Found this comment in TRP 'As always, the more feminist a woman is or claims to be, the more rough and dominated she'll be in the bedroom.
Her body is fighting her mind so to make up for her mind's masculinity, her body needs to be ultra submissive.
Go find yourself a feminist and enjoy the nasty, filthy, no holds barred fuckfest that comes your way. Then never speak to her again.' Also does T_D, * wikileaks. Enjoy sports, TV shows, and some Video games.

Same place as above, 'That would definitely be rape if she had stuck to her guns after she "put the brakes on it", but it sounds like she eventually went along with it after some mild resistance. This is really the issue. Feminists want to be able to call that rape under the category of coercion.' Likes TRP, mensrights, menkampf?, PPD, and some weird unrelated circle jerk subs

She was found in RPW victim blaming 'I was just reading a Reddit news article post about a British woman claiming rape because she was gangraped by two British men in a hotel in Dubai) that's all the details regarding the circumstances).
My first thought was "That woman shouldn't have put herself in a situation to be raped." My assumption (of course could be false because there was not any additional information regarding the rape) was that she and the men were most likely out clubbing) with my background knowledge of alcohol only being sold in luxury hotels in Dubai and the extravagant holidays Western expats tend to take there, having been myself) and she might have willingly went into the hotel room with them then activities escalated out of her control, then she claims rape.
So I wanted to ask - what are your RPW thoughts on rape? I am not talking about a "real" rape (violent attacker). I'm talking about situations where feminists claim rape because they were drunk and consent was hazy because of alcohol or other circumstances. Do you ever blame the men? Or do you think the woman put herself in a situation to be easily accessible and manipulated and she should be more cautious in her choice of activities? (where she goes, how much she has the drink, etc).
Please note that this post is not about the specific rape itself but rather general opinions.' mostly stays in TRP related subs, not too much outside there other than female specific subs

'One of the most frustrating things about all this nonsense is the notion that one person is entirely responsible for everything that happens.
This is sheer lunacy.
Every person is 100% responsible for whatever they chose to do. This applies to the rapee as much as it applies to the rapist.
A man who forces himself onto a woman is responsible for his actions. The woman who makes herself vulnerable to being taken advantage of, leads a guy on only to pull away or other such "brilliant" moves is responsible for putting herself in harms way. Just because he's responsible for what I he did, doesn't mean she isn't responsible sible for her role.
Personal responsibility of is an old fashioned value which needs to become popular again.', only 'bad' sub is RPW but also participates in showerthoughts, deadbedrooms, TIL, & jokes. This is a man, oddly enough.

posted this in /r/incels 'Just some examples:
After being raped you can live a good life, most incels can not because they are depressed and suicidal.
Most rape victims had lived good lives before getting raped, most incels did not because usually the same reasons a man becomes incel, are the same reasons a kid gets bullied, like being very short or ugly.
As an incel, there is pretty much no support anywhere and your problems are ridiculed by people who have never been incel, you even face a lot of hate just for being incel, as a rape victim you get support everywhere.
"Treatment" for being incel is $20k+ worth of cosmetic surgery compared to treatment for getting raped which is therapy, a lot less expensive.
I am talking about rape with force too, not the woman drank some alcohol and had sex with a guy type rape, which is rape in most of the West these days.', hangouts it incels, niceguys, justneckbeardthings
