Wildfire_08,nah i have never been that kind of guy to just ignore something i like to challenge people their stupidity i do not put no fatties on my profile because i am not that much of an arsehole and if you would read what i initially said i only bring up the gym fit thing with women that put must be over 6 ft and do not appear to be some gym fit model on their profile purely to see why they filter people by height and if they are a hypocrite when i bring up the gym fit thing which they always are they always take it as an insult yet somehow it seems ok to discard anyone under 6ft like they are a trash ass baseball card or something ,-4,AskReddit
Wildfire_08,funnily enough my roommate is 5 6 but he a real good dude so it pisses me off when i see this kind of injustice haha,2,AskReddit
Wildfire_08,well because imo if she making 6 figures too then she is not a gold digger a gold digger surely implies someone with nothing dating a guy solely for the purpose of benefiting financially a woman that already loaded and got her shit together wanting a partner in the same situation i get it and have no problem with it ,1,AskReddit
Wildfire_08,hahaha ahhhhh just the idea of a white guy painting the colour of his knob and sending a picture is hilarious ,2,AskReddit
Wildfire_08,lol i have had women who say nobody under 6 ft turn around and say to me why you judging me on my weight you should accept me the way i am when i have said not gym fit later not sure how you can sit there try to tell me that nobody says you cannot say no overweight women when i am the one that seen it and i agree being fit is not a gender thing it a state of mind thing ie getting the fuck up off the couch and making changes but i do not know a single man out there that says no women under 5 5 for instance i think it funny how women can get away with filtering guys but when the roles are reversed guys can get called misogynists for not accepting women the way they are haha what a world we live in ,-4,AskReddit
Wildfire_08,well also being overweight usually corresponds with being lazy which who wants to be with that ,1,AskReddit
Wildfire_08,i am 6 4 so the height thing does not bother me anyway it more the cheek of filtering people out like that i think the funniest ones i have seen are chocolate dicks only which i found hilarious clearly she loves her confectionery must earn over 6 figures like da fuqq can you make it anymore obvious that you are a gold digger ,2,AskReddit
Wildfire_08,so it ok for women to say not 6ft bye but when i say not gym fit bye that somehow offensive and i am a misogynist fyi over 6ft i also only say that specifically to the women that say must be over 6ft ,6,AskReddit

Wildfire_08,the whole brienne hound situation did not happen like that in the book you know full well they put that in the show to satisfy radical feminists by having a woman be better than two of the big time warriors in the show jaime and sandor i honestly hope someone does a show soon called equality a dose of reality where they just go around and put professional male athletes against professional female athletes in every single sport every week the result is the same the guy ends up fucking destroying the chick to imply in the show that brienne can take a punch to the face from sandor when he on top of her 60lbs heavier is just pure shit put there to appease the female fans of the show it funny how all the great men in the show are basically dead while all the great women are still living the arya story line does not bother me too much on it own the same with the daenerys storyline because she got dragons and dragon blood so that fair the thing that bothers me with them is more because as a whole there just so many strong female leaders or badass warriors or master tacticians individually some of their stories are interesting but as a collective they have over done it with this shit made got feel like which guy is gonna die this week it just became predictable knowing that the woman would most likely survive while the guy will usually get killed it a big reason why i do not bother watching tv shows anymore because most of them use the same format for success make men dumb as fuck or die or be useless without women make women the most intelligent super badass can never do any wrong profit why cannot they fuck off with the political agendas and just make good shows ,0,AskReddit

Wildfire_08,wow great response where you proceeded to tackle it by ignoring all facts just making up your own bullshit way to go so got there dany who just maybe an alliance with that lesbian pirate woman another female leader there cersei who is now in charge of kings landing the method to power was never debated no idea why you brought that up tbh then you have got brienne of tarth who beat the hound jamie lannister albeit while they were not 100 but hey nothing like a woman beating the proclaimed greatest warriors in a tv show to get insecure women feeling good about themselves who else oh yeah arya stark the typical girl that gets doubted and has to go through some crazy journey so that she can become some badass fighter she will no doubt play an even bigger role in the next series who else sansa stark another woman controlled by men that finally takes a stand and starts to play the game how touching that at least 5 i have rattled off in different stories within the main story of got and there been more throughout the entire show as for transformers let me give you a link to the exact trailer i am talking about along with the backlash it received maybe then you will actually respond with a rationale mind instead of opening your stupid mouth and talking bullshit without reading up on things first https youtu be ytr 3wyuruq t 76 if you can watch that video and claim ignorance to the pc ridiculousness of it then you seriously need to get your eyes checked now on to the conspiracy idea nobody said there was a conspiracy at no point did i state that so i would appreciate it if you did not try to put words in my mouth just because you are annoyed and cannot seem to debate a topic rationally my point was that there are too many tv shows that are trying to empower women now do not get me wrong i want equality true equality and when it comes to media art i do not care if it an all woman cast if it accurate to real life or a script or whatever but if you suddenly make a film about underground street fighters and a woman is beating up men then it just nonsense and not accurate so many forms of media now focus on how they can jump on the bandwagon with a female lead so they can appeal to a female audience while i have no problem with them trying to target a certain audience or even trying to empower a certain audience they just need to dial it down a notch it gone too far the other way and needs to come back a bit i am not insecure i think it funny you will say that about me seen as you know literally nothing about me but i live a happy life i have taken big risks moved countries and helped people in various ways sure my life is not perfect but i am not complaining i have no reason to be insecure so do not push your doubts onto me and seen as i have typed such a thorough response i might as well add this in if you hate radical feminism so much man up quit whining interesting oxymoron you chose to use there so if i do not agree with something i should man up and quit whining so basically i should say nothing at all i would love to see you explain how manning up equates to saying nothing at all you stupid cunt hold that block for extra hilarity https youtu be kjbsz 3bfzk t 860,2,AskReddit

Wildfire_08,a quick example off the top of my head would be got how they put stuff in the tv show that was never in any of the books all in the name of female empowerment got has left me salty about it tbh because what a great show it started out as yet now there like one guy that a badass or leader and the rest are all fuckin powerful women like damn we get it or even funnier go look at the new transformers movie trailer you wanna talk about a movie being corrupted by the feminist extremists that the best example right there do i even need to mention the flop that was the ghostbusters reboot ,-7,AskReddit

Wildfire_08,im not saying hitting the gym is the only way to get a woman but it is undeniable that packing on some muscle helps you appear more attractive to more women i disagree with hitting the gym to get more attractive to women being a bad thing though it only the initial motivation but after a few months you start realising that you feel great in the gym and it helps you develop yourself physically and mentally and yeah do not ever make things clear to a bird that you are into her over text i personally think texts are the cowards way of doing things like breaking up with a chick asking her out etc always do things face to face fyi not insinuating that you are a coward you sound younger so it different but i am just saying texting does not show confidence imo when you can easily do it face to face where it requires the most confidence as for her not talking to a lot of guys do not be naive that all i can really say on that one almost every woman gets offered dick at least twice a day in some way or another just because she says she barely talking to anyone does not mean her phone is not blowing up at night with texts from others again i do not know how old you guys are but i am assuming 16ish so who knows ,1,AskReddit
Wildfire_08,yea it not something i feel upset over just i look at it like damn i wish that did not have to happen i feel worse for him really because he had no interactions with women from the age of 20 38 until just recently he met some girl on xbox online and within a year is getting married to her and to add to that he been depressed for years but nobody around him is clued up enough to recognise it and try get him proper help they all just think he being a hermit ,2,AskReddit
Wildfire_08,it weird because i am 100 a big kid at heart given the chance i will still do childish shit like beat the shit out of my cousin at tekken and then jump up shouting wooooo i win you are rubbish i mean he only 8 but still he gotta learn but when it comes to important shit like paying bills keeping your surroundings clean all that adulting i make sure i am all sorted i think a key indicator of someone that still a boy is insecurity for guys insecurity is different and definitely something you can sort of grow out of with confidence and age all that big ego shit stems from insecurity of a guy that not really a man yet ,2,AskReddit
Wildfire_08, emerge from the friendzone place you know there was your first mistake ending up in there in the first place i do not even think i know how to help you with this tbh i have never worried about friend zone stuff because i do not keep female friends if i am not banging them then i have no reason to be their friend tbh because that what guys are for i would say be careful about trying to impress her though i feel like that a fools quest how often do you speak to her what you should do is start hitting the gym and start flirting with women when she around if she gets the feeling that you are not all about her and that she does not have you in that friend zone pocket like the rest of them she might start taking an interest especially if she thinks you are not into her has she got any hot friends you could flirt with without it causing ridiculous drama you will be surprised how many women want you when you have got another woman already into you ,1,AskReddit
Wildfire_08,my uncle basically when i grew up he was a good role model taught discipline and important things like that even though his own life was mediocre he still set a good example for me but as i got older i also realised he was a bullshitter with more things like tryna act as though he was some sort of hard man when he never was and i could knock the shit out of him easily from the age of 18 at 19 me my mum had this fall out we were not on speaking terms as i would left home 4 years before that he stuck up for her without knowing the story so i told him to grow the fuck up he told his dad my grandad he lucky i do not drive into town and twat him in front of his friends refused to speak to me beyond that he was about 30 at the time i think now 8 years later he still refuses to talk to me or acknowledge my existence he lives with his parents and i would visit them every weekend because my grandparents were the only consistent figures in my childhood whenever i would get there he would just stay upstairs in his bedroom until i would gone he had his own issues though like not being with a woman since some girl hurt him emotionally at 20 he failed to follow one of lifes basic principles when life kicks you in the balls you have got to get back up dust yourself off and make changes it is a shame though sometimes i think about it i miss the guy he was to me when i was in my early teens i did not know my dad until i was 17 i was the oldest of 4 kids so i was setting the example to them but with some things he was the guy that would set an example for me between him my grandad ,2,AskReddit

Wildfire_08,how is that not free you do not pay for tinder nor would you pay for the pizza or pay sexually because you would turn him down am i missing something how is that not free yes it definitely is gender exclusive we are not talking about the exceptions have i been bought drinks before sure but only because i have got an accent and they were feeling generous haha but it not as though i am out here getting free drinks everyday similarly guys are not just on tinder getting free pizzas every night unlike women that are able to score all kinds of free shit off tinder ,2,AskReddit
Wildfire_08,i mean or just use a recent picture for guys and girls i just think it hilarious how a woman can say something like if you are not into thick curvy women then get outta here basically the way they say it is as though they expect a guy to accept her the way she is and if they do not think she attractive then there something wrong with the guy instead of just that she too lazy to get off the couch and then in the same profile they will say something like must be xyz idk i just have a problem with people that are fat essentially lazy trying to demand that others accept them as they are or demand that others are a certain way ,1,AskReddit

Wildfire_08,i always thought proclaiming to be a male feminist was a type of r niceguys way of trying to get laid like there unwritten rules among dudes about getting women and we all know guys that worm their way in male feminism is the equivalent of worming your way in imo to your last point are you saying that guys that do not claim to be anything like me for instance often have the same ideals as true feminists if so i would agree at the end of the day who does not want equality my grandma marched in the feminist marches for womens rights those were proper feminists that actually did good for people ,1,AskReddit
Wildfire_08,i am not saying that all women do not pay for food i am saying most of them if not all of them have that option available the last time i got a free meal was living with my grandparents once you move out as a guy your free meal section of life is temporarily put on hold until you check yourself into a nursing home at 85 to finish off life by shitting yourself from all the free meals you are now taking advantage of ,5,AskReddit

Wildfire_08,not a cheater btw but one of my friends is he actually just got deported recently but besides the point he lives with his girl and still has his side bitches i think he does it to inflate his ego to be honest he the most egotistical insecure dude i have ever met he will say shit to me when we are around other dudes like ay yo whats up with the boxing though i am tryna go spar we should join up you ai not ready for the hands ignoring the fact that he knows i have done muay thai a few years ago and that i am also about 4 taller and a good 30lbs heavier than him he 6ft 180 i am 6 4 210 but ignoring that it like dude we are friends why would i want to spar with a friend especially when i know you will try to head hunt just so you can hopefully get a fluke ko and then brag about it i think his cheating is all revolving around his need to prove something to other guys ,2,AskReddit

Wildfire_08,this might be the easiest question i have answered all day not having to pay for food getting a job because they are fine as fuck regardless of lack of qualifications getting to play the i am a feminist card to berate a man that was actually correct all along getting served at the bar first getting into places without paying cover i refuse to pay cover anyway so i avoid these dumps getting to generally play victim or use the i am a woman card in any situation necessary like being wrong in an argument making it personal getting to have all the benefits of equality with none of the drawbacks being able to insult or assault a man without getting the same treatment a man would get being able to debate rationally about equality without getting labelled negatively for instance women can talk all kinds of shit about men on tv or in person but if a man talks about how the wage gap is largely a myth and taken out of context and provides factual evidence he is labelled a misogynist being able to ruin movies tv shows games all in the name of female empowerment yet they get completely impunity for it as though a terrible movie game cannot be berated just because it seen as bashing women when actually it was just terrible the obvious in your face political agenda ruined it probably some that i missed ,20,AskReddit

Wildfire_08,at no point as i comparing sports entertainment to being a professional athlete in the sense of comparing their decisions in career choices i think my reply may have got lost in translation somewhere there but either way what i was basically saying is that all professional athletes are essentially sports entertainers when you break it down their sole purpose is to compete and entertain fans without those fans there nothing it all one big show at the core anyway the point was you cannot compare those types of jobs to a regular job they are just not equatable and for you to try and compare the two is flat out ridiculous how can you compare the decisions a multi millionaire athlete gets to make with some dude with a regular job real education not a sports education that has to live in the real world with real regular problems you wanted to act like just taking a better job in real life is equatable to kd ditching an entire city when he already a contender to go bandwagon one of the greatest teams ever that already won a chip without him in what world is that even remotely comparable ,1,nba
Wildfire_08,it essentially sports entertainment not a real job you cannot compare a fucking athlete that getting paid millions to throw a ball in a hoop to regular people working regular jobs which required a real education only a fucking dipshit would try to compare the two with some merit like honestly you can continue in your little reductio ad absurdum all you want but i wo not be joining you ,-2,nba

Wildfire_08,lol look at what lebron is to the nba and sport in general and then look at kd lebron is like a modern day ali in some respects for what he represents kd is just a fuckin bum that joined an already all time great team so he can coast to the chip as much as i despise gsw and their fake ass fan base i hope they sweep the cavs so that next year there could be serious pressure to make adjustments to the salary cap taxation to prevent this shit from ever happening again there will be a permanent black mark next to the gsws championship win before you salty ass gsw fans say lebron cavs fan detected nah i do not support any team i am just a fan of competitive sport one team dominating is not fucking competitive ,-4,nba

Wildfire_08,yes they are bullshit to live there clearly there is a fundamental difference between me and you i do not like overcrowded cities every single city you listed is over crowded and bullshit to live there even london was too much for me you do not know where i have lived dude so do not make assumptions as though you already know cities which do not have a crazy high density are just always better fuck if you want some form of stats go look up the greatest cities in the world right now for the last decade you wo not find a single us city in the top 10 places like vancouver toronto auckland melbourne vienna they are all under 6mil population most of them are under 5 mil with the exception of maybe melbourne yet they are consistently in the top 5 of the greatest cities in the world to live in measured across every area it no coincidence once a city has too many people it impossible for the quality of life to remain as high eventually you will get diminishing returns you must be a new yorker judging by your saltiness to the fact that i hate new york city like all new yorkers you get mad about it and just pretend that everything said is pure bullshit when all the evidence every year in every study points towards mid sized cities having the best livability face the fact nyc is not the greatest city in the world and it has not been for decades ,1,AskReddit

Wildfire_08,for shy guys there no better advice than fake it til you make it sounds cliche and simple but it actually the best advice out there because it all you can do go out there fake being confident talk about something which gives you confidence do it enough times you will just become naturally confident from the inside faking it does not mean walking around chest puffed out like a wanker either btw just be a dude that appears to have his shit together has goals is not afraid to take risks and is just generally fun interesting to talk to ,4,AskReddit
Wildfire_08,this is something i wonder why would a women think it ok to just flat out ignore you it has not happened to me just because i have got the benefit of having an accent in a different place so if i do talk about some shit it makes it seem as though i am more interesting than i actually am i just talk a lot generally anyway but do not tend to specifically approach someone on their own anyway my point is lets say a guy strikes up conversation with another dude whether it in a cafe at a park on transport whatever no dude would flat out ignore him i do not mean he tryna flirt with him i just mean general chat 100 of dudes will at the very least reciprocate with a yea even the most basic thing i have never seen a woman flat out ignore a dude that made a reasonable approach but i have got to wonder what goes through someones mind that lacks that basic human interaction ability to respond with at least one word what would be your response to that i do not think i would be able to just get up and walk away i think i would call up a friend and see what he upto just as an excuse to say that i am sat next to some miserable cunt on a bench or whatever in the hopes of making her feel bad for being that ignorant shitty i guess but there no way i could let someone just get away with feeling superior like that i would have to fuckin shred their ego bring em down dudes do not do it because they know there a risk of getting punched more than likely however slim that might be there a lot of things dudes wo not do for that reason edit it comes across as though i do not have problems going up to women or something i do not want it to be perceived that way i do not have an issue talking to anyone but i find that when i am out on my own somewhere i am either sat at the bar talking to whoevers around me or sat with my ipod in daydreaming about life ,2,AskReddit
Wildfire_08,it too out there as an idea for me do not get me wrong i do not think they are bad people or anything i am just not going to waste my life on bullshit ideas the same reason i am not religious lifes short enough as it is why would i want to piss about wasting my time in multiple relationships when nobody is going to keep them all forever eventually it will catch up you will go to one because one takes enough energy as it is i do not think it coincidence that every single poly person i have spoken to has had failed relationships most recently that fucked them up made them go poly and in that case i think the process would be mental fortitude failed friends support network failed therapy failed poly that what it seems to be a temporary by that i mean it could be years but ultimately temporary fix while they regain the strength in themselves to be able to commit to one person again ,0,AskReddit

Wildfire_08,i am the wrong person to ask because that something i cannot answer as i have not done the relationship thing only lots and lots of fun and fwb type single stuff i just do not see how it would work long term though poly to me seems like a short term thing where they are basically trialing partners and will eventually pick one to be with forever and have kids with otherwise what happens when you have kids the poor kids have 5 stepdads life is hard enough as it is why complicate it ,-3,AskReddit
Wildfire_08,polyamory is the one where they have multiple relationships right i do not care what someone says they are just do not involve me if they are poly them i am noping the fuck out immediately because it tells me they had some fucked up shit happen with an ex they are still not over it maybe they got treated poorly by exs in the past whatever it is it just feels like another attention seeking thing where yet again people would rather join some cultish term that they think defines them instead of just being brave and seeking proper help figuring out what is wrong maybe there normal people out there that are poly but every single one i have met has been in bad relationships in the past with 1 person so they think the answer is to have multiple relationships like backups or some shit my question to people that are poly is why the fuck are you in a relationship in the first place why not just be single date multiple people and nobody will brand you anything like me i know i am not ready to commit to a woman because i have my own trust issues with women that stem from child abuse from a mother that i have got to fully resolve so what do i do i stay single and i fuck around have fun with women instead but i let them know up front i am not looking for anything serious right now i do not get into a relationship anyway then when it inevitably goes tits up starting blaming everyone else or anything i just hit myself with reality recognise my flaws and roll with it if people that are poly become that because of bad relationships only my experience from what i have seen maybe they are not all like that then why continue to get in relationships idk i am a firm believer in figuring out yourself before attempting life on hard mode committing to someone else ,6,AskReddit

Wildfire_08,it not like that at all maybe if shaving had the potential to harm your skin in the long run it would be but as far as i know it does not the point is why use something which temporarily turns you from a frog into a princess when at least if you ditched 90 of the effort time on that and put it into eating healthily and working out your health would go way up your skin would look more than likely more natural and better you would not be hiding anything ,1,AskReddit
Wildfire_08,while the question was not really serious obviously i do wonder why people do not put more time into things which are guaranteed to make a viable difference to your health skins health and everything else over a longer time instead of say make up which only temporarily hides how unhealthy or f ckin ugly they might be why not at least try for longer term real health gains imo ,2,AskReddit

Wildfire_08,i know it should not be that way imagine if they made a film about horizon zero dawn a superb story with a female lead which would be absolutely brilliant as a film but if i did not know anything about hzd there no way i would watch a film version of it just because they would feminazi the shit out of the film ruin it probably ,0,AskReddit
Wildfire_08,i cannot think of movies that represent it well however i can think of a few video games games like tomb raider or horizon zero dawn for example have female lead roles their absolutely excellent games with great writing real depth to the characters when i play those games at no point do i think this sucks playing as a fuckin woman the whole time i am just invested in the story maybe her character development etc etc but you know what makes those different they are not some super women that are invincible badass that can beat up 20 men make all men look dumb or anything outrageously over the top empowering they are relatively realistic in the sense that your character can make mistakes is vulnerable if you make the wrong choices and decide to go in guns blazing it forces you to think more and make the right decisions for your character i cannot think of a single movie i am not a movie buff tbh that got me invested in a female lead role and actually developed the character in a realistic way or showed a woman as being like everyone else vulnerable to mistakes misjudgements whatever it might be every movie tv show follows the same formula now make woman powerful profit game of thrones pissed me off the most with this because i binged watched the series without ever knowing anything about it this was recently like a month ago i watched all 6 series and i always knew for the most part who was going to die who would become powerful badass they just make the series predictable by empowering every woman in the show you have like 6 or 7 female characters that are running the shit and then about 2 guys as for the whole dialogue thing i do not care what the dialogue is or who it in favour of as long as it accurate to the story if i am watching a film about bare knuckle boxing champions what i do not want to see is some woman that the champion fighting other men or talking about how hard it was for her i want to see toothless fucks knocking the shit out of each other that film would be dominated by men because bare knuckle boxing is dominated by men and always has been i know that a bit of an outlandish example but you get my point certain stories lend themselves to certain genders i have no problem with that so long as there a mix of stuff for everyone i would rather have 20 films a year with 7 being male cast dominated 7 being female cast dominated 6 being a mix rather than 20 films that are all 50 50 but inaccurate to the story if that makes sense i think i got lost somewhere in there because i got interrupted lol ,3,AskReddit

Wildfire_08,sure they should be represented i agree it important to push these issues but i do not know if films are the way to do it because you essentially end up trying to brainwash ideas into people i do not know what the answer is because you cannot make everyone educate themselves maybe long term it a more thorough education on social issues in schools but what it is not is destroying media films games and everything else by taking these issues to the extreme making it seem as though men are just inadequate dumb arses while all women are all knowing super powerful can do everything it fucking ridiculous not what equality is all about why cannot there be more films that show true equality but also show how there are certain inherent differences between men and women or races it so bad now with every film being an empowerment to the extreme that i just want someone to make a film where they get a dude that a fighter war veteran and he just goes around and hands out doses of realism to sjws an easy example being women saying they are as strong as men and can do physically demanding shit go get an average woman and an average man and put them in physical trials the fucked up thing is in the ridiculous world we live in you cannot even discuss these things without being labeled a misogynist or racist or some other slanderous shit i am all for equality but i do not think todays feminists understand what equality even is it sure as hell not trying to convince me that women are greater than men at everything they do and that all us men are just fuckin dumb cunts that cannot function on our own sorry i lost track of how long that reply was lol ,1,AskReddit

Wildfire_08,haha yea say see ya later because there literally fuck all left that you can say you have been rebutted in every way possible exposed as being ignorant as hell no it started out as an innocent story you made assumptions to which i responded with more detail who goes to a club stays sober see what i mean you put an assumption on someone that i know by saying your friend was a dickhead harassing a random woman then you expect people to just take that as the truth even though it was my friend i know what happened what is the matter with you honestly i told you what happened with him you act like he just walked up to some woman in the street in the middle of the day did this shit which he did not but even if that was the case let imagine for a second that a guy goes upto a woman and says some shit like that in the middle of the day that does not make him a bad person it makes him an idiot i will give you that but a bad person no you cannot judge someones morality on one single act especially something so minute i am not upset i think it funny how every response you say the same shit in every response hoping to sway me from a logical response here your formula for every response it the same for every woman that does not know how to answer when they are losing a debate if they are not a mature adult make assumptions that favour her argument accuse the other person of being emotional somehow x generic exaggerated story traveled lots been to shitty resorts gained zero perspective generic exit strategy to feel like she leaving on a high you have never met a man like me because everyone is different sure i am stubborn this really is just a debate on reddit but if you think i am just going to roll over let you place your negative assumptions on someone that i know label him a bad person you are wrong do not you understand that by being so quick to pull the trigger label someone you are part of the problem i suggest you go read up on slander and get a good idea for how damaging it can be before you end up labeling some dude in real life fucking his shit up let see if you can write a proper grown up response maybe even admit to your faults walk away like an adult or whether you will respond with the same tired formula that has not served you well so far ,0,AskReddit
Wildfire_08,i do not generally have to go to the doctors that much because i am still young and healthy so i have got about another 20 years before it all hits shit creek but one thing i always assume would piss doctors off i do it anyway but i try to do it in a non intrusive sort of way is self diagnose well i just give symptoms then try help with narrowing down possibilities to save time but i try to avoid doing it in a way which comes across as google phd or i know better than you or any of that an example i had a cold or whatever but i also had a scratch on the crown of my head and had the occipital lymph nodes swell up so i told her i figured maybe the scratch had become infected on some drunken night out because the occipital nodes had swelled and no others she took a look that what it was she would have found it anyway no doubt but why not get to the point immediately right my grandparents were in the nursing first aid field so some medical knowledge has been passed on but not much anyway i am sure they get pissed off with it or maybe it only bad when it the hypochondriacs doing it ,4,AskReddit
Wildfire_08,lol ok i will give a proper response to this here we go with the thicker skin shit as though you know who i am or what get to me i have been through more shit in the first two decades of my life than the majority go through in their entire life so if you think your misguided little words could ever be a factor to me you are sadly mistaken just because i stick up for someone who wrongly accused of being a bad person does not somehow translate to me not being thick skinned for a start i am a brit how many brits have you met that were thin skinned really not many because we grow up with constant shit talking or in your case talking shit the only difference being that i had the sense to leave that shithole years ago see the wider world and gain said perspective while you the miserable little cunt that you are stayed in that pig sty rolling around in shit taking out your frustrations at everyone online to try shield yourself from the fact that you live a pathetic little life full of absolute bitterness you give off the vibe of a woman that would call themselves a feminist without doing a single thing for women that thinks feminism bashing men does not equality you are flat out a dumb arse the short of it is this because a guy cat called a woman you automatically label him as a bad person it ridiculous it like saying someone that does drugs is automatically a bad person or that a guy who punches another guy once is automatically a bad person it total horseshit the only reason you reacted so strongly is because it was a fuckin woman being harassed omg that poor girl you never once thought about the context of the situation that they were all super drunk and talking shit back n forth hence why it was funny you just went from 0 bad person in 0 01 second you are the type of person that makes the world we live in a shit hole the ultra sensitive pc scum that makes every single thing a minefield to navigate you cannot do shit these days without someone like you that never take a risk in your miserable life calling someone a bad person trying to bring everyone else down grow up you are a fuckin disgrace ,1,AskReddit
Wildfire_08,lol so a guy cat calling a woman when he was in his 20s is forever a bad person even though throughout his 30s he grew up and does more work for people who are legitimately in need than everyone i know combined you have a fucked up view of the world but then again you are a brit so it really does not surprise me get some fucking perspective i guarantee if a woman was cat calling a guy in the street you would not fucking call her a bad person no it would probably be funny to you get some perspective you miserable fuck ,2,AskReddit
Wildfire_08,smh you are really going to compare jimmy saville a fucking pedophile to a guy that does not know how to deal with rejection properly is a product of his new york hood environment so he occasionally calls someone a big bird bitch by occasionally i mean i have only seen the guy say it once it was when he was younger and a bit more wild are you fuckin serious get a grip of yourself girl if you are salty because your initial judgement of the guy was off then that your fault everything i have said is true it like i said i did not say he was a stand up guy but i cannot just label him a bad guy either because he does more for people in need than you or i have ever done have a good un no do not run away now stay and defend the horseshit that came out of your mouth ,0,AskReddit
Wildfire_08,i do not know how this feels myself but i do know my dad is in this situation he basically just proposed to her they have been together for 10 years but he has had a few chances to get away did not have the balls to do it i have told him numerous times to be a fuckin man cut the rope and be done with it but he could not even though he knew he did not love her the same way he hated the country he in and the lack of opportunity he cheated on her a shit load of times she does not know obviously but the guys a musician and before he a had a stroke was just killin it now hes gonna get married just so he can be more secure in that country knowing full well that he does not love her knowing that she thinks everything is great and that it all mutual idk i do not judge the guy he makes his own decisions but i know he is not happy that the part that pisses me off ,1,AskReddit
Wildfire_08,well i think the situation happened in a club not just randomly on the street but it definitely a grey area because the guy actually does quite a lot of work for homeless people orphanages but clearly you know him better than i do til that no matter what you contribute in life if you say anything sexual to a woman when she does not appreciate it you are a bad person ,-2,AskReddit

Wildfire_08,a couple of things when they do that childish voice act when they want something as though it supposed to make me think awww so cute ok here you go when really i am thinking grow up for fuck sake you are 27 not 7 telling me how many or what level of dude wants to fuck you right now example oh yeah i have got this guy that a basketball player with a wife keeps tryna get me idk if she thinks it attractive or if she tryna make me jealous or think she something special either way it a turn off saying that you are strong independent let me be clear i love women that are actually strong independent women that can look after themselves and have goals in life nothing is more attractive however it the women that do a few squats per month say gym fit strong goal orientated etc etc when actually they are just fuckin bums that whore for attention on ig or something being strong independent is attractive at least to me saying you are when you are not or bragging about it when you are is not attractive if that makes sense just a few positive things so it does not seem like i am a woman bashing misogynist intelligence women that can hold a conversation have a sense of humour are fuckin hot biting the bottom lip i do not care how cliche it is it fuckin sexy being able to hold eye contact also something which will light a fire in any man ,1,AskReddit

Wildfire_08,done nothing wrong you called me a racist before i even actually insulted you lol why do not you go ahead and tell me you are a teenager or early 20s and do not get out much so we can move on already because like i said nobody that actually a normal adult with normal relationships is saying triggered it a silly little fad word that american kids use or like always british kids that want to be as cool as americans like when they say yo wassup man and other shit that just deductive logic but take it easy ,1,AskReddit
Wildfire_08,the fact that you just said the word triggered let me know you are either a teenager or an early twenties virgin as for swearing i am a brit it in the nature does not mean i am mad or triggered or anything it just a way of talking getting the point across seen as you did not want to listen the first two times and proceeded to call me a racist but that what happens with race baiters they slander people before they actually think about what they are saying the problem with slander is the damage is often already done and irreparable hence the need to quickly effectively shut it down immediately also i am pretty sure i said find your balls not get more balls i would never wish more balls on a man ,1,AskReddit

Wildfire_08,best thing i ever saw from a pet was when i used to live with my grandparents they had two whippets one male one female my grandad used to buy little teddy bears and stuff from the charity shop because it made him feel like it was contributing also because he would give them to the bitch and she would just curl up in her little dog bed with them carry it round with her like a pup or something the dog was a little attention whore he would run out and bark at cats then if a cat hissed back at him he would leg it back inside yelping only to be found getting his ears rubbed by my grandad haha he used to snatch the teddy bear off the bitch all the time and run out in the back garden with it and rag it around a bit before she caught up to him and took it back she would always win the teddy bear tug of war matches because he would eventually get bored but one day i remember seeing the dog run up with garden with the teddy bear in it mouth obviously fresh from a thievery he ragged it around in his mouth with this big dog smile on his face then sort of looked around dropped it took a big dump right on it then ran off as a spectator it was fuckin hilarious the bitch did not look impressed the dogs name was buck and he looked like the most gormless dog you would ever see ,1,AskReddit

Wildfire_08,yeah but the thing with the gold digger is that as a guy it would be way more difficult and more effort to chase riches even if you knew which bitches had crazy money it not like they are all single looking to make some dude rich plus you would not have the sexual attraction power you would have to rely on good old fashioned game whereas with the sexual attraction power your life would automatically be easier if you knew that women in certain situations were 100 sexually attracted to you you would know you could bang get shit from them like shagging a female interviewer that you know is 100 into you and getting a good job ,2,AskReddit

Wildfire_08,why they have to act entitled try to make me address them as ze or whatever the fuck that new bullshit is i do not care what you are i have got friends that are part of that community but they know better than to try involve me in it in anyway at all just because you choose to identify as something different because mum or dad did not love you when you were younger you did not have the mental fortitude to get on with life unbroken does not mean that it should impact my life that i should have to go out of my way to make you feel accepted or whatever i think i can honestly say that 99 of people when they are honest about it do not give a shit what other people do or think we are all self involved and do not want to know about your choices whether that be identifying as a man when your biology clearly shows you are a woman or believing in 1 of the 100s of bogus gods as far as gays and lesbians go i have got friends that fall in those categories it cool sometimes i even go out with my gay friend to help him pick up because he pretty nervous stuff plus it actually fun to go out get into a place or served before women for once it a surprisingly good place to pick up women too oh wait there is one thing why do gay guys when they come out start talking like graham norton this is not all gay guys btw it just some of them that clearly want attention that actually does annoy me when a gay guy talks like that because 99 of the time he did not talk like that before he came out he talked regular but now he talks like that because the dudes on tv that get attention talk like that as a straight dude forgive me for using this word in this context but that voice is a clear difference between a gay guy a faggot gay dudes that talk normal with their regular voice are just normal dudes that are attracted to different shit they are cool i treat them as i would any other person but those guys that switch the voice instantly lose any respect the moment i meet them not that it means anything but still ,1,AskReddit

Wildfire_08,just wanted to log in thank you for this info information for skyforge on the ps4 version seems to be scarce this really helped to give me a more solid understanding of the general way you should build your character from a pure numbers perspective on a side note is there anywhere that shows information on the best pantheons to join and how to join them for ps4 na servers ideally i want to join one of the top tier pvp leagues as i do with every game but i can never seem to find information on that maybe their forums is the best place to look edit i also remember reading something about prestige might multipliers 4 although i am not sure how accurate that formula is either way what are these multipliers because it stands to reason that if you keep boosting your base might without getting these multipliers that you would have relatively low prestige and high might but once you get these multipliers your prestige would essentially skyrocket and the might would then be appropriate for someone of that prestige level hope that makes sense although it possible i have misinterpreted some parts of how the multipliers work maybe the gear are the multipliers ,2,Skyforge

Wildfire_08,i am 6 4 about 220 right now was a lifeguard for a few years while in university but i have always been in decent shape not like mega ripped or anything just good shape i will always think it down to a lack of mental fortitude to be honest i only think this because i have been through bullshit all my life never once been broken to the point where i become unable to function as a normal healthy human being i have dealt with many deaths seen people die in front of me never had the stable family life had no dad been through the child abuse stuff grown up around every drug imaginable been out on the streets moved country on my own much more but i never let that break me and suddenly give up on living well i think maybe because i grew up with all that stuff from a young age that bad shit as an adult really does not phase me like that as opposed to kids who grow up with regular life face little adversity and then freakout when the bad stuff happens in their 20s maybe i am lucky in that regard i do not regret anything but yeah whenever depression is involved it a hard thing to quantify because i have been in states of depression when younger but i willed myself on and forced myself to man up and get over it to face any fears do what i needed to survive i am also the oldest of 4 kids wanted to set a good example i think there extra motivation for me in doing that tbh i am not saying you are a bad guy or anything but yeah idk it just something i will never understand ,-4,AskReddit

Wildfire_08,i do not literally mean 99 it was just for emphasis really i want everyone to be equal and that how i treat people but i am just honestly sick of those women that think feminism means make women more important than men it a big reason why i stopped watching tv other than the news because every tv show the hero or best character or smartest person is always a woman and the villain or retarded dumbarse is always a man that cannot function without a woman i do not know what you call those women that treat feminism as some sort of right to power they are not real feminists they are just dumb cunts trying to act like they are part of something so they can think they are cool i remember years and years back ali g interviewed a brilliant feminist obviously he was doing it for jokes but she was great she highlighted issues and how they would try to resolve them and what their goals were etc etc and explained that it was about being equal to men she a real feminist not a fake one that thinks being a feminist means you can have equal pay without the extra responsibility or paying for your own shit instead of letting everyone else pay for it ,0,AskReddit
Wildfire_08,who talking about relationships you sound like another butthurt feminist or even worse a male feminist that just wants to jump on the bandwagon of talking shit to anyone that opposes the idea of feminism it such a ridiculous world we live in people talk about free speech but if you make a rational point about something such as a certain feminist idea not being for equality for example you get labelled a misogynist it ridiculous i do not feel inferior i am not worried about being in control i just do not want to be barraged with the constant reminder through media that men are inferior to women somehow or that every woman is a strong independent woman i appreciate the attempt to try and make me look like i am some inferior little man though that the common tool used by someone that is offended when they do not agree with something said about feminism it super grown up ,-2,AskReddit
Wildfire_08,here the real answer because 99 of so called feminists are not actually interested in equality and prefer to shit on men while getting all the attention it a shame because i actively avoid hooking up with going on dates with or being in a relationship with any woman that calls herself a feminist in this day age because they are just not a feminist to them means they get all the power none of the drawbacks it means they get to decide everything without any repercussions should not it be about equality men are getting shit on in all forms of media all the time now and if you are a straight white man forget about it you are the new devil as far as the world is concerned pisses me off because equality is great of course that should be the goal for all of us but 99 of women these days view feminism as a tool to emasculate men globally it only the 1 of women that actually understand what the real goal is edit see what i mean you cannot even discuss feminism in any negative light without people getting salty about it fuckin ridiculous ,-8,AskReddit

Wildfire_08,but what does that have to do with anything i said go look up those new gender pronouns i am sure one of them is ze or something i am talking about those people that want to be identified as that whatever that is expecting someone like me to know to comply like the fuck i can identify myself as a fuckin duck request that everyone calls me donald does not mean they are going to do it so why would i get offended if they did not in this example i would not so why do those people get offended and pissy if i do not call them by the correct gender pronoun when they are transgender has not it got to the point where companys can be sued if they do not use the correct pronoun i mean it ridiculous,1,AskReddit

Wildfire_08,i have a tonne of mates in the lgbt is that right community and i make friends with anyone i am not arsed what their choices are or thing is but to expect me an ordinary straight dude to know what to call people it just too much i only concern myself with shit that affects my immediate life like most people my friends in those communities would never try to get me to call them a certain thing mostly because they know me well enough by now idk people can be what they want but why do i have to get dragged into it lol,1,AskReddit

Wildfire_08,i do not care what freaky shit someone is into whether it be being walked like a dog or saying that you identify as a woman when you clearly have a knob bollocks i just think it f ckin ridiculous when normal people are affected because we have to start calling them or addressing them by some stupid term otherwise they will get offended ,1,AskReddit
Wildfire_08,sam belongs in the library but is still a bumbling little coward a semi lovable character but his girl the wildling is still a stronger person than him jaime was a strong character now has 1 hand and is reduced to an average or worse fighter davos gets ignored by his friend king stannis is constantly put in his place essentially has to endure the manipulation of that red haired cunt tyrion a dwarf if strong male characters have to also be dwarfs then fml how many strong male characters are the typical straight warrior that does not have some sort of weird affliction i can only think of one maybe two being jon stannis like all tv shows now they focus too much on the empowerment of minorities or what would be the appropriate word for focusing on gay females minority race is there a collective word for that anyway to the detriment of the show it gets to the point where you already know the outcome of a storyline or situation because they are basically going to follow the principle of make all women gay lesbians minorities awesome make all men especially straight white men die shitty deaths or be retarded as fuck there nothing wrong with equality after all that the worlds goal i would hope but there is something wrong with empowering groups of people to the detriment of others it a big part of why i do not watch tv shows anymore i do not want all the badass characters to be male of course but it just feels as though every storyline in got has some woman smarter or stronger than the equivalent guy ,-4,gameofthrones

Wildfire_08,has it really been that long ,10,AskReddit
Wildfire_08,yeah there really no game i played which conveyed the emotion of characters so well it was probably the best game of the last decade for me there other amazing games i have played like skyrim dragons dogma dragonage inquisition gta tomb raider and so on but w3 was incredible and the last dlc really felt like a heart felt goodbye from the series by the devs ,2,AskReddit
Wildfire_08,maybe it a contingency plan if the game is super long and she needs to be entertained ,0,funny
Wildfire_08,witcher 3 had a superb story felt like i was playing a movie skyrim also had a great story if we are talking franchises eso takes the cake just for the sheer amount of lore i mean it honestly incredible i think witcher 3 is the top for me though purely because when i played it the dlcs it felt like i was playing a movie it brought the full range of emotion out for sure that moment when geralt opens the door to find what appears to be a dead ciri edge of the seat stuff ,7,AskReddit
Wildfire_08,any pc related comments like saying anything involving race or sexual orientation or gender etc does not matter if you make legitimate points if they are not bigoted in anyway there always that person around that brainwashed into thinking you cannot even discuss those topics that the correct reaction is to go full blown and call you a racist or something oh and most people overreact when it comes to any weird health problem like a lump or something on them that they do not understand although it a good thing to overreact about but still assuming that a pimple is a cancer lump is a bit much ,6,AskReddit
Wildfire_08,who cares honestly pisses me off that people cannot just enjoy their life strive to do the things they want to do instead of constantly trying to shit on each others race treat people differently because of it and so on personally i just try to have a good life impact others in some positive way and then who cares what silly negative words someone says to you or if they look at you in a funny way ,5,AskReddit

Wildfire_08,makes sense ,2,AskReddit
Wildfire_08,i call bullshit on this largely because i just cannot believe any kid would be sad enough to actually prepare to teach other kids in his class no kid would listen to that class he would literally be in a rubbish bin taped up straight after unless this is some ponce rich kid school in which case who knows it might well be possible could also be america which would make a lot of sense ,1,AskReddit
Wildfire_08,i remember an english class being taught by this temp teacher that basically looked like scruffy hobo like jesus proceeded to read some erotic novel to a class of 13 year olds needless to say he was fired that day haha ,103,AskReddit
Wildfire_08,do not feel sorry for me i do not need it lol i lead a good life and have taken big risks and live in places i never thought i would live the issue in my original comment was nothing to do with spending christmas with family or friends it was why does it appear that he mid twenties living at home so excited about getting a games console from his parents but no big deal i can see i am getting downvoted by guys that i suspect are of the same age also living at home playing video games imagine that ,1,funny
Wildfire_08,seen as i live in a different country with parents i have no contact with i would have to say nope but it does seem odd that he looks like a fully grown man getting a little too excited about opening up a games console i also do not think the parents would get him a games console if he only visiting i think they would be more included to buy him useful stuff for where he lives i think the fact they got him a ps4 kind of implies that he still lives at home besides is not he also wearing pjs who takes pjs with them if they go home for christmas ,0,funny

Wildfire_08,soooo many that are used by kids today i swear they will say any dumb shit thing to try make it become the next fad i hate the word bae it honestly such a little hood rat term so it even more ridiculous when used by some rich kid or a grown up the worst of all i identify as a male feminist it seems to have become one of those terms that gutless none testicle having men can use to try and worm their way into some feminist pussy or just join in the man bashing showing that they are clearly playing for the wrong team ,2,AskReddit
Wildfire_08,definitely no one size fits all answer to this but apart from the obvious that anyone who works out is usually a more attractive human being for it physique wise but mainly it shows that you can commit to something even when it gets difficult still stick with it same as anything just like learning guitar and getting really good anything that shows dedication commitment on a psychological level probably increases your attractiveness to women there probably a term for it somewhere ,2,AskReddit
Wildfire_08,you could but it would be more effective to rip them hard for using the wrong word ,1,AskReddit
Wildfire_08,i guess i will just take the obvious answer and say men seen as professional racing leagues around the world are dominated by men wrc f1 dtm motogp fuck even the most important form of motorsport of all dodgems ,1,AskReddit

Wildfire_08,i counted 12 i think will edit with details 1 maverick ok dude 2 limerick your assonance that definitely a dude tryna rim your dirtbox 3 polyamorous 4 but picky obviously not 5 join me or watch me too cocky and for with apparent reason to be 6 sexual assault survivor of 15 years definitely damaged makes sense given other points 7 being open is part of the healing process it been 15 years already so clearly he she it will never heal 8 fitfam but addicted to tacos makes sense 9 wild soul given other points that most likely means crazy psycho 10 gaming addict no real life success makes me doubt that the job education is even true more evidence that it a guy 11 mum of 2 call bullshit but a weird thing to lie about 12 not a party girl bullshit on both counts it most likely a troll profile maybe a gay dude trolling on purpose maybe someone hoping for attention on reddit but i hope it legit if it is it gotta be a tranny ,1,Tinder
Wildfire_08,hahaha,1,Tinder
Wildfire_08,haha the old dirty arse strategy brilliant ,1,funny
Wildfire_08,it definitely a gay guy that girl in the photos will never be able to meet when you are supposed to meet up haha it would be the dude there saying oh she said she was busy also on a side note is it just me that wishes there was an option to select gay straight on tinder i am sick of seeing trannies pop up in the app,1,Tinder
Wildfire_08,you definitely should have tried to match with her because if she was inactive then there would never be a match and if she was active she would eventually see you either swipe left potentially be awkward around you or mention it or swipe right and then that would be your answer i would definitely bring up tinder conversation when you are around her see how she responds with her expressions and stuff if there any sort of worry or guilt in her face haha,1,Tinder
Wildfire_08,i was gonna say 100 setup but on good faith i will say 99 either way if you do meet up with them take a switchblade or something with you just in case i would say there a high chance it two dudes tryna setup to rob you dump any cash before going only take one card so if it gets taken you can call the bank cancel it let a friend know where you are going or even better go there like an hour early and scope the place out maybe take pictures of the place and see if you bait them out of the apartment by saying oh let meet at the starbucks nearby but while you have plain sight of the hotel so you can scope out whether two dudes start walking to starbucks does not look to be any pictures of her face which is sketchy too be careful and keep us updated ,1,Tinder
Wildfire_08,probably because you break rule no 1,1,Tinder

Wildfire_08,i get why dudes do it i just think it idk desperate i guess it different for me because i am a brit living in north america so there the accent thing which opens up opportunities in everyday scenarios to where tinder is not that necessary but i know some lads in the city that get blanked because they are not different or clearly ballin and so they pull out all the stops on tinder the dog thing just reminds me of some old joke about women where the guy goes look at the shiny shiny or something haha,2,Tinder
Wildfire_08,haha the way he runs out is great he definitely felt that shoe before,1,funny

Wildfire_08,when i moved country i lived with grandparents until around 25 and then had enough moved to canada on a work visa moving out is tough enough but when you add moving abroad to that it only magnifies the pressure ,2,AskReddit
Wildfire_08,yup i am honestly so lazy with tinder i just use one picture then rely on the accent and some charm to get my by i suppose it helps that i live in canada and i am a brit the fishing thing is not as bad as the dog pictures imo because i know for a fact that a tonne of guys especially these clowns in toronto takes pictures with their friend parents dog as a one off to increase tinder matches ,1,Tinder
Wildfire_08,which are where exactly in carp monthly take down the fishing picture i am sure you will have much more success ,1,Tinder

Wildfire_08,firewatch i think it was called the ending of it was just so underwhelming i thought hoped the guy was gonna shag that girl on the walkie talkie but she just left also the pc account transfer for console eso giving pc players the ability to basically be gods from the start was never a good idea dcuniverse the cost changes by the dev team this game was so great on console so great but they made some silly changes such as weapon mastery and then the cost was just absurd to stay subscribed and buy replay badges etc i spent about 1 000 pound on that game ,9,AskReddit
