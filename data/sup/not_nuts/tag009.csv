tag009,i recently went to one of the new locations here in massachusetts i like the concept you can actually see and find the titles you are interested in quickly the face forward shelf design is clean and attractive when i discovered that you could use the amazon app to scan each bar coded tag in front of a selection for instant pricing and other information i thought it was great often in other bookstores you have to assume the price printed on the book itself is correct which is not always the case sometimes the price is not printed at all which leaves you wondering or trying to find an employee nearby to scan it for you many times i have forgone purchasing a book because i did not know the price and did not feel like taking the effort to find out purchasing is easy at the amazon store if you have a card linked to your account it automatically gives the discounted prime pricing and your receipt can be sent digitally each book is also sold with an amazon bookmark inserted which is a simple but welcome touch the main drawback to the stores is selection which is extremely limited obviously the offerings are mostly best sellers so in this respect the article is correct overall i think the concept is good perhaps if they are successful they can expand their retail space to include a wider selection if they could offer close to the amount of titles that a b n offers i would choose amazon every time ,0,books

tag009,so much mistrust of science comes from folks who are not only misinformed or ignorant of science but from those who mistrust institutions such as the government corporations and big business as well as other organizations that may or may not be politically motivated as we enter an era of increasing transparency due to technology everything being on record and eventually getting leaked to the public in one form or another it is not hard to see why many folks find these institutions untrustworthy our media is constantly awash with corporate or political scandals that make it difficult for many to trust in institutions of any sort how can we separate good reliable fact based science from this fray of mistrust when trying to communicate with and educate people with low science literacy who are resistant to the facts that they deem untrustworthy or politically biased ,1,science

tag009,well i do not want to argue semantics too much but your definition is the definition of boiling point not boiling my description might not be perfect but i tend to like it better when i have a description of a process i think it is easier to understand for most people when you can visualize what is occurring rather than to give a definition which can be somewhat abstract at the boiling point the v p of the liquid is equal to the v p of the ambient environment that occurs due to an increase in kinetic energy temperature among the molecules in solution perhaps someone else can offer a better descriptive definition ,2,chemistry

tag009,boiling is the physical process by which molecules gain enough energy to transition from the liquid state to the gaseous state generally in order to do so they require some amount of rough surface for the transition to take place this is called a nucleation site where the water molecules in the case of water are able to make the transition and escape the remaining liquid with a rough container and a natural water source which contains impurities there is enough real estate for the process to occur at the stp boiling point of 100 c with purified water in a smooth container the water is able to absorb more heat energy than normal and not begin reacting until the heat is too great or a nucleation site is found ,2,chemistry

tag009,my question is pretty reasonable your hostility toward my reasonable question is a perfect example of what i am talking about people cannot even hold a civil discourse on the subject because as soon as you pose a question gun rights advocates jump down your throat at any mere suggestion of doing anything we cannot even collect data in this country so that people can research whether or not certain measures are or are not effective like it or not the united states has a major problem with gun violence and that problem is not going to magically disappear nor is it going to be solved by screaming at the top of your lungs i do not care i do not care my rights i have no interest in outlawing firearms or making law abiding citizens give up their rights to own them i am interested in facts and education on the subject it is not unreasonable to expect that before a gun is purchased the buyer should need to undergo safety training and licensure it is not unreasonable to expect persons with documented mental disorders that may become violent be restricted from owning firearms on other issues such as gun types magazine capacity amount of ammo etc i do not know or claim to know what the correct answer is but i believe the ability to collect data on these factors should be allowed no other wealthy nation in the world experiences the level of gun violence that we do and turning a blind eye to this fact is a dereliction of responsibility to the citizens of the us ,3,nottheonion

tag009,i totally agree with the sentiment of this post employers tend to ask too much in their requirements usually the ideal candidate also so many businesses these days use staffing agencies and third party headhunting agencies to find employees they hire on a temporary or contract basis in order to get rid of people if they do not work out not have to give raises and avoid paying for benefits all of this creates little incentive for employees to want to go to work for the company and do a good job that being said i have been on the other side the hiring side and i have seen a lot of candidates send in poor resumes or come in for interviews unprepared or under prepared my advice would be if you find a job that you want and think you might be good at but you think you do not have all of the experience they are asking for apply anyway when you go in for an interview if they decide to select you this is the chance for you to show your eagerness and willingness to learn obviously there are gonna be positions that require specific experience you wo not have but for other positions companies might be willing to hire you if they think you are a great candidate that can learn and perform well in the job learn as much as you can about the company position job tasks etc prior to interviewing so you can impress the interviewer with how much you already know take notes and bring them with you come up with several job related questions other than how much am i gonna get paid to ask in the interview to show that you are proactive if you actually do this well and they decide to hire you be the best employee you can be once you go to work learn your job as well as you can and also make yourself valuable by identifying things that might need to be done that are not getting done ie if no one is sweeping the floor and taking the trash out do it these little things will get you noticed and people will regard you as a hard worker someone that gets things done eventually this can lead to promotions or at least good recommendations later on ,1,Showerthoughts

tag009,well first off i am not a medical professional so my advice is anecdotal at best i was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis a short while before doing this yes they do say not to eat lots of fiber raw fruits vegetables nuts etc with any inflammatory bowel disease ibs and ibd share symptoms but are completely different pathologically as i understand it my personal experience is that i generally feel better after eating fruits veg and all that although it does make me more gassy bloated feeling i think the reason for feeling better has to do with the foods providing more nutrients after having terrible symptoms from my condition sharp stomach pain bloody stools a real nightmare i tried this as i read that cabbage may contain some compounds that can help with these symptoms it did genuinely seem to help but i cannot honestly say i believe 100 that it was not a coincidence making the smoothies anyway seemed to be the way to go as i think it was easier to digest i am not sure that avoiding fresh fruit and veg is really great advice from a nutritional standpoint but that what the doctors tell me i think this is more for symptom relief however so at times when someone is asymptomatic or in remission it might be okay deep fried foods seem to be the worst i far as my experience goes so he may want to cut that kind of stuff out if he has not already anyway cabbage is fairly cheap so if you have access to a blender what are friends for i would say it cannot hurt to give it a shot good luck ,20,AskReddit

tag009,pure water at a ph of approximately 7 0 is in a state of what chemists call dynamic equilibrium a very small amount of the water is at all times constantly converting from h2o to h3o or oh upon reacting with itself the net result is a ph which is neutral upon addition of a soluble acidic substance the ph goes down as more h3o can now be formed lower ph indicates the presence of greater amounts of hydronium ion h3o if a basic substance is added to the solution in other words the amount of oh concentration is increased the solution can be brought back to neutral or even higher ph because working with the number of molecules involves very large and inconvenient numbers the ph system was developed to make it easier to work with ph is just a shorthand notation which mathematically translates to the negative base ten logarithm of the concentration in moles per liter of hydronium ion h3o present in an aqueous solution using 7 0 as the neutral marker for the ph scale is a natural conclusion for the system where the benchmarks are concentrated 1 molar hydrochloric acid as the zero ph marker pure water as neutral at 7 and concentrated sodium hydroxide 1 molar at 14 logarithmic scales such as this are often used in science to simplify a number scale where the actual numbers are cumbersome to deal with ,2,explainlikeimfive

tag009,it looks to me like they just ran the same sample twice getting slightly dissimilar but pretty close results the alkalinity is quite high which may be indicative of some sort of detergent or something did you witness them actually taking the sample from your faucet it may be that whatever contaminant was present had cleared by the time they sampled it in any event there is no organics testing here so nothing to indicate whether an oil or similar substance was present as others have stated the testing slate they ran is not adequate to determine presence of organics if at all possible i would try to have the water tested independently ask for a qualitative analysis including organic substances to determine what is present other than water and common harmless minerals ,7,chemistry

tag009,i would argue that proven is a strong word here yes this study from oxford university did find that the majority of participants that practiced a vegetarian diet were less likely to suffer from heart disease and related events but the study also focused on people that were vegetarians to begin with and people that led active lifestyles so this was not a general population study which is one negative thing i found about it i have no quarrel with the idea that people who are incorporating higher amounts of fruits and vegetables into their diets are probably less prone to heart disease this fact seems evident still i am not convinced that in general people who eat moderate amounts of meat products are in fact less healthy all other lifestyle factors beings the same there is also the problem of vegetarian vegan diet providing adequate amounts of macro and micronutrients how many people on a vegan diet are able to maintain proper levels of all necessary vitamins and minerals without resorting to supplementation i think supplementation is something that should be reserved for people with disorders such as anemia and do not believe anybody whether they are vegan non vegan etc should be reliant on supplementation as a primary source of nutrients i think there are many synergistic effects that are poorly understood even by the medical community that we will see come to light as knowledge advances although this is only my opinion it seems evident that whole food sources are preferential to supplements if they can be avoided as for knowing whether or not if everyone will change i think it is fairly clear that at least in the short term without some sort of forced government mandate being imposed globally it would be extremely difficult to get everyone to change their diet meat as food is something that people do not only practice because they really like it or they have to because it is what they have available it is actually a deeply rooted part of many cultures and removing a part of peoples cultural heritage is quite a task this is why i believe it is important for the vegan as well as non vegan communities to come together in order to progressively work toward a more equitable system i have seen some of the videos you mentioned animals being inhumanely slaughtered chickens and other animals being kept in inadequate cages being kicked tortured etc etc yes i agree that this is unacceptable and awareness should be raised about these immoral and unlawful practices animal farms producers slaughterhouses all of these places should be held to a high level of scrutiny and should be heavily fined or even shutdown if they are found to be negligent in their practices if we can get the meat consuming population on board with these goals i think that we stand a much better chance of creating change generally speaking people find reasons to consider vegans and others calling for a complete shutdown to these institutions a fringe element that is to be ignored people think peta is a joke and that all of these animal advocates are tree hugging idiots that should shut up i am not saying this to be insulting but these are things that i have actually heard myself ever been called a petard i have whoever it was that said people do not care was correct there are in fact a lot of ignorant folks out there that do not care and do not give a shit about animals or how they are treated but i have to believe that there are many more people that actually do care and do give a shit about where their food is coming from and how those animals are being treated this is why i am interested in meaningful debate and conversation because i think there is enough middle ground for people from different sides of the issue to come together on in order to create real progress and make the world a better if not perfect place for everyone cows pigs chickens included ,1,IAmA

tag009,my argument and i know you will be angry and totally disagree with this is that there is no real convincing evidence that eating moderate quantities of meat is unhealthy all the sources of evidence that i have ever seen which state that meat eating in normal amounts is unhealthy are of highly questionable validity they are often times anecdotal or studies done by people with a highly suspicious background conducted in an unscientific manner i do not claim to be an expert in nutrition but i have just never seen anything that does not present red flags i understand the moral aspect of not wanting to kill animals and i sympathize with it i believe livestock that is raised for food and other purposes should be treated as humanely as possible that being said i do not believe trying to make everyone switch to non animal products in a short amount of time will ever have a chance of working the system needs improvement for sure but i believe a gradual process that begins with people starting to incorporate more plant foods in general is the only way that humanity will have a realistic chance of beginning to reduce the amount of animal products it uses ,1,IAmA
tag009,this is kind of general but i think it applies find out what the position you are applying for really requires or what the company does and try to highlight any experience that plays to those things for example if the position is analytical highlight any instrumentation experience you may have even if it is not that in depth typically hiring managers have many resumes to sift through so they look for buzzwords that show you have at least some knowledge of what they specifically do you could even take out sections that are really not applicable to the job you are applying for to give more real estate on your resume to the things that do people always say do not make your resume more than one page but i have never tossed a resume for being more than one typically one or two pages is fine but i would not make it any longer than that also there is a lot to be said for the format of your resume having a good format that is easy to read and looks clean and well thought out is key i have seen phd level candidates with really poor resumes that do not even get considered because it is obvious they did not put much time or thought into creating a good resume on the other hand i have seen people with no experience and maybe an associate level education be called in for an interview because they had a great resume little things go a long way ,2,chemistry

tag009,this is kind of obvious but perhaps not so obvious to many martial arts are almost always depicted poorly in movies and television the obvious part is that of course things are completely overblown in most martial arts or action movies of course people that have just been smashed in the face seventeen times with a lead pipe probably would not be able to keep fighting what is less obvious is the way they get specific martial arts wrong all the time or how different martial arts are used in place of the ones suggested in the film or show a specific example of this that many here may be familiar with is from the walking dead not a movie i know but still relevant when morgan gives in to eastman and agrees to accept his training and philosophy eastman explains that his life was transformed by aikido which he had become involved with after seeing a flyer morgan begins reading the art of peace and training with eastman in the show this is all well and good until they actually show the two men training now i am no aikido expert but i have trained in the art a bit and i can tell you confidently that nothing the actors were shown doing is related to aikido aikido practitioners practice a staff art called aiki jo the staff work that is depicted in the show looks more like poorly performed okinawan style kobudo which is completely unrelated to aikido if the show wanted to portray things authentically a simple google search will easily reveal videos and basic information that the show could have used to get things right or at least more so than they did perhaps they even knew this and figured that most people would not know enough to notice that may be true but for anyone with a little bit of knowledge in this area it is actually pretty glaring ,1,AskReddit

tag009,the blu rays are expensive because of two reasons first they continue to be popular as recent years have brought a resurgence of people who are either rewatching the show or many who are watching it for the first time sencond and probably more important as many people probably choose to stream the epsiodes is the production costs of releasing the series on blu ray for the remastering for blu ray all of the special effects had to be redone digitally as during the original production the special effects were all done in a format that did not transfer readily to the digital high definition format about the best explanation i can give google that shit this was behind the reason the original series was actually released on blu ray well before tng because it was actually shot in the correct digital format i have not bought them myself yet hoping the price drops within a few years or so but i will eventually as a fan it is one of the few things i would like to actually have i did spring for the tng movie blu ray boxed set which was a solid purchase ,1,TNG

tag009,season 1 2 have some rough episodes but it generally does a lot of character building and hashes out the roles the cast will eventually realize if you miss these two you will miss some origin stories that come about later such as the traveler story arc maybe not too important if you hate wesley the captain background with the crew members the tasha yar backstory and more while you avoid the awkwardness of season one and the weirdness of season two with dr polaski replacing dr crusher for one season i think if you are gonna watch the series just suck it up and watch the whole damn thing it may be somewhat difficult at first but is more rewarding in the end as you see the characters go from totally unknown entities to some of the most iconic and important characters developed in our generation no pun intended just kinda the way it came out wesley does not bite it but will wheaton leaves the series about a third of the way or so through season 4 he returns for a few episodes later though his story arc ends up kind of weird but there are plenty of other great episodes to drown it out the greatest wesley crusher episode imho is the last before he leaves the series final mission in season four this episode is one of the series best due to the great performance from patrick stewart who is pretty much masterful at this point do yourself a favor and watch the whole series ,1,TNG

tag009,this is an extremely complicated subject as generally speaking the history of the ninja is something that has been obfuscated to a great extent throughout history the popular image of the ninja that most people recognize today of a super human that runs around doing backflips and always dressed in black with a mask and straight bladed sword is basically a cartoon fantasy version of the ninja that really has nothing to do with real historical people or the real ninja at all this image was basically created out of ignorance even among the japanese of who or what the ninja actually were one account for instance states that the traditional ninja uniform was actually something worn by stagehands during n dramas plays so that they would just appear neutral to the audience the fanciful characters we recognize now were created as compelling personas for manga and anime and later the same sorts of characters were adapted to a lot of bad martial arts films produced in the us and elsewhere mostly during the 1980 during the 80 there was what is known as the ninja boom when the image of the ninja became very popular and loads of people began training in martial arts to try and get a taste of what it was like to engage in the practices of the ninja unfortunately during this time all manner of charlatans came out of the woodwork trying to jump on the bandwagon in order to capitalize on the popularity of ninjutsu this phenomena still persists today and there are a lot of gullible people that have wasted a lot of time and money seeking out the guidance of these folks who really have nothing to offer there are some practitioners out there who are legitimate but they are few and far between i do not wish to get into a debate about who out there may or may not be legitimate as this is a topic that has been hotly debated over the years and i do not really want to get into a pissing match about that here a lot of people have varying opinions on the subject and i merely wish to mention this fact as a word of caution to anyone who is seriously interested in getting into researching this topic that being said the history of the ninja is something that takes a lot of time and diligence as many sources including otherwise well written history books get things wrong or present things in a misleading way i would recommend reading some good texts on japanese history to try and familiarize yourself with the major events political and military history of japan in order to gain a good understanding of japanese history and culture having a decent understanding of these things will help prepare you for understanding the japanese mentality and perhaps help understand why and how the ninja and their practices came into being one thing i will say is that many people have this misguided idea probably from reading some of the more poorly written books that the ninja and samurai were these two separate entities that were sworn enemies that always fought against one another this of course is an immature viewpoint where people have romanticized reality for the sake of creating compelling archetypes like most history things were a lot more subtle and complicated in reality many people who can be said to have been ninja or practiced the ninja arts were in fact samurai themselves the whole thought that samurai were held to the code of bushido and would never use the dirty tactics of the ninja is greatly overstated and probably mostly a lot of bs anyway i do not consider myself an expert on the subject by any means but have read into it significantly over the years so i just wanted to take this opportunity to add my thoughts it takes a lot of time trying to ferret out some semblance of reality and there is so much misinformation out there it is important for any would be researcher of the subject to understand this and be prepared to revise your viewpoint on the subject continually the only source i will recommend here is this http www amazon com gp product 0804839271 keywords kacem 20zoughari qid 1444879064 ref sr 1 1 s instant video sr 8 1 this is probably one of the best if not the best texts written in english on the subject as the author is not only a practitioner but also a scholar of japanese history while not entirely comprehensive it seeks to give the reader a clearer view of what the ninja were all about i am sure i will get chided by some for recommending that but i have yet to come across any book on the subject that is as comprehensive while remaining completely unbiased good luck with your research and i hope this is helpful ,0,history

tag009,i used to work with hf on a daily basis for dissolving metals metalloids such as tungsten titanium silcon tantalum and some others i was also fortunate enough to never have any accidents personally but i know a couple of people who did small amounts on the skin may go unnoticed as hf is in fact a weak acid so does not immediately cause a stinging sensation that other stronger acids will within an hour or two the contact site starts to get sore which worsens over time if left untreated the tissue will eventually undergo necrosis and the area will turn black at that point you are at major risk of having the area finger limb or whatever amputated always take strong precautions when handling the stuff wear thick chemical resistant gloves multiple pairs is advisable as long as you do not lose the ability to manipulate your work thus making it a more dangerous situation gloves may contain pinholes allowing chemicals to penetrate cover all bare skin wear all normal ppe gloves as previously mentioned labcoat safety glasses closed toed shoes long sleeves and pants no loose hair necklaces ect ect additionally wear a chemical resistant apron and full face shield all of this may seem like overkill and you will feel like a total geek but hf burns are no joke you will wish you had been wearing a hazmat suit if you ever get one also if you ever do get some on you make sure to immediately cease what you are doing and treat your affected site at this point you are working against time and your 1 priority is to get the acid off of your skin quickly remove any clothing that has been contaminated with hf as this will just hold the acid to your skin and be careful not to come into further contact with the wet article begin by flooding with copious amounts of cold water and prepare to treat the site with calcium gluconate gel asap some sources say to rinse for at least 15 20 minutes yeah that a long time with water but i might be inclined to only go for a few minutes before getting that gluconate solution on the area the water is only going to be good for getting any acid that is on the surface of the skin off but the gluconate is what is needed to help start neutralizing the ions that have begun penetrating the skin also be sure to keep the site wet with the gluconate so that it can continue to work with maximal effectiveness for hand finger burns it might help to saturate the skin and then place a clean glove over the affected hand to keep the gel from drying too quickly of course seek professional medical attention immediately following this initial first aid notify anyone who is with you that you have had an accident and get them to help you and call the emergency number right away another thing to note here is that many medical facilities may not be prepared to treat an hf burn properly it is a fairly rare occurrence because many laboratories and other facilities that utilize chemicals will not even keep hf onsite because it is too dangerous it may be a really good idea to contact the nearby facilities in your area to inquire about their ability to handle an incident of this nature often times only burn centers or hospitals with specialized training initiatives are really prepared for hf burn victims finding the appropriate facility in your area and working with them ahead of time on an action plan might be the difference between somebody having a scary incident that they get through unharmed or someone losing a finger a hand or worse a large enough dose absorbed through the skin can actually cause death by blood poisoning sorry for the whole hf psa here but i have found that the amount of knowledge training about hf safety even among trained chemists is severely lacking only you can prevent hf accidents ,2,askscience

tag009,perhaps but i am willing to bet your aunt and uncle did not wear wool socks also you have to make sure to get the correct size to avoid toe bumping you do not want to get blacktoe and ruin your vacation ,1,EarthPorn
tag009,regular tennis shoes while a feasible alternative if you are looking to save money will absorb water and make your feet heavy and make the hike more difficult they wo not let the water escape so they will keep more water around your feet as you travel the water shoes are designed to let water flow in and out they are also made from material that does not absorb water lastly they have better traction meant for hiking in wet conditions that tennis shoes do not either way i cannot stress the importance of wearing wool socks enough even if you do rent the shoes your feet will still probably get messed up if you wear cotton socks or no socks if you decide to just wear tennis shoes or sneakers at least wear some good wool socks to help protect your feet ,1,EarthPorn
tag009,i agree the hiking stick is helpful with some of the crossings i forget the name of the place where we rented our shoes but i remember they gave everybody a free hiking pole to bring with them ,2,EarthPorn
tag009,yup my buddy and i hiked in the same conditions both wearing the water shoes but only i was wearing the wool socks his feet took about two weeks after to properly heal and i was fine the wool helps wick the moisture away from your skin and lowers the friction so that chaffing and blistering is reduced ,3,EarthPorn
tag009,coolest hike i have ever done just stay away during flash flood season tip rent the special water shoes they have at one of the outfitters in town wear wool socks as well to keep your feet from chaffing ,31,EarthPorn
tag009,that makes sense i guess the point that is confusing to me was his assertion that the idea of a condensed ball of extremely dense matter is incorrect if this is true what is the correct way to think about the black hole is there another metaphore for picturing that we know of or are we simply unsure ,1,askscience

tag009,analytical instrumentation and labware working in analytical chemistry labs you soon find out how expensive it is for new equipment as well as upkeep and repair of existing equipment glassware is not too bad for common items but if you require specialty items things manufacturers do not sell a lot of items that seem like they should be pretty cheap can cost several hundred to a thousand dollars or more plasticware can be quite expensive depending on what you get big plastic storage bottles can run you a couple hundred bucks replacement parts for instrumentation can be quite ridiculous you can easily find yourself spending hundreds or thousands on what amounts to no more than a few small pieces of plastic or metal but have an exorbitant cost due to low demand or the fact that the manufacturer is often the only source for said parts third party sourcing can often be problematic kind of like buying those refurbed ink cartridges that never work quite right and if you pay for the manufacturer service contract for service and repairs you may be spending several thousand to tens of thousands a year and that still may not cover the cost of all parts new equipment can be really expensive you can easily pay 50 100 grand for something that looks like a little plastic box with a touchscreen of course the electronics inside are what is more complicated but again low demand for specialty items keeps the price tag high under these conditions unless business is booming and you are making cash hand over fist or unless you are a big pharma company with a lot of capital it is difficult to maintain the proper level of equipment maintenance and instruments will often be run until something breaks and there is no choice but to fix it the rest of the time things are limped along even though management knows about a problem but they are unwilling or unable to spend what is required to bring things back to 100 ,2,AskReddit
