Taper13,well yes and no there are two issues legal self defense and federal limitation of gun ownership per the 2nd amendment the issue of deadly force in self defense is explicit in more than half of the state constitutions and while the limits have been argued duty to flee castle doctrine etc no attempt to wholly deny the right has ever been heard by the scotus although the washington d c ban is an interesting case to consider the use of firearms as reasonable has been challenged on a case by case basis but never successfully in total what does the 2nd amendment say it says militias how is it interpreted ask the scotus that is their domain per the constitution what have they said about it shockingly little since 1791 there is an attempt by many to say i read x as saying this which is fine if we are chatting over cold ones but suggesting that we have overlooked an amendment for two hundred years is just foolish the possession of firearms specifically for self defense is not legally contentious specific circumstances sure but not as the supreme law of the land applied to all americans here a good review from ucla law http www2 law ucla edu volokh stateselfdef pdf tl dr the legality of gun ownership for self defense is firmly established by state and federal constitutional law ,2,AskReddit

Taper13,the voice of this story is me taper talking to you the reader i interpret op question as what secret knowledge would you want about others and what would you do with it in this idea of i guess a threat meter of sorts i see reasoning based in fear whether fear of physical pain fear of death or the fear of the very real psychological pain of social anxiety and rejection there a lot to unpack there i think in this story you project your fear harm pain on others based on their ability to work that fear upon you it bothers you that the baby could take you even though you know they never would try there are a lot of things going on but ultimately you are integrating your fears and working to overcome them with a flawed but best you can come up with method once you overcome your fears you forget about them and become interested in helping others i think the cure to a lot of our problems is to be good people and to build the best communities we can but ultimately you will be ok just put in the work the right kind of work now there are not really any female perspectives in this story i do not think i am good enough to speak in that voice with any authenticity that the most detailed female character is interpreted by the protagonist as potentially misinterpreting the protagonist is a nod to my befuddlement and projection so i ask you what would be different from a female perspective ,3,AskReddit

Taper13,thing is neither are the kurds in northern iraq kurdistan or the kurdistan regional government we saw religious tolerance before and after the invasion and it was the only place where until two or three years ago no us allied troops were killed the kurds in turkey are fighting to reestablish national recognition rights and a place in government that they had under the ottomans but lost under kemal ataturk in iraq the kurds want independence in syria they just want peace and in iran they are gently nudging the government for more freedom and autonomy and better ties with kurdish iraq ,16,CombatFootage

Taper13,thanks and i will give it a crack how can anything dealing with god change well is not the christian faith based on the new covenant i believe that there is a degree of reciprocity within our relationship with god eg we transgress and he forgives he loves and we are created etc we are taught that the church is as a spouse that we are as children and so on which requires action and reaction i see no basis for believing the god would be static in any way are some of the rules static ask him i do not know his care and concern is constant but as our behavior changes so must his how can a good god allow evil i think this question goes to the fall i think that as our bodies evolved and we became more smart aware sentient whatever as we evolved we gained the capacity to do good or evil and became subject to whatever potential for good or evil are inherent to the created world i cannot even picture what a world without evil would look like i think this question in general not from you here is a response to us wanting more sweets and less veggies why does god allow bad things to happen i have heard the metaphor that god is a general and we his soldiers he will lead us to victory but does not promise that it will work out well for us all i am not sure how i feel about that reasoning but i do not disagree that he does not owe us a happy life when he already loves us and offers us redemption i am sure on some level it simply unknowable for myself i consider pain and hardship to be a remnant of love and joy matthew blessed are those who mourn as well as an opportunity to grow in my life and faith of that in the moment i am just dealing with a jerk i am not sure how any of this will compare with your personal understanding or the teachings of the mormon faith but i would be interested to hear what you think ,1,AdviceAnimals
Taper13,i do not know anything about mormonism but your comment suggests a common feeling among a lot of youth from denominations i am familiar with you are read is one way of seeing it but it not well informed theologically most serious examination with notable exemptions such as some dominican scholars agrees that the story of the fall situates man within a universe of god creation we are inherently sinful that means we do not always do the best thing all the time mature reflection on this does not mean i am bad and need a quick fix it means i have to respect my limitations and consciously work towards improving myself my circumstances and human society as a whole i have to be aware and respectful of the limitations of others as well and neither rush to judgement nor deny forgiveness christianity has been around for a long time and precedent religions even longer it not a house of cards held up by charlatans or poor reasoning maybe it not what everyone wants in their life and no one can deny the bad experiences that too many have had at the hands of evil men it a work in progress and has to adapt with a changing world great u btw i love c h i wonder what jean calvin or tommy hobbes would have to say about the fall ,1,AdviceAnimals

Taper13,yeah no set standard there great point ,1,askscience
Taper13,that a great question which is really tricky to answer i will give it a go though the periodic table is a really amazing tool there a ton of information there if you know how to read it you can see the atomic number the number of protons in the atom usually an integer below and to the left of the letters and atomic mass the number of protons and neutrons in a typical atom of that element is at the top left and is usually not a whole number what gives why is not atomic weight a whole number jump now to the chart of the nuclides this shows the known isotopes of the elements as well as how often and in what way they decay decay is largely due to how the neutrons and protons fit together inside the nucleus a guy named seaborg there an element named after him for this theorized that there are discrete arrangements inside the nucleus that have different intrinsic stability this makes sense in a philosophical way every time we look more closely we find order and that order has implications but it was really amazing how he figured it out anywho those arrangements can be more stable or less stable let go back to the periodic table the lower rows not the lanthanides and actinides which are separate at the bottom but all the mysterious ones at the bottom of the main body are cosmically weird we do not find them naturally but all the rules that the periodic table hints at says that they should be at least theoretically possible so tying in ops question we try to make them problem is we know they have to be super duper unstable based on their nuclear arrangements millionths of a second unstable so we crunch the numbers based on seaborg and brilliant others work to try to find something that will last long enough to actually observe the places where this relative stability is calculated are our islands of stability let me know if that helps edited with coffee and advice from below ,457,askscience

Taper13,iirc bull sharks are more likely to bite but less likely to keep attacking i am not sure about neurological differences which might explain it but i have been told that it relates to environment bull sharks live in environments in which locating and identifying prey is more difficult as such bite right away and leave it if it is not right is a pretty solid strategy for pelagic open ocean fish like gws blues and whitetips they can track from a long way and plan their stalks and attacks plus gws have evolved to eat hot crunchies like people and seals so while we are not familiar were also not so different the woman from the mote aquarium whose name escapes me but i am sure i will remember or be told it in reply studied shark behavior and intelligence for decades she proved early on that the shark can see you outside of the water and adjust its movements to approach right when you get to the pool at that was in nurse sharks who just wanted some fish it not the most fascinating thing she discovered but it what made me join the will never go spearfishing in shark waters club i would love to hear anyone else thoughts on this ,2,videos

Taper13,i will hop in here since we are talking about a two dimensional sheet i will try to stick with that pick two different spots places locations choose your term on the sheet there exists some operation that can move from one spot on the sheet to the other it can be as simple as move two cm in that direction no sweat because both spots exist within the same dimension of the sheet now recalling that we are using a metaphor what are some other properties that this sheet may have how about height above the table temperature color remember that these are within the metaphor each of these qualities is another dimension and we can change perform operations within that dimension raise or lower the sheet warm or cool it color it with a pencil whatever you like change can occur across many dimensions at a time move two cm that way lift cool and add a nice purple hue but the operation is more complicated because of all the dimensions which could change the number of dimensions in string theory depends largely on how we define matter if you think back to our metaphorical sheet was it like a piece of paper or like a bed sheet was it made of chihuahuas how you defined the sheet requires you to consider a different number of those dimensions on which we can perform operations there is a minimum number which applies to all possible definitions of 2d sheet which is added to the number specific to your definition of 2d sheet and that is where we get the final number i hope that cleared it up let me know if it did or if i could try again for you ,44,explainlikeimfive

Taper13,your magic missile was successful but no sooner did the bolts fly than a darkness a physical emotional darkness descent upon you a cloud like charcoal seems to form in the air as ebony oozes down the walls and onto the floor you begin to shrink with dread as if the sands of an hourglass are falling on you head and shoulders from the swirling nether before you a voice reaches out with the depth of the sea and the echoes of long sunken halls i need about tree fitty ,14,DnDBehindTheScreen
Taper13,paladin in my games you are the holy tool of your divine master thus he would keep most or all of his melee numbers he would lose some bonuses because his faith is no longer protecting him or guiding his hand which are canon in pretty much every game i have read all spells or spell like effects which are derived from his celestial sugar daddy would be gone until they were replaced by the new deity for rp purposes i think it beneficial to let him be the gimp making the other players protect him as his powers wane and ultimately return will strengthen the party enhance their appreciation of the paladin and his role for him and them all and will give them a pretty unique role playing challenge to be fair though for me the game is in the mind miniatures are cool and it passingly entertaining to hear about a half dragon half dwarf half centaur flying ninja bard with a vorpal boot but at the end of the session it what i imagined how i felt and what surprised me that keeps me coming back ,2,DnDBehindTheScreen

Taper13,this is a great question topic can you tell us a little more about your campaign paradigms for instance are these pcs which are kept long term what roles do pallys play in your world how active are deities in your world one option that comes to mind is to really crush the character by having loss of powers and identity being scorned and becoming a bit of a pariah allow this to last for a period before being accepted by the new god in a vein similar to how job was tested in the old testament another would be to have the character flee to a holy place of the new god being pursued by paladins from the old god as an apostate have the paladin defend the people place of the new god against the old whatever you come up with i would use a crisis of identity in parallel with a temporary reduction and reinstatement of powers ,4,DnDBehindTheScreen

Taper13,so i have thought about this you could have a high level paladin pass through and browbeat them you could have a bard compose songs about their bad behavior you could do a lot of things but what i would do is ding their charisma scores probably with a temporary local modifier then make them perform cha checks on everything you want an sandwich that ten gp and you eat outside no one in town will talk to you they untie your horses while you are in the shop or put burrs under your saddle ,3,DnDBehindTheScreen

Taper13,that group not together anymore but i maintain my point that there too much sexism and gender driven prejudice in fantasy the heroine does not need to be paraded around in plate underwear etc dealing with gender in game as per op query should be about role playing and strong characters not nerfed stats again my opinion ,2,DnDBehindTheScreen

Taper13,really happened party of dwarves they venture into a forest to seek vengeance on an ork warband which had been doing very ork warbandy things they begin to home in on the ork camp hacking and slashing their merry way there one party member a berserker actually puts ork entrails on himself and smears blood on his face hack and slash hack and slash then they meet the female ork warband leader and suddenly they want to talk the berserker shows me that his character sheet shows that he speaks ork and then tells me he wants to try something diplomatic an otherwise fun party of pretty experienced players falls apart because the enemy has ostensibly two x chromosomes let thy character be chivalrous heck let them be a chauvinist jerk i do not really care just be consistent ,2,DnDBehindTheScreen

Taper13,there a lot of latent sexism in fantasy i have had parties choke when they found out the bad guy was a bad gal and it totally changed their behavior likewise with npc gender and players who play characters across gender lines i ding players for poor role playing if needed and have never once adjusted stats for gender just my view ,1,DnDBehindTheScreen
Taper13,i think both of your points have merit i would never really thought about this topic as whenever one of our parties have been sent to jail they have pretty quickly found their way out again ok not in dark sun but otherwise yes my first thoughts are these first we have never played out a courtroom procedural drama in game it always been kind of catch them disarm them rough them up throw them into a cell it would be highly culturally dependent whether this model was used or whether there was a more formal process i do not see orcs debating the finer points of habeas corpus although now i am picturing ten orcs huddled around a campfire one with a squirrel tied to his head a la wig saying in grung v drathblurp it was found that second proportional sentencing seems to me to be more just as an equal rebuke to all offenders plenty of room here for a more perfect solution though third and lastly i think that this has to fit with whatever the dm has put together we have all been in serious campaigns and we have all been in silly campaigns while tastes vary i think it best that whatever sentencing guidelines are developed fit within the broader setting and tone ,2,DnD

Taper13,this sounds like paul eno multiverse theory he has a website podcast and several books for anyone who wants to learn more in his theory each universe exists in a matrix of other universes which occasionally cross over each other or merge he works through the nuts and bolts to explain events which seem to be from the past events from the future and some of the entities that can be encountered good bad and indifferent i do not subscribe to this theory but it has the advantages of 1 being based on a long history of experiences and 2 being very well explained in the literature i do not have to agree with paul to say that he a really smart guy with a ton of experience in the field ,2,Paranormal

Taper13,and as to protohumans and convergent evolution yeah no comparing dna from different groups which is in my view pretty much a gigantic and meaningless series of arbitrary divisions but whatever we see not only relatedness between groups as would be predicted in a migration hypothesis but more than enough correlation to fail to support some kind of convergent evolution we were here before that land bridge hypothesis people fail to see the actual scope of dna evidence seriously we read genetics something some gene blah blah blah and it pretty easy to rationalize away or at least ignore but seeing two different species what i read from pronto humans whose genes have evolved to match as closely as different groups appear today would be like having my kid and william gibson both write the exact same book not thematically but word for word independently oh and the book is on the order of a complete library bookcase in length simpler to imagine is not the same as simpler to support with evidence and reason and occam razor only works if two concepts are otherwise equally provable ,6,history

Taper13,i think that really sums it up pretty fairly obama especially in his second term has positioned himself as a moderate democrat in that role he has been a sore disappointment to progressives to his left and the republicans to his right most people while they might not say they liked him would identify anonymized policies as being favorable i would say that his biggest shortcoming which i will grant might have been the eventual outcome had any of us been in his shoes has been a tolerance or even enabling of polarized partisanship he had little choice when no one could consistently be relied upon to stand with him but if you are the leader of the country sometimes you have to reach across the aisle and drag the opposition over dealing with a caustic political environment in a constructive way would have led to stronger parties based on liberal and conservative values instead of the current circus we see i do think it kind of neat that for my son who is about to start first grade the pusa and the space guy on tv his title for neil degrasse tyson have always been african americans i also think that it shameful that much of his presidency has involved ceaseless usually baseless ad hominem attacks about his race his citizenship his religion and so forth pretty telling about us that we demonstrated opposition on a basis other than principle ,5,AskReddit
