extremelytemporary,ahhh yes i knew i remembered that from something ,4,drunkencookery
extremelytemporary,oh that makes sense ive never actually tried so i was totally blowin bullshit with my post ive only had it while camping as delicious toast and at home as a quick snack with deli meats and cheese but now that i think about it it probably doesnt hold up well for proper grilled cheese sandwiches its too grainy and full of seeds sunflower seeds would be falling all over the pan and the bread itself wouldnt crust quite right ,2,grilledcheese

extremelytemporary,i will have to check those out they look great ,2,ketorecipes
extremelytemporary,i got them from amazon crown prince organic boneless and skinless i have heard that places like walmart and costco have much better deals but compared to the price of good sardines in nyc the amazon deals were good enough for me ,1,ketorecipes
extremelytemporary,and in general always look for the cheap cuts of meat and fish my local grocery store does chicken leg quarters for extremely cheap so i will buy family packs and freeze them i live alone frozen veggies save money but there are certain things i will only get fresh namely onions and garlic snacks are definitely the hardest part of it all im not much of a snacker though so i cannot help much edit duh i forgot to mention cheese i eat cheese at home whenever im hungry and will usually bring a bit with my lunch to snack on if i get hungry soft cheeses like brie and mozzarella are for home harder stuff like extremely sharp cheddar is for work i dont really bulk up on this i wait for sales and pounce i can get a pound of mozzarella for 5 if i wait for the sale so it worth it ,2,ketorecipes
extremelytemporary,for breakfast get eggs and maybe some bacon its hard to get tired of that i also sometimes do a scrambled egg thing that i just posted in another thread it eggs onion liver and curry power super tasty surprisingly good for hangovers for snacks i usually have nuts mostly almonds but i cannot always afford those so i sometimes get a cheap thing of salted peanuts you have to be sorta careful because nuts have more calories than you think but my deficit is usually steep enough to allow it since i skip breakfast ,3,ketorecipes
extremelytemporary,i make a breakfast thing that is basically scrambled eggs white onion and calf liver seasoned with salt pepper and curry powder the curry goes well with the odd taste and texture of liver ,1,ketorecipes
extremelytemporary,also if you are into fish at all a sardine tin can add 20 g of protein to your meal for 170 calories i just eat them straight out of the tin they are cheap and can be ordered in bulk online plus they last a long time ,3,ketorecipes
extremelytemporary,on sundays roast a whole chicken stuffed with lemon and garlic and with carrots n onions at the base pork chops are also cheap and easy just sear up a big batch i do not do like a total prep though i usually bulk cook a protein that i have for both lunch and dinner and mix it with different veggies throughout the week like avodacos and spinach and whatnot i also rarely eat breakfast so that is not an issue ,4,ketorecipes

extremelytemporary,but would you not be able to get it if you waited for release day to pay for it that the part that confuses me ,1,gaming
extremelytemporary,i see so many people who in the middle of their rants mention that they thought they had learned their lesson from pre ordering xyz other disappointing games in the past but now with nms they will surely change their ways i hope they stop whining about it and actually do it dont pre order anything whats the point what is actually the point of pre ordering do people think they wont get a copy unless they pre order and do not even get me started on dlc the fact that destiny keeps being re released for 60 with every expansion just shocks me ,5,gaming
