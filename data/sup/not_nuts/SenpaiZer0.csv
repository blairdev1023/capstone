SenpaiZer0,wow that a dope way to look at it i like that last part maybe the show is like a social criticism on how technology is turning us into more primitive creatures even though we think of ourselves as becoming more sophisticated with the use of said technology either way i think reflection of society is definitely what the writers directors are going for in some form edit grammatical error,2,blackmirror

SenpaiZer0,it comes with four parts the stand itself a pop filter a clamp to attach the stand to a surface like a table a little mic holder i was able to clamp the stand to my desk but i have no idea how to attach the mic holder to the end of it i know where to put it but it seems like the part the mic holder goes on is too small for it it is the right part though because i have seen it in the pictures on the box on top of that the pop filter comes with a little clamp to attach it to the stand when you screw the clamp down however halfway down it runs into a metal circle where the pop filter spine is on the other side of the clamp this makes it impossible to screw the clamp down more than halfway and i do not know what to do about it edit fixed the pop filter i saw a video of a man who has the mic and he just screwed his mic holder onto the part no problem mine does not screw on like that and i do not know why maybe my shipment had the wrong size or something like that all the parts came together in one shipment so i am confused ,1,microphones
