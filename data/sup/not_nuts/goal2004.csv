goal2004, dropping a titan in tf1 felt awesome it hit the ground cratered robots and mowed down any pilot caught in the open you still get to do all of that i do not understand how you are not seeing that the only difference is that if you go out in the open and too many pilots notice you or you run across another titan you may need to be prepared to break off pursuit and approach it from a different angle in tf2 i feel like pilots have the upper hand versus titans they have more of a fighting chance but pilots are still waaaaaaay way below a titan power a titan can almost always instagib any pilot no pilot can kill a titan on their own unless the person in that titan is a moron or if there enough distraction going on that the titan cannot focus on the pilot a pilot simply has the ability to damage a titan now which in the past was way too difficult it required you to both expose yourself and continue remaining exposed otherwise the titan shield would come back up it made taking shots at titans rather pointless letting pilots have lasting impact on titans simply evens the odds a little bit ,1,Games

goal2004,first one encouraged the same kind of play in the titan that you experienced on foot focusing on creative aggression from both perspectives i think that they added tons of depth to the game by making the distinction between pilot and titan gameplay significantly different the idea behind is to make it so that on foot you think on your feet but when you are in a titan you gotta use your brain a bit more and weigh risk vs reward more carefully it more punishing when you make mistakes which can be a problem for some but i do not think it is inherently bad it different is all ,5,Games

goal2004, the weapon movesets make them very unique and requires very different playstyles i have found the variety to be somewhat lacking to be honest i mean there is definitely variety when you try different weapon types single handed single rigged double rigged heavy duty but two weapons from the same class will seem to have pretty much the same animations with maybe one or two standout weapons per category that do something a bit different on certain combos i with there was more variety of moves per weapons also sometimes it feels like there no difference between vertical and horizontal attacks like in certain combos or if you do a dodge attack i wish there was more meaning to whether i have to use vertical or horizontal attacks ,2,thesurgegame
goal2004, for the second phase focus on one of the four arms and dodge a lot focusing on one arm is not actually necessary but it is imperative you only target the 2 arms farthest from the boss if you get close to the other 2 the boss will smack you one interesting phenomenon that i found to be consistent across all three cycles of the game was that half way through the third phase the camera will un lock from the boss and point directly to its left and you will have to re lock it again this happened to me too can confirm is annoying ,1,thesurgegame

goal2004,i found it weird that the way to get the 2 0 weapon was actually the easier way to kill that boss i mean if you leave any arm on it in the 2nd phase then you are gonna have a hard time without the whirlwind of arms that phase is so much easier also i love that weapon i have been using it pretty much since i got it its fire aoe is fantastic ,2,thesurgegame
goal2004,they expect you at that point to hit the thinner piece of the arm farther up rather than the large armored piece on the ground it makes sense but it not cool that there no feedback of any kind to hitting the wrong spot a weapon recoil a considerably lower damage like hitting an armored piece anything like that would have worked fine having my weapon just clip through felt lame ,1,thesurgegame
goal2004,in phase 1 if you attack fb legs head on rather than from the side and continue to hit it from there even when fb staggers and sits on it for a moment you will see that during that 2nd bit your hits will swing right through here an example i captured actually https www youtube com watch v cbo8id69bsw t 2m20s,1,thesurgegame

goal2004, slowing something down does not add variety it makes me less enjoyable it adds variety compared to the pilot gameplay if one is fast and the the other is more methodical the types of gameplay you experience are more varied there is nothing subjective about that whether you like it or not is something else and you agree most anybody would agree that faster titans along with the much more exciting titan eject from titanfall 1 are preferable see i do not think that is true at least not according to what people here have been saying ,1,titanfall

goal2004, its all timing now instead of skill timing things well is a skill i do not understand how you cannot see that the titans need to be speed up the speed at which they do things their base movement speed all of it i do not think i agree i like the gameplay divide between being on foot and being in a titan it should feel different because you are bigger in your titan you are still faster than a pilot it just that you are not proportionally as fast to your size as a pilot is whether or not you enjoy this is your own subjective taste but it is not bad simply because it slower it adds variety to the game ,1,titanfall

goal2004,yeah this is one thing that kind of bothers me dark souls had this tendency to make all attacks take roughly the same amount of time with maybe an odd one out that quicker in the surge most animations are the same speed except for a couple of combo finishers that are way too long compared to the other animations it took me a while to figure it out this specifically but i am certain this is my biggest annoyance also kind of annoying esp on firebug sometimes there will be parts of a large enemy that will block your movement but your weapon swings right through without damage or any kind of feedback that not cool ,1,thesurgegame
goal2004, titans are worse much slower and way less skill based if i understood it correctly the usual criticism against 1 was that there were some loadouts that were considered outright absolute best and some that were absolutely impossible to win with i think that having 6 defined presets with slight customization is a better way to ensure proper variety while everyone still has an easy enough time understanding how to counter whatever comes at you it less spammy more strategic which is why slower is better but i would not say less skill based if anything because it takes more planning it takes more thought oriented skills than reaction oriented skills ,1,titanfall

goal2004, but yeah i agree it would weight several tons but it does already so i do not see what the problem is you know why the saturn v rocket is so big most of it is built to push the fuel that powers it this is a similar game of diminishing returns with significantly less power to actually make a difference how much force do you think you would need to push an arm that weighs say 3 tons and have it swing at 30mph from a resting position to a fully extended position that pretty slow for a punch but let start there i do not think we can build a metal beam that can take that kind of stress without bending or splitting at a weak point ,1,videos

goal2004,i think it better to enable toggle crouch rather than hold crouch that way you just hit the button once when you think you would wanna land into a slide and then immediately jump again ,28,Games

goal2004,tracking eyes inside a headset is gonna be very difficult but more than the gameplay implications it might have there are huge performance benefits to be had basically if you know the user vision does not focus on certain areas of the screen then you can effectively render it at a lower resolution and not have any perceptible impact on the player the tech that could leverage that already exists and was experimented with by nvidia in vr as far as only showing high resolution data directly in front of the user this obviously limits your field of view but if that high res area could be mobile around the screen depending on where the user eye is looking then that would be the needed game changer graphical performance could easily surpass what we see on non vr games because they would require significantly fewer pixels to be processed ,4,Games
goal2004, i cannot tell you how many times people have told me this but i think its funny because it almost sounds like they are being held hostage lol to be honest the developers of the applications should make it somehow possible to redeem any app you buy on one platform on any other one i do not think it that big a request but it would be tricky to set up something like that ,6,videos
goal2004,here the thing iphones still provide the best battery life to performance ratio out there i do not know what it is about androids but the ones that can run modern applications at good performance run out of juice within a few hours but an iphone will hold up to double as long this and the fact that i already own software on the platform that cannot be transferred to another platform is why i still use an iphone ,-9,videos
