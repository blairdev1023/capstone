4tunabrix,this is my dads story there used to be this metal ring in the ceiling above the teachers desk not sure what for but before a lesson once they threaded a piece of fishing line into it and on the other end above where the teacher stood they tied a condom full of water now the ceilings were pretty high so they hoisted this watery condom high into the ceiling and he held the other end of the fishing line from his desk when the teacher arrived it was slowly lowered down above his head all the students were trying their hardest not to die of laughter the whole time the teacher was utterly oblivious to what was hanging above his head for half the lesson the condom would be bobbed about above his head the teacher getting more and more furious with the laughter finally the teacher snapped and started screaming at them at which point my dad decided it was time to release the line and have the condom burst on his head punishment for this was a pretty severe beating apparently ,3,AskReddit
