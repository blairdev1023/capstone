SilverL1ning,here my review of the topic the fight scenes were terrible from the choreography to the speed of the motions the fight scenes amount to a major disappointment as for the story it pretty cool the one major thing it lacking is more depth into the characters lives outside of following danny desire to defeat the hand the entire story is very linear but who is the girl and what does she do when she not talking to danny what does danny do when he not following a clue otherwise i am interested in seeing part 2 because the mystiscism of the samurai kung fu stuff is far too interesting of course my reviews are the best ps i did not enjoy daredevil far too slow and uninteresting ,-2,television
SilverL1ning,were you born stupid you just said evander holyfield cannot be beat by an alternative martial arts master a basic understanding of a martial art will get you no where get your two bit arm chair knowledge and condractory complex out of here anybody can join the military and go to war means that samurai master could train their art the fuck you have a serious disability to intellectual think or visualize maybe you need another lesson you cannot be the best if you do not beat the best if there are no bests are there are no samurai master two remember what you are talking about and what it implies somebody walks into a room gets attacked by an insurgent with a knife means samurai have a place on the battlefield seriously where do you come up with this bum fuck knowledge does it come naturally or do your try you should probably get out of here ,1,OldSchoolCool
SilverL1ning,there a reason why but you do not know it seriously dude back off you obviously know nothing about martial arts and what is this bs about hand to hand combat even today grab a sword and step onto the battlefield please my dick is hurting by the way evander holyfield is trained to do one thing really really well his stance alone will get his ass kicked against a mixed martial artist in fact he would have to train in other martial arts to prepare for the fight do not know what is wrong with you maybe you need a lesson one scientist cannot know all science ancient martial arts are not developed by one man its developed by all men in an environment that requires it like any profession that environment no longer exists and the last of the masters no longer exist the sengoku period the same period that the portuguese showed up with guns that led to the extinction of the samurai just two centuries later irrelevant yeah not to mention it well known in popular culture http www telegraph co uk news worldnews asia afghanistan 9571522 soldier who led afghanistan bayonet charge into hail of bullets honoured html here the last recorded bayonet charge which resulted in zero close quarters combat essentially somebody had a bayonet and you consider that proof that samurai could exist today what else did you fuck up ,-1,OldSchoolCool

SilverL1ning,you mean you have yet to see a master knock out holyfield at his own game gloves and rounds maybe holyfield should walk into the octagon or into the masters domain gloveless and in mud not to mention the real samurai warriors are dead long ago when the gun arrived masters today have not been in battle ,-3,OldSchoolCool
