JonnyM93,you are correct the bible was written by humans and they had leeway to write things down from their point of view in many cases however the bible itself explains that all scriptures are inspired of god meaning god himself guided them through it to ensure the overall message came across correctly 2 tim 3 16 this video gives a great example of how that works who is the author of the bible https www jw org en publications books good news from god good news in the bible from god video who authored bible insight search id 2d73d5b8 7a6a 4b7d a706 3b608b37a2a0 insight search result index 0 what reason would we have to believe those words though if anyone can say what they write is inspired of god by studying the bible one can find many reasons to believe in it and therefore have faith in it some examples are in this video why believe in the bible https www jw org en publications books good news from god good news in the bible from god video bible true ,0,pics
JonnyM93,what you describe does sound reasonable and i understand the process i do not deny the ability for a species of life to adapt to its surroundings that been directly observed many times what i do not believe can happen is that a certain kind of animal can morph into another type of animal given enough time i believe it referred to as macro evolution i also do not believe that life arose on its own from imple proteins as even the simplest cell is extremely complex on the molecular level about the designer and who designed him i believe the bible gives a satisfactory answer to those questions feel free to pm me if you would like to know why i think that ,-2,pics
JonnyM93,that is a great question and in my opinion the bible is the method through which the creator reveals himself to humanity for those who are willing to study it and get to know him if you have more questions about why i believe this feel free to pm me ,-6,pics
JonnyM93,this is what i find hard to believe as well ,-1,pics
JonnyM93,to be fair the theory of evolution implies that it came about by millions and millions of little accidents over enormous spans of time not just by one or a few i myself do believe however that it is more logical to believe that there was a designer who created life than to believe that life arose on its own ,-24,pics
