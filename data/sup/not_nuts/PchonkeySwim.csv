PchonkeySwim,perhaps all i ever notice is that people who in the outside world who definitely at some point in their lives say it just a joke get over it get super offended and militant when someone makes fun of them it just too much of common thing in life for that to happen to someone in regards to saying it just a joke get over it or any nuanced action in life that happens to people for me to take the offended super seriously barring actual hateful and aggressive teasing and blatant distaste i think people tend to not be aware of themselves when they choose to be vocal with their being offended and it a really bad thing that a common action in culture it only funny until it has to do with you it makes me super uneasy and curious into how exactly these people brains work i even know people like this and i see it through strangers as well hell i have even seen it turn around completely during a single conversation someone makes fun of someone does not think it a big deal then gets made fun of and gets super angry i think it should be mandatory that people get some sort of how to be a human training cause apparently it does not come naturally i almost feel like we are regressing into more primitive roles ,1,funny

PchonkeySwim,i would work at this place just for that it weird that bad customer service is telling people what is wrong with them and how to correct it or even just bluntly pointing out that they are wrong and they need to shut up so you can help them so people are so irate for some alien reason that has nothing to do with the call it almost a favor to shut them down so their fucking spiral does not drain the life out of some other unsuspecting foolish enough to talk with them throughout the day i have worked in the tele business a lot this is something i desire luckily when you become a manager you can do just that if you feel like it depending on where you work here at this student servicer if you have exhausted all options and the customer is being irate just to be that way you can start talking to them sternly and telling them what they are options are you can hang up on them and you can do this all in a condescending tone if you want to but only under the unreasonably irate circumstance it still too weak if you ask me because sometimes i just want to get people to follow me along a trail of the conversation so i can point every instance they have contradicted themselves just to be spiteful to me haha i feel like someone downvoted this because there was more than twenty words ,0,Showerthoughts

PchonkeySwim,i was only doing it because of what people were saying to me half of the shit i have said was just off the top of my head probably more than half i will repeat i just gave back the energy i was given its what i like doing because it just seems so mundane yet the two people involved could not be doing anything else when ultimately we are talking about nothing and puffing up our chests some people are just better than other people though and i mean that but there is not a very great way of discovering that over means of petty arguments in that case probably both parties are pretty useless what i do not like in the world is all these memes used as dissuading relevance to individuals because they share similarities it become an avid part of our culture and it makes me kind of sick that and the general dismissiveness and unaccountability of people who say things they do not do i apologize none of us deserve to be treated this way nor should treat others that way i wo not deny that i am not cocky and i am definitely short sighted i have been working on this forever and it almost to the point where i think i am stuck with it if i had all the answers on how to be the best person you possibly could be i probably would not ever be on reddit at all in my opinion and sometimes people just think you think you are better i take certain instances and actions and portray them how i perceive them but i do not believe myself to really be better than anyone to any certainty while i do believe that some people are just simply better than others i have an extended list of issues and problems faults qualms and various other words for the same thing if i could solve those all in one day i would give my life to eternity you have been my favorite asshole though ,2,AskReddit

PchonkeySwim,yeah they are everywhere or that just someone elses way of saying fag without having to i dunno ,1,AskReddit
PchonkeySwim,exactly literally anyone can say that and you cannot tell you said it yourself but you are sure as shit that i am not even having said that i said earlier that i am only returning the energy people are sending to me if they continue to do that i really had nothing better to do lunch is over though so i gotta go anyhoo this is all subjective blathering based on our own interpretations of the world i reacted to hostility with hostility so none of us are any better than the other and we all might as well be calling ourselves stupid i will always respond in turn to the way i am talked to ,-1,AskReddit
PchonkeySwim,yeah gifs absolve people from reality yes they do it not entirely the most polite thing to do but they do it you speak in absolutes that only serve to protect your narrative given talking with you in particular has been better than the others you somehow have an ability to get through an entire message without blathering out some petty playground insults which really reduces the strain on my eyes from all the rolling anyhoo i have lost interest we gonna keep doing this ,0,AskReddit
PchonkeySwim,well you said it so it must be a fact i will just point out that the context of this conversation is not solely limited to the last response i received which it seems to be with you you guys have goldfish memories and are petty as absolute hell i am returning the energy you have given me my original comment was not offensive at best it was speculative and a little lamenting to the situation somehow you asshates took insult to that and went on what i am sure you consider a rampage you have done nothing said even less and continue to think you are accomplishing something here beyond the mere satiation of your pithy desire to feel special i am smart incredibly smart but probably not too smart for participating in this meandering nonsense i mean the fact is that you had no good comeback so you said people who are smart do not have to say they are smart in what context does that apply i mean you are probably implying in a situation where smarts would be applied and proven through practice one would not have to say they are smart then again when you submit a resume are you not telling people you are smart when you offer your assistance in a specific task are you not telling people you are smart is your interpretation of this fact merely just the vocalization of yourself as being smart i mean where do you draw the lines in such a vague statement you guys have no context you are contrarian and you cannot argue your way out of a phonebooth if you are so unhappy with how stupid you are change yourself maybe one thing you need to work on is figuring out why someone saying that they are so smart makes you so insecure ,0,AskReddit

PchonkeySwim,are you not accountable to your own logic you are doing the same thing you are accusing me of when did i act surprised by anything other than the idea that some person was so separated from their own family that it was offensive wherever you are from that may be common but not where i come from so i guess you can just use our social expectations as a basis for who is really what here ,1,AskReddit
PchonkeySwim,i guess the 0 i spent to not actually give a shit worked too you are pathetic man unfortunately your skull is made of some dumbass based titanium so you are stuck with you ,1,todayilearned

PchonkeySwim,oh big surprise i would have never expected someone of your intellect to use an actual disability as an insult you are still screen shotting this right reddit loves people like you i will make a bet with you i will ask you to explain any of the things you have accused me thusfar autism mental instability being a tumblirina and you have to come up with good explanation as to why they are true that involve rational explanations then i will let you ask me to do the same thing with the things i have accused you of you game omg you finally did the right thing and stopped there is hope for you yet ,1,AskReddit

PchonkeySwim,i understand the connotation associated with that link but you really should be pointing yourself that direction ,1,AskReddit
PchonkeySwim,i already told you that i am going to respond to everything you say i knew that you had a bad memory but i was unaware that you could not read it seemed like you could you wo not acknowledge how you have changed your tone 3 times now you said that you were not trying to be mean after calling me a pussy nothing you have said has had any context besides prying or trying to insult me and then the labels you come up with afterward it like you are calling me all the things that are associated with the actions of your own it kind of amazing what is even more amazing is i am not even being nuanced and you still do not understand all the mistakes you have made i have never met someone as dense as you or proud of nothing your vernacular is shit and you are a tortured wreck of your own ignorance a typical victim of your own problems i do not even know what a tumblrina is but i assume to you that like a really solid burn or something it useless though the biggest insult you could do to yourself is to keep talking ,1,AskReddit

PchonkeySwim,on the really dumb ones who cannot carry decent and respectful conversations usually the ones that jump right out of the gate by calling me a pussy yeah usually those people have a hard time hanging it because they are stupid as fuck ,1,AskReddit
PchonkeySwim,what is this a reply i must be retarded sorry but these are not personal messages this are on a public forum you said some incredibly stupid crap that you have either a deleted or b edited by now or are going to and i am going to keep pointing out your intellectual flaws because it super easy you do not let an opportunity like this pass up because you get to see what it like when someone in denial runs out of mental energy anyways we are both going to have our comments removed soon for a flamewar hell i bet you even report them personally just so you can be rid of me which is totally expected totally you are deflect it in your mind and somehow make it seem like you did something right and feel better about yourself someday that truck is going to hit you straight in the face and you wo not be able to see your way out of your own bullshit who is the fucking snowflake now ,1,AskReddit
PchonkeySwim,this is the typicality of people like you you get upset when someone calls you on your bullshit and then you pretend they are harassing you remember you sent the first message calling me a pussy i am not trying to be mean remember you said both of those things you do not even know what you did and it was less than an hour ago you are the only one getting bothered and these two responses here are responses you do not even know what you are talking about you are too full of hubris to concede but too fucking stupid to make any sense the only one having a bad time here is you ,1,AskReddit
PchonkeySwim,here another fun fact the guy the initiated the conversation with me in the first place is now calling me annoying because i keep responding to him you seriously need to take a pen and write down everything you do throughout the day then take that to a stand up club and pretend it a persona that has nothing to do with you if i was in the audience i would laugh my ass off and you could at least get some sort of reciprocation for such a dead end personality ,1,AskReddit
PchonkeySwim, i am not even trying to be mean also im pretty sure this guy is mentally unstable guess what you just did bullshitted so hard you forgot your own words so how can anything you say be valid in any regard i m annoying try talking with someone who cannot even remember what they said five seconds ago i knew you were projecting and with each response you give me it becomes more apparent that you are talking about yourself than you are me the issue here is when will you notice that ,1,AskReddit
PchonkeySwim,last word im so cool dude you cannot even get through a sentence without making an insult you know children right what children do you give them even the slightest hint of your disapproval or scold criticize them and they start going you are a poopy head that you right now yes it hilarious also still waiting to hear on where you got the qualifications to deem me mentally unstable i will wait all day but i am pretty sure i am not going to get anything ,1,AskReddit
PchonkeySwim,last word i mean it just you are so typical most likely you are projecting with that mentally unstable comment also i mean on what basis have you deemed me mentally unstable are you even qualified to make that diagnosis with those questions asked is it more likely that i am right instead of you i mean you are setting yourself up for nothing but failure but your dissonance is of such high value you are making yourself feel better with low effort thoughtlessness i mean if it works for you fine ,-2,AskReddit
PchonkeySwim,sure you do sure ya are sure we are i do not know what you intended the end result to be here but i am pretty sure it was not me laughing as hard as i am now it kind of ironic that you called me a pussy when you are obviously so triggered by my words added note which you probably wo not see since you pettily downvoted me and are in the act of responding snowflakes are beautiful and unique you need to try harder haha snowflakes give me a break you have no supplement no context you are just an anger machine with no use ,-15,AskReddit
PchonkeySwim,yep nothing stop trying to be the cool kid anyways knew you were a liar have a good life ,1,todayilearned
PchonkeySwim,well the likelihood of someone who labels their daughter as such is that the whole thing is made up to push a narrative i do not know anyone who would say such things or put such labels on their family like that not saying it not possible but this is reddit people are referencing this comment as evidence that i was shocked culturally about aspects of familial relations if you want to see the bottom of the barrel on reddit please keep following this thread if you want to spare yourself some idiocy avoid it i participated i am just as guilty but i kind of had a lot of fun ,60,AskReddit
PchonkeySwim, focus on yourself and get a job that assuming ass you probably just told a bunch of people at work to get jobs well you should not be on reddit at work that about as good as saying i do not have a good comeback i do not understand how you people do not notice the idiocy in the things you say so assuming always have an immediate answer when you could not even begin to fathom the opposites position see from your stance everything is not that bad and nobody should worry and it too late but if the roles were reversed as they have been before you would be in my shoes whether or not you would be speaking in a manner like myself or saying shit like get over it libtard noob is unknown at this moment if you are worried about your daughter not having a job spend less time telling strangers about it as if you are embarassed by her that certainly does not help your personal relationship with her if you even care if this is not made up and help her find one and be a parent the same logic that applies to your demand for people not getting too caught up in things do not concern them applies to this very thing plus you are wrong half the people you are talking to are employed and a majority of people complaining have jobs just like you would be saying to me if our roles were reversed while it highly likely you have your own set of rules and confirmations that make the world seem to you a certain way you have no real ability to determine if any of that is true most of the main news outlets push fake narratives that push agenda millions of people are still arguing about information that is already proven to be untrue but now they think it jus government covering up because they are stupid think chemtrails except less evidence yeah cray anyways the way you are thinking here is err would very err would and you need to reevaluate the way you think about people you do not even know every time you assume some stupid thing and then back it up with well it has to be at least somewhat true you could pretty much paint any picture you want and push any information you want so your logic is inredibly flawed and finally you want people to calm the fuck down about things that definitely affect their lives you do not even know who these people are you do not even know if there is legislation being passed that will directly affect their lives but they should just get jobs though right seriously dude get real ,-2,AskReddit
