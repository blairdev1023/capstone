nashvortex,the basic dumb idea is as follows 1 take a collection of a lot of very general statements and random numbers eg 1 2 3 x etc parameter space 2 write a program that can rearrange those general statements or change those numbers eg 2 3 1 solver 3 show it an example of a question and its correct answer eg 1 2 should be 3 training data 4 now let it rearrange the statements and numbers thousands of times until it reaches the correct answer iteration 5 eventually it figures out the correct thing to do 1 2 3 6 now ask it 3 4 it will use the statement it sort of figured out and do 3 4 7 congratulations you have an ai that knows it must add the two numbers to get the right expected answer of course no one writes an ai for addition but i hope you can see that the method can be applied to very complex problems as well in fact the more complex a problem the more useful and efficient it usually becomes to use an ai approach the exact method of doing each of these steps are vastly different and may be very complex but the core idea of ai is that it is a program that can modify another program or algorithm until it reaches the right answer then it is rinse and repeat ,1,explainlikeimfive
nashvortex,sex has had two functions throughout human history 1 consensual sex for procreation and recreation 2 non consensual sex as a method to establish political military or psychological dominance option 1 consensual sex is portrayed as a taboo subject in indian society as such the only option that remains is option 2 the exposure to option 1 is so limited for most indian males that they cannot often even distinguish between option 1 and 2 unfortunately option 2 is further bolstered because it fits in so nicely with another deeply rooted idea in indian culture that of the subservient female ,3,india

nashvortex, yeah and that makes mass slaughter okay are you making an argument for futility of ethics then killing people for eating beef is also okay by your own reasoning no i am making an argument for the subjectivity of ethics and thus the futility of ethics as a source for a debating point it is exactly because ethics is subjective we follow the law killing people is illegal at least under the circumstances under discussion here the law is decided by the people in a democracy and if people want to make it legal to kill animals they may do so no because animals do not have a moral compass humans do morality is even worse than ethics when it comes to objetive logical arguments at least ethics may sometimes align with reality for a stated goal morality is entirely in your head and what is in your head need not have anything to do with anyone else head plants and microbes are not sentient please do define sentience the ability to process information almost all life has that self awareness can you prove something is not self aware can you prove you are self aware you cannot because of the kurt g del already proved that through the incompleteness theorem or turing halting problem even if you accept the idea of sentience is sentience a binary thing or is it a continuum where do you draw the threshold your threshold and the use of sentience as a factor for deciding rights is entirely arbitrary here is a simplified tree of life http www sciencehq com biology images kingdoms png your assignment of rights to one particular branch of it based on subjective principles of ethics and purely imaginary and individualistic ideas of morality is arbitrary at best and irrational at worst so there no evidence that it is an essential part and that is relevant because essential can mean a lot of things essential for an individual essential for a species there is plenty of evidence that eating meat for essential for the survival of humans as a species there is some evidence that this holds true even today due to the economics of agriculture and vegetarianism here is an excerpt from scientific american that should throw light on this killing animals and eating meat have been significant components of human evolution that had a synergistic relationship with other key attributes that have made us human with larger brains smaller guts bipedalism and language larger brains benefited from consuming high quality proteins in meat containing diets and in turn hunting and killing of large animals butchering of carcasses and sharing of meat have inevitably contributed to the evolution of human intelligence in general and to the development of language and of capacities for planning cooperation and socializing in particular even if the trade off between smaller guts and larger brains has not been as strong as is claimed by the expensive tissue hypothesis there is no doubt that the human digestive tract has clearly evolved for omnivory not for purely plant based diets and the role of scavenging and later hunting in the evolution of bipedalism and the mastery of endurance running cannot be underestimated and neither can the impact of planned coordinated hunting on non verbal communication and the evolution of language https www scientificamerican com article should humans eat meat excerpt here is another article you may find interesting http time com 4252373 meat eating veganism evolution unnatural immoral of course those are not the same thing unnatural based on objective evaluation and observation of reality immoral whatever you want to be depending on your moral code has nothing to do with reality the whole point is that your moral arguments are entirely meaningless because morality is fundementally meaningless as a guiding principle for rational decisions the law is also subjective in that it is what people decide it to be and clearly people do not want this end of story ps are you a sociology student ,1,india
nashvortex,this if the funniest thing i have heard you obviously do not know what liberalism is about for example you are assuming that animals have the same political and legal locus standi as humans that not the worst of it the most important thing that you are ignoring is that nature could care a rat ass about human philosophies and values if all animals have rights are all carnivores criminals in any case is it up us to judge that are herbivores not exploiting plants are plants not exploiting microbes plenty of evidence suggests that meat was is part of the natural diet of humans our single chambered stomachs canine teeth and inability to digest cellulose or synthesize lysine are just the tip of the iceberg if anything vegetarians are doing something very unnatural as humans so really you are entitled to your opinion but it makes absolutely no difference to the nature of things as far as human biology is concerned i think it is presumptuous of you to judge anyone especially when your own reasoning is so flawed ,14,india

nashvortex,an egg can break in infinitely many ways but once it breaks it has a very specific set of pieces it broke into only one of the infinitely many ways of being a broken egg actually occured that statement is rather silly but it has to do with prior and posterior probabilities if you calculated the probability of the egg breaking into that specific set of pieces you would find that the prior probability is extremely small in fact it is near 0 yet once it happens the posterior probability is 1 since the egg has broken into a piece this thing where the posterior probability being larger than prior probability is a tell tale sign of entropy increasing somewhere in the system in information theory or thermodynamics or pretty much anywhere where a system is very complex it is often only possible to measure probability of something happening in these cases this change in probability is used as a signpost that entropy is increasing somewhere in the system ,3,explainlikeimfive

nashvortex,you seem a little confused about warming and ozone layer effects so let start with extreme clarification ozone is just a form of oxygen in fact ozone continuously breaks into oxygen and reforms and in the process it uses the energy of some uv radiation that is coming from the sun because of this going on continuously in the upper atmosphere the particularly harmful uv radiation is used up and never reaches the surface of the earth this is different from global warming global warming is caused by the greenhouse effect now you already know that materials can be opaque to some kinds of radiation because they absorb that radiation they can be transparent to other forms of radiation because they let it pass through and they can reflect some types of radiation so think of coloured glass say it blue coloured glass this kind of glass let blue light pass through transparent to blue but absorbs red and green light opaque to green and red what i just described with blue glass also happens with clear glass it is transparent to uv and visible light but absorbs infrared light notice how hot glass becomes in the sun due to its infrared absorption certain gases like co2 and methane have exactly the same property to understand the greenhouse effect you have to understand that any kind of radiation including visible light will i tend to heat up objects a because of the energy they are exposed to and anything that is hot will emit infrared radiation so let see what happens if the earth has co2 in the atmosphere and is exposed to the sun the light from the sun comes to the atmosphere and some specific harmful radiation is absorbed by the ozone layer but most of it including visible light passes through the atmosphere because co2 is transparent to it and reaches the earth surface this heats up the surface of the earth and therefore makes it emit infrared light but wait the infrared light that is emitted cannot go into space because co2 is opaque to it and absorbs it making the atmosphere hot just like glass the upshot of all this is that instead of radiating away the infrared light harmlessly the co2 in the atmosphere traps that energy in the atmosphere heating it up and cause an increase in temperature this is global warming edit before the whiners come in with too long for eli5 comments op needed clarification on basics we prefer properly informed 5 year old humans not 5 year old parrots ,3,explainlikeimfive

nashvortex,this is a guess it is possible that the file encoding is different on windows and on android linux and the apps were not designed to handle it but what is probably happening here is that the android app is expecting a specific order of columns in the csv file while the pc app is writing them in a different order for instance the android app may expect column 3 in the csv file to be milliliters of liquid which is a number while the pc app is using column 3 to write names hence the complaint of invalid characters letters instead of numerals could you post your exported csv file somewhere i will try to convert it ,1,DIY_eJuice

nashvortex,first you have to understand that because of the way light blends any three colors can be used as primary colors to generate any other color the caveat is that sometimes you have to add a couple of primary colors and sometimes you have to subtract the primary colors from the blend subtracting light is very tricky it needs some kind of filter system to block the primary color to a precise degree so we really really just prefer to add the primary colors now it turns out that because of the wave human eyes perceive color choosing red green and blue as primary colors allows us to create the maximum number of other colors that we can see just by addition this is why rgb colorspace is so popular it is simply the most convenient notice that we did not really define what red green and blue should be in terms of the spectrum by tweaking the precise definition of red green and blue in terms of wavelengths we can get slightly better or worse in terms of how many colors we can generate this is what is meant by how good the coverage is of the colorspace for reasons that are beyond eli5 it is nearly impossible to create a system that generates all possible colors in a spectrum unless you involve very high temperatures think of the sun there is a low temperature system that does work by generating all colors at least in a given range directly http www leica microsystems com science lab white light laser but this only came up in the last 5 years and it is a cumbersome laser with a very complicated filter system to block out the colors you do not want even then the filter can only block out about 800 or so colors at a time it is not a practicable or economic system for consumer electronics costs are currently in the 100 000 range it is also unclear whether human eyes are even sensitive enough to detect the differences between colors while watching something on screen hence for now we are at rgb which represents the most practical and convenient way to display colors without much loss in information content ,1,explainlikeimfive

nashvortex,we do not know so far this is the known function of nav1 9 this is a protein that was discovered because a mutation in it was found to be responsible for some chronic pain disorders all versions of nav have since been shown to be involved in sensing pain stimuli generally the is no conceptual difference between effect and side effect we just tend to call undesirable effects as side effects cold pain is very much a useful thing ,5,explainlikeimfive

nashvortex,unlikely to make a difference the current is flowing through very specialized liquid wires in these switches it not superconductivity the temperatures we are talking about are nowhere near as cold ,22,explainlikeimfive
nashvortex,basically nerves have electric switches on them that allow current to flow through and that creates all sensations including pain when you hurt yourself some of these switches called trps trip causing the pain sensation now there is a particular switch nav1 9 that gets turned on by the cold and it has the effect of making the other switches easier to activate so if it cold nav1 9 is in the on position and that makes the pain switches trip faster and more frequently enhancing the pain sensation basically it sort of sucks that the same switches that cause pain are also sensitive to temperature changes the reason for the cold pain is that you probably want to know your finger is freezing before it dies of frostbite ps i hate it when specialized neurobiology has to be eli5ed ,1740,explainlikeimfive
nashvortex,again adult stem cells have now been shown to be capable of differentiating into all tissue types it does not require modification it requires that certain transcription factors primarily oct4 oct8 and notch activate in the cells the problem is that they do not do it in the body even if they are capable of it ,1,explainlikeimfive

nashvortex,evolution happens when selection pressure exists on the kinds of variations that are allowed to exist in the genotype of an organism whether those selections are natural or man made is immaterial for example it could be said that agricultural crops have evolved a commensalic relationship with humans from the point of view of the plant developing traits suitable to humans gives it a huge reproductive advantage having human favoured traits ensures that huge swaths of land are created for exclusive use of the plant and seed dispersal is unnecessary humans will purposefully plant seeds and grow the plant in optimal conditions to the best of their ability this is not the first time this argument is put forth that evolution is not happening i do not know why people think it is not happening of course it is ,1,explainlikeimfive
nashvortex,i agree i was just trying to explain what the opposing argument is however weak it may be ,1,explainlikeimfive
nashvortex,it is definitely not bad for you but it could be for the eco systems where they are grown the main objection is that utilizing technological manipulation to tremendously speed up evolutionary processes in a manner suited to mankind has never been done before to this degree as a result there is very little to guide on what impacts any particular gmo will have on the environment ecology etc typically evolution is very slow and this gives other will organisms time to adapt and evolve in parallel as well essentially in nature entire ecosystems evolve together while with gmos there may be a sharp perturbation of the ecological balance it is hard to predict what effects this will have most scientists do not give credence to this because gmos have to undergo all sorts of testing to rule out the above scenario however and unfortunately not everyone believes in the scientists ability to to their job right further suspicion in invoked since it is suggested that biotech companies and scientists working for biotech companies have vested interests in promoting gmos the gmo debate presses on because of the uncertainties involved here ,3,explainlikeimfive
nashvortex,well it is not entirely true that scientists do not know the problem seems to be that we can no longer remodel tissue even if we can grow it wound healing usually involves cells of the same type growing to replace tissue so blood vessels make more blood vessels skin cells make more skin cells etc and the wound is patched up creating any kind of structure requires cells to not just grow but also adopt shapes and properties in a series of co ordinated steps such that you end up with say a finger it seems this ability to grown and then remodel into an organ is lost in humans ,18,explainlikeimfive

nashvortex,let define what auto night mode should do it should essentially change interface colors based on when sunset and sunrise occurs that leads to the first problem sunset and sunrise do not occur at the same time everyday as the length of the day varies throughout the year therefore a proper auto night mode needs to hook up with some kind of time weather service to know the timings of sunrise and sunset different manufacturers have different implementations of a weather service so this means that the app having auto night mode cannot depend on the phones weather app it has to have its own independent service the second issue is time zones if the phone changes time zones there will be a sync required to get the new sunrise sunset timings this essentially means that essentially the phone has to keep polling the time service to detect if the phone has changed time zones and if yes get the new sunrise sunset times continuous polling impacts battery life finally there is the situation of whether the app is active or not what happens when the app is closed during sunset should it then be doing all the above timing checks when it is started that results in slow startup or should it have a background service to constantly check and have the app startup in the correct mode this consumes battery all in all most programmers and users see this as too much complication for something that is neither tremendously demanded nor is it so difficult that the user can manually switch autonight mode is a minor convenience that requires major infrastructure backend weather time service and complicated logic in the code tl dr it simply fails the cost benefit analysis ,11,redditsync

nashvortex,medical scientist specializing in liver biology here for those interested it is good to be aware that donating a liver is a difficult surgery for a live donor that is likely to mean hospitalization of upto 2 weeks if everything goes well complications involved include infection blood loss etc expected side effects of the surgery involve reduced digestive capacity and gastrointestinal inflammation for this reason liver donations are typically post mortem ie from cadavers and live donors are very rare especially in the west please also note that simply matching the blood group does not necessarily make you an eligible donor liver weight steatotic index and serum parameters play a big role besides general health of the donor a putative donor has to go through at least a week of intensive tests before even being declared eligible for donation it is also misleading to say that the liver grows back it does not grow back rather the remaining parts of the liver increase in size to compensate for the loss of the surgically removed part the missing part never grows back i hope the best for op but felt that this was far too scant information for potential donors who are being asked to be involved in a very serious and non trivial surgical procedure and clinical process ,172,india

nashvortex,strictly speaking the act of cutting out certain frequencies is not anti aliasing it just a bandpass filter of course it is entirely possible that this filtering step is included in most anti aliasing algorithms from a signal processing perscpetive anti aliasing would involve some operation that attempts to reverse or minimize the effects of aliasing in audio your signal is everything upto 20 khz the fact that you use a sampling frequency higher than 40 khz would ensure that you have no aliasing at all for frequencies upto 20 khz so you already have a nice unaliased signal of course the problem is that you end up with some frequencies between 20 khz and 40 khz which as far as you are concerned are noise your bandpass filter is therefore strictly speaking a noise filtering step not anti aliasing this problem is more severe for audio because audio is eventually output through analog devices like speakers which will render the 20 40 khz noise and create distortion in the case of raster images this problem does not exist because the screen is incapable of rendering at higher resolutions necessitating anti aliasing in the first place for video frame rates higher than what the display is capable of creates a similar effect as you mention commonly called screen tearing this is fixed by exactly fixed by using vertical sync the exact equivalent of a bandpass filter which ensures that the frame rate never exceeds what the display is capable of showing again this is a kind of noise removal not anti aliasing ,1,explainlikeimfive
nashvortex,no are you assuming the word frequency to always mean temporal frequency this has been discussed elsewhere in the comment thread ,1,explainlikeimfive
nashvortex,a way to study the structure and information in language existed for a long time that used the frequency of words and letters their correlations with each other the relative positions etc to try and relate these features to the meaning of the written words thus was called statistical linguistics computational linguistics is basically statistical linguistics but immensely amplified due to the ability of computers to do a lot of math very fast on very large sets of data to find complex correlations patterns and so on the goal is to have a better shot at deriving the meaning a simple example you see a sentence in the language you do not know but you count how many kinds of letters occur you see that there are some occurrences of that matches a germanic language then you see that the average word word length is 10 letters hmm that matches german with a high probability there also some words starting with capital letters those must be nouns the words in between them must be other kinds of those there are some 2 letter words those are likely to be prepositions and so on ,2,explainlikeimfive

nashvortex,dimensions spatial or temporal or otherwise are irrelevant to the idea of aliasing https en m wikipedia org wiki aliasing as others have pointed out you are talking about a very specific aliasing problem with regards to digital raster images it is ironic that some people here explain even this issue as existing because pixels are square i ask them would rectangular hexagonal or circular pixels not have aliasing of course they would aliasing in raster images occurs because pixels have a finite and discrete size thus making it impossible to render spatial signal variations smaller than pixel theoretically for perfectly avoiding any kind of aliasing you would need an infinite number of infinitessimally small pixels it has nothing to do with the shape of the pixel it has to do with size ,17,explainlikeimfive
nashvortex,apparently reddit is full of gamers who tell you nothing of the core concept so let start with what aliasing is let say your checking to see how often a light blinks so you decide you are going to check it every minute to see if it on you start the timer and you see that the light is on at the minute mark aha you say it blinks every minute but wait what if it was blinking every 30 seconds and because you were checking every minute you only saw every second blink and missed the 30th second blink event so you say fine i will check every 30 seconds now and yet the question can be asked what it was blinking every 15 seconds and you only saw every second and forth blink event essentially you were seeing blinks that were partly determined by your speed of checking for them you saw 1 when there could have been 2 4 6 8 etc blinks in that minute there is a pattern here which i wo not get you but this inaccuracy that occurred is called aliasing this goes on and on and you eventually reach a conclusion you can only be absolutely sure of the frequency of something if you check it at least twice as fast as that frequency this is called the shannon nyquist sampling theorem anti aliasing is basically the opposite of this and depending on how complicated the setup of frequencies is methods to anti alias also change the fundamental method of anti aliasing is simply check the frequency more often in time or space and hope that you are at least twice as fast as the actual frequency this is called supersampling you could do something more complicated for example you could check every 10 seconds and also every 15 seconds this means you will be able to see blinks if they occur at some point for all multiples of 10 and 15 seconds that pretty good by checking at 2 different speeds you have sort of reduced the need to go faster for one frequency this is called multisampling now in a computer for graphics aliasing occurs because pixels are processed at a certain frequency change at another and are displayed at still another frequency this creates the jarring because of aliasing you are not getting all processor produced pixels displayed because you screen refresh is to slow for example you have to use extra tricks in the gpu to makes sure the image does not get jarred this is anti aliasing performed by more complicated algorithms of the same basic steps above edit a lot people seem to be assuming that the word frequency only refers to temporal frequency it does not your assumption is flawed before the this is wrong comment i recommend you read up on fourier analysis https www cs auckland ac nz courses compsci773s1c lectures imageprocessing html topic1 htm and http homepages inf ed ac uk rbf hipr2 fourier htm these links are definitely not for 5 year olds but are suitable for the poorly informed tunnel visioned teenagers who are whining below ,126,explainlikeimfive

nashvortex,which book is this it is sort of right though since many reactions are reversible you may not know the source in the reverse direction a phosphorylase catalyses a pi ap low energy bond a kinase catalyses a ntp ap ndp high energy bond a ndp pi take a look at the reaction of succinyl coa syntehtase https en wikipedia org wiki succinyl coenzyme a synthetase it very clearly a kinase i think the problem here is that the enzyme eventually the energy stored in the succinate coa bond to create a ntp from ndp and pi so the phosphate forms a high energy bond bond energy is the easiest way to distinguish kinase versus phosphorylase seen in reverse you see that it matches the kinase reaction ,1,Biochemistry
nashvortex,wait a minute are you referring to succinyl coa synthetase a kinase is an enzyme that deals with high energy phosphate bonds as in atp a phosphorylase usually involves inorganic phosphate with low energy bonds eg like glycogen phosphorylase ,1,Biochemistry

nashvortex,i will try to answer your questions one by one your questions are very relevant but each one of them is sort of a lecture course in itself but how do those newly synthesized proteins do anything i mean how do the go anywhere do the cell just synthesize enough that through osmosis eventually the chemical reaction that needed to take place will largely yes the key concept to understand here called diffusion diffusion is the natural tendency of molecules to spread out evenly in a liquid medium think ink in water this is called entropic distribution as such all protein molecules are constantly moving about due to their intrinsic thermal energy at room temperature the number of molecules that are crammed into a single cell is astoundingly high with typical proteins existing in micromolar concentrations in a 1 2 picolitres of volume this ensures that proteins will largely interact with each other the scenario is often described in biology textbooks as molecular crowding remember that this kind of interaction is non specific there are some other factors that increase the chance that proteins will interact specifically i will list 3 major ones 1 targeting proteins often have localization signals features that cause them to be either a actively transported via vesicular transport to specific locations eg secreted proteins transported to cell membrane b actively sequestered in particular cellular compartments eg ran system for nuclear localization 2 specific binding complex formation many proteins that need to work together have specific binding sites for each other allowing them to fit together like lego blocks and form complexes these complexes are much more stable and remove the dependence on a random diffusional encounter for a reaction to proceed eg ribosomes proteosomes etc 3 scaffolds scaffolds are proteins whose sole job it to interact with other proteins many proteins that need to interact with each other to execute a function do not interact directly with each other but rather bind a scaffold protein essentially a scaffold protein forces a complex to form and again increases the chance that the required proteins end up in close proximity to each other does it actually look like this yes and no the video comes very close to the real thing except that for reasons of clarity it shows things happening one after another it also shows proteins moving in a more or less directed manner instead think of everything in the video happening all at once with a lot of random movement that closer to the real picture what actually is the golgi apparatus i know it the cellular ups but where is it sending things and how does it do that the golgi apparatus is partly a delivery sorting centre and partly a modification centre there are proteins in the golgi apparatus that recognise and bind the localization signals on other proteins thereby tethering them there proteins are then tagged along to various vesicles it might be over the top for now but take a look here to get an idea of how it works https www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc1805082 how do proteins know when to do things or is it more of their destroyed whenever they are not needed granted that begs the question how does the cell know when to get rid of them and what gets rid of the proteins that get rid of the original ones now you are broaching the topic of information processing in the cell the shallow answer is that the activity of proteins can be regulated by 1 making them or stop degrading them only when you need them and vice versa this is called genetic or transcriptional regulation 2 by modifying them chemically phosphorylation ubiquitnylation etc 3 by making their activity dependent on another protein molecule that must bind them what happens to all the other organelles during mitosis it depends on the organelle the nucleus is completely dismantled and remade in the daughter cells the golgi and er are broken up into small vesicles that are distributed and reassembled in daughter cells the mitochondria are also distributed where does everything come from like animals go from a signal cell to things in just a few months how do the cells know what to turn into i was reading about the sonic hedgehog protein and how that makes limbs develop and apoptosis gives you your fingers but how does the cell know how to do these things in those specific places if you think deeply the way to identify directions is asymmetry if two directions are symmetrically identical you cannot tell which is which indeed you have to reason to distinguish them for example east and west are identifiable because the sun rises in the east and sets in the west at sunrise and sunset the sky in these two directions is asymmetrical in biology there are many many things that create this symmetry breaking for example in embryology the stage of development called a morula is completely symmetrical but it in the uterus and naturally once side of the ball touches the uterus wall the other faces the uterine fluid the side that touches the wall becomes the placenta because it gets signals from the uterus cells and the side that faces fluid becomes the embryo the moment you have this you can start establishing gradients the placenta cells start producing a particular protien which diffuses to the other cells and forms a concentration gradient high on the placental side because it is produced there and low on the embryo side cause it leaking it all to the large volume of uterine fluid now instantly you notice that depending on the concentration of this protein that a cell experiences it becomes aware of its location within the embryo this is the kind of thing that goes on all the time throughout embryonic development like with sonc hedgehog there are many many such proteins they were initially discovered in studies on fruit flies drosophila sonic hedgehog is famous because it was discovered in fruit flies and then found to exist in mammalian cells as well https en wikipedia org wiki bicoid gene to end this long comment most of the questions you ask are discussed in college level textbooks of biophysics cell biology

nashvortex,so what you have done is called a phenomenological fit this is when you use a function in your case a quadratic because it fits the data well this is sometimes useful but a phenomenological fit does not give you any idea of the underlying mechanisms that explain the data there is no physical theory behind the mathematical operation other pitfalls of this kind of fitting are that there is no guarantee that the fit is valid for data points that do not correspond to the observed ones in other words no predictive power so let take a look at why your quadratic fits the data so well a quadratic equation is one of the form ax bx c 0 there is another way to define a quadratic the derivative of this equation with respect to t is d dt ax bx c ax b the derivative still depends on x the derivative is the slope of a function at a given point it is the rate at which x changes for a quadratic equation this means that the higher the value of x at a given point the higher the slope and the higher the next value of x this gives you the upward curving graph of a quadratic in your data set x is simply the number of infections and t is the time so your quadratic fit is telling you the more the number of infections in one year the higher is the rate of new infections and you will have even more infections the following year in other words it simply saying that mrsa is contagious it tends to spread the more infected people are running about the more infections that is going to generate the next years depending on whether you are a high school student or a scientist this is either trivial or interesting edit so now that i am off the bus i wanted to explain this further what you have here obviously is an example of quadratic growth https en wikipedia org wiki quadratic growth in the number of infections but quadratic growth is a special case of exponential growth https en wikipedia org wiki exponential growth if you fit a quadratic equation you are really fitting it by finding out two parameters a and b from ax bx c while c is simply the minimum value what is the physical meaning of a and b this is hard to define instead in most cases it is more meaningful to fit a general exponential function to this graph that is we will not assume that the growth is quadratic but could be anything from linear to cubic to quadratic etc in other words we will not assume that the new number of infections depends on necessarily the square of existing infections 2 but could depend on any value of the exponent so instead we will say x c a e x c t where c is the minimum value a is the offset and t is time constant here what your data looks like fitted to that exponential function http i cubeupload com zkuvxr png you can see that the r square value is 0 997 even better than your quadratic fit but there is more see the value of t1 this is the time constant of an exponential process the time constant is related to the half life of a process by a simply relation t t ln 2 this means that for t1 7 76 years the t 5 38 years the t is the doubling time of the number of infections this allows you to make a statement as follows the number of mrsa infections increases exponentially with the number of infections doubling every 5 38 years thanks for the interesting discussion ,3,biology

nashvortex,heart beats originate from nerve cells we will leave out where the nerve cells are nerve cells fire by creating what is called an action potential to understand the action potential you must understand that all cells have something called the membrane potential the membrane potential is an electrical potential difference between the extracellular and intracellular sides of a membrane this is typically 60mv for nerve cells this voltage is created mainly because the concentration of na ions outside the cell is higher than what it normally should be at equilibrium as dictated by the permeability of na ions ditto for k ions except their concentration is higher inside the cell the combined effect is to produce a net negative voltage of 60mv think of it as an effective charge separation across a membrane which would create the voltage the membrane is polarised it is calculated by the nernst equation of course this needs energy to maintain and that is done by a protein called the na k atpase which uses the energy of atp to continuously keep na out and k inside the cell now the action potential is a deploraization of the membrane it is largely produced because the sodium is allowed to go in the cell for a short moment essentially short circuiting the voltage of the membrane potential sodium is allowed to flow in along its concenration gradient by opening proteins called sodium channels that the sodium influx that how the membrane voltage goes from 60mv to 20mv great that the action potential now we need to get it back to 60mv right how do you do that well you let our maintenance pump the na k atpase pump the sodium out of the cell again but this is slowly hardly possible in the few milliseconds of the action potential so the cell does another thing it opens the k channels and let the k out again along their concentration gradient this brings the voltage down to 30mv or so the rest is taken care off by the slow na k pump thus in an action potential na causes the voltage to rise and k causes the voltage to decrease imagine what happens if there is too much na in the blood outside the cell well maybe you get a much higher peak cause the voltage would rise higher than the usual 20mv no biggie you will still activate everything that needs to be triggered by the high voltage like heart muscles what happens if there is too much k in the blood again outside the cell the peak of the action potential would never come down because the k inside the cell cannot get out since it would now have to travel against it concentration gradient the membrane stays depolarised for longer than it should when the membrane is always depolarised in nerves and muscles that called a neuromuscular spasm in the heart little spasms because of these abnormal long depolarisations cause well you know what so it is absolutely critical that k in the blood remain a certain quantity less than that in the cell for sodium it is critical that it remain a certain quantity higher than the cell which is already is anyway that why you have to monitor k any fluctuations of it inside or outside will change the action potential and give people a heart attack it the same with sodium too but of much lesser severity calcium is a minor player in all this not otherwise though it has a role in synaptic transmission but does not have a large effect on membrane potential per se edit i just saw the diagram you posted and realise that the precise values mentioned there are different this is probably because long long ago i read this for peripheral neurons there are differences between different neuronal types for the precise values the idea is the same however edit 2 if you are looking to learn this in proper detail you need a molecular cell biology book here are links to the famous two hosted on ncbi for free legal lodish https www ncbi nlm nih gov books nbk21668 alberts https www ncbi nlm nih gov books nbk26910 ,7,StudentNurse

nashvortex, lieven anatol 2011 pakistan a hard country new york publicaffairs p 128 isbn 978 1 61039 023 1 ahl e hadith a branch of the international salafi tradition heavily influenced by wahabism salafism politics and the puritanical the economist 27 june 2015 i hope those references suffice in general salafism wahabism dominates in india bangladesh organizations the middle east north africa pakistan and afghanistan this is pretty much the entire muslim world with the exception of iran malaysia and indonesia ,2,india
nashvortex,irrespective of the ratio of wahabis to moderates which is certainly not 1 1000 dominance is not necessarily due to a demographic majority 300 million americans have a much larger impact on the world and humanity than 1 2 billion africans please the geopolitics of the us sa relationship is not the point of this discussion ,6,india
nashvortex,no i am not as mentioned the dominant discourse of islam is the salafist wahabist version of it just like the dominant discourse of nazism was hitler version of it no matter whether the average german believed it also the nazis were more of a pseudo scientific group when it came to ideology i am not selecting an extremist interpretation i am saying the substantial power and influence of the middle east has made the extremist interpretation the most dominant one in the muslim world they have selected it for all muslims ,7,india
nashvortex,who defines true islam you or the salafists or the wahabists ,4,india
nashvortex, by that logic should not hinduism by default by associated with caste system and we be suspicious of every hindu because how much of the values he shares with the caste doctrine yes absolutely in fact most hindu are still carrying the burden of casteism and it is unfortunately reinforced by centuries of cultural and genetic segragation you would be very justified to suspect that a hindu may practice caste based discrimination heck hindus themselves often suspect other hindus of a different caste to do the same ,12,india
nashvortex, point is you can criticize islam it an idea religion but why you want drag every single muslims into that an ideology is meaningless unless there are adherents to that ideology islam in the quran would be inconsequential if it were not for the people muslims who adopt it into their lifestyle and thus make it part of the human condition the question is what is the dominant narrative of this ideology and whether the people who adopt it actually align themselves with this ideology this is not specific to islam but ask yourself if you or your family really adhere to every word of the quran if not then by definition you are not muslim what are you achieving then by calling yourself muslim besides unnecessary association with an extremists who claim to really adhere to every word of the quran i mean my entire family neighborhood friends it all muslims and you think we should we all just stop being muslims because terrorists are muslims you think that will stop terrorism in the middle east yes just like in my example we are all nationalists and our country follows socialist principles but we do not call ourselves nazi the point was that the word muslim today comes with negative connotations that people like you and your family do not deserve and no it will not stop terrorism in the middle east but it will make abundantly clear that you and your family are not associated with it neither do you support it it will remove the burden of suspicion from you which as i stated is natural given the narrative of islam today ,4,india
nashvortex, muslims nazis this is a little much do not you think let see comparing salafist wahabist islam to nazism 1 an ideologically assumed superiority and hatred towards those who do not follow said ideology check 2 use of violence considered justified against those who do not adhere to said ideology check 3 military expansionism encouraged with the stated ambition of creating an ideologically rooted state rule over the entire world check 4 critical thinking considered anathema check 5 encouragement of retrograde practices that are derived from authoritarian diktats rather than rational thinking check umm no it is not a bit much it a rather prudent analogy so you are fine with the religious nut jobs hijacking the religion why should not the good guy muslims be allowed to retake their religion from the crazies clearly their numbers are vastly more than the crazy ones i have no problem with that they just are not succeeding at it for the last 25 years ,19,india
nashvortex,the problem is that according some people interpretation you are not muslim the islam of the book salafism wahabism does not accept criticism criticism is mukkafir the islam of the book demands complete surrender to the word of the prophet as recorded in the book as a person who even tolerates hearing anything critical of the prophet or islam you are a mushrikeen takfir and not a mussalman according to this interpretation now you may argue that it is simply their opinion however it becomes clear that this is the dominant interpretation of islam in the public discourse of the middle east and the middle east is the center of islam due to its history the two mosques and the immense amount of wealth it puts behind the propagation of their version of islam perhaps it is in the interest of moderate muslims to stop calling themselves that at this point it is akin to calling yourself nazi just because you have some nationalistic and socialistic beliefs one must realize that nazi has only negative connotations in the zeitgeist of the 20th 21st century and the world muslim is turning into something similar there is no point saying i am a nazi oh but i do not hate jews and i also do not think that the aryan race is a master race also i do not think that measuring people skulls gives me any idea of their genetic purity etc etc if one appears to share belief in a doctrine that terrorists also claim as their reason for their acts suspicion is natural it is but logical that people will question how many of the values of what extremity do you really share with these people moderate muslims need to do what the protestants did they split from the catholics when being a catholic meant condoning the inquisitions they stopped calling themselves catholic ,59,india

nashvortex,i am not a defence analyst however this might be an indication that india finally has disregarded the possibility of war with pakistan the main reason india has won all wars with pakistan is the fact that india could turtle for many more days as a country with greater economic resources and larger military india had far more staying power than pakistan during the war all india had to do was keep pakistan engaged for more than a week after that the indian war machine would still be formidable while the pakistani side would be resource starved india greatest threat today is china and we cannot compete with them in terms of resources or staying power india will now depend on the superiority of its war infrastructure and aim for a quick result in case of a conflict with china in some ways india is in pakistan position now if we get embroiled into a long drawn out war with china we would lose anyway so it makes more strategic sense to reduce war readiness to the first 10 days where india would aim to deliver a massive effective punch quickly ,19,india

nashvortex,perhaps the beginning is to realise that there are no sides just consequences of the set of assumptions people have that lead to certain opinions it is immaterial for the purpose of having an opinion whether the underlying assumption is congruent with reality for this reason the focus must not be on different opinions but rather on differing assumptions most racists start with the assumption of superiority in some form moral intellectual or divined there is a lot of argument about how that is morally wrong which is actually the weakest argument since morality is subjective instead one must must work on objectively demonstrating flawed assumptions i suspect that the problem is that objectivity often confirms racist ideas for example it is statistically more probable that a scientist will win a nobel prize if they are jewish thus it is objectively favourable for a university to prefer a jewish scientist to be on their payroll is this zionist racism the crux here is that humans like in everything else in nature are not equal we insist that they be treated equivalently for certain basic fundamental rights for the greater happiness of the species this is itself a hypothesis that seems to be in vogue since the renaissance nonetheless only time will tell if it is an effective method if it is not the laws of nature will restore the equilibrium to whatever degree of freedom and oppression are in balance ,1,pics

nashvortex,if hydrophobic substances face water molecules hydrogen bonding between water molecules is reduced this is the entropic cost hence water intense desire to form hydrogen bonds drives hydrophobic molecules into configurations that hide the hydrophobic part and expose the more polar part that water can interact with so you see phospholipids in bilayers are a favourable arrangement and thus remain in water triglycerides is general do not have any configuration where water can be kept happy and the loss of its hydrogen binding compensated as a result triglycerides tend to fall out of solution and separate from the water in clumps etc to answer your question yes a bilayer is more ordered that a random solution so of course it has a lower entropy but before you start imagining violations of the second law remember that it only applies to systems in a statistical sense where no additional energy is available ,2,Biochemistry
nashvortex,nope blend of spices is masala curry is a type of masala with curry leaves as the main ingredient ,9,germany

nashvortex,now that i have reached my destination here is a more complete answer 1 it is simply not true that plants do not absorb blue light here is the absorption spectrum of plant pigments http hyperphysics phy astr gsu edu hbase biology imgbio pigabs gif 2 the more accurate question is why is photosynthesis more efficient with red light the answer for this seems to be that blue light tends to get absorbed by a lot of molecules in cells everything from atp nadp proteins etc will absorb blue light blue light also scatters more easily that red light red light penetrates tissues better this is the basis for imaging in living tissues for something called 2 photon microscopy the more light gets absorbed by everything other than the photosystems the less efficient photosynthesis is this explains why photosynthesis is inefficient under blue light and more efficient under red light plants tend to use blue light more for sensing the amount of light rather than as a photosynthetic workhorse by the way the same applies for infra red light because it is strongly absorbed by water 3 this begs the final question why do not plants use green light this simply comes down to chemistry all living things are made of carbon and biomolecules including photosynthetic pigments have a high degree of c c double bonds c c double bonds due to their energy levels of electrons simply reflect green light thus out of the solar spectrum the red wavelengths even though being less energetic than blue or green light are still the best suited to harvest energy from light as far as a carbon based water filled living tissue is concerned note that when you are not a carbon based water filled living system like a solar cell blue light is the best http images pvmeas com products qe solar cell qe measurement si gaas a si mc si dssc png,1,biology

nashvortex,from a biologists perspective there is more to that there is something called sexual selection in part sexual preferences drive the production of offspring and thus the offspring that result tend to have similar sexual preferences an example is the peacocks flamboyant tail peahens prefer peacocks with large tails therefore the next generation of peacocks and peahens are born with the trait of having large tails and preferring large tails respectively this keeps repeating as a positive feedback until the peacocks end up with enormous tails of no functional use and peahens end up with a huge preference for those tails humans are also sexually dimorphic sexual selection has definitely occurred in humans leading to the female and male body stereotype human females are stereotypically smaller in height than males have less body hair higher pitched voice and hip curves and breasts human males are stereotypically broad shouldered with a larger height and deeper voice etc this is possibly a reason why men find a woman taller than them less feminine and therefore trigger the uncanny valley syndrome https en wikipedia org wiki uncanny valley ,27,IAmA

nashvortex,allergies lessen over time essentially the general way the immune system works is as follows any molecules present in the body when the immune cells are developing and maturing is considered normal and does not justify an immune reaction the hygiene hypothesis is that we live such clean and sterile lives in the modern world that our immune system is exposed to too few substances when it develops the result is that it panics easily when it sees something new however innocuous the new thing is now here is the issue everytime the immune system panics it creates a memory cell which remembers the substance it saw and panicked against these cells hang around for years but when they finally die your immune system has forgotten it and will treat any exposure to the same substance from that point as a new encounter so if you were not exposed to dogs or cats early in life your immune system panicked when it encountered dog or cat proteins for the first time and this manifested as an allergy you probably also ended up with memory cells that goaded your immune system into an attack in subsequent exposures over the years if you were continuously exposed to dogs and cats your immune system started understanding this is as harmless normal and stopped panicking because developing immune cells saw this dog cat substances too the memory cells from long ago have also died out and no more are being made because dogs and cats are normal for your immune system the result is that your allergies have progressively become less severe over the years this happens with all allergies in fact there is a lot of evidence that nut allergies are mainly a result of not being exposed to nuts which are normal human diet as an infant when the immune system is activating some material here so you do not have to take my word for it very relevant for you http onlinelibrary wiley com doi 10 1046 j 1365 2222 1999 00534 x full http www sciencedirect com science article pii s0091674910006883 http www sciencedirect com science article pii s0140673600028427 https www aaaai org conditions and treatments library at a glance prevention of allergies and asthma in children ,2,biology

nashvortex,now this is entirely speculative because the truth is that we have no confirmed explanation for why in 99 of the cases we are aware of the primer is always rna rather than dna 1 one expanation is that the part of the sequence representing the primer needs to be removed later as such a dna primer on a dna sequence is diffucult to distinguish and may lead to errors on the part of the depolymerase by overshooting the primer if the primer can be easily identified as the rna part it can be removed with an rnase much safer than introducing a dnaase into the mix 2 a second possibility is simply probability rna polymerases are much more common in a cell since they are required for gene expression of all the genes all the time by contrast a dna polymerase is needed only to do one job therefore by sheer probability an rna polymerase is always around to create the primer why bother to create a dna primase this is an unsatisfactory explanation because it does not explain why dna polymerases so exceedingly seem to avoid having a primase function 3 the third explanation is that this is a safety catch rna is much easier to degrade and thus false starts are more easily handled if the process of dna replication is split into 2 steps rather than the dna polymerase priming itself and running off another safety catch is probably that rna uses the u base while dna uses t base the t base is synthetized by an enzyme called thymidine synthetase is which is under notoriously tight control to prevent spurious dna replication there is not a lot of t base around normally under these conditions it is probably easier to prime with rna which can bemade using the much larger u base that said there is some evidence that archael primases have dual specificity and act as dna polymerases after self priming however even in those cases the primer is made of rna this makes explanation 1 more likely ,1,biology

nashvortex,co transport is a case where an energetically favorable transport is coupled to an energetically unfavorable transport to move molecules across membranes i will explain your example glucose will not easily move across the cell membrane but the cell wants glucose and also has a lot of glucose within it already so even if you have a simple passive transporter for glucose on the membrane there is not much glucose that will get in this is akin to opening your mouth air does not rush into your mouth because your mouth already has air in it to get extra air in your have to use energy in your lungs and suck the cells way of getting this energy is to create an ion gradient of na ions the na k atpase uses atp to pump na ions outside the cell lets ignore the k ions because they are not directly relevant to cotransport so what you have is a concentration gradient of na ions that is stored energy like a battery the na glucose symporter is a protein that will allow the na ions to flow back into the cell this will release energy however the protein is built such that na ions can only get in through this protein if and only if a glucose molecule is also attached to the protein on the outside the symporter couples na ion transport with glucose transport so what ends up happening is that because there is more energy available in the na ion gradient than is required to move glucose the glucose piggy backs on the na ion transport and moves inside the cell against its own concentration gradient cotransport ends up enriching glucose inside the cell other examples of cotransport are bile salt pumps in hepatocytes and pretty much the entire symporter family of proteins you can find a large list here https en wikipedia org wiki cotransporter wprov sfla1,27,biology

nashvortex,let set something straight first the greenhouse effect is a caused due to the fact that when light is absorbed by an object it becomes hotter and radiates the heat as infra red light this infra red light can be absorbed by other stuff which in turn becomes hotter so with respect to the earth atmosphere gases like c02 water vapour and methane can absorb infra red light and become hot but they do not absorb uv and visible light the earth being a relatively dark rock can absorb all kinds of uv and visible light when uv and visible light from the sun comes to the earth it passes through the atmosphere without being absorbed and hits the earth the earth absorbs it and becomes hot and radiates the heat as infra red light now as the infra red light tries to go away into space it gets absorbed by the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere making the atmosphere hot so essentially the heat is trapped in the earth atmosphere more and more light keeps coming from the sun gets converted to heat and trapped in the atmosphere this is the greenhouse effect so called because a similar thing happens with glass in greenhouses glass lets visible light in but does not allow infra red light to go out the greenhouse effect is not under debate what some people are making a controversy about is global warming namely if the greenhouse effect is powerful enough to actually cause the earth temperature to rise and if yes by how much and if human activities are increasing the level of the greenhouse effect the would ebate is not about if it happens the would ebate is about does it matter and if it does who is causing it to increase you should know that it has been made amply clear by scientists that human activities are causing global warming this simple statement is easy to understand for everyone except the us bible belt some asian countries who understand it is happening have said yes it happens but we do not care cause western countries created this mess and developed themselves at the cost of the environment now it our turn and you want to stop us they have a point since an individual american contribution to global warming is ever today nearly 20 times that of an average chinese or indian they are saying fix your shit first this is the controversy ,1,explainlikeimfive

nashvortex,i would suggest that you visit a shrink at a hospital they are usually more free with their time and can always ask you to wait around at the hospital they may refer you to other psychologists for monitoring of the treatment when you go to these other psychologists with a referral they know that you have been examined and diagnosed properly and you are likely to be taken more seriously this is unfortunately so because in india people who go to psychologists are either extreme obvious cases or people who are just unhappy but educated enough to have the resources to go to a shrink its hard for doctors to diagnose over one session let alone 10 min if a true clinical diagnosis is warranted now let me ask you this since 2 out of 3 psychologists have not diagnosed anxiety are you sure you have clinical anxiety or are you just unhappy it would seem the first 2 shrinks picked this up why did you not follow up psa barring life and death situations or clear diagnoses a doctor who is too eager to drug you or cut you up is unlikely to be a good doctor it is the doctors who show restraint when suggesting intervention that are the good ones ,2,india

nashvortex,that depends on a few things sometimes the endogenous microrna is just good enough to tone down the gene it targets by say 50 we might increase or decrease that as required by designing our own sirna with a better or worse match or we might increase that by changing the amount of microrna in the cell by adding test tube made identical sirna to the cell to sort of give the system more juice many genes have no matching endogenous mirna to control them they are controlled in other ways in this case we design a sirna that targets this gene and introduce an artificial level of control on it the main point of the rnai system is that it can reduce the production of protein from a gene through a complicated way by using a sequence matched small rna this small rna can be endogenous microrna or test tube made sirna it does not care which gene or where the small rna came from as long as the sequence matches so by adding the right kind of small rna with the right sequence we can hack the system to control whatever gene we want ,1,explainlikeimfive
nashvortex,again you are too far away to discern the movements the rain is falling continously like a river if you observe rain on a very windy day though you will see large portions move with the wind ,1,explainlikeimfive
nashvortex,endogenous microrna is targeted towards the control of specific genes in a cell this is part of normal biology rnai involves essentially hacking this endogenous system to control genes we want to this is not normal biology it is an intervention rnai is sequence specific the genes that are controlled depend on the match between the nucleotide sequence of the gene and the microrna so we make our own microrna in a test tube called small interfering rna sirna that matches the genes we need to control this is what is added to the cell ,1,explainlikeimfive

nashvortex,the current consensus is that race vs intelligence is only a correlation iq is estimated to be 75 nature and 25 nurture the general differences in the iq of races seems to within the 25 nurture effect the race intelligence correlation seems to be more a result of historical oppression and deprivation of what were considered inferior cultural races these effects have not yet ameliorated from the human population i do not know what studies show a strong correlation but here are some that explore genetic factors and come up with no correlation piffer d kirkegaard e 2014 the genetic correlation between educational attainment intracranial volume and iq is due to recent polygenic selection on general cognitive ability open behavioral genetics 1 35 rietveld c et al 2013 gwas of 126 559 individuals identifies genetic variants associated with educational attainment science 340 1467 1471 doi 10 1126 science 1235488 besides this one should consider that such studies show an average and do not necessarily predict what individual ability with good confidence secondly these tests use a relatively narrow definition of ability intelligence i would speculate that what we are seeing is neurodiversity rather then differences in overall ability mistaking neurodiverisity for difference in intelligence is the exact same mistake that was made in the past with autism spectrum individuals it would be prudent not to repeat the same mistake on a much larger scale anymore ,1,explainlikeimfive

nashvortex,not necessarily always true it is a case that the medicine targets a particular aspect of biochemistry that is distinct and happens to be correlated with the cultural race characteristics such as skin color if you use some other medication you will end up with a completely different grouping of individuals that is not correlated with skin color genetics or more precisely genomics has shown that there are innumerably more groupings schemes that are not correlated with skin color than those that are thus the argument is against the anthropological definition of race not against the fact that there are groups of humans if one chooses a specific characteristic ,1,explainlikeimfive
nashvortex,you can classify people into innumerable groups depending on where you draw the threshold in genetic clustering on on hand is the lowest threshold where all humans fall into one group which we call species on the other extreme is another threshold where every human alive is their own group which we call individuals there is no clustering threshold that classifies people according to the culturally defined 4 races formally this is the known as the difficulty of discretizing what is essentially a continuous variable as any mathematician knows this is typically an approximation and often a bad one further the issue is not that people are different but rather whether any valid generalizations about ability or competency can be made using the 4 race classification the answer is a resounding no this is why the anthropological race is a foundation less idea yet discrimatory generalization is exactly what it has been used for in human history ,3,explainlikeimfive
nashvortex,the question is about how you define race skin color hair color texture and facial features are what are used to commonly identify race culturally these are maximally 20 of the 20000 genes that define a human yet they have been used to draw inferences about physical and intellectual ability so the idea of race is a bit like grouping vehicles on the basis of their color hubcaps and type of headlights this is unlikely to tell you anything common about the type or performance of the vehicles you may be able to draw some obscure correlations like for example red vehicles with square headlights in italy tend to be very fast because they are ferraris but such a thing would immediately become invalid the moment you step out of italy because red vehicles with square headlights in the us tend to be fire engine trucks besides the social problems associated with the idea of grouping people the culturally defined race is not a useful way of grouping people even when it is a good thing scientific and medical reasons this is why anthropologists reject the idea of races because in reality people exist in multiple combinations of the variants of 20000 genes and while some groups may exist they are not in anyway related to the cultural idea of 4 races ,156,explainlikeimfive

nashvortex,you repeatedly ask for technical specifications when the main problem is not technical the main problem with tejas is not that it is a inferior air craft in its class the problem is that it is outclassed you keep asking how a maruti suzuki could be better compared to a hyundai when i am saying that the competition has a porsche the issue is with the tejas project not the aircraft ,1,india
nashvortex,none of what i said in the original comment is factually wrong it is true that kaveri was supposed to be used for tejas and the program was a failure this makes tejas not completely indigenous it is also true that tejas simply by being a 4 generation fighter is outclassed by major air forces who are now already inducting 5th generation fighters it is true that the tejas is not all it is being hyped to be but the tejas induction also calls for deep introspection on the complex and daunting challenges that loom ahead for india s aeronautics sector despite tejas taking 33 long years to materialise it is still not ready for prime time the key strategic issue is that progressive phase out of mig 21 iaf s workhorse has led to the nettlesome conundrum of its sanctioned combat aircraft strength drawing down from 40 squadrons to a worrisome 33 today this is against the government mandated 42 combat squadrons to face the extant two front china pakistan collusive air threat severe delays in the tejas project have exacerbated iaf s looming crisis of numbers and dwindling combat worthiness this was exemplified by 45 squadron receiving only two series production aircraft against iaf s order of 20 tejas each in 2007 and 2010 as part of its planned six tejas squadrons http www thequint com opinion 2016 07 01 celebration over lca tejas calls for reforming defence sector too mig 21 indian air force hindustan aeronautics ltd http www thequint com india 2016 03 18 indias combat air power worrisome deficiencies not my words but those of kapil kak whose bio i think you wo not question http www hscentre org wp content uploads 2014 06 kk bio pdf more independent sources http www defense aerospace com articles view feature 5 163429 how india tejas and china xiaolong fighters compare html other have gone as far as to say but the problem with india s hal tejas is that it is one of the single worst fighter projects that has ever been conceived of in the history of aviation even as it enters service the aircraft is obsolete and is probably inferior in many respects to the jf 17 the jet has 57 known deficiencies and will probably get a lot of indian pilots killed if any type of conflict were ever to break out http nationalinterest org blog the buzz crash landing the slow painful death indias air force 14149 dave majumdar is the defense editor of the national interest and then there are the apologists is indian tejas i fighter a failure or a success both if we go by the indian air force specification tejas fails but if we go by the level of technology mastery india has achieved the aircraft is a success the iaf rejection of the tejas on grounds of not meeting requirements is a red herring invalid and irrelevant http www dailyo in politics tejas i lca iaf the hunter mig 21 rafale fighter aircrafts defence budget 2016 armed forces story 1 9604 html this one maybe biased http www dawn com news 1211500 but is worth noting and this one is the iaf succumbing to pressure and launching a pr salvage operation to say oh we did not really say anything bad about tejas http english mathrubhumi com news india tejas not singled out during post iron fist briefing iaf english news 1 947890 as for your specific question to me what would i want from tejas i want it to be developed and ready in 2001 i want 20 squadrons of it already in the air force with pilots who accumulated 1000 hours on the jet that ship has long sailed ,1,india
nashvortex,it is not hatred everyone agrees that a state of the art indigenous fighter would be a massive asset the point is that tejas is not that fighter mainly because it is not state of the art as a combat aircraft of 2016 2040 you must have seen from the downvotes on my original comment that in fact what i have stated is the unpopular opinion most people love the tejas there is no hate for it fortunately the people on reddit aee not influencing tactical and strategic decisions for the iaf nor is the true assessment of the capability of a fighter like most things that matter dependent on the democratic popularity or unpopularity for example you saying it is combat capable does not make it so you and i may wish it was but it is not i am happy just to know that the people whose opinion matters the experts at directorate of operations iaf and ntri know what tejas will or will not deliver i provided some facts of the matter as i see them and see no reason to convince anyone here i am happy to know that those who will take these decisions are in agreement ,1,india

nashvortex,however it is not technically the government job to worry about non tax payers which farmers in india are you can say that making sure farmers are well off is a good idea in the long run but economic decisions are often driven by short term goals a tractor is not automatically a capital asset it depends on the use case heavily for example you can buy a cargo ship and have it delivered to your farm a cargo ship is a capital asset you say but not in your hands is what the bank argues may be it is in the hands of say merck who has shipping contracts and port services and who can use it to generate profit indian farmers do not tend to do that with tractors this is because of 2 reasons 1 tractors only work economically on a certain scale of farming 2 tractors do not control the monsoon ,1,india

nashvortex,all you say is correct except that exactly how it not done because of the problem of assigning triangulating points over the distances comparable to the universe ,1,explainlikeimfive
nashvortex,the basic idea is that that the distance between 2 points depends on the curvature of the space between them imagine two points connected by path if the path is curved it would be necessarily longer than if the path was a simple straight line connecting the two points so essentially you can measure the curvature of the path if you know the actual travel distance on the path versus the straight line distance between the 2 points we can measure this by using something that has a defined speed to travel along this path how long it takes to get from point a to b with its fixed speed tells you the distance comparing this measured distance with the straight line distance between the two points you would know the curvature this is the basic idea we use to measure curvature of space the idea above is extended to 3 dimensions and the object with a fixed speed is light which travels at a precise unchanging speed no matter what according to relativity from such measurements we have determined that on the scales of the observable universe the universe is mostly flat the observable universe for us is the extent of the universe that we can catch in the wmap experiment the mostly comes exactly because we do not know anything about the unobservable uinverse so it is possible that the space is slightly curved which can only be measurable at distances larger than the observable universe however for all practical purposes on anything we can measure space time seems to be essentially flat note that we are talking of a the global curvature over distances comparable to the observable universe we know that space time is curved locally as any mass will curve the space time around it a k a gravity what is meant by the statement is the besides the local dips and bumps there is no general global curvature to space time as far as we can tell over the distance of the observable universe ,1,explainlikeimfive

nashvortex,yes in fact it would mean that it recognizes a linear epitope on the surface of the protein molecule do not be distracted by the monoclonal or polyclonal thing a monoclonal antibody is derived from a clonal progeny of a single b cell as a result it is a single type of igg same protein sequence for all igg molecules thus it either binds a linear epitope or it does not if it does not there is no hope of it working on sds page similarly it either binds a protein surface epitope or it does not if it does not it wo not work in ihc polyclonal antibodies are derived from multiple b cell populations as a result they are a mixture of different iggs targeting the same antigen it is much more likely that this set contains some iggs that bind linear epitopes and some that bind surface epitopes thus a polyclonal antibody is much more likely to work on both sds page and ihc it is also somewhat easier to produce since it is essentially only purified antisera from an animal that was immunized with the antigen of interest monoclonal antibodies are produced by isolating individual b plasma cells and then fusing them with a myeloma cell to create a hybridoma cell line which produces the required igg clearly every time you immunize an animal the specific complement of iggs it generates will be different thus polyclonal antibodies have higher batch to batch variance hybridoma cell lines remain the same so the monoclonal igg is always the same ,3,Biochemistry

nashvortex,gold for incorrect information good on you mate molecualr cell biologist here so let correct the facts first 1 humans do have telomerase in fact pretty much every eukaryote does here is the database entry on uniprot for human telomerase http www uniprot org uniprot o14746 2 telomerase expression is a contribution to cellular ageing specifically the hayflick limit the number of times a cell can divide before it becomes senescent there is eveidence that increased telomerase levels actually do reverse the effects of ageing however there is no evidence that lack of telomerase is what causes normal ageing the difference is important the ageing of an entire organism is a different matter altogether specifically since cells grow exponentially even a modest of number of stem cells in an organism can in theory regenerate the entire organism multiple times ageing organisms have more to do with evolutionary pressures on the lifespan of an organism ie many organisms can clearly survive for much longer than their observed lifespans but for some evolutionary reasons such as maintaining a species population to not over grow the ecosystem organism lifespans are genetically metabolically restricted this is why biologists are not sure if extending human lifespan is going to be such a good idea on the species level http www nature com ncomms 2014 140408 ncomms4563 full ncomms4563 html ,1,pics

nashvortex,yes but how do you confirm that he has really lost a passport and is not applying for a second one just in case how do the cops know he is not trying to create a passport with fake information i sincerely believe that you have a genuine case but the cops have to verify one of the methods to verify that is to verify that the address supplied is correct in the absence of documentary evidence like bills or a home owners renters agreement is to use witnesses now what is the cop supposed to do if the witnesses who reside at the provided address claim that he does not stay there address verification is a common practice for all passport issuance across the world in fact it seems your husband made a mistake by providing his parents address he should have given the address of his aunt because she is presumably not hostile and would verify that he lives in her house he must have a permanent address somewhere right in the us then he can provide the american embassy with all his photocopies and ask for temporary passage papers and then reapply for a indian passport at the indian embassy in the us ,2,india
nashvortex,do you have a any valid document that attests to the fact that you are married if not you have a very long way to go you have to prove to a judge or at least a marriage registrar that you are indeed married rest assured that it will not be impossible for you husband to get a new passport he will get it for sure just the number of hoops is larger do you have photocopies of his green card and relevant id numbers as you should this will certainly make things simpler in the american embassy the indian passport system is not the problem here it is working as designed to prevent fake passport applications his family sucks that all ,5,india

nashvortex,what i am saying is that irrespective of whether a crime occurred changing and inconsistent testimonies from the accuser are legal grounds for dismissal of a case in every system of law based on the english common law so indeed it is possible and well within judicial purview that the court will not take her seriously and dismiss the case without further investogation because she has given contradictory testimonies at different times do you get it now i am not discussing whether she is lying or whether the guy is guilty i am not assuming anything you said either i am saying that the fact that she gave different testimonies is enough to invoke suspicions of dubious claims in the court of law and consequently get her case thrown out this is specifically against your assumption that she would be taken seriously on rape allegations despite having said in 2011 that she was not raped ,1,Music

nashvortex,as i said higher speeds are available but they are not affordable which explains why you got it under a promotional scheme i am not sure what your point is certainly it is not that bsnl has oodles of idle bandwidth they are not selling it is available for a price because even a simple search will reveal that india simply does not have the undersea cabling to support multiple mbps connections for every indian online ,1,india
nashvortex,higher speeds were and are always available they just are not affordable as i mentioned elsewhere india has invested the bandwidth it has in increasing penetration rather than in increasing speeds more connections rather than more bandwidth per connection this makes complete sense in a country where most did not have access to any internet ,1,india
nashvortex,firstly this is how internet speeds have grown for the entire world https www nngroup com articles law of bandwidth clearly we are where the world was in 2008 2010 in terms of speed at the same time internet penetration in india has increased from 0 1 in 1998 to about 30 in 2015 so it is plain to see that india has invested the bandwidth in penetration rather than speed http www internetworldstats com asia in htm ,1,india
nashvortex,the definition of what trai considers broadband is only relevant to marketing tactics of isps the actual internet speeds available to people have undoubtedly grown over the years india transitioned from dial up to dsl and cable for fixed networks and from gprs to edge to 2g and finally 3g since the 90s we are only behind the curve since europe got lte 4 years ago when we were rolling out 3g ,3,india
nashvortex,this is an optimization problem india is behind the curve when it comes to bandwidth and is trying to build infrastructure to increase it however internet infrastructure progresses every few years to different modalities and protocols the question is should we invest huge amounts of money now and catch up to current standards for minimal gain only to fall behind the curve in the next 5 years when new modalities become standard or should we follow a policy of slow incremental upgrades thereby utilizing resources over time to implement newer and newer tech india has in my opinion wisely chosen the second option it sucks for the high end users but by and large it is better for the country as a whole ,10,india
