Raiguard,it encourages teamwork i have had several teammates who were completely incompetent or inconsiderate of me so i would receive a lot of friendly fire however there were a few times where i was actually able to communicate with my teammate through our strategies and we ended up pulling off a really impressive combo right at the end to kill both of the other team simultaneously i wish i remembered his name would have friended him immediately ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i went from confused to triggered to laughing all in two seconds have an upvote ,2,NintendoSwitch

Raiguard,think about it 99 of the people who will use voice chat will be playing on their own switches pro gamers they could limit bluetooth headset functionality to when there only one player on the console that way there a maximum of three bluetooth connections plus the online connection ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,ah so this is why my vram usage increased by a gigabyte d,1,factorio
Raiguard,we should have a bot for this ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,this is exactly what i have been thinking before the splatoon headset was announced i assumed that it would work by having the console do the actual work of voice chat and lobbies while the text chat play appointments and control of the lobbies and voice chat would be done through the app this could also be utilized to send the game audio and voice chat to your phone via bluetooth so you could use a headset in docked mode without an unsightly cable ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,this is so fucking stupid ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,eh nothing really you asked for feedback two way trains cut out the need for loops and therefore make it easier to stack stations next to each other it not necessary it just what i would do ,2,factorio
Raiguard,i would recommend switching to using two way trains with engines on both ends this will greatly simplify your rail network eliminating the need for all those loops ,3,factorio
Raiguard,what client is that is it some variant of steam ,3,factorio
Raiguard,i just like to have options maybe i will write a mod and my problem is not a lack of robots i have a circuit network that automatically refills robots when demand outstrips supply and i have a ridiculous robot making setup that produces two robots a second once again there are just ideas ,1,factorio

Raiguard,a belt can only transport so many items in a second if you have a lot of furnaces outputting to a single belt line you may find that the ones at the front stop smelting because the belt they are supposed to output to is full this is actually what you want it acts as a buffer for when your factory begins to use tons of iron at once ,1,factorio
Raiguard,we have gotta have something to do during church d,2,dataisbeautiful
Raiguard,yeah simply adding an additional input line fixed it thanks rip coal powered steam forever ,2,factorio

Raiguard,i have been playing for two weeks on my 6th factory i kept restarting as i rapidly kept discovering ways to do things better now i am not going to restart again until i at least launch a rocket and even then i think instead of restarting i am just going to build trains and relocate to build a bot factory ,1,factorio
Raiguard,i am on my sixth factory i have only been playing for two weeks the first time i figured out how to automate mining and smelting then the second time i moved on to making a bus and red research third time was better smelteries and green research fourth military science and belt making fifth i restarted very quickly because the biter camps were all insane and impossible to kill with my current tech now i am on my sixth wo not be restarting for a long while ,1,factorio

Raiguard,i decided to replay botw when dual audio was released so i could experience the japanese voice acting which so far is vastly superior in almost every way to the english i have already discovered entire areas of land i never found the first time around i will be playing this game for years ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i am seriously hoping that the app is mainly for controlling the features changing lobbies typing into chat etc and that the actual stuff still happens on the console itself ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,that 63 000 more than r wiiu rip wii u ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,bull you have been on this sub for several months ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,a possible extension to this could be different custom toolbars for different projects for example you could save a toolbar for generic factory work another toolbar for building railroads etc then you could switch between these toolbars with either a hotkey or a button in the ui somewhere ,2,factorio
Raiguard,or if you have a logistics system have them delivered i do not actually know how logistics systems work please do not hurt me ,5,factorio

Raiguard,i think the switch is better overall however i do not think it perfect there is no denying that the ps4 is significantly more powerful like an entire order of magnitude more powerful than the switch and has amazing video recording features but the ps4 is s power hungry monster and is not portable tl dr i like the switch more but that does not mean the ps4 is not amazing they are both great consoles in their own ways ,9,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,huh well sorry that it a way slower experience for you unfortunately our world is not perfect best of luck ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i wonder if it has to do with where you live i live in utah just a few miles away from i 15 and there is major shipping traffic all along that corridor if you live in a more rural area it might be consistently slower ,1,NintendoSwitch

Raiguard,this is exactly how i feel i am a junior and it legitimately difficult for me to do homework i cannot focus on it i find school incredibly dull because none of it will matter anymore in my future i am already a proficient programmer and that what i plan to do with my life however the difference with me is that despite my absolute not caring about school i still force myself to do the work when i can i am nice to my teachers and my parents do not even attend conferences the policy in my family is if you screw up it your own dang fault tl dr i understand the mindset of gifted students and it no excuse for them to be assholes ,35,AskReddit

Raiguard,ok probably more than 1 of switches have problems the point is it seems like the problem is significantly more widespread than it actually is because you do not see people posting i got a perfect switch nearly as often as my switch has x problem i just used common sense ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,it not actually widespread those of us who have the issue me included are a minority that has been blown to huge proportions because of the internet 99 of switches have no problems ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,both ,1,NintendoSwitch

Raiguard,did you find 200 korok seeds just in the great plateau and eastern necluda if so then i will believe you ,5,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,it does not have extremely detailed textures and life like models that does not mean it has bad graphics in any way botw has the best overall video game graphics i have ever seen i am talking about the whole visual experience not the individual tiny parts ,5,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,it is a downer for me i would have much preferred a solid 60fps as i am sure everyone else would have but it does not detract from the experience in any way it still the best game i have ever played regardless of the framerate ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,upon getting my switch i immediately turned my tv to game mode to decrease input latency played through 80 hours of the game that way last night i tried setting the tv back to auto the game looked infinitely more beautiful i am never changing back ,2,NintendoSwitch

Raiguard,i believe you were able to play gc games with the wii classic controller by simply pressing l for a soft press and zl for a full press do not quote me on that though ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,the pro has replaced the gc controller as my personal favorite controller it perfect in almost every way ,7,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,what he means is for video out it only works through the dock you can charge the switch with any old usb c cable but any usb hubs or other adapters will not work you need to use the dock ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,ok thanks i have already noticed that somehow my joy con have a better connection after the update not by much but it is a noticeable improvement ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,what does today system update include v2 1 0 ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,it all depends on the optimization of the game it entirely possible that splatoon 2 will be 1080p60fps on launch just because something is 2x as powerful does not automatically mean things will run twice as well on it ,0,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,that why i said tabletop mode ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,when docked or in table top mode you use the joy con as a pointer definitely not ideal but it works surprisingly well in handheld it just the touch screen like normal ,3,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,this is a bit of a stretch reminds me of the nx days ,13,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i have this problem occasionally strangely it also coincides with my switch disconnecting from wifi and refusing to reconnect unless i do a hard reboot the way i fix the joy con problem is by taking them both off at the same time going into the controller menu setting the right joy con to be sideways p1 then reattach both i am sending in my switch next week want to play splatoon first edit english words ,3,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i think they should make a 2d zelda with very intricate battle mechanics what i mean is adaptive and intelligent enemies that actually think of ways to use your combat style against you like smash amiibo do then they could implement that for the next 3d zelda ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,have you had any issues with yours mine was also in 2016 and i have had the joy con issue plus several other issues that are very abnormal sending it in next week just want to see if there any correlation ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i love them too but they do not compare to the pro controller the pro is the best game controller i have ever used it comfortable the buttons are big and easy to press and it almost disappears in my hands in a good way it feels like an extension of my body ,2,NintendoSwitch

Raiguard,small amounts of drift are to be expected however my right joy con drifts in every game no matter how many times i recalibrate it when held still it will occasionally lose coordination and drift off to one side usually the right for a second or two it messed up my archery in botw on several occasions should i have it sent in to be looked at ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,mods are not perfect chill ,-4,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,it turns off both of them for me i just press a button on whichever one i want to use and it syncs then i calibrate the gyro l,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,wait i was already able to use the left one from day 1 ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,that because there only one true aaa title for switch out right now that zelda ,3,NintendoSwitch

Raiguard,my wishlist more specific activity log external hard drive support firmware fix for weak wifi higher quality screenshots i am thinking that nintendo might actually do a live presentation on a stage at e3 and announce the new features coming to the os as well as game things that would be amazing ,26,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,same for me i have been experiencing desync with both joy con not to mention that my wifi connection will randomly drop and wo not reconnect unless i do a hard restart my right joy con gyroscope has really bad drift recalibrating does not fix it and the console screen will randomly come on but not show anything when the console is docked and in sleep mode i think there maybe might be a slight problem with my console itself ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,the blue is killing me ,3,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i respect the hard work you do for this sub but with all due respect the question megathreads are extremely unhelpful several people have made this same complaint there has to be a better solution ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard, remindme 10 days,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,the left joy con is not nearly as usable for me when it comes to pointers i have essential tremor in my left hand so that not an option i already have to send it in to have my left joy con antenna fixed so maybe i will send in the right one as well ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,automod pls,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i am experiencing problems with both joy con though the left one is definitely worse i am also having weird wifi issues joy con desyncing when attached to the console and the console screen randomly coming on though not showing anything when docked in sleep mode sending it in tomorrow there definitely something wrong ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,this is fantastic if i did not like the look of the standard dock so much i would do this ,4,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,literally what,6,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,alternative facts ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,very valid point i was imagining that the performance dock would only do things like 4k upscaling or better antialiasing but this makes sense here hoping nvidia does some crazy magic with future tegras ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,exactly my line of thinking anyway we are totally off topic have a nice day ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,that is true i am a mormon people do see our standards as odd and limiting but i believe that it improves my quality of life from the way you wrote that comment it looked like you were thoughtlessly using mormon as an insult glad to know that you are actually reasonable d,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard, what glad to know that your opinion of mormons causes you to use the title as an insult may i ask why ,6,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,please put paragraphs ,3,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,same here i just beat the game an hour ago and i was only in hyrule castle to find a memory only to find that there no memory in the castle i accidentally jumped into the boss area and ended up beating ganon by the skin of my teeth a quarter of a heart left and no more food ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,yeah i am actually hoping they stick with the switch design as well in my opinion the perfect evolution would be a more powerful chipset tegra x3 1080p oled screen with gorilla glass smaller bezels slightly bigger screen with same console dimensions better battery life and thunderbolt 3 support so they could potentially create a performance dock not to mention backwards compatibility with all existing switch games and maybe accessories geez that was a huge run on sentence ,6,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,pretty sure a magnetometer is a compass do not quote me on that though ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i am sure nintendo will surprise us again ,367,NintendoSwitch

Raiguard,yeah the switch has ruined the wii u for me i guess that means it well made d,35,NintendoSwitch

Raiguard,this game is so fucking incredible ,3,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,here my wishlist for the share button higher quality screenshots gifs 5 seconds short video clips full length video docked only to an external drive livestreaming docked and ethernet only with optional saving to external drive it would also be cool if you could automatically transfer full quality screenshots and video clips saved to the sd card or internal memory over to the external hard drive when you dock the switch ,1,NintendoSwitch

Raiguard,i paid 320 because taxes ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,yes it still does it for some reason ,3,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,turning it completely off should not be necessary in any way nintendo needs to fix the switch constantly changing tv input through cec even when it in sleep mode ,8,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,it says display box only at the foot of the spine ,82,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i do not want the switch to be bigger but i would like to see an oled screen with actual glass and lower reflectivity i would also love if they added thunderbolt 3 support and created an scd dock accessory ,7,NintendoSwitch

Raiguard,do not sell the dock you will regret it i can guarantee that if you sell it you are gonna end up buying one again in the future ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,this is fantastic ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,just had an idea a zelda mmo where the players are all training in the royal army you have online battles with botw combat system with your fellow knights actually i do not think that would work well it was just a thought ,0,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,this the switch in my opinion is actually a portable console that happens to have a tv out it a ridiculously beefy handheld that can pretend to be a home console and can play home console caliber games ,4,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,do not click the link that what they want ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,yea ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,what are the serial numbers ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,actually it the other way around botw was zelda u for years and was being designed with the wii u gamepad in mind then one day they the dev team received an email from aonuma saying they needed to port it to switch and have it ready by launch source the zelda gdc panel ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,nintendo finally made a modern piece of technology huzzah ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,this happened to me every time i killed a moblin on death mountain other people have reported that it will happen every time you kill a moblin anywhere near a sheer cliff anywhere in the game perhaps there a leak in the moblin ai causing this ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,no it all depends on your strategy there was a time when i was fighting three stalbokoblins a moblin and a lizalfo with electric arrows all simultaneously as long as i kept the other enemies between me and the lizalfo and timed my offense correctly i never got hit you can beat ganon with a tree branch if you do it right ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,it an add on for the wii ,24,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,there a thing on that island besides the things that are worth money i somehow missed that using super vague words because i do not know how to use spoiler tags ,3,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,for some reason if i put the joy con on the edge of a table so it actually flat the calibration fails every time if i put it down normally so it angled because of the triggers the calibration works every time and i have experienced more problems with the left joy con when recalibrating than the right probably just a coincidence ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,the only thing that could make this better would be to put inserts around the ports to make them flush ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,it definitely renders the game at 1080p i think it just downscales and compresses the images to save storage space they really need to add a lossless png option ,34,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,well my left joy con definitely has problems but it not nearly as bad as people are making it out to be i have to go across my house behind a wall and hold the grip behind my back for the left joy con to completely desync otherwise it an occasional blip for half a second ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,duct tape really does fix everything ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,rip,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,look further down in the comments ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,how is it that literally everybody has better gear than me ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,huh definitely a bug ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,you can turn that off in the system settings ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i used that camp to farm arrows ended up with 150 of them after 10 minutes ,1,zelda
Raiguard,oh that one come to think of it i did see that before it was deleted that was completely uncalled for ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,he deleted the comment i can still see it anyway i understand your mindset now it seems to me like everyone got off on the wrong foot i understand you are not intending to sound aggressive i have made a similar mistake before it just really difficult to convey emotions properly over text ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,imo you should definitely open the pro controller do not get me wrong the grip is fantastic but the pro controller is the best video game controller i have ever used it sleek and ergonomic and the buttons are just the right stiffness i always use the pro controller in tv mode and use the grip for tabletop mode on the go ,7,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,f kin casual ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,instructions unclear dick stuck in dock cannot switch to handheld mode ,3,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,or insert story spoiler y item name here ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,the problem is not so much your opinion it your attitude it the simple difference between please help me understand and why wo not you tell me if you were a bit nicer and less aggressive i do not think you would get downvoted as much ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i expect they are going to expand botw as much as they possibly can new areas new mechanics new story elements etc they could do so much with the engine they created it crazy to think about personally i would like to be able to play in pre calamity hyrule where there was an actual castle town and much larger towns in general that would be perfect imo ,8,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,bluetooth headphone support ,20,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,well my cousins were all fawning over the switch and asking me questions the entire time i was playing it so i think that counts as social interaction ,4,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,considering this is a massive open world adventure running on an overpowered handheld it impressive there are not any other major issues ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,quick everybody back to r nintendonx ,4,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,it odd i usually really suck at zelda games but somehow in breath of the wild i am doing pretty well i can manage multiple enemies at once during a battle with little to no damage and the puzzles are right down my alley that said this game is still really freaking hard i have died tons of times ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,one of these is not like the others ,3,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,this is what really blew me away i had to help my cousins move on launch day i played my first few hours of zelda on the tv then switched to handheld mode and played while riding in the car during the occasional breaks we would take to rest our sore arms lots of heavy lifting i could whip out my switch and play for a few minutes then when we got home i just docked it again and continued like nothing ever happened i think the real magic here is in how quickly you can come out of sleep mode you are going from pressing the power button to playing a game in around 4 5 seconds and turning it off is just as quick simply press a button and it will be exactly where you left it when you get back i freaking love nintendo ,66,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i actually do as well minus the lunch who needs food when you have more zelda to play ,18,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,this game is amazing ,1,Breath_of_the_Wild
Raiguard,that where my preorder went ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,same thing happened with my new 3ds ups website lost track of it it showed up literally crushed into my mailbox the next day i hate ups ,34,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,once you get a pro controller there no going back that controller is simply amazing but the grip is very good too ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,maybe they will do a live presentation at e3 where they announce new os features and games that would be great ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i wish it was a bit less flimsy so i could press the power button without it collapsing ,8,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,1 botw 2 albw 3 wind waker 4 twilight princess 5 majora mask,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,yeah i noticed one time on handheld mode where it dropped frames ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i did update did not fix the problems ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,no but you can board your horse at a stable then you can take it back out from any stable in the game not as convenient but it works ,3,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,this the grip is fantastic but the pro is in a league of its own it the best controller i have ever used it the perfect weight the perfect balance and the buttons are the perfect stiffness and responsiveness not to mention it looks sleek as hell ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i used the joy con grip for several hours before i unboxed my pro controller the pro controller is definitely way better but the grip is not bad at all i am extremely impressed by both of them ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,yeah my brother got the wii u version and i got the switch version i was surprised at how similar they look aside from resolution ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,well it does not need to be max level but it needs to be pretty far up there ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,they are pretty good i have not yet been able to decipher whether or not they are virtual surround sound like the 3ds and wii u speakers were ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,wut,79,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i have experienced the left joy con problems heavily but other than that it performed above and beyond my expectations i am still amazed at how seamless and quick the switching functions are i can just dock the console pick up my pro controller press a button and i am good to go ,65,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,you can see your horse location on the sheikah slate ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,at first it actually seemed smaller than i thought it was never played any open world before games except for minecraft but after a while i realized that it felt small because i was only sticking to the paths as soon as i allowed myself to actually explore my mind was blown by how big it is ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,then why is not botw in 4k s,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i made the mistake of taking mine with me to a really dusty place the area is under heavy construction got dust and dirt everywhere on the console but after 10 minutes of microfiber cloth and electronic cleaning spray it was good as new ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,the switch puns are unavoidable ,10,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,the screen has a 16 9 aspect ratio that will give you an idea of how wide it should be ,5,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,it seems like it happening because televisions interfere with the bluetooth signal if your switch is literally right next to the tv it will have connection problems people have reported that moving the dock further away gets rid of the issue ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard, new nintendo switch kickstand pro edition,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,wait what did they say this where source ,3,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i believe there hidden metal contact plates there was a patent for it a while back maybe someone can find a link to the patent ,6,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,woah yea ,115,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,nope it will show the battery level in the os ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,if the screen on the console is still on it not recognizing that it in the dock make sure the power cable works when directly plugging it into the console ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,wut,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,why why ,10,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,tfw a microwave is cheaper than the switch ,60,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,it the most bitter compound known to exist o,42,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard, for the love of hylia everyone ftfy,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,the n64 controllers are backwards ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,my older brother invited me to come with him to the midnight launch at our local best buy where he picking up his preorder i am not getting mine until the afternoon because amazon ,4,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,and the science gets done and you make a neat gun ,23,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,that true the switch runs underclocked in handheld mode when docked it increases to full power full clock speeds so it is more powerful when docked but it has nothing to do with the dock itself ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,huge if correct ,3,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,that what that means thank you my acronym vocabulary is sorely lacking ,5,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i would still like to know though ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,same here except that i can take deliveries on any day of the week so there still hope ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,sure sounds that way people have reported that when playing zelda it can take up to 8 hours to fully charge the switch in the dock the charging speed seems like it going to be the achilles heel of the system ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,obviously i am not actually a rep if i was the ninjas would have assassinated me by now oh crap i just admitted that the ninjas exist ,6,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,er umm em proof of course i have proof let see here um insert typical elementary school excuse here ,0,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,of course ,0,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,if i told you that i am that rep would you believe me ,0,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,keep in mind that there a full blown console in there there was bound so be some sort of caveat ,5,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,gray switch zelda carrying case possibly snipperclips and fast rmx as well ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i am going to put it straight into the dock as soon as it lets me when you first turn it on you need to have it undocked with the joy cons connected in order to proceed so i am not gonna worry about it ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i believe in you ,9,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,gale,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,does the official carrying case have room for the ac adapter ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,you would get stuck at the very beginning you need to climb a rock wall to get out of the shrine of resurrection ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i am personally treating it as a dockable handheld not a portable home console so it will be only me my brother cannot afford a switch so he getting the wii u version of botw ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,you admitted to your crime the nintendo ninjas will be canceling your preorder momentarily ,215,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,no it not edit apparently it only showing up on the desktop version i am on mobile ,-1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,so we should measure in cubic kilometers botw would slaughter everything else in that regard i will do measurements when i get the game ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,hooray for nvidia ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,let see under max load the ps4 draws 137 watts that 13 14 gigaflops per watt assuming the switch has power in the range of 650 gigaflops while docked that 40 gigaflops per watt if the switch were to draw 137 watts like a ps4 that would theoretically be 5 5 teraflops boom i know that a completely ridiculous comparison but it still awesome to see just how much more efficient the switch is compared to the other home consoles on the market ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,that really sucks that someone supposedly spoiled the end for you whoever did that shame on you you are the biggest dick known to mankind ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,zelda obviously ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,uhh i did have a spoiler tag auto mod put one on there i am on mobile so i cannot put tags on manually and i put the topic in the title but it did not have any spoilers in the title itself ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,based on the japanese switch commercial that heavily featured botw it looks like there a max of 30 hearts at four spirit orbs per heart that calculates to exactly 120 shrines the amazon description for the guidebook says there 120 shrines this means that you will have to find a balance if you spend any orbs on stamina you wo not be able to get all the hearts and vice versa ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,thank you finally got around to setting it up my hype is on an entirely new level now d,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,yes thank you ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,whaddaya know ,2,TrendingReddits
Raiguard,well technically botw was first announced in january 2013 when aonuma first mentioned the breaking the conventions of zelda theme that 4 years before release ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,to be fair the video about battery life in the presentation did say that zelda should last for about three hours says so in the japanese text while they are speaking 2 5 6 5 hours that where he getting that info from ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,switch is aiming to primarily play games it not trying to be a multipurpose tablet and it not trying to be a pc you use it to play games it does not really need to do much more than that ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,uncle sam is on reddit now ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,oh that impressive i always forget that the vita is actually really cool hardware but horrifically lacked in software ,6,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,how the performance ,24,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,that is an accurate statement ,21,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,because of their ambitions botw is a massive open world game the wii u has an ancient cpu architecture basically just a gamecube on uber steroids and a last gen gpu so it can barely run it though i guarantee that they did a bunch of optimizations since e3 so the final build will run smoother than it did back then ,6,Breath_of_the_Wild
Raiguard,i am sure nintendo has a solution for this ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard, the switch had a month to build up cardio ftfy,-13,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i do not have a hateboner i was really hoping for the miis to have clothing options on switch i am just saying that since they are not an integral part of the system anymore the lack of clothing customization does not bother me as much ,25,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,well it looks like miis are nothing more than avatar icons now so their bodies do not matter very much ,59,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,when the console is low on battery it will automatically go into sleep mode to preserve your game state that incredible ,34,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i will edit my original comment ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,but why would you ever not play zelda at launch blasphemy ,11,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,you played for a week on day 1 show me your ways ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,because snapping means it broken you slide it ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,why do the most amazing youtube videos get tons of dislikes ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,less than 100 of people in the world know about the switch bad marketing preorder canceled edit stupid utf 8 encoding ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i forgot about fsa i am talking about the 3d zeldas ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,that the magical thing switch does not use a sensor bar and you can sync joy con simply by sliding them onto the console for a few seconds fast painless and amazing ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,wow you can do that to guardian lasers that is so cool ,11,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,totally forgot about that one i am thinking the mainline 3d zeldas ,5,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,think this is the first console zelda game since oot to have a completely new engine ss tp and ww all used iterations of oot engine edit oh yeah and oot is a very heavily modified mario kart 64 engine food for thought edit 2 totally forgot about fsa that one is an exception i am talking about the mainline 3d zeldas ,130,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i guess i will try that thanks and nice print by the way ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i have not managed to get one to work the complication will never update ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,raiguard,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i see that apple watch sneaky,5,NintendoSwitch

Raiguard,world first legal nintendo switch unboxing,153,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i do not know what you are talking about i am 16 and tons of girls have expressed interest in getting to hold my switch when it comes it probably helps that i go to a private school where everyone is a nerd ,0,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard, gasp edit quotation marks,49,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,is it the switch version ,5,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,my cousins live in the middle of nowhere but somehow they are within a mile of a major internet hub they have a fiber cable straight to the hub i do not k ow exactly how fast their internet is but it fast edit fiber not fiver,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,as long as they have that super cool surround sound tech that was in the 3ds and gamepad i am good ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,backyard baseball switch i need this now ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,difference in this case is that they have said that the game is exactly the same on both platforms gameplay wise tp has drastically different huds and controls between the two versions i do not think you will need to get both ,2,Breath_of_the_Wild
Raiguard,it like not using the swift sail in wwhd not gonna happen ,0,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,put shitposts over on r tomorrow and this one was already put there anyway and featured ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,no freaking duh ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i did i am just really excited did not really think this post through i fully expect the mods to remove this post ,0,NintendoSwitch

Raiguard,mine is a switch and zelda absolutely nothing else i am currently debating which carrying case would be the best ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,sir user,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i actually did not know this until now thank you ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,but are they analog s,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,and the switch carts hold home console caliber games freaking insanity ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,the best part is near the end where he absolutely slaughters steppe talus ,15,Breath_of_the_Wild
Raiguard,same here i was really confused ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,how is your gamepad so clean sorcery ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,imagine if they used hd rumble to make it feel like you are actually putting them ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,the only thing i got from this was that her hype infused waiting time was decreased by three days to her it seemed like an instant lucky other than that i hope she makes a speedy recovery and i hope you do not die of hype while she playing it ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,if they would hire the guy from nintendo insider who pulled off this insane botw gameplay https youtu be mtt w2xre3g it would be infinitely better skip to the end he fights a steppe talus and absolutely slaughters it it amazing ,3,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard, how many breakups has mario kart caused ftfy,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,there is hd rumble in the pro controller ,13,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,please delete and remake this post with a better title makes it look like you are talking about the game not the guide ,4,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,should not have included the green tag in the picture they could probably find you ,10,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,nope ,1,Jokes
Raiguard,the problem is the next 13 days will seem like another 120 ,5,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,my body cannot contain this level of hype ,37,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,on the third day of switchmas nintendo gave to me three hour battery two joycons and super mario odyssey,3,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,his is not but you could very easily find one there are countdown skins everywhere ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard, it friday friday friday ohhhhhhhhhh it friday shoots myself in the head ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,they were actively in the process of dumping it when they had to abort to avoid being caught it was a real thing ,22,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,nah it not the same i like the switch presentation music more the startup sound has completely different instruments ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,there is a full unboxing video as well as a better look at the settings screen on this site http www floko tv video 1107255 exclusive worlds first nintendo switch unboxing wkzdmzsrkhs please add it to the list ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,video up here https vid me oqko ,4,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard, dang good thing i wo not be getting one d,0,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,those switch logo badges are wrong the right joy con should be the higher one ,0,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,honestly i think they did not have room for a headphone jack those things do take up a ton of space and considering how tiny and advanced the joy con are i would have been surprised to see one in them that would have been the best option i just do not think they had enough space ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i have realized that the potential use lies primarily with tv mode since there no headphone jack on the joy con grip or pro controller there nowhere for you to plug in a headset when in tv mode the switch could beam the game audio to your phone which will then overlay it with the voice chat and output it through headphones connected to the phone this way you could use wired headphones wirelessly ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,the developer documentation leak says second generation maxwell that leak is almost definitely 100 legitimate so i am calling bs on this post ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,wow that incredible ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,oh yes a nintendo account is what you will use going forward it a proper account system which nnid is not you can link your nnid to your nintendo account as well ,24,NintendoSwitch

Raiguard,thoroughly explore the entire plateau after getting the paraglider i especially want to get the quilted shirt and kill the stone talus before i go off to the rest of the world ,3,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,go away barbara ,12,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,the game is already really hard you can get one shotted by tons of enemies even on the great plateau ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,playing through as many zelda games as i can so far i have done albw wwhd and am halfway through tphd and actually fixing my school grades so i wo not have to worry about past make up work when i inevitably play the switch for two weeks straight ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,that only 14 tomorrows ,3,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,what ,2,MiiverseInAction
Raiguard,good ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,the last week has seemed like a year i cannot wait anymore i am dying send help ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,maybe that what the dlc pack will do ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i just realized that in this artwork link has the full not decrepit master sword as well as the sheikah slate to my knowledge we have never seen him have both at the same time before ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,should have shown the dlc trailer at e3 ,3,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,am i the only one who is sick and tired of posts that start with am i the only one ,3,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,have you been under a rock for the last day ,6,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,they could potentially straight up remake ocarina of time and majora mask using botw engine i would definitely buy that very unlikely though ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,this i really have not been an active nintendo player recently but with the switch i am more excited than i have ever been i am going to lose so much money to this thing ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,yeah i am going on a school choir trip high school over spring break it a thirteen hour bus ride so glad i will be able to play zelda when i get bored ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,and the switch is amazing because of this ,6,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,miss iwata or missy watta ,7,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,holy crap ,-3,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,one of us,11,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,either this is 100 legitimate or some talented troll has way too much time on their hands ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,actually it was confirmed in an interview earlier today that the dock is proprietary so you need to use the dock to enable tv mode other cables will just charge ,6,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,oh no no no i would never put the dock sideways if i had the choice it works a ton better upright i am just saying that for those with literally no other option it possible ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i happen to disagree my console shelf has all of the cords hidden and tucked away neatly with switch having the cords come out the side would completely ruin that here hoping that the included hdmi cable is not ridiculously stiff ,-6,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,true in my opinion it a minor inconvenience in most circumstances key word most you wo not be playing in tabletop mode for that long anyway ,3,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,rubba dub dub,22,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,same i love the matte finish but i think it would have looked better without transparency ,16,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i think it battery life and heat output pascal uses significantly less power and does not heat up as much as maxwell ,28,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,heh albw is the only zelda game i have 100 ed without a guidebook now i speedrun it ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard, a link to the leak https www reddit com r nintendoswitch comments 5tsruy leaked indevelopment ui mockups st iz47g33v sh bec4c0e4 ,3,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard, firstworldproblems though i do agree that it a ghost town ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,oh my god x bots i have never heard that nickname before but it perfect ,7,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,it could be that it will automatically connect the pro controller if you do not remove the joy cons from the system within a few seconds of docking it if you do remove the joy cons it will stay connected to those it could also potentially read your habits and learn what you usually do there are a ton of possibilities ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,botw is very heavily physics based there a ton of stuff happening all at once that needs to be calculated ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,if they added a developer mode to the os so any switch console could transform into a dev kit this would be perfect ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,holy crap that was four years ago how far we have come ,3,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,and even if they do not it pretty easy to tell because the ui between the versions is different d pad vs buttons in the top left ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,you are wrong there are 20 5 days remaining i refuse to wait an extra 12 hours ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,oh derp,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,the only guardian we have seen killed was in the e3 treehouse stream where they were showing gameplay clips from aonuma playthrough if i recall correctly i think it was in the beyond the plateau segment ,3,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,it was a gameplay clip from aonuma playthrough i believe it was shown in the beyond the plateau segment ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,for some reason i cannot access it ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,this has been going on for a week now ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,the us is a lot bigger than you think the closest event to me is over 500 miles away ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,hey look something legitimately interesting for once ,4,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,fantastic writing ,4,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i get out of school at 12 00 on friday i will be going to best buy to pick up zelda then i will spend several hours staring at the cartridge while i simultaneously watch the entire nintendo e3 2016 treehouse stream i expect the switch to have arrived by then ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,and your comment is being downvoted too wtf ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,yes it would also be amazing if they were to implement botw quick swap system for switching out items it would not be nearly as convenient as the dual screen experience but it would still help a lot ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,you have zelda you will be spending so long trying to 100 this game that you will lose your job move into your parents basement then accidentally destroy your switch in excitement as you finally defeat calamity ganon also snipperclips looks pretty good ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i laughed way harder at this than i should have ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,he was talking about the speed of development compared to the wii u getting isaac to run on switch was extremely quick ,19,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,february 12th 11 52am est ,1,NintendoSwitch

Raiguard,maybe this is one of the reasons the switch can only play botw for three hours ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,no they will only charge when the console itself is charging whether through the dock or a cable or if you buy the charging grip and plug that in ,4,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,best buy website says i get to pick up zelda on march 2nd for some reason the console is shipping sometime before 8pm on the 3rd that going to be the longest 24 hours of my life ,1,NintendoSwitch

Raiguard,oh god 100 speedrunning this game will be a nightmare ,3,NintendoSwitch

Raiguard,if this was a game i would kill myself repeatedly on purpose ,6,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i assume so ,0,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,when they say it renders in 900p that does not mean it displays in 900p it displays in full 1080p upscaled from 900p it a lot more resource friendly than natively rendering it in 1080p ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,this makes thirteen times i have seen this question ,-1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,this it would only matter if it ran at 480p 900p is plenty ,2,NintendoSwitch

Raiguard,this is definitely possible add hd rumble support and it would be even more amazing ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,no ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i am hoping for an ultimate installment that will combine all of the remasters and 2 8 onto one cartridge for 100 then kh3 released standalone that would be fresking amazing fitting all of those games into one cartridge is definitely possible before any of you bash me ,3,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,they are listed on nintendo website for the small price of 90 ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,they have stated that the switch version has been developed alongside the wii u version for a long time i am suspecting this has something to do with the delay back in march 2015 so no it built natively for switch it not a straight up port ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,well you are a hairy wizard ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,that is a pretty good description of lasting appeal so yes ,1,NintendoSwitch

Raiguard,i looked it up on amazon clicked pre order confirmed the transaction and proceeded to watch as many switch presentation reactions as i could find oh i then preordered zelda at best buy apparently i will be able to pick it up on march 2nd weird ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,luckily i opened the page right as preorders reopened for a short time got myself a preorder ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,well you have gotta keep in mind that they have to make a profit off what they sell so everything will actually be less expensive than they are selling it for eg the dock is probably only worth 30 max ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,please kindly ignore the comment i made then subsequently deleted i misunderstood ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,god i am glad that was not true ,9,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,in other words they knew what they were doing ,3,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,yeah in the same video you can see the quest log and the guy scrolls through a menu that had a bunch of recovered memories slots so you will recover memories of the past as you progress through the game ,3,zelda

Raiguard,the 64gb card i bought for my n3ds xl before realizing it only supports up to 32gb ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,but i guess the other reason not to have it on switch is because you will be taking it on the go and you wo not always have an internet connection with the ps4 and xbone they are always connected ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,oh good point that would be nice ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,well cloud saves wo not really be necessary seeing as you will only have one console that is both a handheld and a home unit ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,well the volume rocker does have plus and minus symbols on it probably just a misunderstanding ,3,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,actually they are referencing the game boy earbuds ,3,NintendoSwitch

Raiguard,you asked for downvotes you got em ,6,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,goshdangit i thought this was serious for a minute oh well i planned on playing it in japanese anyway it looks and feels too much like an anime not to play it with japanese voices ,3,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,probably given that the console is not region locked ,20,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,because they are angry that he would sell for a profit ,10,NintendoSwitch

Raiguard,hopefully it will also be on twitch and youtube i highly expect nintendo website to crash again like it did with the switch unveiling video ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,well it looks good i do not really have any complaints ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,there is a black one i want that one ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,she said sometime this week not today be patient ,4,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i would like it better if it had the entire front part the game art with a small ns logo in the top corner then the spine can be red ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i never said it was a rumor i am using info from the patent to extrapolate how they might approach wiimote esque pointing ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,all very valid points ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,just as google has male female and other,9,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,you had to recalibrate the wii motion plus every time you used it ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,lots of people might not have room under the tv i was just voicing an idea ,6,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,yes i want 8 player toy tanks from wii play bring it on ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i am also sixteen been a nintendo gamer my entire life i am unbelievably excited for the switch i am crossing my fingers that it comes out on the rumored 16th of march because then i could play it on the 12 hour bus ride to disneyland the next week ,3,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,yes i want my zelda as soon as possible ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,happy new year for you d,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard, p,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,link does not work ,2,NintendoSwitch

Raiguard,march 2nd for me dr seuss birthday d,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,hey me too ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,swiss army guardian ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i do believe it called the switch dock it stated in the collage they have on their website ,21,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,so every time it says one you dock undock it what would be the point of that i can think of 1000 things i would rather do with my time this sucks i have no life rip proceeds to dock undock it 927383939377 times ,9,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i would not release it i would just use it for family games we are all super into it it actually really crazy we will be at each other throats over who sends trash to who at specific times i want to recreate it because it super blurry and hard to look at on hd tvs ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,paper and plastic wrap is pretty cheap apple just overcharges because they want as much profit as possible ,3,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i guess that means it was written well ,10,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i do not like floppy bread it needs to be tender and firm to have a good texture ,12,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,choo choo ,11,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i will have two card slots one for the game card one for a microsd card ,5,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,umm what ,3,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,this could take nintendo land to a whole new level ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,is your refrigerator running it not oh ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,before anyone downvotes this go watch the video linked in a previous comment the library of babel prophesies every outcome and every permutation of every outcome ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,emphasizing swear words and slang does not make your point stronger it just makes you look like a child ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i would sell my soul to miyamoto ,4,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i am not saying that other consoles are not efficient in fact you are right magically making them perform better is not possible still optimizations will make it run faster than we think it will at least hopefully faster than the wii u ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,another fact we have to consider is the enormous optimizations nvidia have stated they are going through with this console if they are optimizing the software to be as efficient as possible and take advantage of every facet of the hardware then the relative performance of the games may be more than what the hardware can theoretically handle just food for thought ,10,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,yes i want my zelda ,37,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,sometimes i feel like native english speakers speak english worse than non native speakers i speak english good 3,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,but i am a gamer and i watch ces ,3,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,it was the footage was simulated ,16,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,that an art style choice the kind of painting style they are trying to mimic fades details out in the background on the wii u it was a bit too extreme because of the limited hardware on switch it is better but they made it not ridiculously good on purpose to fit that style ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,that is definitely the switch version it looks like there antialiasing the shadows do not flicker and you can see trees on distant mountains not to mention the frame rate is buttery smooth ,21,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,minecraft will never die as long as they keep adding stuff it the never ending game ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,that a very inspiring story i am now considering doing the same thing for my high school work if i cannot keep adequate grades i wo not be getting the switch for a while thanks for the idea and good luck ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,wait splat switch revolution splatoon for wii confirmed ,113,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,black black and more black black is the new red ,3,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i compromise by calling it ns ,3,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i find myself whispering welcome to the tokyo switch event my name is reggie and my body is ready nintendo is ready then i fall asleep and have completely unrelated dreams ,5,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,good i never saw anyone using them so i was worried ,1,zelda
Raiguard,that makes sense thank you ,1,calculus
Raiguard,but i thought ln x was 1 x or does it change because of the exponent ,2,calculus
Raiguard,and ,3,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,uhh every other console except the wii u and 3ds only have one screen ,7,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,on the sixth day of switchmas reggie gave to me 6 miyamotos 5 pro controllers 4 new amiibo 3 docking stations 2 launch titles and an hd ips screen ,3,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,no i am imagining a much more streamlined os overall i like the wii u but i find its ui to be very clunky ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,bluetooth headphones or those wonky headphones with a 90 degree bend on their connector ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,yea ,4,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,that was not fake it was subsequently taken down from nintendo website where it was discovered ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,this is not mine i really should clarify that in the post ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,really what i should have done is do a picture post then link to the deviant art in the description oh well ,4,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,there is a locking mechanism that releases when you press a small button off to the side of the trigger buttons so it wo not fall out unintentionally ,15,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,will do ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,gosh my bad if only i could change the title ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,oh when i first looked at this i thought they were saying the wii u released in 2017 ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i have to disagree those sounds did not sound like botw sounds they do not fit the theme at all they sound like os sounds to me ,4,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,hero of ruin,13,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,a computer is a collection of nanometer sized electrical pathways in different configurations that solve math problems it then takes those solutions and puts them into more equations eventually the answers to these equations are sent elsewhere either to be stored or to be displayed or whatnaught and all of this happens several billion times a second so yeah they are complicated we truly do live in the future ,17,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,this has been stated so many times i am completely sick of it ,3,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,it called a first class lever and a bowling ball ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,the nintendo switch ,1,AskReddit
Raiguard, hello i am nintendo switch it sure feels great to be out of that box ,17,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,there is a sound it really quiet and difficult to hear but as he looks at the switch after undocking it he presses a button and a tone plays something is definitely going on here ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,they have stated that the switch version has been built for switch from the ground up so it a native switch game not a port ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,breathe the wild,13,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,if you compare it to xcx wii u box art it checks out the hype is real ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,it was shown multiple times especially in the splatoon portion ,14,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard, because unlike previous games these explosions are dynamic and affect the environment in several ways ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,ps4 levels of power it would be really really nice if this happened but i do not expect it i expect 1 5 tflops at max probably gonna be closer to 1 tflop ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,oh no you have to spend ten seconds switching the cartridge firstworldproblems edit wow that was a completely unintentional pun ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,just because it was a given does not mean she cannot leak it leaking it means those who disagree will lose some ground and some of them will finally accept the truth no need to be so bitter ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,go purchase an atari 2600 should be enough to satisfy your demands 3,4,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,if this is true yes you can plug your switch into any dock and it will work the same ,7,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,for me 1 is nintendo switch gamexplain ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,the sun will come out tomorrow ,2,tomorrow
Raiguard,385 2 days switch remake someday,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,did not britain secede from the eu ,31,PlanetCoaster
Raiguard,same here but with an i7 6700 ,2,PlanetCoaster
Raiguard,really the game runs fine on my 660ti albeit at medium graphics settings were you trying to run it on ultra ,1,PlanetCoaster
Raiguard,yes if only for sandbox mode i do not think noclip should be an option in career mode ,1,PlanetCoaster
Raiguard,there are trimming brakes at least for the wooden coaster i have been to entranced by the wooden coaster that it the only one i have used in the beta ,2,PlanetCoaster
Raiguard,i hope they add a low friction option like in rct3 higher maintenance costs but better coaster ,5,PlanetCoaster
Raiguard,yeah there no measure for gpu usage you have to use hwinfo or something like unto it and download a skin utilizing the hwinfo rainmeter plugin ,1,Rainmeter
Raiguard,here the official release artwork i just finished making https www dropbox com s uj8nhew9fntg3ei 1 0 0 png dl 0,2,Rainmeter
Raiguard,the only thing the new music app has going for it is that it integrates with 3d touch really nicely other than that it a piece of garbage ,1,iphone
Raiguard,i have been developing this skin suite for 10 months now and it finally close to being released the idea of moderngadgets is to have the classic addgadgets com system monitoring gadgets but with updated visuals and a simplified backend to better fit in with modern systems if you would like to help test moderngadgets before release here https github com iamanai moderngadgets is the github repo please report any issues through github ,3,Rainmeter
Raiguard,i noticed while watching the video myself that this frame existed and spent 5 minutes trying to get that exact frame it my own picture ,1,PlanetCoaster
Raiguard,darn i got beaten to the punch oh well it still exciting ,2,PlanetCoaster
Raiguard,sorry for the really crappy quality saw this on a school chromebook which cannot upload screenshots so i had to take a picture with my phone ,7,PlanetCoaster
Raiguard,i feel ya man the first time i heard this song was the day after my best friend commuted suicide i still choke up every time i hear it listen closely to the lyrics then you will understand why ,2,PlanetCoaster
Raiguard,set it up begin playing botw using the pro controller on my tv when i need to go i will undock it and cackle as i play more zelda at school ,3,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,hmm try reinstalling ,1,Rainmeter
Raiguard,no i think nintendo wants to distance themselves as much as possible from the wii brand so i am confident that there will be new avatars with a new name ,15,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i bet your bottom dollar that those rumors are true ,3,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,http www anandtech com show 8811 nvidia tegra x1 preview 2 tegra x1 is 512 gigaflops at fp32 https www techpowerup com gpudb 1903 wii u gpu wii u is 352 gigaflops at fp32 352 512 0 6875 69 edit oh wait i was wrong indeed this means that the wii u is 69 the power of the x1 so the x1 is only 31 more powerful my bad ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,nintendo has never really highlighted hardware potential in any ad campaign they always put the experience first and mention hardware details on the sidelines that said i have to disagree with your belief on its power the tegra x1 by itself is about 70 more powerful than the wii u considering that switch has custom made hardware and software and is likely based on the pascal architecture it likely to be at least 2x as powerful as the wii u if not more ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,maybe that what the ir sensors are for o,3,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,we noticed that less than a minute after the reveal came out ,7,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,looks like you are censoring his legs is he half naked or something ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,oops my bad i only looked at the geekbench ones ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,those benchmarks measure cpu power not gpu power i can almost guarantee you that the gpu in switch will be much more powerful than a smartphone ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,no it the seventh generation nes snes n64 gamecube wii wii u switch virtual boy does not count ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,according to this guy it 3x as powerful as the xbone when docked ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,well when we get 100 autonomous cars that wo not be an issue ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,ok true ,3,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i do not think cases will work at all with the whole toaster docking and joy con things it would not fit or work ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,are you kidding i am going to disneyland on a choir trip in march if this comes out before we leave i will be playing botw for the entire 12 hour bus ride where is your sanity ,10,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,what i meant was they probably have support in the built in graphics tools to handle the switch without crashing heh my phone auto capitalized switch it learning ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,tegra is designed to be scalable if i am not mistaking they probably have built in apis for switching between mobile and docked so devs do not have to pain themselves as much i am sure it has more power when docked whether that means increasing power usage or having additional hardware in the dock the former being more likely ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,eww firefox ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard, get it for only 600 ,19,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,well we wo not know for sure until they tell us i am personally rooting for an x2 on pascal ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,the tegra x1 could reach a peak of just over 1 tflop which is 3x more powerful than the wii u add that in with the likely use of the pascal or parker architecture and the optimizations they have made specifically for switch and i think it will reach at least ps4 level graphics 1 8 tflops ,2,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,or usb c that would be the best choice imo it versatile enough that it could even connect to the dock just using that one port ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,but is it usb c or usb a i am personally rooting for usb c ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,i am sure there is also a regular charging cable if they did not let you charge it with a cable they would receive so many complaints they would have to recall the switch and replace them with versions with a charging port it will definitely come stock ,3,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,the ps4 and xbone are both x86 not arm ,1,NintendoSwitch
Raiguard,here we gooooooooooo ,3,NintendoNX
Raiguard,shame i hope you have a good time ,1,NintendoNX
Raiguard,well then here you go https www dropbox com s sif2uaq9n2xapdq photo 20oct 2020 2c 2008 2037 2036 jpg dl 0 btw these shirts are homemade we love our disney ,4,NintendoNX
Raiguard,hah if you are at magic kingdom today look for a family of matching blue mickey mouse tye dye shirts i am in that family ,8,NintendoNX
Raiguard,i slept for five hours now my body is literally ready i shall be holding off all walt disney world shenanigans to watch this i feel no shame all hail our new nintendo overlords ,56,NintendoNX
Raiguard,honestly i am hoping that after the announcement tomorrow we will see a whole new redesign of the nintendo website it a mess right now ,2,NintendoNX
Raiguard,i was on the walt disney world parking lot tram i saw the news and a grin wider than that of the cheshire cat spread across my face after a second i stood up sharply raising my arms in triumph i screamed hallelujah its happening i can die now they stopped the tram right then and there and i had to apologize profusely ,8,NintendoNX
Raiguard,no need to post this there already a stickied megathread referencing primary source material move along now ,0,NintendoNX
Raiguard,no it new nintendo nex plus xl zelda limited edition extravaganza ,6,NintendoNX
Raiguard,its happening all aboard the hype train choo choo ,2,NintendoNX
Raiguard,this is real omg ,3,NintendoNX
Raiguard,i believe it coming on friday but i do not believe emily rogers ,2,NintendoNX
Raiguard, and it gone darn ,1,NintendoNX
Raiguard,hey i am at disney world right now o,3,NintendoNX
Raiguard,it will be unveiled tomorrow ,1,NintendoNX
Raiguard,if only all internet arguments ended as peacefully as that did ,1,NintendoNX
Raiguard,fix it tomorrow ,18,NintendoNX
Raiguard,eh screw it i did not think about it oh well it does not matter anyway ,2,NintendoNX
Raiguard,well i will see the tweet on my apple watch literally as soon as it posted and i already have a post written out i just need to copy the twitter link i will be posting it lightning quick what is your setup ,1,NintendoNX
Raiguard,what i said is the ideology of most americans these days if they do not get what they want they fight until they get it it why america is going down the drain in terms of decent society ,1,NintendoNX
Raiguard,if you are wrong you could be sued ,0,NintendoNX
Raiguard,42 ,3,NintendoNX
Raiguard,at this point i would trust my neighbor dog barking morse code more than i would trust emily rogers at least the dog has a clean track record ,27,NintendoNX
Raiguard,challenge accepted ,10,NintendoNX
Raiguard,oh i plan on being that guy ,38,NintendoNX
Raiguard, everything is going to be fine no it not ,3,NintendoNX
Raiguard,well whenever it happens i have nintendo twitter set to give me notifications on my watch so i will know exactly when it happens ,1,NintendoNX
Raiguard,in terms of how long the sun stays in the sky in the northern hemisphere in fact in or close to the north arctic circle the sun never sets on june 21 ,3,NintendoNX
Raiguard,umm i will pass thanks ,1,NintendoNX
Raiguard,i am checking this subreddit while waiting in line over and over and over and over and over ,1,NintendoNX
Raiguard,i am shamelessly leeching off disney world free wifi service exactly the opposite of doing homework ,3,NintendoNX
Raiguard,i take this challenge ,5,NintendoNX
Raiguard,i think a tweet saying something like join us on 10 21 for a special event talking all about nx with a simple picture of the white nx logo on a red background ,6,NintendoNX
Raiguard,on the second day of nx mas nintendo gave to thee two wacky gimmicks and one monday that bound to proceed,1,NintendoNX
Raiguard,actually june 21 is the longest day of the year ,68,NintendoNX
Raiguard,or u ,2,NintendoNX
Raiguard,because lots of people agree that revealing it a week before will give people time to react to it and for nintendo stocks to go up or go down before the meeting all the signs point toward this week ,4,NintendoNX
Raiguard,wii luve u ,1,NintendoNX
Raiguard,they are moving on from the wii and wii u i do not think they will ever use that branding again ,3,NintendoNX
Raiguard,or the sheikah slate looks like an nx inception,1,NintendoNX
Raiguard,uhh bayonetta no that a game ,3,NintendoNX
Raiguard,yes eurogamer caused an outbreak of tumors ,1,NintendoNX
Raiguard,at first glance all i saw was nintendo direct coming soon my hype got the better of me for a moment there ,2,NintendoNX
Raiguard,seems legit to me ,1,NintendoNX
Raiguard,i am going to disney world luckily i will have internet there ,1,NintendoNX
Raiguard,nintendo is basically the apple of video game consoles except that they do not have ridiculously shady business practices ,-7,NintendoNX
Raiguard,i said maybe not likely though that why i did not mention it in the first place ,-1,NintendoNX
Raiguard,if the console is shit and if zelda were not on it i would have no incentive to buy it maybe smash bros or mario sunshine 2 but that would be it ,-1,NintendoNX
Raiguard,so the nx is capable of magic sign me up ,1,NintendoNX
Raiguard,none the end ,-8,NintendoNX
Raiguard,yes ,0,NintendoNX
Raiguard,if nintendo waits until march to reveal it nintendo headquarters might not survive the hate war ,4,NintendoNX
Raiguard,a home console capable of ps4 pro level graphics a handheld with a 720p capacitive touchscreen and dual analog sticks cartridges for both rather than disks a gamecube esque wireless controller with the new control scheme everything in the scd patent online connectivity distributed server farm session transfer etc and for pete sakes online featured up to par with the other consoles and even beyond them i would also be fine if it turned out to be completely a home console ,2,NintendoNX
Raiguard,and my battery ,4,NintendoNX
Raiguard,it gonna happen while i am at disney world frick ,1,NintendoNX
Raiguard,last time this happened i mentioned it and absolutely nothing came out of it i would not get my hopes up if i were you ,0,NintendoNX
Raiguard,zelda ,6,NintendoNX
Raiguard,i think next week confirmed ,1,NintendoNX
Raiguard,watch this is actually nintendo official unveiling ,1,NintendoNX
Raiguard,may as well be nintendo osu at this point r osugame,1,NintendoNX
Raiguard,tell him that there is an even better console coming out next year tell him he should wait for that before asking for a console ,3,wiiu
Raiguard,reggie my body is ready ,3,NintendoNX
Raiguard,now a reddit post in a tumblr post in a facebook post in a reddit post in a twitter post in a facebook post in a reddit comment link to pic https www dropbox com s d7xjha9z0rsjssy photo 20oct 2007 2c 2018 2056 2011 png dl 0 ,2,NintendoNX
Raiguard,literally nothing will be revealed tomorrow ,10,NintendoNX
Raiguard,ok true i guess you are right ,1,NintendoNX
Raiguard,actually their marketing strategy is causing riots and flame wars all over the internet even if they just tweeted the nx exists that would be enough to calm most people down ,0,NintendoNX
Raiguard,i think so because the company that made the 3ds graphics chip announced a new mobile chip a while back that achieves 1 tflop of power that three times as powerful as the wii u ,1,NintendoNX
Raiguard,maybe they will reveal the reveal at the end of this we can only hope ,1,NintendoNX
Raiguard,i think what it means is not two completely separate gameplay versions i just think it means downscaled graphics and potentially optimized background processes the handheld will likely be at least as powerful as the wii u if not more so so it would handle 3d games just fine ,6,NintendoNX
Raiguard,i would hold off on that even though rumors should not be taken as fact nx is pretty much guaranteed to be some kind of hybrid system i would wait until the reveal to make your decision ,1,NintendoNX
Raiguard,nex would also be cool ,2,NintendoNX
Raiguard,comic sans ,6,Showerthoughts
Raiguard,when there a child friendly reddit well know we are in the future that will never happen ,5,Futurology
Raiguard,make it the entire series and agreed ,-1,NintendoNX
Raiguard,it will be revealed tomorrow always ,1,NintendoNX
Raiguard,the big cartridge is the guts of the nx itself not the game the cartridge includes a game card slot for whatever game you play ,1,NintendoNX
Raiguard,i play with my hype levels,1,NintendoNX
Raiguard,he said this about botw at e3 but never about the nx so i have no idea ,2,NintendoNX
Raiguard,oh wow i really like that it feels like a nice evolution of the pro controller except the scroll wheels i could definitely live without those in fact i do not like them at all ,1,NintendoNX
Raiguard,this comment section is giving me cancer ,1,NintendoNX
Raiguard,10 10 best mockup ever looks just like the real thing o,2,NintendoNX
Raiguard,pull an apple and have 1 usb c port for everything but seriously i think usb c would be the best choice it the most versatile port out there a few of those a headphone jack a micro sd slot and the game card slot ,3,NintendoNX
Raiguard,ooo does not make much sense though ,2,NintendoNX
Raiguard,well that was anticlimactic i was actually expecting it to happen but nope see ya next week cry,1,NintendoNX
Raiguard,iwata san did not die he traveled into a black hole to give fusajiro yamauchi the idea to start nintendo he saved us all ,3,NintendoNX
Raiguard,where we are going we do not need roads smirk ,3,NintendoNX
Raiguard,in case anyone else is concerned this is a joke nxdomain is a real thing but it has nothing to do with the nintendo nx ,0,NintendoNX
Raiguard,the nx correlation is a joke but nxdomain is a real thing ,1,NintendoNX
Raiguard,dat ique tho ,2,NintendoNX
Raiguard,this is the best and cleanest mockup i have seen yet great job yeah posting another comment because it so awesome ,2,NintendoNX
Raiguard, let me introduce you to our new baby like all babies it is small and it can make a lot of noise shigeru miyamoto e3 2001 gamecube unveil ,33,NintendoNX
Raiguard,i was thinking more along the lines of an announcement announcement like they post on twitter tomorrow join us for a special nintendo direct on 9 29 to hear all the news on nintendo latest console codenamed nx ,9,NintendoNX
Raiguard,glad to know that today was in fact a monday ,12,NintendoNX
Raiguard,the only thing i would change is replace the power and dock ports with a single usb 3 1 type c port that can do both plus data transfer edit oh and move the right joystick to the top to mirror the left ,1,NintendoNX
Raiguard,the console startup splash screen is a picture of trump laughing with a middle finger ,1,NintendoNX
Raiguard,are you sure it at 1 21 gigawatts ,2,NintendoNX
Raiguard,maybe we should make a separate subreddit r nintendonxshitposts,3,NintendoNX
Raiguard,the wii u ,1,AskReddit
Raiguard,do not nx and drive kids rip ,2,NintendoNX
Raiguard,stand up in the middle of class and shout hallelujah ,1,NintendoNX
Raiguard,just a few things i would change 1 usb c 3 1 2 no disc reader just cartridges for both consoles it takes up a ton of space is obsolete and would make the games much more expensive to produce if people want a disc drive for backwards compatibility they could buy a peripheral disc drive that would connect to one of the usb c ports 3 instead of mario it should be breath of the wild nice job with the mockup though that looks amazing ,2,NintendoNX
Raiguard,well then how about an add on disc reader that connects to one of the usb 3 0 ports then you could have back wards compatibility if you so desire even for dual screened wii u games by utilizing the mobile console as the second screen ,2,NintendoNX
Raiguard,my overdrive switch is broken d ,2,NintendoNX
Raiguard,soon ,3,NintendoNX
Raiguard,nintendo nex pronounced necks as a throwback to the nes as well as an acronym for nintendo experience also because it cool ,1,NintendoNX
