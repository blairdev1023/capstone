Fettnaepfchen,give it some time and talk to your urologist stress works greatly in creating erectile dysfunction so i would attribute your trouble to the stress from and the closeness to the event surgery just for your information the main portion of the seminal fluid comes from the prostate not the testicles and stress also lowers the amount of ejaculated fluid volume vice versa long foreplay and excitement can increase the volume i would not assume that losing one testicle makes you infertile but again the urologist is the most competent specialist for your questions ,2,medical

Fettnaepfchen,cancerous growths often change and grow fast if you had cancer you would likely have noticed changes over the last months lymph nodes hardening and increasing in size baking clumping together or becoming immobile b symtoms like fever night chills unwanted weight loss or be very ill by now monitoring your lymph nodes makes no sense in your situation there is simply no reason same goes for asking others how many lyph nodes they were able to palpate in their necks etc if you google pictures of cervical lymph nodes you will see that there are many location can have variation if you were not so worried you would have been a good candidate for the occasional med students physical examination class so they can palpate the lymph nodes for studying as it is you should try to shift focus away from them though your life quality will suffer from the health paranoia and anxiety you should really get counseling because the extent of worry is not normal and you might not be able to stop worrying on your own everythign on our body has quirks and variants and can seem worrying if you were to watch your breathing sounds or heartbeat you would surely also be able to find something not exactly symmetrical or regular people get bad anxiety about that too although it is physiological and normal hyperfocussing on one item is never good nor helpful ,1,medical
Fettnaepfchen,we actually had a coincidentally related case report in my last pediatrics symposium last year there was a young woman who showed up with unexplained weight gain and all her lymph nodes clearly palpable doctors did all the tests for tumor markers etc nothing imaging showed masses in the abdomen she happened to have pica an eating disorder and had been eating stones every day on her walks with the caretaker and was simply extremely skinny due to not eating enough normal food and that was why the doctors were able to palpate lymph nodes you usually can only palpate when they are enlarged they were so clearly palpable that everyone was stumped although retrospectively they met no criteria of being malignous people just did not think of it because of the weight gain and were misled until someone pointed out the skinniness and the stones showed up on the x ray i can assure you that my medical textbooks state that you can indeed feel lymph nodes in some locations given a superficial position and low subcutaneous fat sometimes lymph nodes can be reactive and stay enlarged even after the infection has disappeared too i do not know what you read online but the internet while vast does not hold all the answers after all be well ,1,AskDocs
Fettnaepfchen,currently it seems to be localized and you describe it has been for quite a while but i would rather be safe than sorry having a constant infection is not for your health in general and it cannot be comfortable either i would not go about digging around there on your own because in the worst case you could spread the inflammation deeper into the tissue a surgeon might also be able to help if those need to be drained but many internal docs and dermatologists do these kinds of small surgeries too i d probably see a dermatologist or you can call your pediatrician and ask which doctor he suggests as most appropriate ,2,medical

Fettnaepfchen, i am starting to think that this is the hidden factor in some early stage melanomas killing people not necessarily each and every sample is sent to pathology in case of larger surgery in the clinic you get first fast results about the safety margins being clear or not during the surgery if the safety margin is deemed insufficient in any direction the pathologist gets marked tissue and can say which side requires more excision there will usually be a revision surgery where more tissue is cut out to hopefully reach the safety margin meaning the area of 0 5 1 or 2 cm needs to be clear of malignous cells melanoma simply metastasizes pretty fast and thus has a bad outcome in general unless it is caught early enough in situ so if there was a systematic mistake in cutting them out too shallow they would catch it and give feedback accordingly at some stage and with some cancers it makes sense to cut out bone and muscle too think neck dissection or amputation of limbs with osteosarcoma but if something has metastasized badly to many organs and is a cancer known to respond badly to additional treatment you might as well leave the muscles functional as not to impact life quality too much for the rest of the palliative treatment i believe the outcome is generally bad because higer stage melanomas are a fucking nasty and ruthless thing purely hypothetical but i could imagine that people notice suspicious moles on the extremeties easier and sooner than those on the side or back of the trunk on the hairy scalp so those are more likely to have reached a higehr stage when diagnosed ,1,Dermatology

Fettnaepfchen,usually the hospital doctors would be the ones to ask they would also know whom to turn to for medical transport and if an insurance covered hospital transfer is something they have had experience with in the past you can try asking insurance too normally you do not just transport an unconscious person privately without medical staff accompanying them locum doctors do assisted medical transport but with her level of care you might need an intensive care nurse too or similar ,1,medical

Fettnaepfchen,bedwetting can be the first or only sign of a subtle uti as an irritation of the bladder takes place the typical burnign while urinating can occur but it does not always start with it sometimes all you notice is a higher frequency of urination with smaller amounts the urge sets in earlier a simple pee stick at the doc would easily rule out an uti until then stay well hydrated but stop hydrating an hour before bedtime so you can pee in time and go to sleep with an empty bladder ,3,AskDocs
Fettnaepfchen,wow how insane i believe in germany the lab charges under 20 euro per mmr titer so that would be 60 euro max for mmr titers taking blood costs 3 7 euro so the bill would be significantly lower here a list in german for extra labs that you can privately order http labor28 de fileadmin user upload preisliste igel pdf measles and mumps is 13 99 eur each as of today i will never work or live in the us that for sure ,1,AskDocs
Fettnaepfchen, also she used to love soccer and was great at it even on the travel select team in our area she got three concussions in two years and the doctor recommended she take a break that was a year ago it is taking its toll on her she does not want to play any other sport and will not exercise just to exercise unless she has shown neurological issues from the two concussions there is no reason for her not to take soccer up again it a great sport and if she loves it let her do it of course i am not her doc but i am a doc and have a soccer sister but unless they had a very pressing reason to stop the soccer training the risk of getting a concussion again is pretty low she has some kind of influence on it i guess depending on how she plays while the advantages are clear it a team sport you need both strength and stamina it great for team spirit not wanting to exercise just to exercise is understandable many people commute by bicycle to combine both exercise and necessity and again soccer training is good for mental and physical health especially when she enjoys it and is good at it too support her in that and you will be on the right way if she took a year off she might or might not have starting issues easing back into it but silently have her back and she will notice and appreciate it even if she does not say or cannot acknowledge it yet i would frankly not be too strict about the eating habits when you feel it creates defensive behavior and refusal eating bread and pasta is not ideal but not hazardous unless she eating huge amounts what is more critical is when she does not eat regularly because the metabolism will switch to storing energy as it feels it in a situation of reduced ressources a compromise would be offering healthy balanced meals with smaller amounts of pasta or deep fried stuff she might feel stubborn about external attempts to make her diet so do not force it my personal favourite diet is to eat half do not cut out anything but keep the amount small and do not overeat on things like sweets etc that also helps to avoid cravings of things you constantly forbid yourself it is reasonable to generally minimize the consumption of empty calories like soda and juice and either do not buy them or only have them rarely cook and eat healthy in general and keep offering eating regularly is definitely important in not gaining weight even if it sounds paradox a bit of pasta is not the problem when she starts taking up soccer again healthy weight loss can be slow as little as eight kg per year i worked in a lipide ambulance and reha sports centre with patients dealing with cardiovascular and degenerative issues and adipositas per magna the goal is to keep her active and give her healthy options she needs to want change otherwise she will not accept it but that can take time ,1,xxfitness

Fettnaepfchen,if you have been born prior to 1970 you are likely to have been vaccinated once or not if you have been vaccinated against mmr once in childhood a booster second mmr immunization is recommended if you have received that booster another booster third mmr dose is generally not necessary if you are not sure what boosters you got you might want to do the titers if you are sure the boosters were for mmr you do not need another booster or titers unless you are known to be a nonrepsonder some people are unlucky and require several boosters to gain a proper immune response and some never get it but that the exception not the rule if you do not know what kind of boosters you received generally mmr is usually given as combination as it is more expensive in single doses other popular booster shots would be tdap tetanus diphteria pertussis every ten years where you can also get separate tet dipht and a single pertussis booster although the combination vaccine is generally used most adolescents and young adults get the tdap booster mmr has only recently gained more popularity since the vaccination refusers and measles parties fans caused unexpected outbreaks in the last years as herd immunity waned hepatitis a b can also be given as combination or separately every ten years or titer control ,1,AskDocs
Fettnaepfchen,did you have one or two of each of these indiviual vaccinations the current recommendation as far as i know is to get two vaccinations in total for max protection so you can either get a booster with the mmr or wait if the titers are good enough on their own the mmr vaccine is generally cheaper than the individual titer tests if that is of any concern if you have unknowingly high titers and get vaccinated a second time the local reaction might be a bit more uncomfortable if you are unlucky but that about it ,1,AskDocs

Fettnaepfchen,possibly the blisters develop on the skin but since the nerve is affected and inflamed i could imagine it also causing radiating muscle pain yeah shingles is typically known to go around one half of the chest or back but can also affect a whole thigh or leg an arm or half of the face a friend of mine had it in the ear canal and on his eye and needed to be hopsitalized because of the pain the earlier you treat it with antivirals the less pain will develop and ibuprofen or similar can be taken to take the edge off the pain it usually starts with sensitivity to the touch maybe tingling or burning and when the blisters come you can be certain that it shingles ,2,medical

Fettnaepfchen,staying hydrated is always a good idea because dehydration can cause the blood volume to decrease temporarily as water is drawn out of the blood to put it simple if there are any cardiovascular diseases or cardiovascular deaths especially early ones below 50 years of age in your family it might be worth bringing it up with the gp just to be sure but otherwise it was likely nothing serious taking blood samples from the finger can be tricky as well depending on how warm your hands are how deep you pricked yourself etc so your trouble with that is not really reliable to jusge your blood thickness without having been there ,1,AskDocs

Fettnaepfchen,i did not mean to insinuate you were accusing anyone of drug seeking and i was not suggesting narcotics in the first place either so i wondered what you meant you are right overprescription of narcotics can be an issue depending on where you work live and as usual and similar to antibiotics it also depends on the doctor in question how justified prescriptions are or not op is probably frustrated and in pain and it can be hard to take the edge off it just sounded as if the pain management was not properly discussed in most cases a combination of sufficient advil and warmth rest etc should be fine but you will always meet people who wonder why the lowest dose of ibuprofen is not working and who do not know what dose to take ,1,AskDocs
Fettnaepfchen,i did not say narcotics were needed but usually docs follow the who escalation scheme which starts with nsaids combines them and if that does not help adds a mild opiate like codeine escalation is done step by step op might be good with just an optimized cobination of otc nsaids or a combination of an nsaid and a muscle relaxer they stated that otc does nothing but did not state which nsaids they tried just that they are taking advil and tylenol now but we do not know at which dosage or frequency in which strength and in what combination the doctor should have discussed pain management with them and that would have included the aforementioned questions it sounded as if not much of the like was discussed at all that said not treating pain adequately this is up to the physician to evaluate if a muscle is stone hard stronger pain meds or alternatives can be indicated is medical malpractice i do agree that it not state of the art to go from low dosed paracetamol for example to fentanyl but no one was suggesting that i know that drug seekers are a concern worldwide but not taking pain seriously is as bad as just giving out pills like candy ,1,AskDocs
Fettnaepfchen,the problem with anxiety and also depression is that it can manifest in subtle shades it not always an obvious full blown panic attack as long as your o2 saturations are good there is no trouble at all when it happens again try breathing slower on purpose and not deeper or faster try relaxing as hard as it is if you have unknowningly breathed out too much co2 the lowered breathing reflex decreased frequency of breaths per minute might make you think you are not breathing enough and trigger a mild anxious response as you are noticing it making you worry breathing normally happens automatically and subconsciously and you do not think about it once you start watching it it easy to get concerned similar to how people start watching their heart beat and obsess about it if it really a co2 issue breathing slower and less deep for a few moments which might feel counterintuitive should make the co2 accumulate again to normal levels and you should feel normal again when you feel the compulsion to breathe more and more deeply yet feel it does not help just tell yourself to stop for a moment and observe real dyspnea with lack of oxygenation will feel very different and not resolve as easily again it would show a drop in oxygen saturation too as long as that is not happening you are good i know that easier said than done believed but give it a try ,1,AskDocs
Fettnaepfchen,this is actually quite common i believe most people have had this feeling once or a couple of times in their lives and it usually a non issue unless you obsess about it more often it is indeed mental anxiety related a safe way to find out would be to do a quick pulsoxymetry where they measure the o2 saturation in your blood via a red light clip on your finger non invasive if your sats are 98 99 you do not have a lack of oxygen no matter how it feels and it likely to be anxiety have you had a bodyplethysmography at the pulmonologist like a spirometry lung function but in a glass chamber for higher accuracy it sounds paradox but this kind of feeling can occur when you focus too much on breathing deep enough our body physiology usually makesregulates breathing just fine without us needing to take action i am not sure but maybe hyperventilating knowingly or unknowningly and focussing on inhaling deper and deeper also plays a role lowering the co2 is usually depressing the breathing reflex similar to how deep water drowning works sometimes a relative lack of co2 in your blood from exhaling so much while trying to take deep breaths can cause dizziness etc ,1,AskDocs

Fettnaepfchen, is my foreskin not retracting really that important that it worth seeing a doctor for it can become an issue once you get sexually active because it could cause pain or discomfort or even end in an mergency when you have a glans that gets trapped and cut off circulation by a too tight foreskin paraphimosis hygienically too it is preferable to have it retracting as it should be so you can clean your penis properly simply with water so yes i would definitely consult a doctor about it this is essentially what they are there for circumcision would definitely be the last resort and could be necessary if you ever suffer a bad infection or inflammation that could carry the risk of adhesion to the glans which is why retracting and cleaning is an important function or if you get into a parapohimosis by accident eg when retracting a too tight foreskin too early over the glans by consulting your doc and doing proper stretching with steroid creme doc will advise you on the stretching technique you will be set up for the best result so yes going to the doc now or in a couple of months will aid you in avoiding potential emergency circumcisions ,1,AskDocs

Fettnaepfchen,the first course of treatment would be steroid creme and stretching you do not need to get a circumcision and if you really cannot stretch it enough despite the cream they could just make a tiny snip on the side to enlarge the opening enough for retraction at your age i would think waiting and strecthing is a good start but as others said be careful not to retract a too tight foreskin on a half erection lest you suffer paraphimosis which can be dangerous deoending on the degree and situation be gentle with yourself and bring it up when you are ready the docs see so many cases of this they wo not be scandalised especially in europe sorry or nearly europe damn brexit i know it more difficult for you but when you can just be brave and tell the doc so they can help you you could even write your ped a letter and ask this way or maybe start with asking a pharmacist take care and you can do it it will probably go fatser and better with steroid creme but i think you are still good and can manageit eventually without getting a circumcision take care ,3,AskDocs

Fettnaepfchen, but their severity is up for debate by whom it really not if you get into the research history of depression no one in these times doubts that depression can range from light and subtle to debilitating and sometimes causing suicidality it has actually been a great break through for patients everywhere that depression is nbow being so well researched and accepted when years ago it used to be just a bad mood swing all in your head because you do not want to feel better etc people can actually be helped these days mostly without the stigma which is something worth celebrating ,1,AskDocs
Fettnaepfchen, prolonged sadness can only do so much i do not know how to make it clear to you other than maybe asking your psychiatrist directly or telling you to grab some psychiatry and psychology books not the popular reading kind the scientific kind but that statement wrong everyone seems to refer to the layman everyone in the health care profession is pretty unified on what fatigue is we do not always know what causes it because it can be a symptom of many different illnesses but fatigue is fatigue be it light moderate or severe fatigue and i am talking about the medical term which is taught in med school used in psychiatry and oncology etc alike can range from only quoting what you specified to make it clear mild drowsiness to exhaustion being unable to get out of bed there is more shades of fatigue and of course every individual feels it subjectively someone who has no issue likely does not have fatigue this is why you cannot measure depression and fatigue in absolute numbers but rather have multiple sets of questions to generate a score fatigue is gradual depression can cause it please believe those specialists who actually studied psychiatry and do not assume you know it better when the topic has been well researched i try to understand where you are coming from but it difficult do you fear the stigma of depression or do you have trouble seeing yourself as someone suffering from depression would you rather have one separate organic illness than a mental diagnosis would not you give therapy a try as the depression is accepted and treated your other symptoms that are related to it may improve greatly that does not mean that you do not have other health issues but you need a wholesome approach to heal i really recommend listening to your doctors and potentially seeing a psychosomatic specialist in addition to a psychiatrist allow yourself to feel better ,1,AskDocs
Fettnaepfchen,how is your appetite are you eating regularly or sometimes forget or only eat bites loss of appetite fatigue and loss of motivation can have different causes sometimes several combined like depression plus a metabolic issue and subtle eating irregularities could appear too have you gotten even more sedentary so muscle mass loss could also be a factor as for the thyroid i hear your levels are normal but do you have normal test results to compare them to from before this started some people really suffer from a light hypo or hyperfunction and vice versa some feel fine on a light hyper or hypofunction similar to how some people have a slightly lower core temperature than normal in their healthy state and we do not know why that is it would be nice to compare the old values to see if you always had the same levels as now or if you had in fact slightly elevated or lowered levels in your good times hormones are a sensitive thing did they do a thyroid ultrasound there were good suggestions on other differential diagnoses as well and i hope you get to the root of it soon some people take worse to the change from an active to a less athletic lifestyle because the body metabolism is adapting to the change so maybe that plays a role too the weight loss really is not normal and i hope you feel better soon take care ,2,AskDocs

Fettnaepfchen,i agree addressing the ra directly is definitely worth a try so find yourself a good rheumatologist op if you do not have one in general when you communicate your pain issues with the gp they would usually follow the who pain medication escalation guidelines or involve a pain management specialist who can go through the possibilities and their limitations with you while generally reliable not every medication works the same for everyone either so discussing this with a specialist is always a good idea it definitely better than just aiming for a good script because depending on your location more or less doctors are wary of drug seekers and unfortunately many people with legitimate pain issues have had trouble getting adequate pain management and have been labelled drug seekers despite really being sick and not pleasure seekers if you are open with your pain and priorities you are more likely to be taken serious ,1,medical
Fettnaepfchen,i thought of it because it is extremely common in adolescents and harmless i remember reading about it short before or after finishing med school and it definitely was not during lectures but a coincidence out of school and realizing that it matched what i had experienced quite frequently when i was younger too it just stopped happening eventually and i would always thought of it as some sort of side stitches in another place it is not a popular term despite occurring so often maybe because it not really associated with any real clinical consequence or pathology i am not even sure it should be called a disease since it seems to be a functional but benign issue maybe that why it was not taught at cardiology classes in adults there something similar maybe the same but with an added layer of more half knowledge about health more commonly called heart neurosis that is mostly associated with a deep irrational fear of having a heart attack we were taught about that in psychosomatics class and looking back i am wondering why they never brought up pcs as a term just to have it in the back of the head all of that said if someone has concerns i would rather have them listen to intuition and see a doc once too many for a check up than not seeing a gp and being reassured that it nothig is better than staying at home with a real cardiac issue which midddle aged or older people often like to do if op finds that pcs matches i would think they should be able to rest assured though real cardiac trouble usually gets worse with physical activity and in cases of angina pectoris is often relieved by resting ,2,AskDocs
Fettnaepfchen,no depression is an accepted and researched illness why are you set on invalidating other patient experiences they are not at fault depression is a clinical illness and not only a result of bad choices or other illnesses there are conditions and situations when depression becomes a cofactor and a symptom but lumping that together with real depression is not fair to all those who are genuinely struggling chronic illnesses can cause depression because it hard to be happy when everything sucks and hurts but there are bodily perfectly able people who still suffer depression without a real reason other than that they have depression it is a serious illness and often underestimated or trivialized and as often wrongly stigmatized you can see that in those well meant advices like just cheer up or just pull yourslf together that is not how it works and if it works you are maybe in a temporary depressive phase not the same as depression despite the name but definitely do not have clinical depression if you want to find another illness and cannot accept depression as illness see a psychosomatic doc who might be able to help figure out what is what they are specialists of getting to the grounds of it and if there is another cause for the depression they will surely find it if not you have got clarity too ,2,AskDocs

Fettnaepfchen,no it would also not make sense if a neurologist told you it was not necessary you wo not get one if you have not seen one make an appt if you must and really cannot let it go but it will likely be a waste of money if you have been evaluated and no one actually sees any risk of a stroke nothing from your description sounds like a tia which is characterized by neuro symptoms disappearing again without 24 hours so it the only stroke like event without neurological residues and any stroke would have left permanent neurological correlates a lp a lab test at the gp would make more sense although it is already a pretty far fetched idea i have worked in a lipid ambulance otherwise probably would not even know about it ,3,AskDocs
Fettnaepfchen,there you probably have the answer on why you recovered so fast seriously only your gp will be able to address your worries in person and assess your risks in the long term judging from your individual labs your family history lifestyle risks etc one of the few conditions that can cause strokes and heart attacks at a young age is familial hyperlipoproteinemia which is easily ruled out by testing the lp a in a blood test homocygote carriers die in early childhood but if you have no family history of early cardiovascuklar events it really unlikely that you are affected what are you aiming at do you want a head imaging to exclude a stroke you suffered a strange episode that was likely some benign temporary hypotension and recovered quickly all your vitals ae normal electrolytes blood sugar are fine you do not have much to worry about right now and imaging is not really indicated i know it must have been intimidating and your anxiety is likely making it more difficult to rest assured but i would see it as a once off and be happy that it actually was not anything serious see your doc but do not try to find out stuff online there enough what ifs online to make anyone into a hypochondriac and most things described end badly which is not a realistic representation of reality ,2,AskDocs

Fettnaepfchen,very well possible my bet is on a case of bad circulation low blood pressure due to unlucky circumstances some sort of electrolyte imbalance etc you said the heat was making you uncomfortable and coupled with a possible dehydration and sitting position blood likes to pool in the lower extremities and the warmer it is the more the peripheral vessels dilate letting more blood disappear in the lower extremities this could easily cause a fleeting blood pressure drop as soon as you lie down which the emts likely did your blood pressure would recover the reason why we do not keel over every day and are able to do sudden sports activities is because our cardiovascular system is usually very responsive and tightens up vessels to increase blood pressure as soon as it drops it usually happens in seconds not minutes so after a syncopal event minutes would still be plenty and fine considering the circumstances other measures to counteract a low is an increased heartbeat once the blood pressure has stabilized the heart rate returns to normal ,2,AskDocs

Fettnaepfchen,it could have been an orthostatic or vasovagal presyncope due to low blood pressure and dehydration exacerbated by an anxiety panic attack which might have been triggered by this weird and sudden feeling you experienced low blood sugar can cause all symptoms of a stroke too btw if it had been a tia or transient ischaemic attack or a stroke you would not have recovered as quickly back to normal in a minute the blood pressure drop might have caused a temporary hypoxia and brain fog and i am glad you did not get into a serious accident but this really does not sound like a stroke the hospital doctors have a lot of clinical experience and if they examined you and cleared you i would trust them if you are worried let your gp family doc assess yur personal risk for cardiovascular events make a stress ecg ergometer to see how your coronaries and cardiac fucntion is and rest assured when you know where you stand ,3,AskDocs
Fettnaepfchen,depression can cause fatigue that actually a very well known effect a psychosomatic doc would be the one who is best trained to distinguish between organic and mental origins it is well possinle that you have several issues and that not one singular cause is responsible we know that mental conflicts can cause organic symptoms and given enough time these can sometimes manifest and become palpable organic illnesses which is why it good to treat the patient wholesome and from both sides saying straight up that everything is just in your mind is as critical as saying it all physical because it can be both and nothing should be overlooked to get the best treatment result hope you feel better soon light to moderate sports outside does help with depression among other things so it is worth getting back to that lightheadedness palpitations and fatigue can also come from low blood pressure and a not well trained cardiovascular system so maybe start with regular walks as your cardiovascular system gets more exercise it will likely stabilize have you had a stress ecg on an exercise ergometer to see how your heart responds to light to moderate work it is a very simple examination that should have been done also to clear you for sports but i did not see it in your list might have missed it ,1,AskDocs
Fettnaepfchen,fair enough give them a try it might help to take the edge of and get you to the point where you can move better pain often leads to bad relieveing posture which exacerbates the pain or causes other pain in addition see someone sooner rather than later because the earlier this is treated the faster recovery will be if the doc wo not prescribe manual or physiotherapy ask for their direct rates maybe a few sessions of manual therapy massage are not too expensive and they might be worth the money i have personally have these kinds of bad tension hard muscles often but i also often have recurring functional thoracical vertebral blocks once the pain is gone exercises targeting the back muscles and chest muscles for balance can help prevent future pain ,1,AskDocs
Fettnaepfchen,were they prescribed for that issue and for you i would not use other people medications but if you had them in the past and did not react badly to them you can try one prior to going to sleep and hopefully that will help your back relax more i would not self medicate on muscle relaxers on my own in the long term without a physician approval though you can also try lying on a wrapped hot water bottle for fifteen minutes and then try massage tennis ball self massage important try to relax and rest a bit afterwards so the muscles do not get pulled back into the badly tensed position right away some people say running jogging relaxes their backs but anecdotally i can say that this works for my partner but not for me some people also take well to loseing muscle tension by alternating heat and cold the cold causes vasoconstriction and once removed a reactive increase in circulation ,1,AskDocs

Fettnaepfchen,when you are using condoms you are supposed to retract the foreskin and roll the condom over the glans that way it wo not do the gliding you describe condoms do exist in several sizes trying them out once or twice and saying they are uncomfortable like a tourniqet is lazy do not put all the responsibility on the ladies try out different brands and sizes and put it on correctly prevention of stds is as important as prevention of unwanted pregnancy the foreskin is not that long if you feel like you are only sliding in and out of the casing your technique might simply need some practising maybe try deeper strokes for example do you also experience this problem with stimulation when you are masturbating consider that it could be a mental issue performance anxiety playing into it as well another tip would be involving more foreplay that more often helps than not increasing the circulation in both penis and vagina vulva making both parts more ready for enjoyable intercourse generally the vaginal walls are not equipped with too many nerve endings similarly the shaft is less sensitive than the glans so with a full ercetion and retracted foreskin you should get more stimulation from the glans the foreskin usually helps in stimulation not hinders it maybe r sex can help you with helpful tips and shared experiences ,3,AskDocs

Fettnaepfchen,in germany if you want to call yourself a chiropractor as a physician you need to be an orthopaedic specialist 6 years of med school plus another five to six years in both trauma surgery and orthopaedics who then does additional training without that and we are talking about roughly ten plus years of clinical experience in hospital and or they are not allowed to carry the extra specialisation of a chiropractor here the ones often seen an pseudoscientific are osteopaths the orthopaedic senior residents i have worked with who had the extra chiropractics qualification usually were really good and firmly rooted in classical medicine and science using the chiro techniques as addition as they fit most require imaging and extensive physical functional examinations beforehand and when the findings show something critical they will refuse to manipulate the spine and explain to you why as it should be it interesting how different it is from country to country i can only speak for german mds but those who have both the qualification orthopaedics and chiropractics are excellent as far as i can judge them it never crossed my mind that in america chiropractors might be less qualified especially when they are mds i need to ask some of my colleagues who worked overseas about their impressions that said there are many non medical people heilpraktiker natural health professionals in germany who practise chiropractics along with reiki etc and those are the ones i would steer clear from as far as i know osteopathy and chiropractics are only controlled terms for licensed physicians i might be wrong though regulations might have changed and natural health practitioners can use whatever they want for terms they could even sell happiness therapy if they wanted the regulations were pretty lax when i checked last time chiropractical therapy can be very good when done well and very bad when done wrongly so it is definitely important to know who is doing what and to find someone with expertise who is not just selling snake oil the docs i know never advertised themselves as chiropractors but listed it among their additional qualifications mainly they were orthopaedics or did sports medicine ,2,medical

Fettnaepfchen,an ent would be nost likely to give a good evaluation and answer if she cannot taste sweetness at all there might be some odd quirk in her gustatory system maybe the particular receptor somehow does not work as it should i am not sure it should also cause the chalky feeling though so a psychological issue or component is also imaginable to explain the changed perceived haptic i would have imagined it to simply not taste of much because tastes are made up of many components some of whch are non sweet and she should still be able to get those imagine eating a sweetened waffle versus a non sweetened one it does taste different but not bad per se i am not a specialist on gustatory issues though and might be wrong ,3,AskDocs

Fettnaepfchen,were you just active prior to taking the blood pressure or nervous because of being at the doctor with that blood pressure especially the diastolic of 90 in what i assume is a resting situation i would recommend a stress ecg ergometer bike usually to see how your bp reacts and how your recovery rate is from the numbers alone it marginally high but you are very young still and should not have a high resting bp at all being unfit and or overweight can contribute to exaggerated bp spikes under physical stress and if it as simple as that the stress ecg can contribute to finding a good level to start training and building condition if there is any pathology under stress and physical exertion that can not be explained by your fitness and or weight it will also be visible in the stress ecg so it useful either way it could still be related to anxiety even though you do not feel like it is subtlety is sometimes tricky with anxiety and depression if you have a therapist or counselor you like talking to that could be a part of a wholesome approach also you said you loved walking to school but now it not possible anymore how fast was the change for worse gradually or suddenly did you have an infection in the month prior like scarlet fever or a bad tonsillitis some bacteria and virii can cause myocarditis which in turn can either heal completely or cause a weird basket of residual symptoms if your dad does not cooperate you could call and ask your pediatrician for advice hopefully it nothing but either way i hope you find out how to get better take care ,1,AskDocs
Fettnaepfchen,can you see the doc again i would assume that a holter ecg over 24 hours plus a stress ecg on the ergometer bike should be helpful to either rule out or confirm cardiac issues regarding the sinus tachycardia do you have low blood pressure did they ever test the thyroid levels do you usually suffer from anxiety or is it just related to your recent symptoms tachycardia combined with low blood pressure can cause pain chest tightness nausea dizziness palpitations in themselves are often harmless although people worry and are usually only treated with medication when they become symptomatic or people get extremely anxious about them it not overly cautious to rule out organic reasons if you get tachycardic as result of a low blood pressure and low cardiovascular fitness for example it might have a positive effect to start slowly with endurance sports walking swimming and increase the amount gradually you might simply be very unfit or there could be hormonal causes or cardiovascular issues like reentry tachycardia or electrolyte imbalances and it could be related to anxiety or something similar being young and overweight often tempts one to dismiss issues but i would rather get evaluated properly than brush it off without actually knowing what is going on before something gets overlooked ,1,AskDocs
Fettnaepfchen,unfortunately i am not familiar with the time you can use zoloft should not it say on the packaging or did you get them in a plastic bottle from the pharmacy should not there be some sticker with the use by date you could call the pharmacy where you got them from and ask them sorry to be hijacking this post background for my question is that in germany you simply buy a pack of medication in varying size amount and they hand you the original box it always contains a leaflet with instructions on how to take it side effects etc and has an expiration date printed on both the package and the blister pack on the other hand the patient name is not classically printed on the paper box pharmacies can fill pills into special pill dispensers but this is usually only done on request and for a limited time supply i am assuming weekly eg when an old person is not physically or mentally able to handle the tablets by themselves ,1,AskDocs

Fettnaepfchen,plus you can get it at any time later when the prenatal screening shows severe genetic abnormalities that would end in fatal birth defects etc i think it a pretty good compromise you can very well make up our mind about having a baby in the first months and if tragedy strikes it could also mean that the mother life is in danger you still can choose if you want to birth stillbirth or abort depending on how well you could cope with the possibilities i cannot imagine carrying and birthing a dead fetus but others need it for catharsis so to each their own ,1,todayilearned
Fettnaepfchen,my mind was boggled when i heard about those protests in front of abortion clinics in the us this never happens here when you are evaluated to be in medical need for an abortion there is no uproar about it it not like you can just walk in and schedule an abortion to go but you absolutely can and will be supported if you need one there is some informative counseling talk beforehand to inform and offer alternatives to those who are too young or feel like they cannot carry the burden on their own financially and there is also a time limit after which abortions are limited to pressing medical reasons i believe i am definitely glad not to live and work in a restrictive and in terms of sex education and women health backwards country in sheer numbers i do not think we have more abortions only because they are more accessible we have more sex ed in schools and none of that abstinence only crap so people in general seem to be more familiar with their bodies exceptions granted contraception and conception enabling them to have safe r sex ,2,todayilearned
Fettnaepfchen,there has been lots of controversy about a group of dog races including pit bulls because they still get used and bred for illegal dogfighting it a pity because they are such lovely dogs but they have been classified as dangerous breeds and are required to wear those mouth snoutguards in public and be on a leash simply because they are incredibly strong and have the potential to kill and seriously injure people when raised badly although most people would agree that many tiny dogs are more aggressive than a normal not mistreated and mistrained pitbull these laws and regulations are under constant discussion though so maybe we will one day get to the point where these rules are changed yet again ,1,todayilearned

Fettnaepfchen,from the sound of it especially if the pain is always located in exactly the same spot plus variable muscle pain it could be vertebral blocks with muscle dysfunction abnormal tension due to suboptimal posture the problem is that even if the block is mechanically realigned well done chiro can help especially in the beginning the muscles often pull back into the old now wrong position due to tension if there was not trauma or any ither issue you likely need to stick with the physiotherapy and be mindful with your posture no slouched sitting in front of the pc for hours until it is resolved get a second evaluation by an orthopaedic doc or a skilled physiotherapist if you will but keep doing the extercises if you get additional issues like tingling in the extremities or muscle weakness definitely see a doc again too ,1,AskDocs

Fettnaepfchen,i assume that her blood pressure is low because of the hemorrhaging due to residual placentar tissue in her uterus in which case it needs to come out so she stops bleeding the bp is not ideal but if she keeps hemorrhaging the bp will go lower as well if she keeps hemorrhaging it may become an emergency a stable but low bp is a better praeoperative setting than an emergency situation with a sudden rapid drop trauma victims receive emergency surgery with worse vitals as long as the anaesthesia staff knows about the bp they will simply be aware and prepare countermeasures general anaesthesia tends to lower the bp so a starting bp that is slightly elevated is less complicated to deal with but in a healthy young woman she will be able to compensate quite a bit elevated heartrate to start with and for the rest the anaesthetists can give catecholamines and infusions to keep the bp up a d c usually is done under a short general anaesthesia wishing you and your wife and your baby well i am sure the staff is experienced and doing their best to help your wife if you are really worried talk to the anaesthesiologists who will be the one actually managing your wife circulation the surgeon gyn just does his usual job on the other end ,9,AskDocs

Fettnaepfchen,post coital headaches or coital cephalalgia you can separate them into preorgasmic and orgasmic headaches too if i am not mistaken can be related to muscle tension in the neck due to posture to vasospasm migraine possibly also blood pressure changes not sure about that last one but can also be linked to aneurysms cerebrospinal fluid leaks infarctions or bleeding most likely it benign nothing to worry about but since you describe the pain as so intense it worth bringing it up with the doc at the next visit just to check if you are in some risk group for either of the less benign reasons it also more often men who suffer these headaches that said i have already seen two patients in my short career who were both women and suffered strokes during coitus if you have recently adapted new positions that might cause more muscle tension inn your neck and shoulders maybe try to see if another position alleviates the complaint eg lying on your bed do you ever experience these headaches when masturbating ,3,medical

Fettnaepfchen,definitely see a doc after such a fall to rule out hairline fractures etc especially so if it happened during work as workplace related injuries might be handled differently by insurance if there are long term issues the head neck and jaw pain can be related to a concussion and simple muscle tension but could also hint to cervical vertebrae being misaligned etc get checked after such a fall that ended on your face head trauma can also cause smaller intracranial bleeding so i would always be safe rather than sorry cognitive deficits weird feelings like the grogginess etc can all be signs of concussion head trauma and if you do not get enoguh rest during recovery you might not heal recover sufficiently ,2,medical

Fettnaepfchen,it could have been a stroke or a transient ischaemic attack tia and at least it should be ruled out the issues with tias is that while the symptoms are reversible meaning that you recover the paraesthesia motoric deficiency or memory loss that you experience as result of the hypoxaemia the risk of suffering a stroke in the following days and weeks is increased it sounds weird that they did not think of this differential diagnosis during triage because eight hours plus another ten hours sounds ridiculous maybe talk to the nursing staff again and voice your concerns for a tia you can also try calling her primary doc for advice on what to do in the worst case you would leave the er only to be sent back by her doc although if they suspect a tia stroke they might be able to sent her in more urgently if she completely recovers it could also have been too low blood sugar but even then the tia needs to be ruled out after eight hours there is no way to see if the blood sugar was responsible since it will have changed again unless it is still too low usually you do these tests right when the patient gets in alzheimers does not start from one moment to the other ,10,AskDocs

Fettnaepfchen,adding to what the others said chronic sleep deprivation is known to also make cognitive performance worse in german we have got a colloquial term stilldemenz that translates to nursing dementia and refers to the forgetfulness of new mothers although i believe it has less to do with breastfeeding and more with the sleep deprivation associated with newborns and toddlers it not a medical term i believe but the phenomenon is known to be reported every now and then what you describe sounds a bit worse than usual though stress can raise cortisol levels too and depression or even depressive phases can impair cognitive abilities so ongoing therapy or counseling sessions might help surprisingly too even though you already feel better and sound like you worked hard on coping and recovering depressive phases do not necessarily show themselves through extremes like suicidality and extreme downs but can present low key as lack of focus cognitive trouble etc since you experienced ppd i think it not too far fetched that there is a connection especially when your labs were clear and there are no deficiencies etc you might experience a combination of causes so working on each if them might be a good concept i know how hard it is with kids we have two at home and rarely got more than about three hours uninterrupted sleep in one stretch per night in the first three years take care ,14,AskDocs

Fettnaepfchen,good that you mention that i remember a lecturer at a pain managment symposium once who presented data about complaints and spine abnormalities and said that often people had degenerative or slightly abnormal findings without issues and some had normal findings and pain and that screening without reason would just worry those who would not have had problems it was in the context of treating the patient not the images i believe ,2,AskDocs
Fettnaepfchen,it could be a sign of too high blood pressure to start with the simplest but could be many things a general practitioner family doctor or doc for internal medicine preferably with expertise in cardiology should be able to check for both cardiovascular health and take labs for questions regarding nutrition so you do not need to see two docs unless they find something and refer you to a specialist ,2,medical
Fettnaepfchen,the best way would be to approach your regular doc and bring up your family history the type of tumor matters too so if you have documentation from your mom bring it and subsequent worries then you two can discuss what screenings might or might not make sense and how your individual risk is depending on the illness your risk might be increased which could warrant examinations others would not get without pressing reason or it might be statistically normal in which case no extra screening would be needed being proactive is good and i would speak openly with the doc about your concerns ,2,AskDocs

Fettnaepfchen, but i have googled similar situations and have read that it is possible from this type of scenario my best bet is that those scenarios online were a bogus b the people did play around with dirty hands or did not count on precum containing sperm or c the woman was early pregnant from someone else had regular sex with someone else close to that day do not read up such things when you are already worrying you cannot confirm the stories and they will just drive you crazy ,1,AskDocs
Fettnaepfchen,there really should not be doubts because it is not possible to get pregnant without sperm entering the fertile woman vagina plan b is nothing to just take offhandedly so making someone take it out of unwarranted insecurity is not good there should be no tiny shred of doubt if you are familiar with the biological facts behind pregnancy reading similar scenarios that led to pregnancy online is useless since people could be making up stories or lie to fearmonger no sperm in the vagina no baby no matter how you turn it if you want to continue being sexually active this level of anxiety is not going to help when you already feel that anxious about noninvasive sex because if you research the pearl index of contraceptive methods you will see that none of them are 100 safe with condoms a large part of it due to wrong use because manufacturing defects are rare but wrong use is not hypothetically even a vasectomy plus pill and condom yould not guarantee 100 safety realistically correctly used condoms alone are pretty darn safe if you have a long term partner you can add monitoring of the fertile days to the diligent and careful use of condoms and just be abstinent on those fertile days all non invasive play is safe as long as you wash your hands in between touching penis precum and sperm and the vagina vulva do not ejaculate on the woman panties when she still wearing them etc ,2,AskDocs

Fettnaepfchen,in the long term you might benefit from inlay soles for your shoes when walking and standing for a long period of time at the same time you should do exercises to strengthen both the muscles stabilizing your knees and your foot sole and arch preferrably together with a physiotherapist one exercise is to sit on a chair and put sour foot onto a sheet of paper then try to crumple up the paper by pulling up between your heel and your toes sorry for the bad explanation they might advise you to walk barefoot at home it not wrong to prescribe the pain medication but it should be combined with physiotherapy and mild exercise aqua gymnastics can also work in some cases although i am not sure how well it works for knee issues it great for spine issues though weight loss in general is a good general advice to reduce strain on the joints but one should not automatically assume the overweight is the problem because it is not always the solution not all obese people have joint problems but doctors are quick to stop looking for an underlying issue once your bmi is deemed too high of course often it can be simple degenerative issues from excessive strain and arthrosis due to obesity and building functional muscle has never hurt someone but sometimes there is an actual injury that needs treatment issues like patellae chondromalacia benefit greatly from physiotherapy independently of weight so conditions like that should be ruled out ,1,medical

Fettnaepfchen,the hot water in the new pool your preference to not use products and the pictures of the initial rash which does look a lot like eczema and not like molluscum make me wonder if the skin simply needs more moisturization care the chlorine content might be higher in that pool or the temperature warmer and usually the skin benefits from the chlorine being washed off gently eg with her usual baby shampoo you can use that for the body too after swimming and the skin being cared for afterwards any mild lotion she tolerates well or get a recommendation from the pharmacy it might have started off virally and continued because the chlorine and heat dried out the skin and affected the natural protective ph and bacterial balance of the skin same goes for winter or climates with very dry air i would say give regular moisturizing with a not strongly perfumed lotion a try ,2,AskDocs

Fettnaepfchen,i am wondering how you feel let down when you did not take her to the doc again when the otc treatment did not work they might have misdiagnosed the rash when they first saw it and thought it was some local reaction at the ankle but should have been reconsulted when the rash spread so much the spreading pattern might help them diagnose what it is i would personally not continue with the hydrozole if it does nothing unless the doc gives some reasoning as to why only a pediatric dermatologist or a good pediatrician will be able to give your child a thorough examinattion so i would most definitely go and see one you need to see it in person to evaluate it properly preferrably with a magnifying glass the images are hard to evaluate for us molluscum is one option although the papules are usually 3 5mm with a central indentation it does not look like classic hives or eczema and not really like the classic fungal rash either viral infections can cause benign rashes that disappear as the infection subsides but a month would be unusually long some small kids react to currant or citrus with rashes although those often feel like sandpaper or look reddish reactions to food and detergents can look different in different individuals so someone with clinical experience with kids rashes can evaluate it best ,2,AskDocs

Fettnaepfchen,is it hot and humid where you are living there could be several reasons there mihgt be an actual rash due to sweating irritation possibly like a small eczema or mild fungal skin infection like pityriasis hormonal changes plus the wrong fabric and sweating playing together for example and there could be stretchmarks independently of that so if they look different and appeared at different times they might be coincidental issues so far functionality is the priority so congratulations on successfully breastfeeding without issues in the end seeing a dermatologist would be the safest way to find out the nature of the marks considering that there is numbness but i agree that it likely nothing emergent when there is no pain lumpy feeling or abrupt change i would definitely bring it up with the next doctor you see be it the gp or gyn you might even ask the pediatrician at the next well visit i know they are not treating adults and are not the ones to approach but since it concerns nursing related body parts i think it fair enough to ask for example you could ask them if it was appropriate and safe for breastfeeding likely it is to try out a topical treatment if any kind to see if that changes anything ,1,Dermatology
Fettnaepfchen,your gyn or the midwife could probably evaluate it best stretch marks often feel a bit depressed like little gaps while allergic rashes often are raised like hives if they disappear again and reappear on different spots they are also not stretch marks because those would be permanent the red colour would fade in time maybe they look a bit atypical because of the implants i have so far never seen fresh stretchmarks on breasts with implants so this is a guess there are dermatologists around here so you might get more input you can try getting a sharper picture of the red area too for better evaluation with they are getting bigger did you refer to the red marks or breas size do the marks itch any allergies new detergents etc ,1,Dermatology
Fettnaepfchen,difficult to say might be stretchmarks which would not be bad but the image really is not conclusive if you also experience fever and flu like symptoms always be aware of mastitis btw judging from the line below your breast you should get new nursing bras whatever you are wearing now is too tight the curcumference usually expland a size when breastfeeding and especially during the beginning first months cup sizes might change several times first up then down again util it stabilizes hot milk has excellen nursing bras generally avoid anything that is too tight as it can cause issues with the milk flow and mastitis and do not use bras with underwire take care and keep watching the changes ,1,Dermatology

Fettnaepfchen,if anything you will need to wait until you are of age until you can try to find a doctor willing to work with you while i do not agree with your approach and evaluation of your choices i can kind of understand a part of it the suffering is real although the rationale behind it is not something everyone would agree with for example some people suffer from conditions where they do not identify with one limb or another physical trait but that does not mean doctors can just go around and chop off limbs you do have bodily autonomy and can decide what you want to do with yourself but you cannot force others to aid you when they suspect the wish is based on an underlying treatable condition after reading around it actually seems to be possible to paralyze the vocal chords with botox injections this would be something that might help you yet would not be permanent eg you would need to repeat the therapy regularly retaining the chance to decide to unmute yourself again or stay mute for as long as you wish i think once you have reached adulthood this would be a procedure that you could possibly find a doctor for at least more likely than finding one for permanent surgery you seem to already have a counselor and if they after years of therapy eventually agree that being mute would be the best compromise to increase your life quality botox could really be something to discuss i am not familiar with it but as far as i know it is relatively safe when used by a professional with enough experience the patient i have read about wanted to mute themselves to get rid of a stubborn inflammation of the vocal chords i still think there can be better outcomes but if you insist and can not change your mindset over the years that would be the most acceptable way of muting yourself that i could cautiously see ,1,medical

Fettnaepfchen, its a cyst removal medical students and 1st year residents with very little experience remove cysts with no issues they are either very good or this was a very incompetent dermatologist while cyst removal is simple it seems like the main mistake was to have a separate person marking the area wrongly the dermatologist should have said something if there was not in fact a cyst but there is indeed a possibility of this being a second cyst i agree that there should be plenty of communication if pathology received a cyst op might simply have had two or a new one if path received nothing it easier to make a point i believe ,2,AskDocs
Fettnaepfchen,they should have said to the doctor that they forgot to mark the cyst beforehand and were not able to palpate it anymore then the doctor could at least have palpated it critically to see if the location was correct or if it was not possible to pinpoint the cyst anymore asking the patient to point out such a small cyst at that stage after the area has been numbed and is swollen is not standard ,2,AskDocs

Fettnaepfchen,it might be a thrombosed vein they can look and feel promising but never yield blood usually they do not heal when they are completely thrombosed keep telling the nurses and docs what your experience is and ask them to use another vein for the future this is why it is essential to compress properly and for a few minutes after a stick blood draw it minimizes the risk of vein thrombosis at least that what the vascuzla surgeon taught us take care ,6,AskDocs

Fettnaepfchen,the pertussis booster is combined with tetanus and diphteria tdap which are all dead vaccines mmr are live weakened and are not given in combination with the tdap if you meant that there is a booster for mmr as well that true both make sense too since adults often loose immunity we just had a few surprise measles outbreaks among health care staff and adults in berlin over the last years leading to recommendations of getting a second booster when you only received one as a child usually adults born before 1985 at least in germany ,1,videos
Fettnaepfchen,was that during the last trimester it something done in the uk but not yet done in germany and i believe the theory is that the foetus benefits passively from the mother antibodies for a while after birth to try and close the gap where newborns and infants cannot be vaccinated yet definitely a good thing ,1,videos
Fettnaepfchen, this is another very important reason to vaccinate your kids to add this is also why it makes sense to get a vaccine booster tdap as grandparents parents when someone in the family gets pregnant because the immunity sometimes lessens as time goes by ,1,videos
Fettnaepfchen,it does resemble mild nail clubbing which can occur with chronic hypoxia marfan syndrome etc interestingly enough it also seems to be related to celiacs in some kids but if it has always been that way it might just be a normal variant i have spent some time in asia and many of my friends also had nails that seemed a bit larger like yours i noticed because it seemed like an advantage when playing guitar in the evenings that is just my subjective impression though and might have been coincidence if the doctor cleared you after a general check up i would not worry about it too much unless you experience other problems or the shape changes even more the deviated nasal septum should not cause relevant hypoxia if that is your question an issue with a cardiac septum might be a different story ,2,AskDocs
Fettnaepfchen,i agree i have also met enough patients who were afraid of using opioids in post surgical care because they did not want to get addicted it a bit like steroid creme for dermatological issues patients are afraid of getting thin skin while you can get addicted to opioids and yes long term use of cortisone cream can have negative effects on your skin not every treatment causes those unwanted side effects and not in short term use anyway and sometimes these meds are more than appropriate as treatment opioids are a blessing for pain managment as long as you use them responsibly and according to the who schemes escalating from nsaids etc there a time and place for everything prescribing opioids for headaches definitely sounds like something that should be an exception and at least doubtful judgement the goal is appropriate pain control while minimizing risk of addiction exactly and sometimes when you have ongoing extreme pain or palliative care you need to weigh benefits and risks i have heard relatives of palliative care patients sceptical of opioids because what if grandpa got addicted that was sad i mean when grandpa is dying and has terminal cancer pain pain management trumps addiction especially since we are talking about a terminal addiction wo not matter for long patient ,3,science
Fettnaepfchen,that is true but ageusia loss of taste is a known condition albeit more rare than anosmia loss of smell which also leads to loss of taste or can at least impact taste greatly both can be caused by infections among other reasons ,2,medical
Fettnaepfchen,viral infections can cause temporary or permanent anosmia inability to smell and subsequently taste smell is a big part of tasting the tongue receptors basically can distinguish between sweet salty umami sour and bitter the other nuances are tanks to our sense of smell it weird that you can smell normally but ageusia loss of taste is not unknown although it is more rare than anosmia loss of smell in total the three components stations necessary for taste are the taste buds cranial nerves vii x and ix and your brain viral infections scarlet fever autoimmune conditions like sjogren syndrome hypothyroidism b12 or iron deficit diabetes chemo or radiation therapy among others like cell toxic processes neuritis of the cranial nerves encephalitis or brain tumors neurodegenerative conditions like alzheimer multiple sclerosis traumatic brain injuries etc but also trivial causes like smoking medications or bad mouth hygiene can cause ageusia in varying degrees from partial to total loss of taste i would wager it is a matter of the current infection affecting your sense of taste i would hope that it returns as the infection subsides but it would still make sense to exclude other causes especially when you do not feel like it getting better as the infection subsides anosmia and ageusia should still be evaluated by a doctor usually ents sometimes together with radiologists and some university hospitals have special centres for ageusia a thorough anamnesis will help to get the baseline how sudden was the onset is the taste completely gone or diminuished etc later on there are gustometric tests conventional and electrogustometry gustatory evoked potentials in the eeg to try and classify the extent of the condition and to find out which of the three stations mentioned above is affected for now let hope it jst a side effect of having a bad cold ,1,medical
Fettnaepfchen,this is definitely not the time for steroid creme anymore especially if it has gotten bigger and is as painful as you said a wound specialist needs to reevaluate this as soon as possible debridement sounds likely alternative treatment with medical maggots might work out too the debride the necrotic tissue only but it not a standard method please get seen and take care ,1,medical

Fettnaepfchen,mostly agree but running water over the scoop just spreads more bacteria over the sink unless you also clean the scoop with a brush and soap to cover all the crevices keeping the one poop scoop close to the litter box in a separate small bucket or whatever is more hygienic that a halfhearted rinse after each use when the scoop is still damp litter will stick to it like hell too so i simply would not bother with that step maybe give it a thorough cleansing when you clean the whole litter box that should be enough ,7,AskDocs

Fettnaepfchen,did you directly address your odor perception to the urologist again a bit of odor depending on how well you wiped dabbed after peeing how much you were sweating and what you were eating is normal if you did not have sexual contact an infection like gardnerella is very unlikely i also just remembered that for gardnerella you can simoply swab and look for clue cells under a microscope it does not even require sending it in you are probably sensitized to your penile appearance through the ppp and insecure but i assure you no penis ever has been fragrance free not even jesus would have had a pristine penis the body sheds cells and bacteria degrade proteins it not a shame it courteous to wash up prior to having sexual contact anyway and intercourse should involve condoms to protect against infections and pregnancy so i really thinnk you should not worry too much be confident ,1,AskDocs

Fettnaepfchen,you should seek an allergist and get tested blood test labs rast and a skin prick scratch test definitely avoid the food irems that make you feel that way especially when it causes swelling around your mouth or nose testing is useful because sometimes there are cross allergies and it might help you avoid other allergy triggering foods without going through trial and error nuts and legume peanut allergies often cross with certain pollen and stone fruit like peaches or apples but there are some that also react to latex etc getting tested will ease your worries because ou will be able to see what is safe and what you should avoid in the future sometimes the reaction also only occurrs with the raw food item not with the roasted cooked one so discuss all of your questions with the allergist dermatologists often do that but you can call the office and ask beforehand if they do it they will also be able to tell you if you need to visit your pediatrician first likely the case since you are 15 ,1,AskDocs
Fettnaepfchen,it not impossible to have heart palpitations but it could also be anxiety a holter ecg for 24 hours would likely be the best ways to either confirm the palpitations or lack thereof even if there are palpitations as long as they do not cause circulatory issues they usually do not need to be treated very low doses of medication can however be used if the palpitations cause great anxiety in the patient most likely your heart is not stopping and you are fine i do understand that you are worried though since it worries you so much discuss the holter with your doc are you diagnosed with and treated for anxiety if not an evaluation might be useful in coping with these situations if it serves the purpose to ease your worries and anxiety and you cannot stop thinking about it a holter ecg might be worth it even when they assume you do not actually have palpitations but be aware that using these ressources costs money and time and some docs are more reluctant to use them than others lastly the feeling to have not gotten anything useful is your side and understandable from the layman view for the er doc who sees tragic cases and death every day several ecgs that show absolutely nothing abnormal are good news so you need to understand their viewpoint as well they are dismissive because they feel confident that it is nothing life threatening again some occasional extrasystoles palpitations are nothing to worry about ,3,medical
Fettnaepfchen,you should be careful not to overdo it with the hot soapy water the natural skin flora plays a part of a healthy balance basically when you wipe out the good bacteria the bad will have a chance to overgrow bacterial vaginosis for example is more of an imbalance of bacteria that are usually present in small numbers but create problems when they are the dominant bacteria and it can be caused or increased by either really crappy hygiene or overuse of intimate douches etc that destroy the normal protective flora warm water is fine but make sure to use a ph neutral mild ideally nonscented soap or plain water often it fine to just let the body wash run down and use that bit of suds genitals do have a certain smell even when ads suggest everyone should smell spring clean like a flower this is not realistic it fine to have normal body odor and this is usually why regular showering bathing is appropriate but you are right that it needs to be investigated when the odor is strong enough to be noticed by others or when it has really unusual biting qualities or when there is any discharge did the doctor find anything unusual visually or smell wise did they swab for yeast only or for gardnerella too i would not keep treating something that is possibly not there especially if there are no other symptoms did you see a gp urologist dermatologist urologists are familiar with genitals and dermatologists venerologists are also treating stds and skin conditions infections ,1,AskDocs
Fettnaepfchen,smegma does have a particular odor how is your personal hygiene fishy odor in females is generally linked to bacterial vaginosis mainly gardnerella usually males are not affected much meaning that when you treat the bacterial vaginosis you usually do not treat the partner too but that does not mean it could not affect some individuals if it would be a gardnerella overcolonialization antifungals would not touch it since it is bacterial the urologist can swab for this when the fishy smell occurs after ejaculation it might be related to the protein breakup of the sperm ppp would be unrelated and should not cause any smell so i am not sure if you were referring to the ppp or the smell when you mention seven years you said they suspected thrush were there other symptoms redness or pain was the diagnosis confirmed by some test in the past ,1,AskDocs
Fettnaepfchen,with incomplete evacuation without a known cause i would see a gastroenterologist you are pretty young did it gradually start being a problem or was it linked to different food habits stool changes etc they might be able to do a defecography to see if they can find out the cause if there is a motility problem etc ,1,AskDocs

Fettnaepfchen, the only times i have had that happening was with people under lots of blood thinners the moving is in most cases bad technique although that easy to say without having been there but some veins are really more forgiving than others ,1,medical
Fettnaepfchen,hm who did it med students beginners routined phlebotomists you can ask for staff with experience with kids or cancer drug addicted patients or with experience in the er since they might be more skilled drinking plenty of fluid beforehand and keeping yourself warm should help already do you have well visible veins a lot of times people make the mistake to target a visible vein instead of palpating for a good one a vein that can be felt but is invisible will yield better results than a blatantly blueish greenish vein that you cannot feel sometimes a gauge size change smaller needle can help if it always the same place that is palpable yet does not yield blood it might be a thrombosed vein but you should not have several of those i had exactly one patient with what looked like a premium vein that was bound to fail because of thrombosis yet people fell for it and kept beelining for that one tell them to take their time to look properly before starting i usually loosen the tourniquet again if i really searched for too long but you will nearly always find something and tighten it freshly when the time for the draw comes near good luck and i am sorry you had to go through so many unsuccessful attempts ,3,medical
Fettnaepfchen,it could be some inflammatory reaction from the mechanical stress and irritation similar to carpal tunnel or bursitis are you a bit on the hypermobile side regarding joints either way i would talk to an orthopaedic doc when it happens next time and they might be able to prescribe you some physiotherapy to optimize your movements and get on top of the issue before it becomes a chronic degenerative problem i know musicians who had similar ailments and who benefitted from targeted exercise i know it might sound weird since you are probably very strong but a small adjustment of movement or strength might make a difference in the way it affects your performance and the aftereffects ,3,medical
Fettnaepfchen, ubi pus ibi evacua is most surgeons motto definitively evacuate pus when it has formed there is no health benefit when you let it remain in the body and it poses the risk of spreading the inflammation infection it not evidence anymore the antibodies and defense mechanisms of your body are activated upon being presented the bacteria virii or parts thereof right in the beginning the reason why you usually are told to wait and not squeeze an inflamed red pimple without a purulent head is not that it wrong to get the pus out too early but because premature digging and manipulating will cause tissue trauma and in the worst case spread the inflammation ,1,medical

Fettnaepfchen,the body own immune police does indeed register parts of the intruders as to target them specifically but this happens as first step before the bacteria virii are attacked and broken down or eaten by phagocytosis the debris if you want to call pus that is not analyzed again as far as i know it more like leftovers that are merely discarded obviously an immunologist would be able to give a more competent answer ,2,medical

Fettnaepfchen,the fact that the heart starts beating faster when they get up and the static dizziness sounds more like too low blood pressure high bp is more frequently unnoticed unless it high enough to make your head ache and although it can also cause more palpable heartbeats it does not quite fit here you are right that anxiety can also increase the heartrate among other things ,3,AskDocs
Fettnaepfchen,orthostatic or vasovagal presyncope has those symptoms you might have a slow circulation in the morning or low blood pressure and getting up too fast causes the elevated heartrate in an effort to get enough blood to brain and the rest try getting up slowly eg sitting up first waiting then standing ,6,AskDocs

Fettnaepfchen,strange some kind of fungal skin infections can cause hair loss but i am not sure it would look like this i would see a dermatologist to cover the usual suspects of eczema etc but i guess you could try foaming up some head and shoulders and let it sit on that brow for a couple of minutes every day to see if that changes anything about the redness ,1,Dermatology
Fettnaepfchen,do you have an atopic predisposition tendency of getting eczema or seasonal allergies i would see a dermatologist to see if a steroid creme would be suitable ot i do not know how to word this without unintentionally sounding creepy but you have got beautiful eyes lashes but i am sure you know that already ,3,Dermatology
Fettnaepfchen,i was trained in germany the dre for everyone mostly comes from the er evaluation although we were taught that a thorough first exam for a gp should include a full inspection as not to miss obvious moles skin conditions hidden injuries etc no invasive examinations like a pelvic for females those are only done by gynaecologists here realistically this is not done very often simply no one has the time for it and in most cases the symptom oriented exam is totally fine agreeing on the undressing half half which is what gps and gyns tend to do it simply more dignity for the patient no need to make an exam more uncmofrotable than necessary and there should not be room for power trips we do not have that thing from the us where the patient gets weird paper gowns and is completely nude underneath ,3,AskDocs
Fettnaepfchen,ah i overlooked that part true a dre is most definitely not necessary in a fertility check the dre as simple cancer screening generally can make sense if the last physical has been a couple of years ago more so when the patient is 50 y but we usually offer them and do not press it if the patient declines the offer which most do it a bit like the textbook recommendation to let the patient undress and inspect the whole body at a first visit when most of the time the examination is symptom complaint oriented to be efficient ,2,AskDocs

Fettnaepfchen,yeah i worked with stress ecgs for a while with a limited physical examination and i did not use gloves for the cardiac pulmonary exam either i would have agreed previously but since op clearly felt uncomfortable i was thinking about sexual assault in general and where to draw the line handling a penis and testicles might be less invasive than a vaginal exam but it still an intimate area and i was a bit irked that several people immediately rationalized that a crotch grab to a female without consent was definitely assault while it would only bad bedside manner to have forgotten the consent with a male i know that you probably did not mean it that way but even if it had only been a vulvar external inspection that is maybe more equivalent to a testicle exam in terms of invasiveness it would still not make sense to only see it as critical for females ,2,AskDocs
Fettnaepfchen, she asking me to have more sex and that we could do anything we want and she even offered me money to have sex with her be very careful she knows you have the recordings and she might plan to make it look like a consensual relationship or a rented gigolo so i would absolutely not engage further in it there are excellent books on emotional blackmail that might not totally apply but help you undertsand some processes anyway people get into and stay in abusive relationships all the time and it hard to get out of there you are the victim and the conflicting emotions make it hard try to resist and get counselling do not give in do not keep a friendship totally cut her off no casual gettogethers if you can avoid it do not get yourself into an abusive relationship no matter how paradoxically attracted you are right now and do not let her know about your feelings lest she abuses that knowledge and plays to your weaknesses with time and counselling you will be able to overcome this and find joy with other partners in the future physically sex with a person you love will also feel good but it will lack the disgusting sick component you might not know it but looking back in a few years you will see it be patient do not focus on her give yourself time and love yourself as you are i suspect her approach right now is utterly selfish and an attempt to protect herself from your potential allegations ,1,sex

Fettnaepfchen,true op kept it neutral but frankly no doctor of any gender should touch a patient of any gender without consent it would be wrong in all scenarios so lexicanluthor main point is very valid with such a scenario it is easy to jump to the conclusion that it must have been a female patient to feel violated and it is sad and says something about the way we view genders because a non consensual genital exam on a male is and should be scolded as much you cannot say the scenario os fine with a man but not with a woman or any other gender ,3,AskDocs
Fettnaepfchen,hygienically washing and disinfecting hands directly prior to examining is the same or even better for the patient than non sterile gloves non sterile examination gloves are mainly a protection for the doctor to minimize the risk of infection when we are talking about regular external skin exams not mucosa during surgery the patient needs the extra protection from sterile gloves frankly i prefer gloveless examination in some situations fine if you are only doing auscultation and percussion of the back and chest at the gp but i also do not want to touch people doubtfully washed or regularly sweaty axillae and genital areas it also a bit about my comfort too even someone who showers regularly occasionally sweats on their day prior to showing up in the clinic ,3,AskDocs
Fettnaepfchen,i believe everyone benefits from a second pair of eyes especially when they are not of age yet for example it goes both ways because it a protects the patient from inappropriate acts and b protects the doctor from false accusations it not always feasible to have two members of staff around though although nurses are pretty good in checking in in the right moments when the team works together well that said yes female female male male and even female doc and male patient etc examinations are often done without chaperoning which does not mean there is no risk of inappropriate behaviour there in a perfect world there should always be an assistant or someone from the nursing staff attenting the examination we often had med students shadowing who would conveniently take the notes so it can be of advantage for the whole process too depending on the set up ,3,AskDocs
Fettnaepfchen,even with males a complete basic examination includes a digital rectal exam so i do not see a way how this half baked genital inspection without gloves makes sense unless they were asked to check for genital warts etc ,-3,AskDocs
Fettnaepfchen,true but it still kind of unusual and the red flags in op case are the lack of asking consent and the undressing regardless of op gender ,3,AskDocs
Fettnaepfchen, if you are male it sounds like it was more a case of poor communication and poor bedside manner male or female genitals the undressing and examining without consent is not okay in either case only because a male genital is less invasive to touch does not mean it is less intimate and potentially less humiliating for the patient i was taught to use gloves for a physical too at least in the emergency area might be handled differently in walk ins or private practise ,3,AskDocs
Fettnaepfchen,kidney damage tends to occur when you urinate too little flushing through should not have a negative effect ,1,AskDocs
Fettnaepfchen,there is something i would translate to cold related diuresis where exposition to cold leads to vasoconstriction and decreased production of adh some people also feel the need to urinate upon hearing waterflow and i do not know the mechanism behind that one if it psychological maybe you are sensitized to it and react more than others diving and climbing can also cause increased diuresis but i think the pressure changes are bigger than a mere weather change from sunny to rainy have no data on that though what sounds odd is that it not happening once when faceing rain and cold but seems to keep happening i am not sure what mecahnism would cause that aside from the two aforementioned could it be that you start drinking so much that you naturally need to use the toilet more often the more you drink the more you excret normally what happens when it cold you need to pee but do not keep drinking do you really keep peeing larger amounts or smaller amounts at high frequency even when there is no increased input as long as your blood levels kidney labs are fine i would not worry too much when the doc has cleared you but i understand being curious ,1,AskDocs

Fettnaepfchen,what kind of abnormal are we talking about micropenis unless it that you will likely be fine when you find the confidence to be happy with your penis no matter the size it all about functionality not size and most partners will tell you that the sheer vaginal or anal penetration alone is not the most relevant part of sex there is a lot of non piv playing around involved that makes sex enjoyable since most nerve endings are in the clitoris and the vulvar area is also more sensitive to stimuli than the vaginal canal unless someone has a fetish for being stretched or their cervix bumped the foreplay will decide how happy your lover will be and then you can still use toys and hands some people say that shaving a bit of a straight line upwards from the base of the penis pubic hair gives the optical illusion of a longer flaccid member so if it about feeling conscious of others looks in public bathrooms you might try experimenting around with pubic hairstyle ,1,AskDocs
Fettnaepfchen,hm maybe she irritated the cervical tissue more than expected and wants to give it more time to rest heal then she should have specified so otherwise i got nothing it should not have caused much irritation in the first place and it should be effective quite quickly or maybe she wants to wait and see if it getting expelled with the next cycle that does happen occasionally although it more of a complication and not the rule did she give you another appointmnent for a re check prior to giving you the green light ,3,AskDocs

Fettnaepfchen,ah okay i need to read that up obviously not an allergist from what i remember from my class with the allergist and from what my son allergist actually told us two years ago kids with for example allergic rhinitis hayfever dustmite allergy are at increased risk of developing allergic asthma called etagenwechsel floor change in german those persons are definitely predispositioned for both conditions and i was taught that treating the seasonal allergies lowers the risk of this floor change into allergic asthma i believe my textbook states that allergies are a risk factor for developing asthma but that maybe it was meant to be seen as an indicator for the basic disposition i did not mean to say that someone with a bee allergy automatically develops asthma to be honest i find immunology and allergies a tough topic to fully get behind ,1,AskDocs
Fettnaepfchen,i do what makes my life hell and what makes me dislike the job is the economists behind the scenes scheming and making doctors and nurses lives miserable by imposing hours of coding and paperwork and hindering us from practising medicine the payment is so mediocre that without care for the patients it would not be worth it loads of unpaid overtime bad hours many standby 24 hour shifts etc there are always those who do not care and are in it for the money if you rush and drop care to get the money over quantitiy you can earn more but are doing a shitty job against good morals and ethics or who lost their empathy over time out of being overworked and frustrated but i am sure you will find equally burnt out people in other jobs too i have met enough doctors who do not care and i would always recommend switching when you notice that your provider is not interested in you and your wellbeing ,13,AskDocs
Fettnaepfchen,one reason for treating allergies in children is to reduce the development into and onset of asthma which is a risk not to be underestimated so that might be the thought behind it please be open and discuss your concerns with the allergist as they will be the most competent to asnwer for your daughter specific case we do not really know enough about her results and clinical findings auscultation etc to judge it fully ,3,AskDocs
Fettnaepfchen,regardless of what it is might just be a local irritation if you absolutely cannot afford to see a doctor you can try finding a skilled physiotherapist for an evaluation no guarantee that they can help but with many conditions they can evaluate and help they will surely be able to tell you when you need to see a doc too ,2,AskDocs

Fettnaepfchen,that looks very much like a fungal nail infection you will need a dermatologic evaluation and antifungal treatment the doc will need to decide whether topical treatment with creme will be enough or if you also need to add systemic antifungals antibiotic treatment is only in order for bacterial infections not fungal ones a combination of antifungals and antibiotics would only be necessary if there is a bacterial superinfection which it does not look like from the images i am frankly surprised that the doctor told you the infection would simply disappear on it own again i can only suspect it did not look that bad back then some people do have good supportive experience with lavender oil and tea tree treatments but i have no personal experience with that and would always be careful with essential oils since some can be pretty irritating in concentrated form if you are looking into that i would definitely still combine it with proper antifungal therapy once the infection is treated the nail will hopefully grow out healthy from the nail bed the whole process might take a while but it does not look hopeless ,3,medical

Fettnaepfchen,that looks fantastic very cool ,2,Art
Fettnaepfchen,thank you for the excellent pictures unfortunately i do not have expertise with this but with anything that bothers you or the child i would recommend seeing the pediatrician or ped dermatologist to get a competent evaluation for the while you might get more input on the r dermatology sub not sure if there is a pediatric sub but knowing reddit there lilkely is somewhere if it was a hematoma i would have expected it to change or disappear over the months i would assume that it could be a harmless naevus simply because malignant melanoma in young children are rare but again i do not have enough clinical experience with kids to judge it well enough i can understand worrying and wanting clearance and that is likely something you will only get when visiting a doctor and getting an examination red flags would definitely be changes in size colour etc but there no harm in bringing it up with the doc as it is with kids better ask once too many than not ,2,AskDocs
Fettnaepfchen, do you people not have children i am sure some actually do not nothing about your shower setup or her bathing wiping habits sounds unusual for that age anyway you should not worry too much and just get her to her pediatrician hopefully it not a full blown tear but rather a vulvar fissure or badly looking abrasion the suggestion of npo below refers to no food prior to procedures with general anaesthesia which might be necessary for treatment if the wound is as substantial as you fear some kids also do not like to cooperate even for inspection especially when strangers and potential pain are involved do not worry and get her seen take care ,3,AskDocs
Fettnaepfchen,if it has not happened a doppler ultrasound of the legs would be in order after all that time it likely not an acute process as the name suggests you cannot have an acute compartment syndrome for years which does not mean that you have not experienced complications from a slowly healed injury but scarring or other issue with thrombosis might be worth checking for to see if it something that can be fixed or something that requires treatment internists usually do sonos for dvt for example some general practitioners do them too or depending on the country radiologists might be the ones to do them having clinical experience and practise with the sono is key better trained more accuracy with the results but you could always call ahead and ask as tcc1 suggested seeing an orthopaedic doc would also be a reasonable step to evaluate what is the actual problem ,2,AskDocs
Fettnaepfchen,just throwing it out there but toddlers at age 2 5 can be able to stand and play in the shower and at the same time not be able to wipe perfectly yet or at all so i would not see that alone as puzzling fact as with tooth brushing washing hands and tying shoes some kids can do it earlier some struggle for a while or do not cooperate ,11,AskDocs
Fettnaepfchen,if it not turned bad by now assuming the hematoma has reached it max extent and is not growing in size i would wager not although it is certainly possible to get compartment syndrome from following blunt trauma generally being immobilized and having large hematomas might carry a certain risk for thrombosis emboli and dvt and compartment syndrome can also present similarly at first that why ultrasound is always a good idea so op should watch out for shortness of breath or changes to the limb compartment syndrome has a pretty urgent presentation pain swelling and op would notice that something is going badly or so i like to think personally i would see a doc as not tp overlook anything but that just me ,1,medical
Fettnaepfchen,that hard lump is likely a larger hematoma and your inner thigh should turn a dark purple eventually before it fades i would see a doctor after falls and trauma like this especially if it painful enough to be immobilized for a couple of days but also to catch up on a tetanus shot if you have not a current immunization ,2,medical
Fettnaepfchen,skin cancer would not have been my first idea but what you need to do is to stop picking at it and see a dermatologist sooner rather than later to get it evaluated examined by picking you risk infection and scarring and most importantly it wo not get better ,3,medical

Fettnaepfchen,a couple of days someone posted with a similar presentation of a few spots on a five year old but no one knew what that could have been either i would see a dermatologist especially if you have been traveling and they are painful might be some weird infected bug bites after all they might be able to give you something for pain relief ,1,AskDocs

Fettnaepfchen,that is not always accurate although i am also very very cautious with medical tourism and super cheap prices the latter are usually too good to be true we have excellent dentists and implant specialists in germany and the cash prices for foreigners who naturally would not have our insurance might indeed be significantly cheaper than in the us one of the reasons is that we do not get into such huge debts during studying so prices can be reasonable and this is more of a guess i believe here it more widely accepted that prevention and treatment actually lowers the follow up costs in subsequent years i have an acquaintance in main who regularly travels back to germany to get his doctor visits done he said that including the flights and cash payment it was still cheaper than in the us ,4,Dentistry
Fettnaepfchen,i agree op can also call their own insurance to ask about the typical procedure and costs covergae of a sleep study most likely they will cover it or parts of it when the sleep specialist typically not a dentist evaluates you and deems a sleep study necessary ,1,Dentistry
Fettnaepfchen,you are saying that now but the evaluation in the sleeping lab might still be worth it i have had sceptical patients who were extremely thn ankful for the difference the machine made on their first night if you try it and do not want it that is fine it your choice but consider that if you wake uo very tired after long sleep it might not be as mild as you think there several types of sleep apnea central and obstructive and the latter can in some cases be improved through weight loss if the patient is obese to start with restless legs syndrome can also cause inefficient sleep if you really have sa long term negative effects can be cardiovascular illnesses and complications starting with high blood pressure and the associated risks i would say getting evaluated and informed before deciding is not a bad idea in germany pulmonologists often have the sleeping labs but some ents might as well only the sleeping lab results can tell how serious the sleep apnea is if it is present ,1,Dentistry
Fettnaepfchen,in germany pap smears cervix cancer screenings are done yearly in adulthood and generally the general practitioners do not know much about pelvic exams and often do not have the setup if you are living in a place where this is different another qualified provider like a pcp might be a good alternative to start if she just has beef with the term gynaecologist regular check ups are a good thing because some illnesses are only noticable when it too late and it simply unneccessary to take that risk the guidelines on pap smear frequency differs depending on countries yearly every three years etc more often when you have a familiar history of cancer but yeah any frequency of screening is better than none i still think gyns are specialized for a reason but if someone else took the time to qualify themselves sufficiently it can work out i guess ,3,AskDocs
Fettnaepfchen,the advice could have two sound reasons some issues actually get better after birth and some growths might get to a point where they could actively hinder a pregnancy directly or indirectly through surgery or complications hysterectomy in the worst case most doctors also want to be sure that family planning is complete before exploring the option of an elective hysterectomy which can be a ultra ratio solution for some patients maybe your gf indicated that she could imagine having children when they discussed treatment options i agree with the others that some communication is in order you can also join her next appointment if she agrees and have a joint discussion ,3,AskDocs
Fettnaepfchen,i am all for being informed it would be tragic to give up easily on a potentially lifechanging treatment because of a misfit we had someone requiring a total face mask and plenty of people required trial and error when it came to adapting to bearded faces or certain shapes it is probably the hardest for those people who unconsciously rip the mask off in their sleep or the ones who can not sleep with the noise no matter how calm it runs ,1,AskDocs
Fettnaepfchen,if you have not tried it try to get access to physiotherapy with the right exercises if the pain is significant possibly starting passively with the therapist then active without weight bearing and progressively more from there on your muscles especially around the knees can work like a protective suit and take the weight and stress impacxt off your knees aqua gymnastics is also very strenuous by no means a granny sport as the cliche suggests and often good for patients with spine and joint pain since you are floating a bit source worked in a medically supervised sports centre with elderly people in rehab after joint replacements and young adipose people with lipid metabolism issues ,2,medical

Fettnaepfchen,i have not heard aout this phenomenon in particular but considering normal physiology let me take a wild guess take it with a grain of salt if it a really sudden high dynamic big jump it might be as simple as a brief period of bad circulation similar to an orthostatic dysregulation presyncope when someone with low blood pressure stands up too quickly anbd feels faint as the blood is pooling in the lower half of the body and the blood pressure is not rising adequately fast enough tachycardia fast heartbeat is the body usual reaction to compensate for the temporary lack of oxygen in the brain when the blood pressure is low to make sure that enough volume oxygen reaches the brain the heart pumps faster to get the same flow during a period of low blood pressure there can also be physiological arrhythmia in relation to breathing and it only becomes a problem when it actually making you syncopate faint does it also happen when you are well warmed up and in training when did it start it might be a phase you grow out of but if you want to feel reassured or if you feel substantial pain chest tightess and dyspnoe shortness of breath you can talk to your pediatrician and get a resting ecg and maybe a stress ecg while on the ergometer to make sure it nothing ,1,AskDocs
Fettnaepfchen,cancerous lymph nodes are typically large painless and baked together in a rather immovable clump since you show signs of an infection viral infections often show up with rashes and they showed up at the same time i suspect these are not malign cancerous lymph nodes you can just ask your gp about it and have them check it out to feel safe though ,1,medical

Fettnaepfchen,oh okay that does sound like it will be fine to see a doctor tomorrow with that fever it is fine to take some antipyretic if he feels too awful to sleep but with the vomiting he should take care to not upset his stomach more it probably more of an acute issue than something related to an older infection unless that was a chronic thing in the gastrointestinal area his mom cancer would likely not be related to a feverish acute illness like that some viral gastrointestinal infections or mild food poisoning affect the stomach more than others and puking itself can irritate the mucosa to cause light bleeding hope it turns out to be something mild that he will recover from quickly ,2,AskDocs

Fettnaepfchen,eli5 as you walk and your foot touches down on the ground the impact will be transferred through your body through your ankles knees hips spine it is totally normal that the head moves a bit during walking the brain is cushioned in a nice layer of cerebrospinal fluid liquor it can indeed bounce around sort of when you accellerate and come to a sudden halt like in a car accident for example a countre coup injury is the typical lesion you get during those accidents from inertia causing your brain to get bruised both in the front and the back against the bony case it is residing in as your body and head move suddenly imagine a whiplash movement first to the front then to the back when you walk normally or run the liquid cushion keeps your brain nice and safe when you focus on something you did not notice consciously before it will feel weird heart rhythm and breathing are other classics that can drive people nuts when they overobserve and analyze everything often occurs with preexisting anxiety for example try not to overthink it if your head was shaking more than it shouldn you would likely see it in resting phases too or you would have some other symptoms pain dizziness etc if you have issues like that consult a doc ,10,AskDocs

Fettnaepfchen,adding to what zebra stampede said there surely was a pulsoxymetry hooked up to you so if they suspected trouble breathing they would have seen it clearly on the saturation levels that it was fine or not subjective trouble breathing is interestingly not always also an objective issue and if the sats show 98 the next step is to calm you down which they seemed to attempt with the meds and oxygen mask general anaesthesia does stop your breathing since the machine ventilates you automatically or anaesthesiologist does it manually like during intubation so a weird feeling during coming out of it can be in the normal range the tube can cause some irritation and swelling in the throat so you might have been feeling that as well an objectively closed throat definitely would have mirrored in the clinical presentation and oxygen sats though they would have noticed ,1,medical
