flyingpigmonkey,honestly some sort of hybrid would ultimately be superior to a single sort of reward system rng crafting where currency can drop anywhere allows players to farm for literally anything some items are already behind skill rng gates with shaper drops atziri drops being some of them i would prefer guaranteed drops from those bosses with potentially an even greater difficulty or skill required maybe uber atziri drops an axe if you do it deathless and slowly loses item tiers as you die more lol maybe not this is kind of a mess simply put i think guaranteed unique drops with specific skill barriers would increase the quality of the game while allowing currency items to remain as they are would likely permit the economy to continue in a decent fashion where players who cannot be bothered or are unable to play at a higher level still could ultimately acquire any item ,1,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,skill in poe comes down to two things physical and mechanical understanding interactions in game boss mechanics passive efficiency etc all fall under mechanical skill understanding in game interactions allows players to better clear content a player who does not dodge a wind up slam will learn to do so and gain skill physical skill is in being able to manage you character in content actually dodging slams hitting your flasks quick gem swaps etc this also comes with practice both can compensate for the other to a certain extent gating things behind concrete development as a player encourages players to learn to play if the goal of a player is acquiring a shiny trinket and the best way to get the shiny trinket to to play easy garbage over and over then you have made something boring overcoming a skill barrier is infinitely more rewarding than overcoming a time barrier at this point are you suggesting that you would rather be able to get stuff while being terrible at the game ,1,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,no my comments relate to the acquisition of items in this game which is the only detraction as far as i am concerned diablo 3 has zero depth in character creation and zero variety in content as far as i am concerned diablo 3 is a mediocre arcade game that is not deserving of quarters poe has depth and variety unfortunately people equate the quality of poe with the time required to get good items this is not the case end of story ,2,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,the idea that longevity of this kind makes for a good game is fucking idiotic the rng is the bad part of the game i play because the content is varied and the complexity is second to none in games of this sort unfortunately people want more than varied content they want to chase wild geese for a thousand hours i have no respect for that ,1,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,lol you are a moron d3 is a trash game ,0,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,what opposite effect you make a new build and try to do the content with it that literally the meat of the game poe would just be diablo 3 if the passive tree and gem systems did not exist there is a ton of customization that breathes new life into the game i have been playing since beta and i have not tried even a quarter of the build i would like to i wont either though because some of them require shit i will never get because i have a life that does not involve multiple hours of poe every night that stupid imo game design that rewards time over skill is bad ,1,pathofexile

flyingpigmonkey,bastion a similar style top down point and click where the different weapons are acquired through specific missions most other games that you can list under the arpg umbrella has a hybrid system where there are randomly generated items alongside guaranteed unique rewards this is true from borderlands to elder scrolls there are also arpg games with no few items like many of the zelda games just because many people view diablo and diablo 2 as the cornerstone of arpg especially point and click games does not mean that each and every mechanic that they contained was integral to the genre ,1,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,lol 3 you,1,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,lol my argument is that being driven by the desire to acquire something that in all likelihood you will not is dumb and if you are willing to commit 40 hours of repetitive labor to acquire something like that you are stupid you have every right too find enjoyment wherever you like but it reflects poorly on you beyond that i am sick to shit of the condescension of many people who claim that my anecdotal experiences have not happened and suggest that because of that anything and everything i say related to them can be dismissed out of hand ,0,pathofexile

flyingpigmonkey, so you want to just be able to go get whatever items you want without the time investment you want super rare items to just fall into your lap this is the problem items should not be that rare do you not understand what i am trying to say are you being intentionally obtuse the idea that anything should take so long to acquire through redundant game play is idiotic imo edit fuck super rare items ,-1,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,i love that responses i get on here are almost always you clearly have no idea what you have experienced i do though yes i have used at least that many fusing orbs no given the wide variety of choices in building and optimizing characters it is unlikely that in 1000 hours i have tried even a small portion of possible builds given the progression rate my interactions with players beyond copy paste hideout trade accepted ty have almost always been negative of the few times i have tried to buy things that are not trade window viable i have been scammed 100 of the time linking a build planner is easier than finding a screenshot of the entire passive tree which draws me in with its variety of choice and customization i am surprised you did not understand that i do not care about acquiring gear that is potent enough to complete all content if that is trivial then why lock some items behind preposterous time barriers as a motive for people to do repetitive nothings that dumb edit i guess i should add condescending to the community norms ,0,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,lol you are suggesting that planning a build does not count as creating one if i decide to make a build that will use certain specific items when finished i must be copying someone else build the idea that you should play one efficient build in order to gain the currency for items to play another build is at the very least irritating to me especially since it means playing specific meta builds that i have already done before i do not have interest in playing the same thing over and over again so what the fuck again lol,0,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,you misunderstand i think the idea of running a single efficient map is the boring shitty outcome of the unrewarding rng i do not understand why people would choose to do that instead of choosing to stop playing it a dig at the mindset that makes that an ok solution ,1,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey, this is false you just arbitrarily decided that rng drops are a core mechanic of all arpg games this is most certainly not the case you are wrong let it go honestly man it does not sound like you like the game if its such tedium for you why do not you take a break i love this game i just do not love it for the same reasons you might i also am taking a break i want to enjoy the game but the detractors keep pushing me away i boot it up and i have a little fun i realize that after an hour i have made zero discernible headway then i stop what are you doing trying to make a headhunter or skyforth build on your first go it does not take anywhere near 40 hours to level up get passable gear and test a build are you not i do not plan builds around tier 2 gear i am not rolling a golem build and planning on not using the jewels that go with it testing a build for me is not clearing some shitty t12 maps and saying good enough ,-5,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey, loot in arpgs is always going to be rng you will always have to grind ad nauseum that the entire game this is false if you find mapping and boss farming tedious you probably should look for a game that the entire endgame is not based around mapping and boss farming i do not find mapping or farming tedious innately i find it frustrating and boring after doing it so many fucking times especially on the same character and with the same skills rolling a new toon is like a breath of fresh air but it becomes stale before the character is finished leagues do have concrete challenge specific rewards if you want to set a goal for yourself try getting some of those challenges done concrete rewards of what a new portal effect i do not give a fuck about that i would like rewards that impact game play you do not have to make the best character or even follow a build to have fun in poe you do not need that one specific unique creating and testing builds is in my opinion the reason to play poe over other arpg genre games getting stuck when you realize with an optimized build it might take 40 hours of grinding to outfit your other guy is a wall that should not exist again in my opinion edit yet you are the one on reddit trashing standard arpg mechanics in a sub for an arpg and having an opinion that is not popular is not bad for the community i am not attacking other players here i am not scamming newbies i am not telling people to git gud or some shit ,-6,pathofexile

flyingpigmonkey,this is not even the same thing that example uses two strictly different terms to describe similar effects in the case we are talking about a character that cannot have it move speed reduced past a certain point can still be forced to move slower which is already unintuitive and in addition the terms are so similar that they are easily confused ,1,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey, cold damage fire damage and lightning damage have titles that specify what they are referring to attack speed and movement are specific modifiers speed by itself has no clear meaning here and that is why people misunderstand what the node will do so yes it does need to be specified ,2,pathofexile

flyingpigmonkey,your best description question at the end does not contain an answer that i feel describes my willingness to spend money on the game i made a couple purchases to support the game because i played it for a significant amount of time and felt that i should reward the creators of the game with an equivalent amount of currency to what i would spend on any other title unless ggg improves the game in a way that i would pay for elsewhere i will not buy anything else ,1,pathofexile

flyingpigmonkey,so this really comes down to personal opinion and preference i think it is both interesting and disheartening that the community is so filled with assholes that my average trading experience is unpleasant to the degree that i am not even interested in playing right now i think it is interesting and frustrating that ggg is unwilling to address the issue and furthermore thinks that trading is alarmingly easy i am amused that half of the audience here wants posts that they personally do not find interesting removed it the same mindset that allows people to suggest that folks who like different parts of poe from the reddit consensus should go play a different game it disgusting honestly ,1,pathofexile

flyingpigmonkey,lol no i said alternate options then you could still play 40 hours of shaped strand and get loot and people who have a semblance of skill could find reward from something other than busywork and slots ,1,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,lol my distaste is directed at you because if people were not stupid we would not have stupid mechanics geared towards people who invest unhealthy amounts of time to a single game and enjoy gambling poe and a number of other games would be better if they were not trying to monopolize their audience time through inane time gates and content barriers if this and other games alternately gated content and items behind barriers of physical skill and mechanical understanding instead of hours played i would not be so goddamn frustrated by your existence ,0,pathofexile

flyingpigmonkey,build enabling items are not just defined by whether or not other avenues exist but the comparative ease with which you can create similar effects without them atziri acuity is build enabling even though vaal pact exists because you do not have to path to that keystone which is significant ex a great number of builds that might be viable with skyforth are not without simply because using your chest slot for voll protector is a giant detraction ,-2,pathofexile

flyingpigmonkey,this is a stupid reply you are the part of the community i hate the absolute most nobody should be obliged to play the same meta boring league starter every fresh start so that they can acquire build enabling unique items headhunter is an ok example of a fine chase unique because no build requires it to function skyforth is build enabling in multiple ways and the only item in slot that does any of the things it does the same goes for atziri acuity why should people be required to play one build in order to enable another that poor game design ,0,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,you literally just said you are playing 8 hours a day right now rng is rng if you enjoy it that your pleasure but i suspect that the amount of time you have invested is tied to it i think rng is cancer and should be reduced significantly or entirely ,0,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,no such chase unique that are hard to get fuck that fuck that in the ass with a tire iron ,4,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,the skyforth approach to item balance is the thing that alienates me the most in this game please do not advocate it it positively infuriates me ,12,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,where did i claim i won lol now you are just making a fool of yourself i brough up the value of time invested because the currency that you happily gamble is the outcome of your time invested if you do not value your time obviously wasting it does not matter to you and clearly we do not see eye to eye lulz i am out ,0,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,lol no i am just not going to debate the value of time invested and outcomes with someone who plays religiously it demerits you in my eyes ,1,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,because you commit so much time to the game that if i were you i would be ashamed to admit it your game experience is going to be drastically different from people who do not regularly jam 4 hours a day every day that shit is abnormal ,0,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,that insane you are literally playing like it a full time job of course you are going to be happy to blow currency for entertainment value in that situation you would probably have more fun if you interspersed your poe with literally anything else ,-4,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,it is relevant because now i can dismiss you out of hand ,0,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,interesting that you avoided responding to the time question i agree that using currency to gear out alts is cool not very many people commit near enough time to have extra currency after finishing a couple characters in a league if you are playing enough to gear out multiple characters and have currency left over then you are just committing a crazy amount of time to the game ,0,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,it has no value if you do not value your time how many hours per day week month league do you commit to this game if you spend time and effort to acquire something it has value if you are spending your time and effort to acquire something that has no value to you what exactly are you doing ,0,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,you can do a whole host of things that have guaranteed returns even within the confines of poe i cannot tell you that your enjoyment has no value but i think that you could better yourself by learning to work towards sure goals i suppose if the alternative is walking away from the game then you have nothing to lose but i would personally prefer jumping ship to burning currency ,-1,pathofexile

flyingpigmonkey,the drop rate is a joke with a shitload of people playing a shitload of hours a few of them are going to drop it noteworthy enough for them to take a picture and get a response on here ,12,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,the stigma about wow players was so large and well recognized that it got it own episode of south park that has by and large become a gaming meme i am not even going to pretend to give your arguments against that the time of day i do recognize that i have not got data to back me up in this argument merely anecdotal experience i will reiterate here that if ggg was willing to provide that data that i would bet a personally significant sum of money on being correct you also have no data to back up your side of this argument i can say that not a single person i know would spend 200 a year on a video game that kind of behavior would get you mocked relentlessly given that subscription gaming models are a joke to me i am not going to have a long conversation about eve or other pay to play mmos but i do know a couple people who played for an extended period for free because you can purchase playtime with in game currency i do not know what the norm is but honestly that shit is laughable ,1,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,there is a reason wow was stigmatising socially i cannot tell you not to enjoy a single game for an extensive period of time but just because you enjoy it does not make its content more expansive than any other i would suggest trying something new to anyone who specifically chooses one activity out of many similar ones i do not think your comparison is fair if you were a scuba diver that only ever swam in puget sound i might suggest traveling to loreto and try diving there if you only ever played basketball in 3 on 3 tournaments i might suggest you try playing on a full team if you only play poe i suggest you try out some other games again you can spend as much time as you want on one thing but i am certain you are doing yourself no favors even if you find disappointment in other place you can gain a greater appreciation for what you already know but back to the root of this argument if you want to spend 600 bucks on a single game because that all you do you absolutely can and may this is significantly out of the ordinary however and makes you a whale ,1,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,trading is not playing the game imo shit like this usually makes me quit for the evening i have got better things to do than waste 20 minutes trying to pick up sextants and a belt ,2,pathofexile

flyingpigmonkey,that what makes you a whale you are not in the middle of the bell curve both in play time and likely in money spent edit wait you are not the guy who spent 600 are you if you are then the money spent statement is probably true ,3,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,feel free to ask ggg for that data which i suspect they would not provide so this argument is moot i suppose if in fact they would be willing to give specific information of that sort i would happily bet a personally significant sum of money on it edit and i did incidentally use the wrong term earlier i should have said mean and mode definitely not median ,1,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,both sets just because you have put ten games of time in does not mean there are 10 games worth of content it comes down to personal enjoyment and preference ,1,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,you can redefine things if you want but whale is a term for people who spend far and away more than the mean and or mode how many players have spent even close to the amount you two have by your estimation also frankly for the volume of content that has been released 600 dollars is a preposterously large amount poe does have a wealth of content but not 10 games worth edit corrected basic math terms lol,-2,pathofexile

flyingpigmonkey,you seem to be disregarding a key point other games can provide similar value to people not necessarily you but those other games cost 1 10th or less of the price you are welcome to continue buying and supporting but you have spent an inordinate amount of money on this game and trying to claim that you have not spent significantly more than most people would even consider paying is silly you are the definition of a whale you cannot argue against the definition in context just because you do not like it i do not mean it as an insult edit and what is up with your friend 70 hours and no cruel completion that crazy ,-7,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,i mean you have now given two different evaluations of using solaris lorica instead of shavronne wrappings i suppose i will just have to use poe builder to see the numbers but i doubt that losing es on your chest would only drop your maximum by 6 12 ,1,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,if you are just clearing mobs mjolner is still pretty strong you cannot kill bosses for shit though so there is that ,2,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,i return the question to you how many hours of content would you say poe has on a single play through just because you have chosen to not play through content over and over again in other games does not mean that poe is some brilliant exception in that facet dollar per entertainment value is a sketchy question it really depends on what i expect from what i am buying but no i do not go to movies unless it is a social event some games have significant value while lacking replayability by personal taste like like the last of us or dark souls but other people play them over and over i have a close friend who has played over 1000 hours on the original dark souls do you think he should pay the devs more because he played it repeatedly ,-4,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,hahaha you missed the point entirely with shav you can get 15k es and take advantage of life reservations without shavs it better to go life based and you end up with 30 less base damage and effective life total ,1,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,not op but yes i have only paid more than 100 dollars into one game in the process of buying multiple expansions and i do not play games with subscription fees because that business model disgusts me you have voluntarily spent approximately 10 times the price of any new aaa game on the market if that does not qualify you as a whale i do not know what does ,-8,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,their crucible balance team systematically destroyed almost every single weapon and subclass in the game for crucible and pve they removed weapon re rolling at the behest of total morons they relegated almost all endgame content to uselessness without providing much replacement they changed crucible matchmaking for the worse by bracketing skill significantly this change pissed me off the most and immediately because i could no longer play pvp with my little brother ultimately a game that had a number of options and interesting game play was tuned down in every way ,1,gaming

flyingpigmonkey,are you fucking dense i did not say it was rocket science to parse the api though it is outside most peoples technical capacity i said that it is impossible for some people because they do not have access to appropriate internet connections poe trade or any other publicly accessible indexer is going to have limitations on speed due to volume of traffic it does not update instantaneously and will never be quite as fast as a decent private indexer you are just a dumbass ,2,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,wow i sort of thought you might have something intelligent to bring to this conversation but apparently you do not if i find the patience i might comb through old threads for my evidence but do not hold your breath i have seen test threads demonstrating how quickly certain buyers will message before searches on poe trade turn anything up i regard that as abuse because it is a anti competitive advantage most people cannot run multiple mb s down of a private indexer constantly either due to geography or service providers be stupid if you want that your prerogative ,2,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,see i fully disagree i have been playing since beta and i have never played the same build twice i have zero interest in doing the same thing over and over and i quite frankly cannot understand people who want to play the same character with the same mechanics on repeat does not that shit get boring ,3,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,people who abuse faster updating private api get to buy low listed items before the rest of the community ever gets to see that they are on sale it gives them a significant advantage over the player base that uses poe trade and allows them to capitalize at the expense of less knowledgeable or inexperienced players no i did not just slap together buzzwords edit try low listing somewhat common chase divination cards especially early in a league it almost hilarious ,3,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,i wrote half a reply and then i decided it was not worth it you are somewhat correct but i am always in a foul mood because i spend my life engaging with people who cannot create a cogent argument stop trying to defend statements of fact with assumptions that all parties have not agreed upon your version of absolute certainty is based upon assumptions that have no basis in fact or reality except possibly your anecdotal experience which has zero weight outside of you for your benefit https en wikipedia org wiki deterministic system ,0,pathofexile

flyingpigmonkey,i tend to argue about this on here all the time so i am not going to have the same frustrating argument with you i hate how long it takes to acquire anything of worth in the game i have like 10 builds that would be viable if only i had the fucking time to acquire skyforths i have a golem build that i would like to try but i would need 10ex just in jewels to run it the reason rarity is set as such is because lots of players are drawn in to the the reward system i could not care less about that exalts dropping for me elicit a heavy sigh not an excited whimper or whatever the fuck this is if i got a mirror i would just be happy i could skip running the same fucking map 100 or 1000 times before fitting a character out to do neat shit edit end rant ,0,pathofexile

flyingpigmonkey,it does balance out on single targets if you hit 50 times and half are crits you get the multi on those hits and get a lot of value crit multi being a more multiplier is truly gigantic if you get 250 more on half of your hits you are doing about 3x your non crit dps unless i am mathing really wrong ,1,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,even 50 crit chance is a giant dps boost most of the time get power charges and once you hit a point of diminishing returns stack multiplier instead chance multi on the skill tree and some diamond rings flask go a long way ,1,pathofexile

flyingpigmonkey,i am not saying that trading is not a mechanic i am saying that as a mechanic it is at the very least poorly implemented i am saying that the entire economy is balanced in a way that is comfortable for a minority that is so small it might as well not exist i am saying that the slot machine that is loot in this game and many others appeals to people who do not understand why gambling is stupid or people who have too much time on their hands my fundamental problems with the game as you phrase it could be addressed in a few ways i do understand that it wont happen because a vocal portion of this community seem to fuckin adore playing the same map over and over for negligible rewards and that mindset is either beyond my understanding or below it i mean that in the most demeaning possible fashion ,0,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,no meta troll joke there are not any arpg games in existence that are perfect poe has the best core systems except for this shit i had a lot of time to think today frankly i think my gripe with the game would not exist if there were no unique items i get unbelievably frustrated that items with functionally unique properties are gated behind what i would call insane amounts of playtime honestly if you play hundreds upon hundreds of hours each league i think your opinion just does not fucking matter so few people have that much time to commit that you are effectively an irrelevant portion of the population unless you are spending a fuckload of money on mtx are you a whale ,0,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,if you could log in and use the played command or whatever it is i would love something more quantifiable ,3,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,i do not hate trading i hate that the game is balanced around it and that acquiring gear takes so damn long i can easily level a character to 90 before i make 10 ex through normal play then it just playing the same maps over and over until the game is not fun and i am still not even a quarter of the way to min maxed so trading for profit is pretty much the only viable option when i want to gear up a character ,1,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,the important question is this how many hours did you play ,7,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,efficient at acquiring curremcy if you have a goal to complete x content and you have a character that wo not be able to tackle it without endgame gear then you have to grind for an eternity it is much faster to acquire currency via trading for profit than by regular gameplay ,1,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,you are a crazy person i will come back and smack talk you later i have got more important shit to do with my time atm ,-2,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,you are correct that arguing over subjective preferences is not constructive but there is in my perspective a correct and incorrect side to this argument that is not just tied to subjective preference i think if you polled the general public on how much time they have for leisure activities and how much time they devote to any one of this hem you would understand where i am coming from only an infinitesimally small percentage of the population could ever devote the necessary time to finish most content in this game ,1,pathofexile

flyingpigmonkey,playing shaped strandx1000 does not count as a bunch of content sorry i am not stupid enough to enjoy repeating shit constantly we wo not see eye to eye on this you are similar to the kids i work with that want to watch the same movie repeatedly their brains are not fully developed what does that say about you ,0,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,that more than 100 hours per character that more time than i spend on most entire games and this one while it has a wealth of content runs dry far before you finish that process of acquisition ,0,pathofexile

flyingpigmonkey,your idea of a reasonable time investment sounds insane to me if you want to pick up some top tier shit like a unique 6 link it probably going to be 10ex you think that 10 hours is a reasonable time investment for 1 item for a character that if you are fucking optimized there is pieces of build enabling gear that cost more than that skyforths for example cost an optimized character approximate 30 40 hours of grinding that a work week i do not want a second job this a game ,-1,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,if the better exceedingly hard to acquire items are 5 or 6 t1 then that cool functionally exceptional unique items definitely should not be relagated to your second build every league i do not have any interest in starting every league with fb totems or some other equally budget character so that i can fit out the one i actually will enjoy playing actually even 3 t1 being very hard to acquire would be chill i really get salty when i look at a build and realize in order for it to even start to work i need 5 or 6 ex like what the fuck does a golem build do before you have currency for the new jewels ,1,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,truth thanks for the reasonable reponse i get a bit vitriolic ,1,pathofexile

flyingpigmonkey,in response to why does poe avoid making trade good you responded with because they want to keep the focus on playing the game not on trading i explained that the focus is currently on trading because specific item acquisition in game is almost impossible your point about the game being focused somewhere other than trading is fucking stupid in spite of the shitbag trade system it is still more efficient than acquisition through game play if they wanted to change that they would have to up drop rates to a point where trading is not requisite for most game play or they would have to remove trading if they removed trading the game would be absolute garbage the only reasonable solution is to streamline trading so that it is not at best an irritating fucking chore ,2,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,this is true but captcha tests are just one of many sorts of anti bot barriers that can be easily implemented ,2,pathofexile

flyingpigmonkey,excuse me i argue that the other ways that exist are irrelevant to the discussion because they receive no support and are not considered when the game is being balanced i said i do not want to have a discussion because i have this argument fucking constantly with people like you who try to pretend that the issue is not multifaceted or that ggg might just be wrong though my opinion on requiring players to use outside or third party productions is pretty much set in stone i would love to hear justifications contrary to it just know that swaying me is going to be near impossible because in the multiple years and games that i have played where this comes up not a single person has made a lick of sense in their counterarguments ,1,pathofexile

flyingpigmonkey,i did read your prior arguments and counterpoints i do not want to get into another full blown argument about trade mechanics or acquisition but this particular point is something i feel very strongly about requiring players to use outside applications to achieve their ends in game is a design flaw or mistake in every single case end of story conversation over ,1,pathofexile

flyingpigmonkey,when multiple people are obviously price fixing what is the best way to determine the actual value of an item see grand spectrum viridian jewel on poe trade right now poe ninja looks to be showing the fixed price as close to normal and that does not seem right ,1,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,i would not prices being inflated has a negligible impact on the economy in that both sides are making the same gains it also not within reason to compare to d3 which allowed real money transactions there would be an inherent market cap in poe because you could only buy and sell with the currency generated by playing the game ,0,pathofexile

flyingpigmonkey,economy fixing ah you mean ,0,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,the biggest detractor to the current economy besides the shitshow that is afk manipulators on poe trade is the incredible disparity in item rarity i suspect that most low price items are not underutilized see belly of the beast for an example but very common the other problem is that some items skyforth being my personal favorite example are unique among uniques and so any build that wants to use the mechanical enablers on them is set back significantly demand for skyforth tukohama fortress shav or atziri acuity is very high because they have no analog they also are preposterously rare which makes trading up for them a joke the tiers of rarity inside tiers of rarity are a huge part of the problem and i think a significant portion of the player base does not even understand it ,0,pathofexile

flyingpigmonkey,it almost like you have no idea how a business works the game is good and i support it i have spent more on this game than all but one other i would like to continue to support it but unless they fix the problem as i see it i probably wont play much longer because at this point it just makes me angry the only way to impact a companies trajectory is to impact their income this is my voting with my dollars also items are obtainable through regular play is almost entirely false for example how many skyforths have dropped for you ever if you played in a vacuum without knowing certain things exist the garbage ass drops would be fine but knowing that you do not have access to content and items because you do not have shit loads of time to commit is frustrating ,-2,pathofexile

flyingpigmonkey,lol instant gratification auction houses would make the game better right now sorry that you are fucking wrong either make a real auction house or make items and content actually obtainable through reasonable regular play i wont be buying any micros until the team does something to item acquisition because it is the largest detractor to the experience right now ,-26,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,that probably because race mods are generally stuff that would improve the fun value of the base game but are arbitrarily determined to be too good and so those items and characters are relegated to a dead zone nobody wants to go back to an inferior version of the game after playing with all the cool shit that is gated behind a completely inane time requirement ,-3,pathofexile

flyingpigmonkey,these labels are imposed on everyone by society i am of the opinion that these labels are entirely negative even if the chosen label fits a person they are then reinforcing that label and making it worse for anyone who is touched by it i will respond to the other half later i should be driving right now edit for me at least communication around the topic was and is nearly impossible due to the nature of the language i did not even know until recently that girl meant something different from female which does not even by the arguments set forth in this thread encompass a person physiology so what happens when you have a female body mark male on your doctors intake forms and then need gynecological expertise sure these things are not insurmountable obstacles by any means but it seems crazy to use language in such a manner when the goal is to assuage feelings around self image we should be teaching people that however you choose to be due to how you feel is totally fine even if it does not fit a normal standard and advocate for those people when they are being oppressed or marginalized but i do not think we should tell them to pick a new label because it detracts from the real issue i think ,1,lgbt
flyingpigmonkey,it was brought to my attention within the last couple years that terms like man woman boy girl are social constructs that do not necessarily align with bodily sexes i think that sort of use both overly complicates communication as well as undermines people ,1,lgbt
flyingpigmonkey,i would not ask anyone to justify their gender i do not ask people what they identify as because it empty i just want to know why after being subjected to emotional trauma in part because of these labels why trans people would reinforce them by picking a new one instead of discarding them entirely edi especially because future trans kids are going to be hit with the same gender stereotype bullshit ,1,lgbt
flyingpigmonkey,yes comrade changing your body is a physiologically driven thing but the labels associated with those changes are steeped in all sorts of stereotypes that from incredibly young ages we become entrenched in stupid beliefs i remember being very young and getting angry that people thought i was a girl because i had long beautiful hair i went from being proud of this part of me to ashamed and it was not very long after that started happening that i buzzed my hair off that is still with me from 20 years ago i cannot imagine feeling like my entire body was wrong and trying to reconcile what everything in the world is throwing in my face versus my own feelings ,3,lgbt

flyingpigmonkey,i do my absolute best to refer to people however they prefer it not about their wishes if the root of the problem is that people are growing up in discomfort or worse because society is pressing them with expectations that do not mesh with their preferences then we would be well served by getting rid of those expectations instead of having people choose labels that fit the person they think they should be we should be getting rid of the pressures that make people uncomfortable with who they are edit i am sorry for my poor writing skills via my phone edit 2 shitty example of what i mean if a female person grows up being told boys like trucks and boys like girls then if they find themselves liking trucks and girls in the way they have been taught boys do then we are reinforcing shitty stereotypes and giving this person an identity crisis if anything i think getting rid of gender words entirely would be better for everyone ,-2,lgbt
flyingpigmonkey,this whole page reinforced my thoughts but it was very interesting the problem i have is that unless my perception of the issue is incorrect the problem starts with the social pressure associated with our sex and gender so by allowing people to choose a different gender word they are more comfortable with we are reinforcing the boys like blue girls like pink bullshit instead of challenging those social norms but as you stated you are not the authority i will try to find another resource ,-2,lgbt
flyingpigmonkey,i do not think you mean to obfuscate but that answer is inadequate what are the feelings associated with this if you mean that as a catch all answer can you demonstrate the concrete differences between a female mind and a male mind in some fashion or provide sources that do so ,-1,lgbt
flyingpigmonkey,i think that the current press for free use of gender pronouns is not helpful to the people it is meant to empower in the long run ,-1,lgbt
flyingpigmonkey,i have problems with the way gender pronouns are used i think that the community is not doing themselves any favors in the long run but i am not sure how to explain what i mean without causing upset so i guess the first question is when someone is physiologically male female and decides they would like the be referred to by the gender word not normally associated with their physical sex what is the most common cause ,1,lgbt
flyingpigmonkey,i do not think i need my view changed i just want to debate the use of gender pronouns i have a number of gay trans friends and acquaintances and i think that the concept of choosing whichever word suits you is counterproductive but i cannot talk to them because i fear i might alienate them ,-5,lgbt
flyingpigmonkey,yo if this shit happens i am hitting the protests hard i am a straight white male who takes some issue with the gender pronoun shit that has swept up so many people recently but i am all for equality and not being an asshole discrimination is not ok not ever ,0,politics

flyingpigmonkey,it funny i have only ever followed one build guide by dismantletime or whatever his name is loosely and the first thing i noticed was that the super perfectly optimized tree spent an extra passive point or two on an inefficient route come on man ,3,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,i think meta at this point is in two camps hc is basically one of a few tanky or flighty builds eq or pizza variables there are quite a few potentially better or stronger builds but they are survivable and quite potent at top end sc is anything that double dips for retarded clear speed obviously this is just my definition but it touches on most meta builds ,1,pathofexile

flyingpigmonkey,my entitlement i am so fucking sick of morons like you pretending that an argument or some kind of statement of fact i am stating an opinion based on my experiences and you are welcome to disagree with it entitlement has absolutely no bearing on my opinion that the game is arranged imperfectly disagreement is not the end of a discussion it is the start of one why exactly do you think that the game should not be more accesible because you enjoy a different aspect good for you do you think the majority of people feel the same as you it possible have you made a point aside from sticking fingers in your ears no not really can you claim that many people will commit the time to even attempt end game bosses or acquire top tier gear i think if you did you would be wrong but go ahead dismiss me and my opinions in the rudest and stupidest possible fashion it does not make you right it makes you a fool ,1,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,oblivious to what exactly ,1,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,and why would you roll your eyes because you prefer the game to remain as it is or to be slower this is a point of preference and opinion i want the game to be more accessible and i feel my expectations or hopes are not unreasonable i am so confused by the apparent fountain of people who have the ability to commit hundreds or thousands of hours over the course of a league i am honestly confused ,1,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,acquiring your desired gear for a character tier 1 type stuff i did not really start beating this drum until this season after i made a build plan without price checking gear and discovered the stuff i had planned was completely out of range i probably wo not even have enough currency to get a 6l cospri will this league nevermind the skyforth ,1,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,i want to finish a character in a maximum of 40 50 hours of smart play mtxs and status symbols can be infinite time challenges are beyond the scope of the base game ,1,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,you just made some unreasonable assumptions go back and try again please ,1,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,i think you should not have to invest the time it might take to complete multiple aaa games each season to cap out a character or at least get close there has to be a happy medium ,1,pathofexile

flyingpigmonkey,d3 is a fucking terrible game it mechanics are mediocre and there is hardly any promise in the character building system ,1,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,it cool that you are making inane and terrible assumptions about me as a person because i am calling you out on your self centered bullshit definitely not aspie definitely did not pay a cent over the average secondary retail price of my car if you were wondering definitely done trying to reason with a shitty person who justifies scamming people in a videogame for personal gain get a life amigo ,0,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,i would prefer that because the parts of the game i enjoy are not related to the collection of loot i know and respect that other people enjoy the grind even though i think less of their intelligence for it there needs to be a midpoint and right now the time required to finish a character is completely unreasonable i know irl zero people who would commit hundreds of hours in a month or two to try and flesh out a character i do not get the majority of this community do you even go outside do you have jobs is poe your whole fucking life i want to play the fun parts of this game without playing the same fucking shaped strand 1000 times in order to finish a build i grew out of that doing fucking mephy runs in d2 a long time ago ,0,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,no i just respect how the market works and demanded to pay equal or less than the posted price on the car haggling is from a day and age where we did not have access to multiple sources or markets and competition was not available it was and still is advantageous to be dishonest both about your need or desire and the value of traded objects haggling in this game is basically a scam we have a public market which makes pricing your goods easy and to message someone and offer less than the exact set price is an insult we all know what that shit is worth and you want it for less in order to turn a profit fuck you ,0,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,if i list for an exact price and you message for less go fuck yourself end of story you do not have to like it but haggling is for assholes both in game and in real life ,0,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,i would sell it too but what is the point then why make it unreasonable to actually play content ,1,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,it not that i do not want to do it the problem is that it should not be a choice between getting 1 gg item or playing a map for the first time the content gating is ridiculous ,-1,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,the problem i have with how it is arranged is that in order to beat those challenges on less than top tier characters gear becomes a necessity and frankly i have no interest in playing clones of characters i have played before so if i want to beat uber atziri with a new build i have to have shitloads of currency ,1,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,i think they should at least triple the drop rate of skyforth it should not be a freebie to retain some of the balance but the fact that it 40ex right now on bsc actually just makes me angry i will never own them ,-4,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,my problem is not with atlas completion i have never tried the map because i cannot afford it i am pretty decent at the game but i do not have the time to commit to grinding up 6ex of currency to run a single map it a waste of time ,-1,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,it is preposterously expensive sorry not everyone likes to blow their entire life on this game ,4,pathofexile

flyingpigmonkey,i think ultimately any phys chaos poison build will be viable for cheap and scale very well the better gear you get i have not tooled around with it much but as a joke i made a deadeye ethereal knives build since i stopped caring much about the league and my buddy wanted to play a new character with me i plugged it into a build planner and the dps will be around 150k on a 5 link so look into double dipping before it gets patched lol edit if double dips do not make sense to you chaos damage will get the percent bonus from increased chaos damage and then the poison applied will the the percent bonus again it busted af ,2,pathofexile

flyingpigmonkey,i understand that you think i am being an unreasonable fool but i have met personally with some game devs and every time i have voiced a negative opinion no matter how politely or well worded i have been insulted and attacked so while you think you are being sharp and clever i know exactly what i mean and how correct i am ,0,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,we do not have to agree but i thought the later changes to diablo 2 were poorly balanced and ruined customization of characters otherwise i felt the game was as close to perfect as anything could be at the time diablo 3 came out and had less build variety than the original inception of d2 had shitty in game mechanics like health globes shitty art direction shitty itemization awful loot mechanics and the auction house was an absolute shit show edit i got a refund for that sack of shit ,2,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,i would be a lot more reasonable if the devs of most companies games were not dismissive condescending and often stupid ,-3,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,i think the problem is that they see that as a necessity when i think shit just needs to be easier to acquire there is a limit to the amount of time anyone can be reasonably expected to invest and the game should not peddle to outliers ,0,pathofexile

flyingpigmonkey,the grind is actually awful the only reason you think it is not is because you play an unhealthy amount i also have zero appreciation for progression being tied to rng that whole idea is absolutely fucking inane and if you advocate it i judge you harshly edit in fact none of my friends stick to the game because the grind is so long and ridiculous yes you can make builds that trivialize content with less investment but none of us see the merit in playing the same characters every league and since tier 2 toons need shitloads of expensive gear to challenge end bosses the game has no long term draw ,1,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,you want a rewind of only specific aspects that do not favor your personal preferences you want less access but you do not want to give up access i do not think the version of poe back in the day was remotely superior and i think more access is good if you want less access to gear and content like before then you can play the game like before tell me it too easy without trading frankly though in my opinion you want the game to be shit sorry you have so much free time ,6,pathofexile

flyingpigmonkey,using log out to escape boss mobs or certain death when they could not using flasks movement skills tp etc there are log out macros that log you out with a single keystroke ggg has balanced the game to allow for it but in my point of view quitting leaving the instance to survive in hardcore should equal a rip it would be like quitting a game of overwatch to maintain your competitive ranking that ridiculous ,2,pathofexile

flyingpigmonkey,i did not suggest you play less do not be obtuse i said you might want to consider playing the game differently if you want a different challenge i do not think the difficult part of the game should be acquiring gear i do not think it should be instantaneous but frankly i would prefer that the part of the game that is interesting and rewarding to me is trying difficult in game encounters with new and different builds the game gets stale as fuck grinding the same content with the same builds the way the game is balanced right now though many build plans are not viable with gear that can only be acquired through inane play times and generally speaking it far more efficient to get that gear with the cookie cutters in a way that is detrimental to the game maybe a big part of the problem is balance but addressing it via loot is much easier ,3,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,any reason to be an elitist asshole to total strangers without any reason or provocation ,11,pathofexile
flyingpigmonkey,are you incapable of self control if you want the game to be more difficult in that fashion then handicap yourself there is no reason why the game should be inaccessible and there is no reason why you should not seek out a challenge the two things are not mutually exclusive and allowing for them in design is not even hard i do not even want to destroy content i just want to be able to access it without playing the same 3 builds every league shit man ,4,pathofexile
