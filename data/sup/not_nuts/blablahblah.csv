blablahblah,generally each teacher is assigned to a classroom so it depends on how many teachers teach the subject and how many other subjects the teacher teaches my school had the same teacher teach spanish 1 and 3 and a second teacher teach spanish 2 and 4 so 1 and 3 were in the same classroom and 2 and 4 were in a different classroom we had three different teachers teaching sections of advanced chemistry so that one course was taught in 3 different classrooms and no math and science are not actually the course titles i only listed it that way because there a track of the subject that everyone follows for the classes that you are required to take in order to graduate high school biology chemistry physics for the sciences algebra 1 algebra 2 geometry for math and so on when working on your schedule for the year students do not have to really think about them it just the math class i have to take and the science class i have to take there are other courses in each subject like statistics and psychology that are not required to graduate which is why i separated those out english at my school was actually taught as grade 9 english and grade 10 english because the subject matter was not divided up the way math science and social studies were unless you were taking the advanced placement classes where you take a test at the end of the year for college credit in which case grade 11 you took ap english language and grade 12 you took ap english literature ,1,explainlikeimfive
blablahblah,what do you mean they are all generally taught in the same building schools are often divided into k 5 6 8 and 9 12 so they have access to the same classes the core subjects math science english history are generally taught by grade levels some electives in my high school it was foreign languages art and computer programming have a similar progression so people generally take the first one in 9th grade second one in 10th grade and so on but that not necessarily true for example mandarin was first offered when i was in grade 12 so some people who had taken spanish 3 in grade 11 opted to take mandarin 1 in grade 12 instead of spanish 4 other elective classes like statistics human geography psychology and art history are one off classes so they can be taken by students in any grade most students tried to get in classes with their friends so their was a de facto preferred grade for a lot of the classes take human geography in grade 9 take psychology in grade 12 and so on but it was not required and some people who were unable to fit the class into their schedule one year would opt to take the class in a different year instead and as i mentioned some classes like orchestra were taught in a combined section for all grade levels people in the orchestra would sign up for the same class all four years at that school edit and just to emphasize there is a huge variability between schools in the us what i am describing is my experience in a public magnet school in a mid sized us city even though my school was publicly funded you had to apply and get accepted and the school pretty consistently shows up on the list of the top high schools in the us my school has far more elective classes than most has far more high achieving students than most and has far higher graduation and college attendance rates than most schools in the us ,2,explainlikeimfive
blablahblah,depends on the size of the school the person organizing the teacher schedules the school district policies and the preferences of the teachers school policy in the us is determined at the state and local level so there a huge amount of variability across the country in my experience it was pretty common for the same teacher to teach multiple levels of a class and no it is not common for different grade levels to be dismissed at separate times that would not work because most of the elective classes were not divided by grade an 11th grade student could decide they want to start learning mandarin and take the mandarin 1 class with mostly grade 9 students statistics which was not a required math course was commonly taken by both grade 11 and grade 12 students depending on when they could fit it into their schedules orchestra and choir classes were a single class for all grade levels in the school ,3,explainlikeimfive
blablahblah,no one would take general science and advanced science at the same time but you might have a student who in advanced science and general english class the advantage of having students rotate rather than teachers is that it means each person can customize their schedule to match their level and what they want to focus on you are not necessarily with the same group of people the entire day ,2,explainlikeimfive
blablahblah,that will depend on the size of the school and how many people take the class my school was quite large about 450 people per grade so we had multiple teachers who were only grade 9 science teachers just because we could not fit more than that in the classroom each day but for elective courses where fewer people took each class each teacher taught more than one level for example everyone took a foreign language but they usually only took one of spanish french german or mandarin since so many fewer people take each language we only needed 2 or 3 teachers for the whole school rather than 2 or 3 for each grade ,3,explainlikeimfive
blablahblah,gpa is your grade point average it not a single grade it the average of all of the grades you get in each of your courses at school for example if i get 2 as worth 4 points each and 1 b worth 3 points my gpa is 11 3 3 67 each school district and often each teacher has their own way of calculating grades so it not standardized in any way and is difficult to compare people in different schools for example some schools might do 98 100 4 3 points 93 97 4 points 92 90 3 7 points 88 89 3 3 points and so on another school might have 93 100 4 points 86 92 3 points and so on if two students took identical tests and those two schools and scored identical grades the student at the first school would have a higher gpa than the student at the second school and that not even getting into the fact that teachers grade more or less harshly than others and that some teachers will give harder or easier exams than others the sat is an attempt to provide a score that can be used to compare people from different schools it a score based on a single test that given to students around the country a few times a year the questions are different on each test but the test creators try to make the test similarly difficult each time the test is pretty much only used by college admissions offices trying to figure out which student is stronger academically in combination with your gpa and other factors the test is primarily multiple choice where you get 1 point for each correct answer and lose 1 4th of a point for each incorrect answer to discourage guessing the scores are then normalized adjusted so that roughly the same percentage of the population gets each score for every iteration of the test to a scale of 200 800 for both the math and language sections giving you a combined score in the range of 400 1600 ,1,explainlikeimfive

blablahblah,it figures it out as soon as it first sees the function even before you run it the nice part is that there is a way to tell python that you want it to use the n from the surrounding function you just need to declare that you want that variable to be nonlocal def works2 n 3 def f nonlocal n if n nothing n 1 return f one of the cool things about python is that it really easy to poke around to see what it doing so let take a look at how python interprets these functions to do that we will look at the dissassembly the more human readable form of how it translates the python code into computer instructions it will be a bit confusing but let just focus on the first line of each of them import dis w works f fails dis dis w 3 0 load deref 0 n 3 pop jump if false 9 4 6 jump forward 0 to 9 9 load const 0 none 12 return value dis dis f 3 0 load fast 0 n 3 pop jump if false 9 4 6 jump forward 0 to 9 5 9 load const 1 1 12 store fast 0 n 15 load const 0 none 18 return value so the first thing it does in both functions is load the value of n but the first line of the works function is load deref while the first line of the fails function is load fast it got a different instruction for load the value from this function and load the value from the surrounding function by default python will use the fast version whenever it sees that you assign to that variable in the function regardless of when that assignment happens by adding nonlocal we told python that we really wanted it to use load deref instead edit just to clarify this is not actually the instructions that your cpu understands those are even lower level this is just an intermediate form python uses along the way to translating your source code into cpu instructions ,1,learnprogramming

blablahblah,ok i misunderstood your previous comment since you edited it after i read it you are talking about a single verification method with three steps so you are saying the store needs a network connected terminal and a wi fi network for this to work yes not every street vendor in the world already has that already that additional work for the vendors to set up in order to for this to work i am not talking about extra work for the networks you are right it would not particularly be more difficult for them i am talking about for the vendors ,1,explainlikeimfive
blablahblah,for a verification code to be as secure as a sim it would have to be quite a long code the sim contains some information that used for encryption which makes it more secure than just a simple id and transmitting the hardware id over the network still requires you to have infrastructure set up more than a paperclip and a card street vendors might have trouble with this for example and what happens if someone clones someone else hardware id you cannot do that with a sim card without an electron microscope and a lot of time but there no such protection on hardware ids yes there ways of making it work with software tokens as i mentioned cdma phones used internal identifiers for years but it would take a lot of work and a lot of money to make switching carriers as smooth as swapping a card or putting two cards in a phone which a lot of non us phones support ,1,explainlikeimfive
blablahblah,yes a strong magnet would erase a hard drive or tape data recovery services cannot recover data once it been overwritten they rely on the fact that computers do not actually delete the data when you hit the delete button unless you are using a secure erase feature they just mark the space as available so if you need to write another file later it might overwrite that spot the data recovery services just scan the parts of the hard drive that are marked as empty to see if they have anything that looks like it could have been a file ,2,explainlikeimfive

blablahblah,sure and cdma 3g phones did not have sims but the gsm standard requires that they be a separate card and that they be replaceable the reason for having a separate card is not because it necessary it because it allows you to change them easily when i travel internationally i can walk into any convenience store in the country i am visiting and spend 20 on a new sim pop it in and my phone operates on the local network so no roaming charges for me doing that without sims would require re programming the phone to de register it from the old network and register it with the new network ,5,explainlikeimfive

blablahblah,computer science is a branch of mathematics that deals with finding efficient ways to compute solutions to problems it more about computing than computers computer scientists deal with things like the traveling salesman problem given a set of connected cities what is the most efficient way for a salesman to visit all of the cities once computer scientists are largely employed as researchers by universities or by specialized research groups like microsoft research software development is about the application of computer science to solve real world problems the software developer solution to the traveling salesman problem is to avoid it altogether by building ebay https xkcd com 399 and relying on the postal service to send packages from the original city to all other cities software developers are employed by pretty much every company in the world to build websites applications tools and so on software developer vs software engineer does not have any real difference some people prefer the engineer title because in many ways software engineer is to computer scientist what chemical engineer is to chemist others get protective about restricting the title of engineer to those with engineering licenses and in many places they have the force of law backing them but i assume you are asking about this because you are looking at college programs and that where things get a little messy because your degree does not necessarily relate to your future job most graduates with computer science degrees do not end up working as computer scientists far more of them end up working as software developers despite the fact that computer science is focused more on the theory many companies prefer developers with computer science degrees over software development degrees see this job listing from google https careers google com jobs t jo jid google software engineer 1600 amphitheatre pkwy mountain view ca 6540009 f true for example that because generally speaking computer science programs tend to be more rigorous a computer programming degree might drop some of the higher level computer science classes like large scale systems or artificial intelligence in favor of learning specific technologies like learn to write websites with asp net or ios apps which are easier to pick up on your own than the detailed theory of the upper level cs classes ,4,cscareerquestions

blablahblah,almost all epic fantasy stories follow the classic hero journey and there a handful of tropes that show up a lot so you will be able to find similarities between pretty much any two fantasy series the dwarves and elves are stolen straight out of middle earth for example as they are in dozens of other fantasy worlds the only reason eragon gets extra shit for this is because it has an almost identical exposition to star wars once the princess is rescued and the mentor passes away both classic hero journey milestones and not in any way exclusive to star wars the stories stop following so closely ,4,books
blablahblah,how many other stories can you name with that exact story line not just individual elements or the hero journey but literally that exact plot ,6,books
blablahblah,true the only part that in my opinion is an especially bad rip off of star wars is the opening scene of the princess fleeing from the big bad minions if that was not the first scene of the first book it probably would not have stood out more than any other trope filled fantasy novel ,1,books
blablahblah,you do not need to abstract it all that much for the first half of the first book unless by abstract it you mean change the character names he did get away from the plot of star wars as the books went on the feel was mostly different because the setting was changed but the story is pretty much identical for many years a group of people with magic powers kept the peace in the land then they were overthrown by a power hungry guy with the same magic powers who declares himself ruler our story begins with princess damsel in distress fleeing with a macguffin bigbad minions in hot pursuit as she is about to be captured she sends the macguffin away we then switch over to our hero an orphan farm boy raised by his uncle living in the most distant reaches of bigbad domain he stumbles upon the macguffin but does not really understand its importance he then goes to his friend the wise old mentor with a mysterious past and learns more about the ancient magic power people meanwhile bigbad minions have come to this far corner of the kingdom in search of the macguffin they track it back to hero farm and toss the place looking for it killing the uncle at the same time poor hero all alone in the world now surprise it turns out that mentor is actually one of the old magic power people he been living in hiding in this corner of the kingdom hiding from bigbad and it turns out that hero has access to magic powers too so now mentor and hero trot off to rescue princess damsel in distress while mentor teaches hero how to use his magic powers at least until he tragically dies ,61,books

blablahblah,electricity wants to flow between the positive and negative terminals of a battery whenever you connect the positive terminal to the negative terminal power flows between them normally the phone is in between that connection so the power goes into running the phone the batteries had defects in them that caused the positive terminal to directly connect to the negative terminal which caused all that power to flow without the phone in the middle in one case it was because the battery case was too small so the wires got bent in the other case the new batteries after the first recall it was because a manufacturing defect caused a little pokey bit that sliced through the insulator that was supposed to separate the two terminals so now the power is flowing but there no phone in the middle the power had to go somewhere so it got turned into heat and the whole thing just got hotter and hotter until the battery burst into flames ,4,explainlikeimfive

blablahblah,the decimal symbol has ten symbols representing the numbers 0 9 one less than the base multiple digits means multiply each digit by a power of the base starting from 0 to the right and increasing by 1 as you move left then add them all up 123 means 1 10 2 2 10 1 3 10 0 binary works exactly the same way just with fewer symbols there are two symbols representing the numbers 0 1 and multiple digits means multiply each digit by a power of the base and sum them up so 1011 means 1 2 3 0 2 2 1 2 1 1 2 0 likewise with every other base because of the way the number systems are set up it means that each of these systems is capable of representing any possible integer a system with two digits where one represents 0 and one represents 100 would not be able to represent all numbers the system you mentioned could show orders of magnitude but the numbers quickly become larger than just using scientific notation to show the same thing ,1,explainlikeimfive

blablahblah,so there lots of different layers in the stack when we are talking about http the way the c standard library is talking to the other server we say you open a connection send the message and then wait for the response now underneath that layer is tcp the transmission control protocol and ip the internet protocol this should be its own couple lectures on its own but the important thing for this is that part of sending your messages is including a return address on it your ip address and a random port number and then telling your computers network stack to give your program the messages that are sent to that ip and port the network stack handles things like retrying if the connection is a bit flaky and making sure you get the response messages it may be broken into multiple parts in the correct order the whole concept of a connection is just an abstraction that you can rely on because http is built on top of tcp and your program is built on top of http the reason that the interface for communicating to a server is async is because it takes time for the message to travel to the other server the other server to compose its response and the response to make it back to you by making it async you can send off the request do some other stuff and then check back up on it later to see if it done meaning the network stack has the response messages for you to look at ,1,learnprogramming
blablahblah,you send a message to a server the message contains some text the server responds with some different text json is a way to convert between text and objects so it allows easier interaction from other programs as an example say i wanted to get a machine readable version of this reddit page i could send a message to reddit servers that looks like this get r learnprogramming comments 5nighk json http 1 1 host www reddit com when reddit receives this message asking to get that particular path using http 1 1 it would respond with a message that looks like this http 1 1 200 ok accept ranges bytes content encoding gzip content length 1428 content type application json charset utf 8 saying yes i understood your message here is your content i have gzipped it it is 1 4kb and i am sending you json data if you want to write some data you would send something like a post request instead of a get and you would include some data to send to the server but it the same general idea you do not generally have to deal with building the messages yourself because you are using an api the c library i mean not the web api they are both apis that takes all the important parts what you are sending and where you are sending it and formats it into a request for you ,5,learnprogramming

blablahblah,because the simple characters have special meaning in certain contexts in a web page for example you use to tell the browser about the structure of the page if i wanted to make a paragraph with red text i would write p style color red this text would be red p if i want a literal or i need a way to tell the computer that this is a literal not the start of an instruction and it needs to be a sequence that wo not be used anywhere else the way web pages take care of this is to use an followed by a description of the character to mean the literal character so if i want a literal i can use apos or 39 an apostrophe is character number 39 if i want a literal ampersand i can use amp or 38 ,41,explainlikeimfive

blablahblah,the idea that the sun is in different spots in different places becomes pretty obvious as soon as you recognize that the earth is a sphere regardless of whether you think the sun orbits around the earth or the earth orbits around the sun it did not really matter that much for the first couple thousand years after the greeks figured that out though because we did not have an accurate way to measure time other than using the sun also the only thing that mattered was that you agreed with the guy down the street roughly what time it was since it not like you could coordinate exact times with people far away from you anyway there were three things that changed that made consistent times necessary accurate clocks and near instantaneous communications telegraphs and fast reliable transportation trains the railways were the first to have all of their stations use a consistent time so that the different stations could communicate with each other about when things would happen more reliably and they could send out a message with the current official time so all the stations could synchronize their clocks this worked reasonably well for britain where everyone eventually switched to use what was the local time for greenwich but not as well in the us where a train that was due to arrive in california at noon according to a railroad headquartered in washington dc would show up when the local clocks said 9am so everyone not on that particular railroad time would miss their train the fix for this problem was to split the us up into multiple time zones and the idea of dividing up the entire world into 24 equal sized time zones caught on pretty quickly after that it did not exactly happen they way the scientists envisioned because of politics but it pretty close some places wanted to use 30 or 45 minute offsets from greenwich rather than a 1 hour offset like nepal which is 5 45 ahead of gmt some countries like china wanted to keep the entire country on one time zone even though they really should be in more and some places near the boundaries of time zones set their time to match the time of the nearest big city even if technically they should be on the other side of the line that why the time zone lines are jagged instead of straight ,2,explainlikeimfive

blablahblah,md5 and sha1 are not encryption methods they are hashing functions many common encryption methods rely on the difficulty of factoring prime numbers but hashing functions do not the difference between encryption and a hash is that encryption is designed to be reversed while a hash is not given encrypted text and a key you can get the original from a hash there no good way to get the original text a hash function is a one way function there is no way to reverse it but it does take an arbitrary sized input and produces a fixed size output which means that multiple input values can have the same output values since there are way more possible input values than output values this is called the pigeonhole principle now the chance of a collision two pieces of text having the same hash value is incredibly small it should be 1 340282366920938463463374607431768211456 for md5 and 1 1461501637330902918203684832716283019655932542976 for sha1 so we usually do not care about it when storing passwords you always should use a hash function rather than an encryption function because encryption has to provide a way to reverse it and if someone can steal your password database they can also steal the key so now they have all those passwords in plaintext a non broken hash algorithm is pretty safe because look how many guesses they have to make in order to find a match to that hash even on a cluster of computers it should take decades to find a match so now that we understand what hash algorithms mean lets talk about what it means for a hash to be broken a hash algorithm like md5 is considered broken when you can find a way to get a collision in fewer tries than what we expect people have found ways to get collisions for both md5 and sha1 in a matter of hours rather than decades assuming you have access to a few hundred computers which is why they are no longer recommended for cryptographic use as for the cracking site you are right that it just relies on a database of common passwords and their hashes rather than reversing the hash in real time there is a defense against this called salting that many sites used but that a different discussion ,6,explainlikeimfive
