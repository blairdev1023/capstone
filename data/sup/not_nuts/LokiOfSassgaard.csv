LokiOfSassgaard,so you are looking at cinemassacre but for animation there are a few fundamental problems with this model 1 adrev you will be responsible for making sure everyone gets paid which means you will have to issue the 1099s and be responsible when people do not get paid 2 people like channels for different reasons even within the same genre art especially because there are as many individual styles as there are artists you will lose subs just as quickly as you gain them because people will sub for one artist and then realise that most of the content in their inbox is shit they do not care about ,3,youtube

LokiOfSassgaard,came here to ask the same thing ,1,mildlyinteresting
LokiOfSassgaard,i meant adwords when i said adsense but youtube is not adwords or adsense adwords serves way more than just youtube which is why they have their own guidelines for what you can and cannot advertise they get hundreds if not thousands of new ads every minute if they manually checked out the validity of every single ad that went through they would never get ads up they can check that the ads themselves follow the rules but to chase down the domains videos and social media practises of every single ad that comes their way is an absurd expectation ,16,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,that not at all what the promote button means on youtube not to mention a subreddit with three subscribers is an even worse place to promote a video than the countless other active link dump subs ,1,youtube

LokiOfSassgaard,he not debating to show that one side is more wrong than the other he debating to show how ridiculous both sides are or that both sides have valid points the debate format is just a good format to do so because he can exaggerate it and make it funny ,2,DeFranco
LokiOfSassgaard,he plays all three parts both exaggerated sides and a clueless moderator who does not seem to actually understand the debate at hand often times the side you would assume he would take comes out on the losing side because they are not level headed and get emotional and then get accused of unprofessionalism as in the case of the recent nazi video that one especially highlighted the problem with debate videos where one side is often at a disadvantage just because they are not used to being in the situation of a debate and do not know how to keep calm in the face of blatantly wrong information ,1,DeFranco
LokiOfSassgaard,the is bdsm feminist one was good too he took the most extreme almost cartoony aspects of both sides of the issue and personified them that one was less about showing that one side is more right or wrong than the other and more about showing how absurd both sides can get in trying to lambaste the other side ,1,DeFranco

LokiOfSassgaard,i do not do the eyes last intentionally that just how it worked out on both characters i actually just finish a block at a time working down the page to keep the back slightly more organised i actually meant to talk about that in the video since i did not do that on the last page but i only had about two hours in which to record my audio and get the video uploaded conversion and colours being too dark does not seem to get to me except when there a lot of brown in a piece the freddy fazbear one i did also had a lot of problems because browns just do not map well at all and i do not understand why i wish i would had more time with this piece to be able to fiddle a bit more but i did not want to drag it out to irrelevancy which was most of what made it so exhausting to do and yeah it the travel from the screen to the fabric that will kill you because light and pigment do not look the same like you said and that so infuriating sometimes because the image will look super awesome on the screen and then just look like mud on the fabric so you are stuck having to figure out whether or not the mud you create on the screen will still be mud or if it would work usually i can get it to convert pretty well but this was like 80 confetti so i had no idea how it was going to turn out no matter what i did usually the confetti will help that but here with all those 600s and 400s and 3700 rubbing shoulders together i think the confetti may have actually been part of the problem i tend to use confetti as a means of getting the most detail possible out of a small image because you can use fewer colours to trick the eye into thinking there are more colours but ugh brown now i am sad because i do not trust it but there are a few patterns on my bucket list that are pretty brown as well and it will be a nightmare but man i blew the highlights so much in this that i was worried that rocket face was going to be nothing but a sea of white and almost white stitches because that what it looked like on the pattern which is here incidentally http imgur com 8zbphgs you can also see the bits that i improvised away because i was not in the mood but i was so shocked when groot turned out to be almost the same colour as rocket face when he was more green there rocket does not quite blend into the background as much as he did in the finished piece either though i knew going in that was going to be a bit of a risk because of how much i had to lighten the colours and kill the contrast to get rid of all the black pewter and navy i think if i would gone a little bit bigger eight inches across instead of six it would have solved all my problems but the extra two inches would have added probably an extra month to the piece and i wanted the video to still be relevant when it went up and also my mcn is asking for guardians content right now so there was that time constraint as well ,2,CrossStitch

LokiOfSassgaard,i had a little long haired chihuahua for a while and that was about the perfect level of dog activity for me he needed to go across the street to the dog park a few times a day and otherwise just wanted to curl up on the couch and look at the cats if i am ever allowed to have pets again that exactly what i will be looking for in a new dog but most people seem to think that a dog is a dog and never even bother to ask about the breed it is other than how big will it get which is a good question but should not be the only question ,7,rarepuppers
LokiOfSassgaard,except the officer wo not be home to keep the dog busy if you take a dog that been trained for hard work and been worked all its life and then give it the life of a couch potato you will get no end of behavioural issues the dog does not understand retirement and that now it okay to be lazy the dog wants to be out running around catching bad guys ,16,rarepuppers
LokiOfSassgaard,yep people see a big pretty dog on tv and decide they want one and then get overwhelmed by what a monster the dog turns out to be they do not consider it their own lack of training and that maybe a dog bred for the purpose of being a couch potato would have been a much better choice we did not just make dogs to look different we made them to perform very specific tasks some of those tasks are back breaking and some of those tasks are to sit there and look cute my aunt learned this with her dachshund that dog is an absolute terror when he anywhere but at home where he can chase the wildlife in the backyard all day she used to bring him with her for christmas but now he gets kennelled because he kept biting people by the end of the week ,25,rarepuppers
LokiOfSassgaard,the thing is they are working dogs these dogs need a lot of things to do and if he young and healthy retirement can be a bad thing it like all the pictures you see of huskies and german shepherds that have eaten entire sofas in the owner absence it not bad dog behaviour but the owners not understanding that the dog needs a job and would be happier if it were given hard work they can get that hard work in retirement but if they go to the human partner while they are still young and fit it can result in problems since the human partner will be gone a lot and the dog will be left to its own devices part of the reason they often have to fight to keep the dog after retirement the new owner still needs to provide the dog with a lot of mental stimulation and the satisfaction of getting a job done if the dog will be able to get this on the job it better to keep him on active duty ,127,rarepuppers
LokiOfSassgaard,k 9 units are trained to take bullets for their human partners from what i have read that exactly what happened criminal was aiming for human cop k 9 jumped in and took the bullet as you can see despite the training to take the bullet they will still work to save for dog the k 9 is still a valuable asset to the team and the human partner will have an incredible emotional bond with the dog but the k 9 does not have a family and bills to pay so while it loss may still be devastating it wo not ruin lives depending on how well he recovers he could return to work or they may retire him where he goes when he retired depends on where he lives but i have seen many cases of the human partner fighting to take the dog home after retirement ,299,rarepuppers

LokiOfSassgaard,not only slightly sped up but it often has 5 7 minutes of the original air cut out which is why watching something in syndication that you saw at air can sometimes be confusing because you might remember a part that does not exist anymore ,16,todayilearned

LokiOfSassgaard,annotations are terrible on mobile even if they did work which they do not you would not be able to tap a video to pause it or scrub through it without hitting someone wall of spam since annotations did not have a safe area sticking one right over the play pause button to get accidental clicks was a pretty standard practise some people tried to game the system by sticking them right in the centre where the play pause button is on mobile without realising that mobile users do not see them ,2,youtube

LokiOfSassgaard,well that what is happening advertisers are coming back and have even better targeting tools than before ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,you heard wrong what is probably happening is you are producing content advertisers just do not want to advertise on ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,yeah this week my rev seen an increase to a point above where it was before the advertisers pulled out i guess the doom and gloom is being completely overblown like always ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,i used to go down at meet my husband after my shift at whatever soul sucking store i was working at he let me ride the segway a few times and every time i almost killed myself ,2,mildlyinteresting

LokiOfSassgaard,oh plenty of times but that expensive because you have to prepare the dish multiple times which i have already said if you read my full comment ,0,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,okay but when more than half possibly upward of 70 of the userbase cannot even see them what is the point of keeping them around ,4,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,it has no context without graph labels that could be 20 views and then 10 which is perfectly normal for a small channel ,2,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,no that what i am saying the flagging tools are how youtube deals with it but if channel owners do not actually use those tools youtube has to rely on guesswork with so many new videos posted ever hour it completely infeasible to suggest someone trawl through content constantly to find new spam comments the only people who see every comment on videos are channel owners other people can flag comments as well but again if nobody doing it banning spam is all going to come down to a computer making guesses ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,is what normal you have posted this with no context at all ,3,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,the tools to deal with them are there but the problem is that creators do not use them you can wholesale block links from appearing in comments and report people for spam but it seems like a lot of big creators do not seem to have time to click a few buttons to do so ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,i know the new rules are new and i still like them i mean i wish you all the luck in the world but you seem to be pre convinced that it all going to fail anyway ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,i only know about these channels in name only but if they are still being affected chances are they are probably channels youtube is trying to subtly push out which i have no doubt is something they are trying to do to channels that are not technically breaking any rules ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,it very strongly dependent on your content though some people are still barely making a few cents a day because they have been shut out from the new guidelines the channels that never had any problem with demonetisation before seem to be the ones that are doing the best right now ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,my numbers are back up to pretty much normal at this point i know this is not across the board though and definitely depends on your content ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,no i have just been on the internet long enough to know that there no fighting against changes from massive websites you have to either roll with those changes and adapt or quickly find somewhere else to be that will suit the things you want to do twitch is a good alternative to youtube for some people and if they do not want to play by the new rules that where they should go and a lot of people do not want to seem to want to play by the new rules so why should i feel sorry if they run their channel into the ground in turn i honestly like where youtube is going i think the ad changes were a good idea because they will benefit a lot of people i do not think this depression will last forever and i can even see an increase on the horizon if youtube does manage to give off an outward appearance of family friendly and mature not as in the rating but just a general sense of grown up ness content honestly you are coming off as a bit bitter over this whole thing because you do not fit into the new model you keep saying people will leave and take their audience with them so leave take your audience with you your audience is not my audience but prove me wrong on that but i doubt many 35 60 year old women are watching your channel ,0,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,you call me short sighted but you are looking at this pretty narrowly as well toddlers are a great market because it really will help drive the family friendly model youtube really wants to push to the advertisers i have no problem with toddler videos they have their place on the internet too i guess i am just sick of games and memelords being seen as the only way to make content on the internet when that is demonstrably untrue ,-1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,i have been around long enough to know that audiences can and will be very reluctant to leave to a different platform and changing that platform can be just as dangerous as sticking around on a dying one not that youtube is dying or showing any signs that it will be twitch keeps trying to add new features to entice people who are not gamers over to their platform but it not working because it a new platform it does not have the tools to support content other than gaming i tried it for art and it terrible i have tried picarto i tried justin tv and the original livestream channel back in the day the thing is livestreaming is a terrible format for most channels if you are a cooking channel and the thing you are making needs to ferment for four hours it more cost effective to make the dish once and stop the camera while the food does its thing rather than making several versions of it cooking has a lot of dead air just like art people who have car channels how does that work on a platform that does livestreaming travel vlogs pets and animals home and garden memes and games are great for twitch but it an awful fit for everyone else the overlap in eyes between memes and games and home and garden or art or cooking is very low those channels wo not be hurt if the games go elsewhere in fact the loss of the games would more likely improve youtube overall image as a more mature website for adult oriented content and bring in even more eyeballs the introduction of youtube tv seems to herald just that ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,i am still not getting red get over it ,2,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,all of this it so easy to fall into the trap of looking at the top channels and seeing a sea of gamers and think that all people want to be watching but those top channels are at the top because they have been around for a while but when you look at pewdiepie the number one channel in terms of subscribers it easy to see that he really is not actually the top channel his views to subs ratio is appalling he may have 54 million subscribers but comparatively nobody watching him there so much more to youtube than just the gamers and the memelords a fishing channel would do great fishing is one of those things that does not seem like it would have any gatekeeping but it kind of does it hard to know what you need to get started and going into a big 5 and asking someone to help you out is likely to send you home with a bunch of crap you do not need a newbie does not know the difference between fly fishing and trawling and could very easily wind up getting the equipment for one when what they really want to do is the other if you are going to do youtube do something you enjoy even if nobody else is doing it you will have so much more fun and that will show in your videos and can actually help your channel grow ,2,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,it a video that been privated or deleted the data is still there but youtube cannot tell which video the data is for ,2,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,i get this person who complains about the fact that i use background music on my videos my music track is always at about 30db just to cover up the fish tank noise in my room the one video i did recently without the music because it was a quick info sort of video this person complained about the fish tank noise which is still very quiet aside from a light hum i have given up reminding this person that if they have trouble hearing to turn on the captions ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,yeah i just block on sight and report for spam ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,the whole point of something like red is the added features none of the shows on red are interesting i do not care about the music service and like i said above it was a goddamn travesty i was not able to watch any livestreams at all for the entire month i had it and even some uploaded videos refused to play on my phone i am not paying 10 a month just to remove ads from content i wo not be able to watch anyway ,2,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,i feel like this happens with every website that gets massively huge people yearn for the good old days when there was better content all around and there was no trash to be seen but the trash was always there it was just easier to filter out because the overall pool of content was so small as a site gets bigger and bigger reaches a point of exponential growth that increases the overall pool of content making the amount of trash seem to be getting out of control when the only thing that changed is that it just gets harder to curate the good content because there too much to sift through ,3,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,and you really feel like this doom and gloom attitude is the way to fix it i really do not think everything is as bad as people are making it out to be because you are right people are drawn to certain kinds of content but that not always what happens to be trending or big at the current moment count the amount of threads bitching about trending and recommended videos and you will see that quite plainly i watch so many different kinds of channels on youtube and h3h3 are the only ones who are being hit so hard that they have to move to twitch none of the art cooking travel hobby or animal channels i watch have been making similar noises youtube clearly has a direction they want to go and it one that can benefit the small creators who have hobbies outside of games and memes if that what a person wants to do with their channel maybe they should move elsewhere ,0,youtube

LokiOfSassgaard,honestly unless you have no other skills or hobbies outside of gaming i would suggest doing anything but gaming either platform you pick or will be a slow uphill battle that will realistically only ever make you enough to buy a big mac you have to be incredibly lucky to make it in gaming ,6,NewTubers

LokiOfSassgaard,as a small creator i disagree the small creators who are going against the grain and doing art content seem to be doing pretty well i feel like youtube is just getting sick of gaming content and edgelord humour since that really the only content that still seems to be hurting right now ,9,youtube

LokiOfSassgaard,the thing is the content on tv is highly censored and specially edited in a way where you do not actually see anything too obscene it an age old technique that relies on the viewer imagination to make things seem worse than they are everybody knows that what you see on tv is fake that assurance is not there on youtube ,0,youtube

LokiOfSassgaard,bumper ads are a win for everybody the audience is not forced to sit through a full 30 seconds and since the ad is served in its entirety the advertiser gets their message out and the creator gets paid ,1,PartneredYoutube

LokiOfSassgaard,nfl are notoriously fierce about protecting their copyrights though like i am not even remotely into sports and i know this remember when they tried to ban official team twitters from using gifs from games ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,i love streaming on youtube i got like four or five views per stream on twitch where i easily get 50 on youtube it also means that when people do find your stream or vod they do not have to go very far to find your uploaded content ,3,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,you and your friend both sound very new ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,i do that but i still do not like twitch because it a terrible platform for anybody who does not do games and is not already massive ,2,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,why would you ever click a link in a youtube comment of course it spam and of course it a virus ,3,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,i do but my pieces can take 100 hours to finish a livestream really is not the same as speed art because of it ,2,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,tv is different it follows the blast technique because advertisers have very little information on who is watching what they have nielsen but nielsen just gives a general idea on the internet you know exactly who is watching which channels ,2,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,i feel like this is the main point people are missing just because a channel is entertaining and has a large reach does not mean it necessarily a good fit for advertisers ads are so heavily targeted these days that maybe the people watching those channels are not the people these companies want using their services or buying their products a lot of financial institutions run ads on youtube for instance for these companies anybody under 30 is a wasted impression realistically if you are selling home and baby products what use is the teen demographic to you youtube are providing the advertisers with better tools to make sure their ads go where they want the system seems to be working as intended ,15,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,but you do not know that the fans will follow and if the fans do not follow the sponsors certainly want sponsors care fuck all about the brand they are doing a deal with because it all about the audience and how do i know fans may not follow because i have seen platform switches in the past fans get comfortable with a platform if you move to another one that they are unfamiliar with they will most likely find new people on the familiar platform to follow instead ,4,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,you can absolutely get banned for that that straight up spamming ,7,youtube

LokiOfSassgaard,talk about it all you want but it wo not change the fact that it their right to allow or disallow whatever hey want it in the tos you signed when you created your account so you are kind of fucked if you have suddenly decided you do not like it ,2,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,not at all but if you go into someone house and say something they do not like they are gonna boot your ass out it the same thing with going on someone else website ,2,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,really because mine looking great ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,it still amuses me that it gaming as a whole i do not know why ,9,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,not a conscious association no there may be subconscious associations but that beside the point it the monetary association that the trick if your ads are running on a video promoting views that do not align with your own you probably do not want to be giving your money to that creator indirect though it is it can be seen as supporting those views through an implicit agreement to run ads the general public may not be aware that ads are placed randomly on videos and assume that coca cola elected to place their ad there manually that the association they wish to avoid ,2,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,i love how games is its own exclusion category ,28,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,yep my favourite channels include someone who breeds venomous snakes a guy who glues cds together and puts them on a lathe some dude who builds mud huts and a former disney animator who now just spends a lot of time drawing animals and doing animation tutorials i have also got tons of cooking channels in my subs some music a few travel vlogs needlecrafts and a few random channels that can really be best described as lol youtube there are some games as well but they make up a scant minority of what i watch and i am always finding new stuff in my recommended lists but people tend to think success equals the top 20 a channel can do quite well for itself on 100k subs especially if it is not kids or games honestly the more off beat it seems like the better chance a channel has anyway it why i always kind of roll my eyes at people trying to get into gaming right now they are about five years too late for that find something nobody else is doing and you will grow quick ,2,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,takes one to know one i guess ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,lol sure textile art is considered kid content now good to know ,1,youtube

LokiOfSassgaard,i got there by posting two videos a week in a category not many other people are posting in think it took about six weeks ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,probably because it was livestreamed youtube handles vods really strangely and tends to cock them up like that sometimes ,2,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,i will send it in a pm ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,it like i said elsewhere somewhere i am pretty sure i am doing well because my content is irrelevant and sanitised and i do honestly think that is the sort of content that going to start fitting into their business model a little more in the future they do not want current events or politics and twitch is luring away the gamers and hopefully the new ad policies will drive away all the clickbait garbage which will ultimately make more room for the weird random stuff youtube started out with originally ,3,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,yep i do speed art and i have been thriving in terms of growth in the last month the channel was never set up to be the primary income source but as a driving force to my online store and it working probably because rather than setting it up as a string of ads for my store i have made it look like the channel is the main focus and that the store is incidental ,3,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,i have been wondering when the youtube bubble would burst for a while now honestly i do think it will continue to be a viable business model for a while but one that will be drastically different by the end of the year ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,well one of those is the direct result of the other this is what happens with corporations need to protect their brands ,3,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,oh i know i totally am but at the same time i have been bit in the ass before with similar sort of situations where common knowledge information was not common at all it hard to find information sometimes when you have no idea what you are even supposed to be looking for ,1,PartneredYoutube
LokiOfSassgaard,even the advertisers are not responsible for doing anything other than protecting their brand and controlling where their money goes most people are already seeing a bounce back some have even completely normalised already this was a single blip in time that will be forgotten about by next year those who have not begun to bounce back maybe need to take a look at their own content to figure out why ,2,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,jack and mark both seem to live within their means i do not know two of the other three names you mentioned but h3h3 are under an incredible financial burden right now and are blowing through their money on legal fees making it impossible to save any money unless the other two have no way of actually saving money then their complaining is the result of poor foresight but even h3h3 have fallen foul of terrible foresight especially because they know their financial situation is shit why have not they diversified where their merch where their fan funding do they even do brand deals do they put any of their money away if they were making so much money to begin with where are their investment accounts where are their savings or did they just piss it all away so that a month of unstable adrev is enough to force them to start selling off assets one thing that absolutely will not fix anything is removing even more ads advertisers have already come back reverting the ad policies will drive them away and then we will all be back to making 2 a day ,5,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,ah cool this is the sort of thing that not a single page or blog post ever mentioned like skype it would have never occurred to me that this is a thing that gets used professionally because it such a clunky horrible thing that good to know ,1,PartneredYoutube

LokiOfSassgaard,i am staying right where i am it comfortable it provides the services that i need for what i am doing it has good brand recognition with a viewerbase that trusts it though god knows why let people leave i do not care it will only help to polish youtube image down the line and this will eventually be remembered as that time they finally cleaned up their policies and took out the trash ,3,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,what in the fuck do you think this is going to accomplish honestly the ad decisions were made to bring advertisers back reversing them will make them leave for good is that what you want ,7,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,ah there it is ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,yeah seek help ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,are you for real ,3,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard, it mind blowing that people like onision who have made upwards of 20 000 in a month some months would not have anything saved to the point where they publicly lose their shit make multiple son story videos claim they may have to sell their home and some cars to survive because of one month in lost revenue seriously that about what i make in a year last year my husband and i took a huge hit to our income when for some dumbass reason he was moved from 40 hours a week to 10 15 it sucked but we did not lose our apartment no utilities got shut off we ate pretty much ramen and white rice for about three months straight but we were still eating if a person can blow 20k in a month then i have no sympathy ,5,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,might want to tell that to philip defranco then he gets hella views and is constantly getting demonetised ,4,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,sounds like you created them yourself and prefer the misery wrought by them then have fun ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,it a boycott not a strike a strike implies that the advertisers are working for youtube when in fact they are using a service provided by them and youtube is not going anywhere people who think that youtube is killing itself are angry that the rules are changing and they got caught up in it plain and simple ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,then it sounds like you may need to seek help and not rely so heavily on an uncertainty ,7,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,nope that exactly what is going on apparently the thought of possibly toning it down a bit is offensive in return ,5,youtube

LokiOfSassgaard,have you ever watched a pdp or markiplier video felix is arguably the one who started all of this and markiplier is like 90 dick jokes gameplay also tends to have a high amount of violence and sexual content so yes edgy there a reason why a lot of gamers including ya boy felix are going to twitch markiplier seems to be sticking to youtube except for the fact that he actually making a move away from the internet in general and wants to do more live action and stage stuff try again and big does not mean exclusively top tier simon cat explosm draw with jazza pretty big names in the art sphere not exactly small and unknown there youtube is terribly diverse but people like you seem to be stuck in your own little bubble if people want to refuse to actually adapt and play by the rules good riddance make more room for those of us who do not need to be edgy to make videos it funny almost every time someone on this sub talks about some big channel that everyone knows i do not have a fucking clue who they are talking about youtube really truly is not all kids and minecraft no matter how badly you want it to be to suit your argument ,2,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,yep this some channels are legitimately hurting but they seem to be the ones who are either refusing to adapt or who did not think far enough ahead to have an exit strategy it really not that hard to not spend your video making dick jokes if dick jokes are who you really are then you would better get on patreon and hope your fans are as loyal as you think they are people keep holding the small creators up on a pedestal as a reason why all of these changes are bad but it the small creators who have the opportunity right now they have the room to adapt and i say this as one of those tiny creators the writing was on the wall six months ago when people started uncovering demonetisation over advertiser guidelines we all agreed to the tos so to turn around and be a belligerent baby over the enforcement of that tos is entitled and ignorant youtube owns the servers and they control what goes on them the advertisers control the money and decide where it goes if you cannot handle these two basic facts then you probably are not ready to be in the entertainment business to begin with ,6,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,seriously i do not think a new tab would work for youtube at all and one can use deviantart as a case study 15 years ago the new tab on da was highly useful and a great place to find new stuff but according to their about page da gets about 160 000 new uploads every day a drop in the bucket compared to what is uploaded to youtube every day and it impossible to find anything relevant on the new page today a new page on youtube would do nothing but show you junk and spam exactly what it shows you on deviantart ,2,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,i can downvote you too pal but no the viewers are not going anywhere like i said my traffic has increased this month and by a not insignificant amount because youtube seems to be pushing my videos to the top of the recommended pile for certain videos you can pretend that youtube is being held up on the backs of gamers and edgy content all you like but with the sheer amount of content being uploaded to youtube every day this is patently untrue and wishful thinking on your part ,4,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,well if youtube really is pushing out all the big creators that just makes room for everyone else ,4,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,honestly my tiny channel may not be making any money but i am getting more recommended traffic these days than i was last month and i am willing to bet it because i am not edgy or relevant or even cool really i do art videos apparently art videos are fitting into the new model quite nicely ,7,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,my livestreams are pretty interactive so it makes sense in a way it was not a side effect of livestreaming that i anticipated though ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,i cannot even really fault them for that though i mean it their platform and they have an image they want i am just not part of that image ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,i looked into that once and it seems incredibly limited in terms of what they actually want on their platform ,3,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,do you watch anything outside of what you are subscribed to ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,yeah all those negative view counts suggest a few videos have been removed i am guessing it was a dead channel that op forgot about and now it rebranded and active again ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,i think you forgot something buddy ,9,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,oh jesus netflix does this and it the single most annoying thing netflix does please do not bring it to youtube d ,2,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,you are still missing the point the companies like coca cola do not want to be directly funding certain ideals if you do not see the logic in that then you are probably part of the problem to begin with ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,honestly i love the overall feeling of hypocrisy with people who bitch about the boycott yep it sucks and it hurting a lot of people but at the same time if you want to be a part of new media you cannot expect old media rules to apply the rules are changing fast and people will have to adapt or die it sucks but it nothing new the rules changed when media shifted from print to radio and then from radio to television of course they are changing now edit i mean bitch about it all you want but at least be informed as to the reason and rationale behind it ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,do you own a business because if you did you would understand that pr is everything ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,eh h3h3 could disable links very easily but apparently they do not want to ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,twitch is a terrible platform for the majority of what actually gets posted to youtube though they have their creative and irl sections but as someone who uses youtube to post art and tutorials i cannot possibly see how twitch would ever be a viable option ,16,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,lol whoops ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,assuming that the ads are being pulled because people are making that conscious association is ignorant while there may be unconscious associations by some people being made that not the real issue when companies say that they do not want their brand associated with certain ideals it not that they think people will assume that coke is in league with some random racist individual it that coke does not want their money to go to and directly support that individual because when you run ads on someone video you are directly supporting them monetarily you pay money youtube handles it as a third party and then gives it to the creator secondly the advertisers do not owe you or any other creator anything and can pull their ads for whatever reason they want period ,7,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,remindme 3 weeks,1,confession
LokiOfSassgaard,why would not they if they created the sounds or the license for the sounds allowed whatever kind of use someone wants let them monetise ,5,PartneredYoutube

LokiOfSassgaard,socialblade goes off of an average ad rate per so many views which is why on large channels you will see hilariously vague guesses like 1 4k 30k for a daily income estimate ,5,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,it more of an opposable index finger than a second thumb difference is the phalanges ,1,todayilearned
LokiOfSassgaard,i do not even know what he thought he was attempting ,3,nononono
LokiOfSassgaard,i guarantee that if youtube had a service where you could pay for placement like that it would not be hidden not with the amount of money to be made from a service like that ,2,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,yep that a thing channels with a certain number of subscribers 1000 cannot remember have a chance of being selected to show up there ,1,youtube

LokiOfSassgaard, remindme 3 weeks,1,confession
LokiOfSassgaard,this i tried it out for about a day and it can be very easy to accidentally use it to add misleading or blatantly incorrect metadata to your video which is the most common reason for random shut downs ,1,NewTubers
LokiOfSassgaard,i have done it videos that were poorly shit but had informational value straight up for redone from the ground up it was not that time consuming and interested it like any other video ,2,youtubers
LokiOfSassgaard,i remove stuff that obviously spam but that it ,4,youtubers
LokiOfSassgaard,i am so confused what is even going on here ,7,mildlyinteresting
LokiOfSassgaard,yeah that what the metadata is your tags title description thumbnails all that stuff ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,yep be the annoying friend who wo not shut up if you have got a twitter post it on there a few times eventually someone will notice we all started there do not feel bad ,4,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,unfortunately at first you either have to be a bit annoying about it or you have to be willing to be very patient and put a lot of focus into your metadata make your video extremely searchable so people will be able to find it on their own ,5,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,just obfuscate it rather than making it clickable make it so it has to be manually typed out blah at blah dot com clickable email addresses used to be super awesome but these days they are a super pain in the ass alternately set up a google form attached to the email address and link to that ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,i have started streaming recently as well and i have also noticed that i experience a good bump in traffic and new subs the day after i have only got like four or five people who come in but those people tend to stay for most of the stream if not the whole thing i see a huge bump in watch time comments and retention which is the opposite of what someone told me would happen but i guess five people watching a solid two hour stream is all it takes to bring the overall averages up but i imagine people stick around because my streams are more of a sit and chat with the audience sort of deal where i answer questions and give advice and just chat in general really but all of that interaction seems to be pushing me higher in the search rankings one thing i have noticed is that my sunday streams vastly out perform any other day of the week i may start streaming at different times in the day throughout the week to see if there is a best time to stream overall ,1,NewTubers
LokiOfSassgaard,yep i get that coming up with new content is hard but sparklez has not even really been trying lately ,3,mildlyinfuriating

LokiOfSassgaard,man i forgot all about mailto i have not had to manually code that in aaaages i remember thinking i was so clever when i figured it out too but yeah i still would not put it in a youtube description pretty sure the inbox would explode ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,huh i am vaguely surprised that cc is not one of those universal things like hd is ,9,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,adwords does not have any time limit on what videos can be promoted as long as it not actually breaking any rules there no reason someone should not be able to waste money on this crap ,3,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,no ,4,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,i honestly do not think you would want to with the amount of bots swarming around youtube you will be added to so many mailing lists if you make your email address public like that put it in your about section where it hidden by a captcha and link to that ,3,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,youtube model is television created by its users and subscribe is a television term hence subscribers rather than followers ,6,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,yeah mine about a 20 80 split which seems like it on the high end it used to be closer to a 10 90 split until i started livestreaming ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,it because of the way the emails are formatted some people do not realise that it a blast email going to everyone who recently bought the product and assume that they are being specifically asked ,2,mildlyinfuriating
LokiOfSassgaard, this explains how to convert a picture to a pattern https www youtube com watch v 8eqehiydykq pretty easily you need software like paint net https www getpaint net to add a dither which increases the amount of detail you can get with the limited colour palette once you get through the pdn part of the process import your picture into your pattern making software of choice ,3,CrossStitch
LokiOfSassgaard,i what those signs are not supposed to work like that what ,2,mildlyinteresting
LokiOfSassgaard,not so much with a martini though ,2,mildlyinteresting
LokiOfSassgaard,yep though i tend to stick with olives because i am boring like that and also allergic to onions ,2,mildlyinteresting
LokiOfSassgaard,pickled onions are another garnish for a martini cheese is a common finger food to pair with wine ,2,mildlyinteresting
LokiOfSassgaard,i wonder if these people find any benefit from doing this like surely it gets a spike in views but does it actually help their channel at all ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,my cousin was expelled in the third grade for being a destructive little brat earlier in the year after every add medication ever failed to work they figured out that he does not metabolise dairy properly which manifests in extreme hyperactivity general add like symptoms she told the school this but because of some bullshit rule they still had to serve him milk but he did not have to drink it because third graders totally have strong impulse control right that was the year my aunt graduated med school while working a full time job and home schooling her son ,2,todayilearned
LokiOfSassgaard,this is straight up elder futhark ,2,mildlyinteresting
LokiOfSassgaard,yep it kind of the same deal as being view 301 back in the day also why you will occasionally see videos with loads of likes but almost no views ,2,PartneredYoutube
LokiOfSassgaard,views are not counted in real time it an estimate youtube audits views to make sure they are real and updates in slow time the real time stats are not very accurate as a result ,2,PartneredYoutube
LokiOfSassgaard,what are the channels something like this was posted the other day where a channel was gaining an absurd number of subscribers every second ,3,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,it a combination of the videos being considered transformative and the game devs seeing youtube as free press mostly it the game devs letting it slide see nintendo for instances where monetising gameplay is a goddamn nightmare ,3,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,no the videos are clickable but the links in the description are not unless you click on the video itself which nobody does ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,yeah it does not seem like anything is actually changing it still funny though ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,welp this should not be as funny as it is ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,if a channel is getting view counts that match their sub count that channel is doing exceptionally well ,1,youtube

LokiOfSassgaard,oh you are on the app yeah that changes everything might have to try to catch it while you are on desktop ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,basically it means that something else in the same factory is made with gm products and they tried their goddamn best to keep them separate but there only so much you can do to keep those tiny particles where they belong ,3,mildlyinfuriating
LokiOfSassgaard,well i am stumped then in the past i have always been given a little thing right there on the page to select why i do not want to see the ad ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,lol yeah i will probably never get out of the enough for a big mac ghetto but at least this dude having fun ,3,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,click on that little i in the corner it will give you an option to stop seeing it ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,it pretty solid from what i can see not to mention in the video he shows his analytics by straight up pointing the camera at his laptop i am not saying that impossible to doctor but it would be a lot of effort to doctor the numbers through all that polarisation just to pretend to be making more money than he does he also like ten seconds later mentions dropping 10k on car mods to keep his videos exciting considering the cars in his videos i have no problem at all believing that number ,2,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,jesus fucking christ dude chill out you started it by posting this vague ass post demanding to know more i have examined the evidence provided and have concluded that you are a wanker ,10,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,so this dude uploads daily and seems to get around two million views per week that pretty damn good for a channel his size actually a good number of his videos have close to if not more views than he has subscribers i am not even going to bother to wank about speculations on how those views convert to dollars through ad rates because he straight up shows his screen it not even a screen cap that could be easily doctored if he going to doctor this shit he got skills and patience i do not understand why you are doubting him when he literally showing you his analytics you can see the date range why you hating on this guy for doing well leave him alone ,6,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,these days if an email takes 10 minutes to get to me i start swearing at my spam filter for being a dickbag even if the spam filter is not actually to blame ,13,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,subscribers are irrelevant it monetised views i would wager most channels only see between 10 20 of their total traffic coming from their subscribers without seeing any relevant information it hard to say how much he likely to be making ,8,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,https www youtube com my videos o u hit the downward facing arrow and click download mp4 ,2,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,you can download the raw file from your creator studio i have done that a few times ,2,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard, yeah you can see it there a preview button and everything have you ever even gone to the end screen page it actually very easy to know exactly how it will look ,6,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,i disagree the templates are amazing because it lets you create a graphical end card that never has to be messed with again they save so much time do not punish people who use it well just because some asshat has no idea what they are doing ,12,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,this is not only one of the most trivial things to be concerned about it looks so much cleaner this way this is one of those things that did not matter at first because nobody ever considered that a video might get hundreds of thousands or even millions of likes 1 545 792 is a really messy number 1 5m takes up less space and is much easier to understand at a quick glance ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,advertiser boycott ,8,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,yeah youtube has it set up where it can only appear in the last 20 seconds and only if there so much lead up time ahead of it i do not think the lead up time is long enough at all ,4,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,i am guessing it a really short video less than a minute right this is nothing new and was implemented last year tell the creator that their end screen is annoying as fuck if they care they will change it they probably do not care though if their end screen looks like that ,8,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,no they are really not ,4,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,youtube limits the amount of ads you can place on any video so you can place as many as you like but youtube will override it ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,because it a not even new anymore feature called the end screen which allows the creator to recommend videos channels and websites during the last 20 seconds ,23,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,they can leave for whatever reason they like here the thing you seem to be coming from a place of strong entitlement but the advertisers do not owe you shit they do not hold any obligation toward you or any other content creator be it on youtube or any other platform where a company chooses to place their ads and why they choose to stop running those ads is nobody business but that company you have got two subscribers and 247 views your channel has been there since 2014 the fact of the matter is this is a situation that does not effect you and will never effect you rejoice you are seeing fewer ads than you were a month ago ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,what about wanting to protect their brand is not a legitimate reason ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,they can leave for whatever reason they like ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,holy wall of text batman but no you are 100 wrong the advertisers are concerned about their brands and have every right to pull their ads from google services for whatever reason they want if youtube were to say fuck you to these advertisers it sets a really bad precedent one that means that youtube would have to ditch the advertiser model all together because if they tell companies to take their ads elsewhere everyone will do exactly that youtube would have to become a paywalled service which oh i see you are bitching about that as well you cannot have it both ways bro google and by extension youtube is a massively expensive endeavour adrev is the only thing that makes it profitable because red simply is not performing as well as it needs to be to keep youtube afloat anybody with monetised videos can see this in the huge discrepancy between adrev and redrev ,6,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,i kinda like it ,2,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,oh newer videos are deffo getting more views than the ones before that tutorial but it would be unfair to say that it entirely because of the tutorial since the reason i was able to do that vid in the first place was that i got a new camera that let me film in better detail and it the one i have been using on all my videos since for most things the jump between 720p and 1080p is not that big of a deal but it made a world of difference for close up fiddly needlework videos that was also right around the time i reconfigured my entire recording setup to suit the new camera so a lot happened to my channel at once making it more likely that everything at once contributed to my channel getting more attention after that tutorial video went up but at this point that tutorial video has become the driving force behind organic discoverability to my channel ,3,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,my videos typically range between 50 200 views depending on how detailed and complex the subject matter is except for a tutorial i uploaded not too long ago which has about 8k views and gets around 150 a day i am pretty sure that the video people find my channel through where people go from there is really odd sometimes i can sometimes see a spike where a few people have discovered that video at the same time or are sharing it with friends or whatever and then the videos that get views afterwards are really random before the tutorial started to gain traction i was doing a lot of facebook promotion i have pretty much stopped that at this point and am gaining new subscribers at the same rate i was before though i am about to start experimenting with instagram to see if that can give me a bit of a boost ,3,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,i woke up to someone apparently going through and disliking a lot of my videos and i just have to laugh at least stick around to insult me in the comments so i know you mean it ,2,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,that really interesting it reminds me of kurzgesagt in a way ,1,NewTubers
LokiOfSassgaard,hi i am milesy and i do textile speed art and tutorials related to what i do the art that i make is created with a needle and thread and ranges from simple designs to highly detailed thread paintings while small pieces can take as little as two or three hours to do some have taken 70 hours or more to complete https www youtube com madxstitcher,1,NewTubers
LokiOfSassgaard,seriously i make a habit of occasionally clicking every button in my creator studio in case something new shows up youtube never went out of their way to tell me about end screens i found that shit on my own ,2,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,so you are using a phone with no service ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,so wait are you doing gameplay or product review because these are two vastly different genres ,2,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,yeah that one is kind of bright and in your face is not it lol,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,of course they do that why they are such a big deal you are judging youtube demographic based on your own personal bubble but from where i am sitting based on my channel analytics most of the youtube audience are women between the ages of 35 60 and that is a demo that traditionally spends a lot of money being the people most likely to be shopping for the household even if teens and pre teens do make up the market share they are also big spenders albeit indirectly most of the time they are the demo whose income is 100 disposable making them free to throw money at the latest mobile game they are also the number one reason family phone plans go over their limits causing parents to have to look for cheaper alternatives ads are also targeted to specific individuals based on their entire internet activity i get a lot of ads for the local college in my town because my husband will be starting there this year so we have been doing a lot of research on it and what programs it offers for his field i also get a lot of ads in japanese and korean because a decent chunk of my subscriptions are either japanese or korean or have been spending time over there and doing videos on japan or korea i live in rural washington state and speak neither japanese nor korean so these ads are wasted on me but have been targeted based on what youtube thinks i am into ,3,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,mine typically take about half the time to process that they did to upload but my videos are also a lot smaller in size ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,i would suggest against scripting something that traditionally a real time reaction like gameplay should be unless you are a skilled actor the audience can smell fake a mile away and if you are not a good talker and are considering scripting your videos you are probably not a skilled actor instead i would suggest livestreaming or buddying up with someone to get the banter rolling even if your buddy does not have a channel just having someone else to talk to can make you more comfortable talking to yourself ,3,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,man i love it when my recommendations get completely befuddled like that though that how i found some of my favourite channels ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,this and the advertisers on facebook are not the same as the ones on youtube the vast majority of facebook ads are clickbait blogs that thrive off of negativity ,7,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,you are not making any money yet unless you are breaking the adsense tos but if you pirate software that helps you make money and you are caught you may be forced to pay every cent of the money you made with the pirated software to the developer ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,i hang on to the ones i might need to refer back to later and also to use as a visual element in my end screens raw videos get deleted after the uploadable version has been edited to save space i have got 3tb of storage on my pc so it will probably be a while before i need to start pruning down for the ones that go in my end screen i pick a random one from the folder and grab 20 seconds from it and crop it to fit ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,if this is still giving you a problem i think i have figured out what is going on my videos are backdating themselves to february somehow they are there with the correct date but showing up several pages back in the video manager ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,right here https www youtube com branding,2,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,because they are two totally different and totally optional features that have nothing to do with one another that like asking why there a subscribe button on the channel if there also one on the video description ,2,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard, but you should seriously consider in getting a real job and next time have enough to cover yourself for at least 3 months rent and utitlies stashed away and not rely on a 3rd party system where at anytime they cancel your ass and you would have gotten nothing lol my husband and i both have real jobs and we do not even come close to managing this who does ,3,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,it a b testing two of my channels have the new layout while my main channel has the old one i am kind of torn on the new layout honestly it clean but i think maybe too clean also the links in my new visitor video are not clickable on my channel page which is irritating nobody clicks on the new visitor video to watch it ,2,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,click the little i icon in the lower left and tell youtube that the ad is repetitive also those grammarly ads are stupid as hell how did a person get to a position of being able to be hired for a social media director position and not know the difference between their and they are ,2,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,nah it just your carrier i get this a lot when i am away from the house i was trying to watch a matpat video on the train the other day and could not get it above 240 ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,it not your phone it your carrier ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,no the one in seattle was genuinely stuck and causing all sorts of problems because of it ,8,misleadingthumbnails
LokiOfSassgaard,this recommendations are great if you watch videos from channels you are not subscribed to if you only watch what you are subscribed to youtube assumes that all you ever want to watch because you have not given it anything else to go on ,6,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,yep this is another problem with networks that i have noticed there have been a few times i have been curious enough to look into them but if you are not a gamer there even less to gain from being in one ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,mine bounced back quite a way and normalised but it still a bit lower than it was before i had one day where i earned literally nothing and then just 1 2 for a while ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,the worst ones i would imagine ,11,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,this is a feature not a bug phones often have stricter data limits so quality gets throttled to save the consumer a potential headache ,1,youtube

LokiOfSassgaard,sure i mean if you are going to insist i am saying things i am not that your cake as well ,-3,Minecraft
LokiOfSassgaard,yes but it not a term ever used by mojang or minecraft like you said it an mmo thing but since they came to minecraft from mmos they brought a lot of that vernacular with them and it got picked up by people who never touched an mmo in their life a nerdpole is that giant single block pole you build to get up to a high place ,-3,Minecraft
LokiOfSassgaard,your ridiculous math aside if i even had what is remaining each month i would be in much better shape than i am now ,5,mildlyinfuriating
LokiOfSassgaard,i think it a yogscast thing that leached into common vernacular just like calling the entities mobs apparently that came from them as well ,0,Minecraft
LokiOfSassgaard,no that pretty normal really there are certain blocks during the day when people are more likely to be online than during other times of day this is why some channels agonise over the best time of day to schedule a video you want to hit those moments when the bulk of your demographic usually americans let be honest unless your channel is not in english are likely to be around on weekdays that before and after work school and maybe a blip around noon for lunch on weekends it a little more all over the place and will change depending on your demographic people unsubbing at once are likely just people with commitments who go chill on youtube for a little bit between getting home and having dinner and with a good half of the country being strongly rural the time they are eating dinner wo not be the same as people in the city whose schedules are less dependent on the sun and more dependent business hours which means realistically you are getting east coast and west coast peaks if your channel is not in english that an even simpler answer most countries do not span six time zones so the peaks between business hours will be even more predictable ,2,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,i did a two hour stream today during which the live dashboard said i was either not streaming or streaming with very poor health yet people in the chat assured me repeatedly that everything is fine this is a pretty normal experience also a normal experience is for the chat to just straight up not work until i pop it in and out to a new tab a few times and spam it a bit then i get everything that been said to me all at once i have started having a friend come into chat about five minutes before i go live so i can make sure it actually works ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,is anybody else getting this it mostly affecting my livestreams but a few of my uploads are being funny as well they bury themselves in the video manager sometimes months back the one i did today is showing up behind two videos that were posted yesterday ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,the companies that advertise on facebook tend to be vastly different from the ones who advertise on youtube i do not think i have ever seen an at t ad on facebook it all the same clickbait garbage that shows up in your feed anyway clickbait garbage feeds off of hate and negativity which is why it does so well over there ,3,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,all of this my stepfather threw my brother through a wall something which i learned the other day he straight up does not remember and i cannot say i am surprised he was real good at convincing cps the school and the police that we were making up stories to get him in trouble and hurting ourselves as part of an elaborate scheme to get him to divorce our mother cps is fucking garbo ,4,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,at least the bots on my channel are just the ones trying to get me to sub 4 sub i am really surprised a lot of these bigger channels have not just outright blocked links though ,1,youtube

LokiOfSassgaard,obviously i did not mean like that do not be obtuse ,3,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,yep deletion is forever it even tells you that when you delete a video but it seems more likely that these videos have been privated since the playlists still show the number of videos in them they just could not bear to lose all those views i guess ,8,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,for comedy not really i find a lot of comedy on youtube pretty cringeworthy so i tend to avoid it this is why you should put the sort of stuff you are looking for in your post though ,1,youtube

LokiOfSassgaard,there a store called stuff next to my mum house ,1,mildlyinfuriating
LokiOfSassgaard,it did not increase any more than it would have while i had it visible had hiding the counter made people more likely to click the button you would expect the red line to be above the blue creating an upward curve but when i made the sub count visible again the red line still matched the same even trajectory with no curve ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,i do not even think channels who were partnered but under the threshold and reached it after the new policy should have been grandfathered in honestly and i say this as someone with an affected channel it easy to approve a channel when it only had one video you have no way of knowing what the rest of the content is going to be getting to 10k which i agree is also too low typically takes enough videos to at least set a trend ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,no because there is nothing youtube can do about this beyond what they are already doing to address the concerns laid out by the boycott no ads are being served on your videos that all there is to it ,2,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,get prepared for a sea of downvotes from that one pal everybody took a hit like this it really truly honestly not just you ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,there an ad boycott on this drop is hitting everybody ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,no ,3,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,yeah it really is i got my fun out of it in about the first six hours now i check back about every few weeks and feel like i have not missed anything new ,2,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,eh it nothing to write home about honestly and about 90 of that is just how poorly laid out it is as a message board it got overhauled recently and somehow got even worse but yeah i had the same frustration why keep telling me about it when i cannot access it though that probably exactly what it is a way to drum up enthusiasm for it because people do not seem to actually want to use it once they get access to it ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,idk i did not try you should be able to maybe ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,i contacted support and did not get much of an answer if you search your video manager with the video id which you ought to be able to get from the email youtube sent you when the upload finished you should be able to find it that what i had to do to find my vod ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,honestly i do not think the subscription model is the way to go at all that the model that most media is moving away from because it does get absurdly expensive before too long if the subscription model worked you would not see ads on videos that direct people to patreon and i am not talking tiny creators there are folks i watch with hundreds of thousands if not millions of subscribers hawking their patreon pages if people actually wanted to subscribe channels like ten second songs 331erock and smoothmcgroove would not need ads at all and yet there are still ads ,2,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,i think this is something going round because i have got a livestream vod that has vanished into the ether it there and shows up in the playlist on my channel for past livestreams but otherwise does not seem to exist ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,in the next comment it took a while to type ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,i have seen enough people say that a low subscriber count can turn people off from subscribing to your channel so i turned off my subscriber count on one of my channels for about six weeks to see if there would be any difference in growth between a predicted trajectory and reality the little wiggle between the beginning of march and around march 16 is socialblade not being sure whether i had 100 or 102 subscribers i was not actually sure whether or not to put any merit into the claims i was testing but i am not really surprised by the outcome at all the overlaid blue line shows an even trajectory from february 5th to yesterday if the claim that led me to hide my subscriber count were true then the spike a few days ago should have come up higher than the blue line following the trend set in february but instead both sides of the flatline align almost perfectly it a very small sample but i am curious if other people have tried similar experiments or noticed other trends with a hidden subscriber count on their channels ,5,youtube

LokiOfSassgaard,i think there a big problem with people conflating moral support with monetary support i see a lot of people including big youtubers who argue that everyone knows that a coke ad on a video does not meant that coke agrees with or supports those views except a coke ad on a video does mean that coke has supported those views monetarily not wanting your money to go to a certain group or individual with certain views that do not align with your own brand image is a perfectly valid concern because even if the ceo of coke morally agrees with the videos the ads were placed on that a bad look for coke as a product especially today and it still within their right to pull their ads for this reason ,1,youtube

LokiOfSassgaard,seriously if you are not enjoying it that more reason to stop doing it than any number of reasons to keep going especially if it something you have no obligation to continue doing there zero reason to spend your free time doing something you do not enjoy ,3,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,you know the amount of posts about this i have seen over the last few days really makes me wonder why youtube does not bother to alert its users to changes to the site ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,that not the point though the point is that people watching cnn are probably watching it for news and are more likely to skip viral stuff while people watching g4viralvideos are probably watching for funny videos they can share with their friends ,12,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,well they were trying to do exactly that with the advertiser guidelines unfortunately that proved to be a massive failure so now they are doing it this way the problem with relying on user flags is that if your audience agrees with you nobody going to flag you as being part of the problem ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,first come up with an idea then film the idea edit it upload channel started seriously though this is such a vague request it hard to know exactly what information you are after ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,i put mine up in a card and remind people of it every few videos the thing about patreon is that people who fund you get stuff in return beyond just the warm fuzzies of donating my channel one where physical or tangible items are produced so those items get offered as perks ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,livestream let the audience help you write a song ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,if the older videos are from channels with greater watch time and interaction that probably why they are higher ,5,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,oh well in that case go to bed it well past your bed time ,3,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,yeah it will get there eventually i mean realistically this is google and google wo not just roll over and play dead and companies wo not want to keep their ads off of google forever because again it google they are practically ubiquitous with the internet in a lot of ways they had a point to made the message was received loud and clear and now measures are being taken to fix the issues between a few companies coming back and the new threshold for even putting ads on your videos which does not affect you in the least you are well above it ads are starting to return i have almost normalised on my channel but i have also started livestreaming recently to help it out there are more and more ads to go around every day but unfortunately most of them are ultra low bidding ads so we are seeing a very small payout from them it also seems like the ads that are going around are all stupidly long right now too so more people are skipping ads than usual i have seen more 3 minute ads than i have 15 second bumper ads over the last week or so and i feel bad for skipping them but fuck that giant ad i do not want to sit through that when the bumpers come back en masse is when everything will start to normalise across the board when that will be who can say ,3,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,honey i was in high school too for four years go do your homework ,3,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,yes there an advertiser boycott on right now no ads are getting served basically a huge number of major companies pulled their ads a while ago and it resulting in as much as an 80 drop in revenue for some channels others are starting to see a bounce back depending on their content but you have to really make sure you are advertiser friendly and appeal any demonetisation that comes your way in the wake of the boycott they are also demonetising channels and videos based on metadata if your videos are all still showing that they are monetised you are probably just feeling the collateral damage if not appeal everything they are not doing anything manually but on an algorithm based on your metadata they have basically set it to be on a hair trigger and are relying on appeals to fine tune and teach it context which sucks for the users caught up in it but it honestly a better way than setting it at the lowest setting and relying on user flags doing it this way also sends a clear message to the advertisers that the reasons they are concerned about content are being addressed and is slowly bringing companies back ,7,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,i do not know try it once more or maybe i just remember pulling that same line on my folks every night and the power trip i got from getting away with it feels good when it works does not it go do your homework ,4,youtube

LokiOfSassgaard,i am also looking at who uploaded these videos people who subscribe to cnn are probably a much different demographic than people who subscribe to g4 i did not even realise they were still a presence since the network no longer exists ,12,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,the fact that they are so regularly spaced is what gets me i wonder what is causing it ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,huh those are some pretty regular peaks then do you stream or something because that what my charts look like on upload days ,3,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,also a lie as old as school itself ,7,youtube

LokiOfSassgaard,oh go do your homework ,7,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,i found the middle schooler ,18,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,1 not very at all not without a lot of hustle and a bit of luck 2 it depends entirely on your content no more than once a day if you are gaming and no less than once a week for everything else is a good rule 3 it depends on how and where you are promoting and the quality genre of your videos there no overall expectation here some take years to get to the first 100 subscribers and some get lucky with the very first video and hit 1000 in a week 4 again it depends on what sort of video you are doing screenname sort of channel names are perfectly fine for gaming but if you are doing something else the name should be relevant to what you are doing 5 this is mostly up to you it harder to grow two channels than it is one but at the same time the overlap in demographic may not be as big as you like it to be people who are there for one sort of content may get fed up with the other and leave for example ,3,youtube

LokiOfSassgaard,i do not think topical is a guarantee of anything other than unneeded stress i mean the only channels that topical content even works for is news channels and there are so many of those that never even get off the ground just like every other kind of channel ,1,PartneredYoutube
LokiOfSassgaard,i once ordered a few pieces of balsa wood the biggest one was 3 4 x18 it shipped media mail and came in a box the size of one of those christmas tree bins walmart sells in the winter fury did not begin to describe my emotional state the pack would have fit very easily in one of the post office provided mailing tubes and still had room to spare and then amazon has the balls to refuse to send you something unless you spend 25 on other things because it would be too expensive to ship on its own ,2,mildlyinfuriating
LokiOfSassgaard,the problem with topical content that i have is you cannot plan ahead which leaves you having to be constantly thinking about and working on your next video i do not do topical content i have a month of videos banked up right now so i can focus on videos that are fun and something that i want to work on and if i wind up back in the er like i did in february i do not have to worry about my channel going dead for a few weeks while i am unable to record you do not have that insurance with topical content ,1,PartneredYoutube

LokiOfSassgaard,do you mean superchat superchat is really only useful during a livestream chat on massive channels where even with slow mode on it impossible to keep up with everything being said there no need for that sort of functionality anywhere else on the site since comments can be easily filtered and read at one leisure ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,i would make sure you still have permission anyway if it his demonstration it possible that it something he considers his own personal work anyway ,2,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,probably not i like the music i have now ,2,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,you know that it in youtube best interest if you are successful most people wo not be but especially now since youtube is not putting ads on channels that do not perform well they want more creators to do well enough to gets more ads showing ,1,youtube

LokiOfSassgaard,i picked the sea turtles because it was outdoors and would have therefore needed the best editing but the thumbnails and title are the very first thing people will see that what makes people click on a video at all yours are very yellow from indoor lighting which can send a message of low quality ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,not just videos but youtube itself has the creator academy https creatoracademy youtube com page education you will see articles from it linked every now and then on your dashboard and even on your front page ,1,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard, the algorithms need to take some time to learn where they should show ads and where they should not says byrne and so by nature they start out kind of with a smaller set of inventory that they serve ads on byrne says one of the ways the software will learn is if youtube producers challenge a bad choice something more people need to be made aware of but it does make sense to start out the algorithm on the strictest setting and slowly tone it down rather than the other way round but youtube could be doing a much better job at communicating this rather than letting everyone think that their content is being specifically targeted for whatever reason ,2,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,not to mention if it were fake that means she would be keeping it up every time felix is just casually vlogging she very soft spoken which can make her voice seem higher than it is watch her play games with felix when she gets louder and starts shouting back she does pitch down a little bit ,3,youtube
LokiOfSassgaard,focus on your thumbnails and lose the allcaps in your titles you do not really stand out much against everyone else who going to be in sub boxes alongside you and the allcaps is a bit clickbaity even if it just some quick colour correction to the frame you pull from your vlogs and an embedded caption as for your videos 20 seconds is way too long for an intro i clicked on the sea turtle one and got bored before i saw the turtles vlogs especially need to have something engaging during the first few seconds then you can do a quick under five seconds intro to let people know who you are once into the actual vlog your sound needs to be more levelled out at least on this video the music is deafening but you are kind of hard to hear in some spots i would drop your music track about 15db and run your voice through a lowpass to try to filter out some of the background noise it looks like you are having fun though which is a big plus but as it is i would wager it these things that are probably keeping people away luckily they are all very easily fixed ,1,youtube
