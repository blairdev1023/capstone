sik-sik-siks,ok fair points thanks for giving me some ideas ,2,buildapc
sik-sik-siks,he not floating he got the most ridiculous leg strength ever odds are solidly in his favour ,1,gaming
sik-sik-siks,huh is there a build you can point me to that represents what you are suggesting i see this one https ca pcpartpicker com guide fsgxsy entry level gaming build and it has no os and is already 850 ,1,buildapc
sik-sik-siks,there are several i5 3570 and 4690 on the same cl recently dell machines with no gpus but for 300 400 instead less or same ram smaller drives no ssds dell proprietary mobos that i cannot seem to learn much about do you think that one of those might be better value long term ,1,buildapc
sik-sik-siks,yeah i totally forgot to include the os but it has win 7 pro it sounds like the gpu is most people main problem with this build can i drop a 470 into this machine i only mentioned the 1050 ti because i have seen it in combination with other older cpus in a couple months time i could justify a purchase of a different gpu if that is the only thing everyone really despises about this system i mean i would want to try this out a bit first i am certainly not looking for bf1 at ultra settings or anything i have never really had a machine that could do that i am very used to looking at med settings on a game and thinking it looks fine thanks for your input maybe if i got three more 6950 i could save on heating costs in the winter ,1,buildapc
sik-sik-siks,i forgot to put the os in the parts list but that is also a considerable cost factor and the gpu is already in the machine there was just no price info available from pp i did notice that this particular cpu has great multicore performance but not great single core compared to some other cpus so you do not think the whole package taken as a whole or in all its pieces is worth it ,1,buildapc
sik-sik-siks,what is so bad about the gpu this mobo will allow 3 way crossfire if i can find a couple more of them did you really just suggest i should buy a console and several people agree i am amazed ,1,buildapc
sik-sik-siks,but that would be around 1k would not it ,1,buildapc
sik-sik-siks,you did not include a video card or an os is your recommendation really that much better than this machine ,1,buildapc
sik-sik-siks,so your comments stand out as being the only one reasonably in favour of this i thought this gpu could also be overclocked the gpu and mobo together can run 3 way crossfire or 4 way sli if i changed brands and invested heavily the ssd is older but highly regarded and the case is apparently made for maximum airflow to keep it all cool i am surprised someone even suggested i should get a console instead what do you think would be the best things to do to this setup to improve it without spending too much right away ,1,buildapc
sik-sik-siks,something like that seems like around twice the cost though is there anything i could do to this one ,1,buildapc
sik-sik-siks,yeah pretty unusual eh it does not figure hugely into my decision but it is kind of a cool extra ,1,buildapc
sik-sik-siks,meanwhile i would just like to get some nice mellow old school outdoor so i can actually smoke a whole joint and not feel like i am having a heart attack ,1,AdviceAnimals
