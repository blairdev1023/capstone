onewordpoet,what i said is literally constructive criticism the tones should be darker pictures need to have a range of value and this would benefit by haveing more of a range is what it is but i also paint ,2,Art
onewordpoet,the entire left side could be bumped down specifically those tree shadows could really be adding a lot more than they do they are competing with the same color sidewalk opposide the building i will make a lil edit in photoshop and show you instead of trying to explain it here http imgur com a btq3c is what i mean value wise with watercolor you are painting the light you have gotta illuminate with sharp contrasts and these fixes i am suggesting are all doable with one wash like it would probably take a couple of minutes to carefully lay a wash over that area ,12,Art
onewordpoet,sure but that my critique it would look better if it made more sense color wise but retained the impressionistic aspect it seems like you want somewhat of a real sense of color here seeing as the trees be green and whatnot just one painter offering critique to another actually i usually only offer critique but its usually met with well it doesnt have to be that way stifles growth ,21,Art
onewordpoet,not bad love the energy would like to see more dark values here just more of a range of value like some facades just dont make sense color wise the way the people are handled is just great and i do admire the freshness of that building how it just looks splashed onto the page sweet,20,Art

onewordpoet,no problem i promise to post more,1,pics
onewordpoet,im tryna ride that edge haha art with some soul ,1,pics
onewordpoet,i would always recommend getting a grasp on drawing before starting watercolor black and white is a little easier to handle than all those colors it will make the transition easier but you do not necessarily have to art is art do wut ya want but you areeee making sense,10,pics
onewordpoet,sure send me a private message ,1,pics
onewordpoet,aw that so nice ya will are nice ,22,wallpapers
onewordpoet,dude that is fucking awesome thanks for sharing that love it,7,pics
onewordpoet,usually they call the cops,6,pics
onewordpoet,what i like to do is lay down fresh water wherever you want the paint to be paint wont go anywhere that water is not when the area is damp just drop in some color and angles the painting around to spread the water for that blue shadow i carefully wet the area it was supposed to go first like the entire fuckin fence shadow included with that part wet i could just lay down color wherever i wanted the color mixes on it own do not be fussy with it you want to avoid pawing the paper too as that makes for some dirty pictures as for the white i use masking fluid for all the whites after i put pencil down i map out the highlights and apply mask to those areas then you dont have to worry about losing your whites you can let the watercolor roam freely like it meant to as for being patient yes you must mustmustmust wait between layers for them to dry completely i am guilty sometimes of not waiting and kind of ruining a painting blow dryers work wonders for this it keeps the act of painting active so you dont feel like you are just sitting around waiting i know you want to fix that mistake but let it dry take a look at it and then make your decision great questions it seems a lot of people have similar ones so i figured i would just sum it up here i struggle with these things still watercolor is very frustrating to begin with another tip get some arches 140lb cold press watercolor paper not the sketch book the block just tell the art store people to find it for ya happy painting ,5,pics
onewordpoet,oh hey guys how fuckin flattering enjoy your wallpaper edit instagram darjarri ,235,wallpapers

onewordpoet,you are very nice ,2,pics
onewordpoet,my instagram is darjarri i post there the most ,3,pics
onewordpoet,wow great critique i would tend to agree i originally did not want there to be any distinction between the wall and floor like have the shadow do all of that interpretation for you i wanted the shadow to remain all the same color no matter where it was landing but i crossed that threshold and now more darks would certainly do the trick great eye man i prefer critiques thats how we get better ,5,pics
onewordpoet,i considered it when i was a youngin not so much now ,2,pics
onewordpoet,nah,1,pics
onewordpoet,if ya want here my instagram darjarri,4,pics
onewordpoet,i want to wait and see if anyone can guess the spot ,19,pics
onewordpoet,just to get the hang of the colors like i took a blank piece of paper and just did a wash of orange on half the paper and a wash of blue on the other half not all blues and oranges are the same so it took a little tweaking to get the exact shades i wanted ,17,pics
onewordpoet,all of those things on site sketches are really important to familiarize yourself with the subject i like to throw down washes on a separate piece of paper to lock in what colors i am going to use i take many pictures because the shadows are only going to be there in real life for a couple of minutes and with this piece its entirely reliant on the shadows ,76,pics
onewordpoet,hopefully one day i will move on from props and into money,7,pics
onewordpoet,i will agree there watercolor has one hell of a learning curve there are always plateaus to breach,21,pics

onewordpoet,thank you again i started doing watercolor during my junior year of college which was about 3 years ago i royally sucked at it back then and i was going to get a pretty bad grade my teacher pulled me aside to tell me this and it just got my engines running i decided to go hard in the muthafuckin paint after that it jsut so unforgiving i wish there was a ctrl z in real life,17,pics
onewordpoet,yo thank you ,3,pics
onewordpoet,bets on how many people make a comment similar to this one got 2 so far alsom its watercolor so extremely easy to wash off ,4,pics
onewordpoet,pretty much yes ,5,pics
onewordpoet,he painted one of my paintings before collab city,5,pics
onewordpoet,we will i am flattered i think,3,pics
onewordpoet,that would ruin all the fun if anyone can guess the spot i will be impressed,2,pics
onewordpoet,taking bets ,5,pics
onewordpoet,hahaha that ctrl z is just so addicting how can you ever finish anything ,14,pics
onewordpoet,patience sure i think it requires mostly timing ,2,pics
onewordpoet,o wow what a nice thing to say,14,pics
onewordpoet, ,2,pics
onewordpoet,i would have to say that wanting to tweak is what makes the dreaded muddy watercolor you really have to plan out exactly what youre going to do in terms of layering and washes do not fight the watercolor let it do what it wants to do if you want the watercolor to only go into a certain area then lay down water first in that area only and your color will stay in that spot do one color at a time and start with your lightest color first you cant really paint yellow over purple yannow ,36,pics
onewordpoet,thanks now i love you,4,pics
onewordpoet,does not look like wet on wet usually wet on wet means when the entire paper is wet ,0,Watercolor
onewordpoet,i posted it in art a couple months ago but took it down i usually post in pics and it was around the time when they had that image size limit i noticed they changed policy so i figured i would try and post it here ,8,pics
onewordpoet,thank you very much for anyone wondering this painting took me an entire day i did a color study with two washes as well before i started this painting i knew i wanted it to be entirely blue and red orange so i hadda lay those colors down on a separate piece of paper before going on to the final edit instagram darjarri,250,pics

onewordpoet,hey you have hit all the nails squarely on the head i wouldnt agree with the anatomy critique but i do agree with every thing else i should have omitted the bra strap some of my friends have said the same exact thing it could maybe perhaps look like it was holding up the censor but it was not my intention i only held it as an intention after the fact so yeah good eye perspective wise you are also right the bar does extend far beyond whewre the vanishing point should be i am not sure if i like it or not because it adds some sort of surrealist aspect but i do think that it should be a proper representation instead of the guess that i made i was thinking about doing another in this same vein maybe a portrait or something i really appreciate the critique and kudos for calling out all of my shortcomings in this piece i had my suspicions and you really confirmed them the next piece shall correct these cheers dawg,9,Art

onewordpoet,thank you i hope the tears were good i would hate to make you cry,1,Art
onewordpoet,i can do whatever i wanna do with my talent actually ,15,Art
onewordpoet,you must use arches cold press or rough 140lb or higher to achieve any sort of desired watercolor effect the paper is designed to allow the water to flow freely ontop and yes you wpuld wet the paper and run off the excess water when its nice and damp you can just plop your colors in and tilt the paper in whichever direction you desire ,3,Art
onewordpoet,to be honest i have no idea ill get that on the next one,1,Art
onewordpoet,applying mask is like applying a resist so thay you may freely paint without worry about ruining the white of the paper usually ill do washes in multiple stages depending on the depth im trying to achieve its all about control and at the same time letting the water do its thing naturally there is always a balance with that a wash is just a layer of color over any particular part of the piece ,9,Art
onewordpoet,funny though cause my name in real life is actually frank,5,Art
onewordpoet,ive gotten this as well haha,3,Art
onewordpoet,this is what i would tell myself the entire time i was painting this do not worry you are not a racist mad people look similar ,19,Art
onewordpoet,salt sparkle i was not quite feeling i usually use it for textural aspects like furry coats or something i just had this blue vs red imagery in my head i had wanted to paint this for a while but did not have a drive to do so until blonde was released have you ever used saran wrap to get those weird leafy effects really cool stuff ,3,Art

onewordpoet,nice man really like the ambition in this piece its hard to pull off the mix of textures you present within but i think you did a stellar job crit i think you need a better distribution of values across the board in this piece you have a bunch of real nice deep darks contrasted quite well with your brightest brights the middle grays though seem to be less established than the others also check the anatomy on that arm it looks way small love the work keep it up ,2,Art
onewordpoet,cool but we still on mom fridge,1,Art
onewordpoet,you should be doing them 16 x20 or larger you can do smaller stuff but then it becomes no different than painting with acrylic do you have examples of your larger stuff ,1,Art
onewordpoet,its easier if you paint larger in watercolor you are just able to do more with the medium this could have just as easily been painted in acrylic to truly show off the capabilities of the medium you must paint larger ,1,Art

onewordpoet,just a reaaaaally light wash of winsor blue green shade i may have mixed it with a teeny bit of yellow but the main thing is to lay water down where you want the color to be first then take the color and drop it in and let it run the paint will only go where it wet so you can make some magnificent crisp edges with the way the water bunches up ,2,Art
onewordpoet,yessir www frankkoran com,2,Art

onewordpoet,yessir prints on watercolor paper anyways the provincial is large so shipping would be absurd ,1,Art
onewordpoet, process http imgur com a l2afz ,2,Art
onewordpoet,thank you very much i will see if i can get some process pics up ,1,Art
onewordpoet,start with high quality paper that the most important part you are gonna want arches 140lb paper there are a couple of presses available that all correspond to the tooth or texture that the paper has rough hot press and cold press i personally use cold press but its up to you for watercolors paint i use winsor and newton use professional grade shit student grade just has less pigment thus producing more nightmares for brushes just use a good variation of sizes a 1 2 flat wash brush is nice for washes and large areas but you will also want to have round brushes size 10 20 and 50 get a spray bottle use it to wet the whole paper at once then you can paint wet on wet which is just saucy af always use arches 140lb at least this particular painting was on 255lb paper but that just because of the size ,4,Art

onewordpoet,never have actually i find the references to be very selfie like the compositions there do not produce good paintings in my opinion however i have been known to privately message people on reddit asking if they would model for me that way i can ask for a specific pose and lighting and have multiple references it necessary for a successful painting plus i like talking to people ,1,Art
onewordpoet,yessir,7,Art
onewordpoet,i mean it as the acronym it a piece on institutionalized oppression and how it just evolves into new slang it is not ever truly eradicated th e other words on the white sign read serv mecha and women tryna incorporate meaningful backgrounds into my work thank you so much for the words btw ,7,Art
onewordpoet,do it ,4,Art
onewordpoet,winsor and newton watercolors kept it to a pretty primary color palette it goes beyond the colors though having the correct type of paper is hella necessary i use arches 300lb cold press stretched and stapled to prevent buckling i would not use anything other than arches for watercolor ,3,Art

onewordpoet,thank you funny you say that about the color my original idea was to assign each concept within the novel a specific color and then create the work based off of that i was gearing ym stuff towards psychology of color as represented in bnw that fell through but the color remained instead i chose to reconcile the concepts through present day techhy symbols ,3,Art

onewordpoet,not to mention in japanese history textbooks much of the emphasis of the end of the war was on the taking of manchuria the bombs do not get much mention ,0,WTF
onewordpoet,intercepted intelligence had said the japanese were seeking surrender terms well before the bomb was dropped on july 30 ambassador sat wrote that stalin was probably talking to roosevelt and churchill about his dealings with japan and he wrote there is no alternative but immediate unconditional surrender if we are to prevent russia participation in the war https en wikipedia org wiki surrender of japan japanese reaction ninj basically it was some internal affair shit were the bombs necessary naw other than for us foreign policy measures they could have just reached out and offered some surrender terms instead of droppin mankinds most horrific weapon ,2,WTF
onewordpoet,that what us propaganda tells us so many books celebrating the bomb and whatnot i am preeetty sure it was russia invasion of manchuria that really crippled japan to the japanese the two bombs were just two more cities destroyed the ramifications of the bombs were not totally known until many years later but the taking of the mainland above china shiiiiiieeeet edit why the downvotes ,-20,WTF
onewordpoet,sure its art but is it good you have gotta ask yourself some questions when looking at art what is the artist trying to achieve did he she succeed was it worth it ,1,Art
onewordpoet,or just use a mixed blue orange compliment for your darker tones and add white for highlights it looks like you just added black to a blue or just different blues out of the tube if you create complex color by mixing compliments you image will have more depth the color is richer chromatic grays son black ai not a color so when you put it on your painting or mix it with a color it steals the vibrancy from your other colors ,1,Art
onewordpoet,damn that worse ,2,hiphopheads
onewordpoet,this shit rocks dude i love acrylic spray paint combos the mark making is simply delicious concept on point i would take the text out though because i get it without the text just serves as a hammer to beat your audience with it draws your eye away from everything thats fucking awesome just make that the title people will get it keep it up i also dig the fuck out of color i am pretty high key most of the time but this is yeahhhhhhhh,4,Art
onewordpoet,agreed i have a bit of hesitation posting to reddit for this reason unless you are like an established sci fi or fantasy illustrator you get minimal attention ,3,Art

onewordpoet,this is the exact quote on my whiteboard in the room we were using to create this it served as the inspiration for the piece spot fucking on i am glad it elicited that response outta you ,3,Art
onewordpoet,i am the gesso layered background and the top hand the background is achieved by layered on lots of magazine cutouts of color in this case red and green and covering it with white gesso afterwards we slung a mixed red green compliment onto it i appreciate the comment finding a comfortable medium between graphical geometric abstractions and representational form is quite the challenge i am glad you enjoy looking at it ,3,Art
onewordpoet,great critique i was thinking in the same veins upon finishing the block was one of the parts of the painting that i was not 100 sold on had to take the leap haha this is the second piece we have done together so the meshing of styles is still undergoing its polymerization thirds the charm ,2,Art
onewordpoet,the blocks of color in the background are subdued green and magenta never use black in a painting though the picture does make the magenta appear quite black yikes they are used to enhance color and to give a graphical feel to the piece the hands are floating in space so it already does not make much sense from a formal perspective the strings carry the weight of the visual experience while the blocks help guide the eye around the piece the strings tie up the meaning anything else we felt would be too much so the design elements came my partners specific style is very graphical and i felt the blocks helped the piece become more integrated with our aesthetic tastes examples of his work https www behance net arieltobing what would you have done ,5,Art
onewordpoet,its actually much much easier to draw when you make a grid and transfer the drawing that way it simplifies what you are looking at into simple shades and shapes it useful for copying ,12,Art
onewordpoet,well if you learned the rules before you broke them your pieces would be better but if you do not want to be better nevermind ,-4,Art
onewordpoet,yo think of some new imagery if you want my honest opinion i think this gets to the top page because it almost https www google com search q butterfly elephant es sm 119 source lnms tbm isch sa x ved 0cacq auoawovchmi2pkti9baxgivhnm ch3pswbj biw 1705 bih 985 good elephants with the whole butterfly ear thing is so overdone at least give it some different animal wings on your next go the zentangle patterns are well executed though there are so many differing forms that they get muddled choose 1 3 types of forms oval stuff blocky stuff linear stuff it will look more unified that way also think of a space to put your subject instead of the white background you have now it a void we want atmosphere ,2,Art
onewordpoet,kandinsky was definitely an inspiration ,1,Art
onewordpoet,the perspective is hella awkward and the colors are a bit much you should be desaturating some of them especially those greens and reds but the application of paint is luscious and tactile keep that shit up be careful of muddying colors because drying time how are you setting up compositions why is it your favorite ,1,Art

onewordpoet,all lines of art has its history rothko comes from different influences than a fantasy artist most people do not like the art because they do not understand it or where it comes from i am a painter so i am obligated to know colors have an emotional effect on all humans abstract expressionism is the use of paint to evoke that emotion without distraction of formal representation rothko was painting depression i think if you know that his work is a little more understandable ,5,Art

onewordpoet,arches 140lb or higher i would never work on canvas for watercolor also you need to add variety to your painting it looks like you used cerulean and winsor blue exclusively there is no temperature balance here instead of using more blue pigment add orange it will create a more complex color while at the same time deepening its value blue is a great color but its not adding anything by being all blue warm up areas with orange it wont look orange since its watercolor ,3,Art

onewordpoet,understandable but i like the build basquiat used to play this in studio while he worked its about 17 minutes long and has a continuous build and is very easy to zone and work to i am a painter so that why it resonates with me since it was the end of the piece it probably does not carry over as well for other people feel that ,2,trees

onewordpoet,i do not think the concern can be considered equal i am not going into the logistics of weed versus alcohol because it should be common knowledge by now marijuana is a drug but that does not mean it magically becomes as bad as every other drug its like comparing caffeine to cocaine drinking coffee everyday vs snorting a line everyday is not the same just as lighting up 10 joints a day is not the same as taking 10 shots a day ,1,trees
onewordpoet,i mean i rarely post here but shit who are you people to judge who is smoking too much weed perhaps you guys just could not smoke that much weed its like if you are going to be a member of an online forum about weed why criticize people smoking weed who gives a shit if a dude smokes 24 7 quit white knighting yourselves because you do not smoke that much ,41,trees

onewordpoet,astute knowledge of spatial relations value which is light and color composition etc but as for modern art that word gets thrown around alot modern art is not the scratch your head art it is the period between i think 1880 to about the 1970s this included impressionism expressionism cubism futurism etc etc etc etc contemporary art is the art of the now and it is concerned with the process in which is was created so a painting like this made by a four year old is like shit god damn but i do not believe it was made by a 4 year old ,2,pics
onewordpoet,its fun as hell to land that first trick if you are gonna get a board you have gotta know learn at least one trick you do not have to learn to kickflip or anything but on longboards you can learn dancing carves and all sorts of cool simple stuff otherwise you are just a herb man ,1,trees
onewordpoet,not true you can do mdma or lsd in the comfort of your own home to simply gain a new perspective i actually think doing mdma at a festival is the exact opposite environment to properly do it in mdma is an empathogen with just some relaxation and good vibes you can gain hella insight into your personal life and how you operate on a daily basis with lsd this is even more true for me if i am at a party i certainly will gain insights about the world around me and how people act around one another but the amount gained from relaxing and closing your eyes for an hour is so much more profound the drugs are not the experience so much as you are i feel that if you are doing it to get high then you are bordering on an issue the particular drugs are good at letting you know when you have had your fill though marijuana not so much i smoke that shit er day sometimes i catch myself smoking to smoke and its not too much an issue but hey no one is perfect ,1,AskReddit

onewordpoet,what 9000 ,2,WTF
onewordpoet,sup yo nice painting i like where her head is at conceptually i think combining the different materials was a good choice someone here said that the composition is unappealing and it is the reason being is that she has essentially given you a framed box of ice when you look at it like that it becomes easy to see why the composition is weighted like that here are some pointers from one painter to another if you are using black do not use a combination of burnt raw umber and an ultramarine blue it will keep colors on the canvas and prevent that black from slaughtering it keep away from placing objects in the center of the canvas always do thumbnails i know it might seem stupid but just placing shapes in a box to try things out will really help the final painting block in value try not to use lines and instead use values to create the lines they will form on their own value value value valuevaluevaluevaleuvaleuvaleuvaeuev ewtd wtc etc etc do not listen to me if you do not want to ,16,breakingbad

onewordpoet,yup pm me for deets ,3,Art
onewordpoet,right i was going for a body image type of deal where people look in the mirror and proverbially cribble out what they do not like like the artsy fartsy reason for this painting is if you look past that stuff you could be beautiful and stuff i also wanted to give it a sexual vibe for funnies but more subtle ps its the desirable form that i am interested in not the image of an attractive woman when it comes to art making as an art student when i am figure drawing it is always a treat to get physically fit models you can see muscles and bones which is a huge help in practicing anatomy in figure drawing ,3,Art

onewordpoet,oh and thank you for the compliment on my choices in this piece i have been experimenting with this sort of color arrangements and fractalization if you call it that for a while now and this is the most extravagant of them so far color was used by adding compliments next to each other to increase intensity as well as overlayed to de saturate ,4,Art
