1959 in london england he is a classically trained musician and renowned contemporary music producer recoil was born in 1986 as a two track experimental ep simply entitled 1 2 this collection of primitive demos caught the attention of mute records label boss daniel miller and was inconspicuously released as a mini album on 12 vinyl an album hydrology soon followed in 1988 and both were eventually re issued by mute on cd as hydrology plus 1 2 these early recoil recordings revealed alan s position as a pioneer in the newly emerging world of sampling technology and demonstrated how he could turn the depeche sound around to create something entirely new wilder described the project at the time as an antidote to depeche mode a way to alleviate the frustrations of always working within a pop format almost immediately wilder found himself back in the studio to record what would become the most successful depeche mode album to date violator it wasn t until the band finally allowed themselves an extended break after the enormously successful world violation tour that alan could return to recoil not however before agreeing to produce ebbhead an album for label mates nitzer ebb it was during this time that he cemented a working relationship with lead singer douglas mccarthy who would return the favour by singing on recoil s next album bloodline released in 1992 wilder recruited guest vocalists for the first time with further contributions from curve toni halliday and moby helping to produce an album that demonstrated his ability to concoct slow burning soundscapes drenched in drowsy paranoia bloodline also marked the first recoil single a cover of alex harvey s song faith healer as well as the innovative electro blues for bukka white featuring the posthumously sampled voice of blues man bukka white set into a post modern context an influential idea later popularised by others between 1992 93 wilder resumed his depeche duties as the band recorded the album songs of faith and devotion released to universal acclaim it topped the charts in the uk usa germany and a host of other countries enjoying hits with i feel you walking in my shoes in your room and condemnation the mode embarked on their most adventurous tour to date enduring a gruelling 15 months on the road although the group had reached the pinnacle of success aspects of the lifestyle had taken their toll on everyone and things eventually came to a head in june 1995 having spent 14 years as an integral part of one of the most popular and influential bands the uk has ever produced alan wilder made the difficult but inevitable decision to leave depeche mode free from his group commitments wilder could now focus solely on recoil in september 1996 he began work in his own studio the thin line gradually piecing together the unnerving scores that would eventually reveal recoil next album unsound methods the final results were more impressive than ever what emerged appeared to take up where songs of faith and devotion had left off guest vocalists featured maggie estep siobhan lynch the reappearance of douglas mccarthy and hildia cambell the styles of each could not be more removed from one another helping to create a startlingly original and diverse collection the more organic style of unsound methods incorporated every imaginable musical genre from trip hop to gospel whilst dealing with the subject of obsession in all its manifestations taking the listener to the edge of unease through dark dub infected landscapes reverberating with shivering piano seductive strings and a deep electronic pulse in the spring of 2000 recoil gave us liquid which this time utilised the unique qualities of internationally acclaimed fellow mute artist diamanda gal s 1940 gospel crooners the golden gate jubilee quartet along with new york spoken word performers nicole blackman and samantha coerbell the worldwide music press received the liquid album with a host of glowing reviews and wilder was awarded the charles cros grand prix 2000 strangely enthralling and genuinely unhinging liquid masquerades as the aural equivalent of a disturbing movie wilder intoxicating soundscapes kick up clouds of the same dark dust that falls on david lynch or nine inch nails but where others may hammer out their message with histrionic force his touch is lighter and characteristically more subtle now following a 5 year break from recording alan wilder returns with recoil 5th studio album entitled subhuman released in july 2007 collaborating this time is blues man joe richardson with his band joe richardson express whose evocative vocal style is complimented by accomplished guitar and harmonica performances born in southern louisiana richardson spent years immersed in the murkier side of new orleans life and offers a unique commentary on conflict religion incarceration and personal struggle english singer carla trevaskis a songwriter in her own right brings an expressive range and control to subhuman and has worked with artists as diverse as fred de faye eurythmics cliff hewitt apollo 440 and dave mcdonald portishead says wilder we seem to have learnt nothing from past experiences and our so called civilised world is still awash with personal and global atrocities from suicide bombings in the middle east to ethnic cleansing in the balkans from the homophobic rhetoric of the christian fundamentalist preacher to the activities of western governments engaged in their war on terror subhuman asks us to reach within ourselves and extract the

work on a new form of bratmobile beat happening calvin johnson had previously introduced molly to nascent guitarist erin smith from bethesda maryland during the christmas holiday in december 1990 at a nation of ulysses show in washington dc smith was co author with her brother of the much revered tv pop culture fanzine teenage gang debs when allison and molly asked her to jam with them it clicked and in july 1991 the trio played their first show as a 3 piece with molly neuman on drums erin smith on guitar and allison wolfe on vocals while in d c the band was briefly joined by christina billotte of autoclave and slant 6 and jen smith of the quails this line up released a very limited issue cassette called bratmobile d c but jen and christina stayed behind when the group returned to olympia they were just in time to play at the historic international pop underground convention in olympia washington becoming the only band to appear twice from their first shows bratmobile was considered an exciting and important addition to the fertile early 90s northwest scene from 1991 to 1994 bratmobile released a classic album pottymouth and an ep the real janelle on kill rock stars as well as the peel session recording before the intense media scrutiny and inner pressures of the riot grrl movement hastened the band breakup on stage no less in 1994 for five years the brats honed their skills in other bands and developed their lives with other pursuits neuman moved to the san francisco bay area and began working at east bay punk record label lookout records for which she now acts as general manager and co owns she also played in the peechees and the frumpies and continued to perfect her stylish powerful drumming allison wolfe moved to washington dc and she and maryland based erin smith started a new band together called cold cold hearts allison feminism and activism found many significant outlets and erin guitar playing grew more accomplished and technical while always staying true to her minimalist pop leanings then in 1999 the three women decided to reunite for a low key show in oakland stork club the chemistry was right and the band was relaunched to go on tour with sleater kinney in 2000 bratmobile released their second full length studio album ladies women and girls to an audience who had never forgotten them and never found a replacement for their poppy sassy smart bratty sexy punk the album delighted critics and earned bratmobile new fans as they toured with sleater kinney the donnas the locust and more ladies women and girls was released on

biggest artists in the world of r b and gospel music including chaka khan and kirk franklin he also a grammy winning musician not once but four times over one thing he has not done though release his own album but that something the pianist and producer is about to change and he making sure his friends in dallas are a part of it martin is just getting back from a european tour with franklin and he will be here just long enough to celebrate the release of seven summers a bit of a departure from his music background in the direction of jazz and hip hop the album comes out today and he will play a release show at the prophet bar tomorrow then he heading back on the road going right back to europe but this time with snarky puppy he won three grammys for best gospel album with franklin last year he won his fourth grammy with snarky puppy for best r b song and attended the ceremony for the first time martin always received invitations but never expected to win he remembers getting news of his first win via text message while in church he was pleasantly surprised but preferred to be at church that day just the same martin started his album seven years ago which is where the title comes from he also made a point to release it in the appropriate season not surprisingly he been too busy working on other peoples projects and kept shelving it snarky puppy for instance stay busy enough to play a couple hundred shows a year it a wicked schedule martin admits so he had to make the time for himself and spurred on by the positive response to some of his originals at the black academy of arts and letters he started refocusing on finishing the album last year once he realized how much time had lapsed it s a very well thought out record martin says with a laugh listening to it now the mental progression is what strikes him the songs represent things that had a major impact on his life a whole section of the album is about love have your chance at love captures the time when one relationship had ended and he had just met the woman who is now his wife martin was scared of being hurt again but knew he had met someone worth taking a chance on once he had taken that chance he wrote love don t let me down other songs have been directly influenced by his world travels martin arrived in johannesburg south africa the day nelson mandela died he had just checked into his hotel room every station had this breaking news thing martin remembers but it took forever to say what the breaking news was having no idea what to expect once the news finally came out he was worried but what took place was a massive celebration you couldn t even walk across the street because the streets were just full of people who were celebrating his life says martin this had a profound effect on him that s the life i want to live i don t want people to mourn me when i die i want them to celebrate the fact that i lived on this earth the marching shouting and dancing from that day inspired the melody for the song madiba which is mandela s nickname seven summers is a departure from gospel music which is what martin mainly produces the album is a fusion of jazz classical r b and hip hop martin was once part of erykah badu s touring band and also helped write and produce tracks for her mama s gun album we d sit in new york for days and write songs he remembers badu also collaborated with j dilla during this time and it had an enormous influence on him i m a j dilla fan he says dilla s my guy i wanted to pay homage to that era the album is a love letter to the hip hop that has inspired him people like d angelo q tip and the roots but martin puts a jazz spin on it and works mostly with musicians from north texas any time he gets a platform he tries to share it with his peers from dallas if you give talented people a chance there s no stopping them says martin but he sees talented people in dallas who never had a chance and are now frustrated ultimately he hopes to give back by starting a fine arts academy or after school program i learned how to play the piano in oak cliff martin explains he learned classical jazz theory and musical history but he realizes how lucky he was there aren t that many resources for that he says for all his world travels and all his awards martin is not the type of person to lose touch with his roots he even keeps all of his awards at his parents house i grew up with these people he says of dallas we went to high school together we all went to williams chicken together he feels that the camaraderie is something you can hear on the

volume that they listened to music chilean family friends knew an agent who organized concerts and live performances and taught the young ricardo to play the drums he soon got his first conga drum and

StudabakerHoch, nomeansno artist pic https lastfm img2 akamaized net i u 252 1f7de670af924db3b58846b9622fb9ce png nomeansno are a band originally from victoria british columbia canada and now located in vancouver british columbia the band have never had or have ever seemed to pursue strong mainstream success but they do have a devoted underground following in north america and europe they tour fairly often on both continents and maintain a dedicated fan base the band was formed in 1979 by brothers rob wright bass guitar and vocals and john wright drum set keyboards and vocals their name derives from an anti date rape slogan for their first four years the duo music would seem to be influenced as much by jazz and progressive rock as punk rock the musical press described their earliest recordings as devo on a jazz trip mot rhead after art school or wire on psychotic steroids nomeansno have been credited with being an influence on and perhaps even the genesis of math rock the brothers wright began recording as a two piece in their parents basement in 1979 these recordings heard on their first two self released 7 s consisted of full rock band arrangements and had a new wave warped pop sound different from subsequent recordings when in the early 1980s the duo began gigging simply with bass drums and vocals the present form of their distinct sound slowly took shape the songs they played in this period are documented on the mama lp re released in 2004 on their own wrong records in 1984 they added andy kerr who played with john wright in infamous scientists on guitar and vocals kerr preferred pseudonymity and used such pseudonyms as buttercup or none of your fucking business he brought a distinct hardcore punk edge to the group and stayed until 1991 he is often erroneously credited for penning the lyrics of nomeansno songs on which he sang perhaps due to deliberately vague liner notes and frequent vocal moonlighting kerr sings lead or co lead vocals on nearly half the songs on wrong for example kerr vocals were a necessity for a period of time in the 1980s when rob wright was recovering from nodules on his vocal cords while rob wright is the band lyricist and main songwriter all members have contributed songs to nomeansno records and nearly all their material is credited to the entire band wrong is widely considered the band best and most representative record the playing is incredibly skilled with the wright brothers effortlessly shifting tempos and time signatures and kerr razor sharp lyrics clicking right into place after kerr departure the wright brothers recorded why do they call me mr happy as a duo they subsequently recruited guitarist tom holliston from showbusiness giants and the hanson brothers and have continued touring and releasing records including worldhood of the world as such dance of the headless bourgeoisie one and most recently all roads lead to ausfahrt which was released on august 22 2006 the album was released by antacidaudio in the united states and southern records in europe the album one released in 2000 featured two stunning covers that only make sense coming from nomeansno a slow stoner rock styled version of the ramones beat on the brat and rather authentic fifteen minute version of miles davis bitches brew complete with electric piano and congas featuring lyrics by rob nomeansno initially released records with seminal punk rock record label alternative tentacles this relationship ended in 2002 the band has since been reissuing old albums through southern records under their own wrong records imprint even their earliest recordings demonstrate impressive instrumental technique some of the most complex instrumentation you are ever likely to find in punk rock jazz has been an influence on the group rob basslines have a loping melodic quality often reminiscent of charles mingus and john drumming sometimes sounds a bit like elvin jones or art blakey nomeansno output features a seemingly endless flow of wright wrong right puns and significant measures of black humour with pointedly warped lyrics such as on dad from sex mad the song was a minor college radio hit and has been called a bit chilling even though it spit out at slam pit pace the first person narrator details a rampaging father physical and sexual abuse ending with what is been called a killer end touch the baldly delivered line i am seriously considering leaving home one critic while noting the group savage intelligence suggests that nomeansno might well be the secret influence on a fair amount of both early 90s math rock and emo what with the barely controlled fervour of the singing and the sudden jerks back and forth in the rhythm section equally striking about the band back catalogue is their ability to jump from style to style and still maintain their musical identity they leap from dirge to thrash complication to simplicity discordant to melodic and still sound like themselves john drumming style has been mentioned as an influence to others including dave grohl nomeansno alter ego is thehanson brothers a quartet with john singing and different drummer nearly a ramones tribute band the hanson brothers play fun punk rock as a mock group of backward canadian ice hockey fans the lyrics centre on ice hockey beer and girls the name comes from characters in the 1977 george roy hill film slap shot starring paul newman rob wright alter ego is mr wrong who dresses as an authoritarian priest and often poses with a shotgun mr wrong is simply wright on bass and vocals with no other instrumentation it is rumoured that wright also plays upright bass in a traditional jazz band who play standards but he keeps this side of his life fuzzy in interviews tom holliston released several albums with his band showbusiness giants as well as three solo albums andy kerr and john wright played in the early 1980s in the infamous scientists kerr after leaving nomeansno released a solo cd and collaborated with victoria musician scott henderson in hissanol kerr most recently has begun a duo called two pin din in the netherlands read more on last fm last fm

lifelong music maker is more than apparent on the becca stevens band s sunnyside debut weightless although she s already won significant acclaim for her membership in travis sullivan s bjorkestra and her prestigious collaborations with such esteemed musicians as taylor eigsti and brad mehldau the sparkling 12 song set reveals the accomplished young songstress to be a startlingly original refreshingly distinctive talent in her own right on such original compositions as weightless i ll notice traveler s blessing and the riddle stevens intimate vocals communicate both immense warmth and effortless urgency while her exquisitely understated arrangements and seamlessly crafted tunes embrace inventive acoustic textures and idiosyncratic rhythmic and melodic elements the resulting music offers a beguiling blend of head and heart that resists easy categorization drawing upon elements of pop jazz or folk without limiting itself to the rules of any particular genre stevens work has already received copious praise from the likes of the new york times who described her as a best kept secret and called her debut indie release tea bye sea impressively absorbing the boston phoenix noted becca s big voice and no bull emotional delivery her hometown paper the winston salem journal stated stevens singing is remarkable soulful pitch perfect and subtle in its controlled acrobatics the arrangements are exquisitely produced and her acoustic songs boast musical textures and colors that embrace the adventurism of jazz in addition to its eight original stevens compositions weightless also features a quartet of distinctive reworkings of songs by other artists those cover tunes the smiths there is a light that never goes out seal s kiss from a rose animal collective s my girls and iron and wine s each coming night demonstrate becca s stylistic versatility as well as her impressive ability to find an emotional connection with material from wildly divergent sources stevens recorded weightless at manhattan s sear sound with veteran producer matt pierson whose extensive resume includes influential work with joshua redman jane monheit and kirk whalum and her close knit band which includes liam robinson on accordion and keyboards chris tordini on bass and jordan perlson on drums and percussion her bandmates instrumental skills complement becca s own expressive work on guitar ukulele and charango while their earthy harmonies provide a compelling counterpoint to her own personally charged vocals several of the album s tracks feature guitarist larry campbell who s known for his work with the likes of bob dylan rosanne cash and levon helm and others singer songwriter gretchen parlato guests on the haunting waltz no more it s no exaggeration to say that becca stevens has been making music for her entire life the daughter of musicians she began singing in her family s band the tune mammals when she was two years old she spent much of her childhood on stage singing acting and dancing including a year long tour in the lead role of the secret garden when she was ten she became fluent in jazz and classical guitar and in the folk music traditions of her native north carolina influences that still echo in her songwriting after graduating from the high school program at the north carolina school of the arts with a major in classical guitar stevens attended the new school for jazz and contemporary music in new york where she received a bfa with high honors in vocal jazz and composition it was at the new school that she met the musicians who would subsequently become the becca stevens band my parents are both working musicians and performers and they ve always been very supportive of my choices so i ve never doubted this as my career path becca notes adding the first sounds i heard in the delivery room were my dad playing an irish slip jig on the fiddle the tune was the kid on the mountain i still cry when i hear it i grew up with the sounds of music and composing and singing and rehearsing around me all the time so it was always a very natural thing for me the sense of musical community that was instilled in stevens early in life would help to prepare her to collaborate with a wide assortment of musicians in a diverse array of settings since 2004 becca has served as lead singer of travis sullivan s bjorkestra fronting a genre bending 18 piece jazz orchestra interpreting the songs of bj rk she has also toured and recorded with and written lyrics for jazz pianist taylor eigsti singing on five songs on his 2010 album daylight

recorded with such notable players as clarence penn george garzone julian lage kendrick scott jeremy pelt logan richardson and andy milne 2010 saw the debut of stevens first choral composition soli deo gloria commissioned and performed by the melodia women s choir in new york becca also moonlights as one third of girls gone mild a trio with fellow singer songwriters rebecca martin and gretchen parlato in addition to those projects stevens has also worked extensively as a teacher teaching guitar and songwriting to students ranging from juvenile delinquents to senior citizens she also recently rekindled her childhood affinity for acting playing the lead role in shakespeare s as you like it and supporting parts in romeo and juliet and macbeth with the adirondack shakespeare company as diverse as her musical experiences have been becca stevens creative objectives are impressively focused every day i learn from the music of composers who have come before me and on whose shoulders i stand and from my experiences from the profound to the trivial my focus as an artist is to cast those experiences in a musical and poetic language that will resonate with the listener and affect a

most significant he is best known for his symphonic poem vltava die moldau the second in a cycle of six which he entitled m vlast my homeland and for his opera prodan nev sta the bartered bride smetana was the son of a brewer in litomy l in bohemia he studied piano and violin from an early age and played in an amateur string quartet with other members of his family he attended a high school in pilsen from 1840 1843 he studied music in prague despite initial resistance from his father he then secured a post as music master to a noble family and in 1848 received funds from franz liszt to establish his own music school september 1855 marked the death of his second child his beloved four year old daughter bed i ka when his third child died nine months later he committed himself to composition producing the piano trio in g minor this piece is full of sadness and despair making use of phrases that are cut short possibly in resemblance to his daughter own life smetana moved in 1856 to gothenburg sweden where he taught conducted and gave chamber music recitals in 1863 back in prague he opened a new school of music dedicated to promoting specifically czech music by 1874 he had become almost totally deaf but he continued to compose m vlast was written after his deafness had developed he also suffered from tinnitus which caused him to hear a continuous maddening high note which he described as the shrill whistle of a first inversion chord of a flat in the highest register of the piccolo from 1875 he lived mostly in the small village of jabkenice his string quartet in e minor z m ho ivota from my life composed in 1876 the first of two pieces that he wrote for the medium is an autobiographical work each movement deals with a different aspect of its creator life the first movement is expressive demonstrative of smetana youthful love of art and his search for something undefinable the second movement carefree and somewhat raucous takes the listener back to the days of smetana youth the third movement is reminiscent of the happiness smetana felt when in love with the girl who later became his wife the final movement begins with smetana joy over the recognition which was given to the national music of bohemia however as the movement progresses the music is punctuated by a piercing high e in the first violin which smetana explained represents the devastating effects of his tinnitus he may also be hinting at this personal misfortune with the piccolo scoring in m vlast smetana was the first composer to write music that was specifically czech in character many of his operas are based on czech themes and myths the best known being the comedy the bartered bride 1866 he used many czech dance rhythms and his melodies sometimes resemble folk songs though he was proud of not directly quoting folktunes for the most part smetana maintained that his country music should be a patriotic expression of the czech life and collective soul in this assumption he clashed with a former friend of his frantisek pivoda who believed that art knows no boundaries pivoda wanted to see fair interchange of artistic ideas between countries in 1882 smetana suffered further effects of his progressive neurological illness after he suffered a stroke like seizure doctors forbade him to compose in the fear that the increased mental activity of composition would result in further seizures however smetana rebelled against these orders and composed his final incomplete opera viola in 1884 he was taken to the prague lunatic asylum where he died soon afterwards he is interred in the vy ehrad cemetery in prague for many years it was believed that smetana suffered from syphilis nevertheless later studies carried out by dr ji ramba who studied smetana skull revealed that he suffered from osteomyelitis smetana was a great influence on anton n dvo k who similarly used czech themes in his works the output of smetana influenced many czech composers who came after him and continues to inspire musicians today operas branibo i v ech ch brandenburgers in bohemia interim theatre prague 1866 prodan nev sta the bartered bride interim theatre

musician and a former member of the influential canterbury scene band soft machine as a teenager he lived with his parents in a fourteen room georgian guest house wellington house in lydden near canterbury here he was taught the drums by visiting american jazz drummer george niedorf in 1962 wyatt and niedorf moved to majorca where they stayed with the poet robert graves the following year wyatt returned to england and joined the daevid allen trio with daevid allen and hugh hopper allen subsequently left for france and wyatt and hopper formed the wilde flowers with richard sinclair kevin ayers and brian hopper wyatt was initially the drummer in the wilde flowers but following the departure of ayers he became lead singer in 1966 the wilde flowers disintegrated and wyatt and mike ratledge formed the soft machine with ayers and allen here wyatt both drummed and sang an unusual combination for a stage rock band in 1970 after chaotic touring three albums and increasing internal conflicts in soft machine wyatt released his first solo album the end of an ear which combined his vocal and multi instrumental talents with tape effects a year later wyatt left soft machine and formed his own band matching mole a pun on machine molle the french for soft machine a largely instrumental outfit after two albums and a split matching mole were about to embark on a third record when on 1 june 1973 during a drunken party wyatt fell from a third floor window he was subsequently paralysed from the waist down paraplegia and confined to a wheelchair the injury led wyatt to abandon the matching mole project and his drumming he promptly embarked on a solo career and with a collective of session musicians including mike oldfield the poet ivor cutler and henry cow guitarist fred frith he released his acclaimed solo album rock bottom later that same year he put out a single a cover version of i am a believer which hit number 29 in the uk chart there were strong arguments with the producer of top of the pops surrounding his performance of i am a believer on the grounds that his wheelchair bound appearance was not suitable for family viewing the producer wanting wyatt to appear on a normal chair wyatt won the day and lost his rag but not the wheel chair but gave a performance that could be described as disgruntled wyatt next album ruth is stranger than richard was more jazz led with free jazz influences and nods to african music these solo recordings were all produced by nick mason of pink floyd throughout the rest of the 1970s wyatt guested with various acts working with the likes of henry cow documented on their henry cow concerts album hatfield and the north carla bley and michael mantler his solo work during the early 1980s was increasingly politicised and wyatt became an outspoken member and supporter of the british communist party in 1983 his interpretation of elvis costello anti falklands war song shipbuilding the last in a series of political cover versions collected as nothing can stop us reached number 35 in the uk singles chart in the late 1980s after collaborations with other ex canterbury acts such as news from babel he and his wife alfreda benge spent a sabbatical in spain before returning in 1991 with a comeback album dondestan considered by many to be his best work since rock bottom his 1997 album shleep was also highly acclaimed an uncredited wyatt contributed the haunting masters of the field as well as the highest gander la for t rouge and hors champ to the soundtrack of the acclaimed 2001 film winged migration he can be seen in the dvd special features section and is praised by the film composer bruno coulais as being a big influence in his younger days in 2001 wyatt was curator of the meltdown festival and in

and the now and away with the fairies featured musicians include previous collaborators brian eno paul weller and phil manzanera wyatt said he was keen to capture the sound of a group of musicians playing in the room together but more importantly to have friends playing together music is not just an abstract pleasure it is a company when you play a record why i like duke ellington and charles mingus the big bands is because every character in the band is identifiable as that person there this group of humans in a room he lives in louth lincolnshire and he has equipment in his bedroom where he records himself and his albums we brought a g4 and pro tools and recorded it in like one afternoon he such an extraordinary singer before he left he insisted to give us a scale of his voice where he sings all the tones and he has the most amazing range like 5 or 6 octaves what is really interesting about his range is that each octave is of a totally different character we actually ended up
