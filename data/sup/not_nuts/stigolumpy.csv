stigolumpy,there an interesting phenomenon which occurs when people have been starved for long periods of time called refeeding syndrome imagine you have been deprived of nutrients for long periods of time your body has adjusted and gone into a starvation state producing large amounts of ketones it low on vital vitamins and electrolytes suddenly they are released from that state and given large quantities of food the body needs to manufacture hormones like insulin and the metabolism kicks into life to digest and absorb the food only the body has very little nutrients for this initial burst suddenly the electrolyte and nutrient concentration plummets due to demand this leads to a crisis state low potassium magnesium and phosphate which leads to arrhythmias and death ultimately the solution is not to give high sugar content food to starving people but give gradually increasing amounts of protein hope this is of interest to people ,44,askscience

stigolumpy,there is so much misinformation in this thread simply put the heart continues to beat on its own because it has a couple of internal pace makers which beat independently of the brain however the vagus nerve which originates from the brainstem can modulate the hearts rhythm and slow it down this is the parasympathetic nervous system the sympathetic nervous system can cause the heart to speed up and these nerves do come from the spine so in severing the spinal cord immediately the heart will not stop immediately and can self regulate this is not to say that other problems such as bleeding loss of blood pressure control direct injury to the brainstem etc wo not eventually kill the person most people are spot on about breathing the diaphragm is controlled by nerves from spinal levels c3 c4 and c5 and damage to these levels or above these levels will prevent the diaphragm from working completely i hope this helps some people ,2,explainlikeimfive
