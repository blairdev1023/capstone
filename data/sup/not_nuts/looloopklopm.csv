looloopklopm,as the other commenter said i think clearance would be your main issue i only have the non rgb version so from what i understand the leds are below the switch in that case it might be possible to bend the led over so that you can get a little more clearance rather than stacking the fiber optic diverter on top you can lay it beside instead that might be something worth looking into you could also just remove the led and mount it o the side of the case or wherever you would like it and just wire it up to the socket hope that helps,2,MechanicalKeyboards
looloopklopm,any lube you would recommend i see a ton of recommendations on the wiki so i am curious what you would use,1,MechanicalKeyboards

looloopklopm,that true i had not thought about the fidget aspect i had almost picked browns when i decided to go to memory express and sample their cherry switches immediately loved blues ,1,MechanicalKeyboards
looloopklopm,huh til i am in that exact situation and my landlord has been using the tenant act i will have to let him know,3,Edmonton
looloopklopm,unless you live in a small town you do not need to buy one go into a store and test out some switches many places have their own testers or will be happy to unbox keebs to let you try the switches save yourself 20 bucks on something you will never use after the first 5 minutes you get it ,1,MechanicalKeyboards
looloopklopm,that seems like a good way to go about things hopefully all is resolved without issue ,1,Edmonton

looloopklopm,i just tried to buy a poker 2 from them on ebay said they had 7 left in stock with mx blues got an email 3 days later wanting me to switch to different switches asked for my money back they seem honest enough and had good feedback so i would trust their site would be safe ,1,MechanicalKeyboards
looloopklopm,i would recommend that as a first step ,4,Edmonton

looloopklopm,if you are not under a contract i believe you can kick them out with 1 month notice have to check whatever regulations apply though the reason that they are smoking medical marijuana is not a valid reason to evict someone so it would fall under an eviction without cause law my understanding was that lta governed everything ,4,Edmonton
looloopklopm,does he smoke inside if so tell him not to make sure he keeps everything in smell proof containers i do not have too much experience with this but i am pretty sure you cannot evict based on him smoking legal medical marijuana alone under the landlord and tenant act i take it he she is under a contract with you in that case i believe you will just have to wait it out try asking for their cooperation in eliminating the odor ,3,Edmonton

looloopklopm,i have gotten so spoiled with amazon if anything takes more than 2 days to get here it feels like it takes forever ,4,Edmonton

looloopklopm,i am in canada and am having a really hard time finding a mech that i like which is actually available up here i like tkl although would consider 60 i assume they are essentially the same minus the function keys i would enjoy backlit but this is not essential my current build is black and white so if it would be possible to match that it would be an added bonus i do not want this mech to look ub3r gam3r and would prefer a more professional look probably going to go with cherry mx browns but debating reds as well would like to spend roughly 150 cad i have looked at the pok3r and the cooler master quick fire rapid but both are not available at decent prices up north are these old models or something or is it simply because i live in canada that they are not available would appreciate any help or recommendations ,2,MechanicalKeyboards
looloopklopm,ohhhhhh i thought you meant the setup in the picture was 200 yeah that too much ,8,pcmasterrace
looloopklopm,that not even that bad ,33,pcmasterrace
looloopklopm,that a good call on the switch tester however the cheapest i can find in canada is 30 bucks i would probably just return the keyboard if i did not like the switches ,1,MechanicalKeyboards
looloopklopm,cool i really appreciate the help one last thing i like a smooth typing experience at least i think i would would browns provide that or do they feel too clicky i want something that has that nice plastic on plastic feel to it if you know what i mean frowning videos i have seen browns seem to do that but i am worried about the bump in them compared to something like blacks or reds ,2,MechanicalKeyboards
looloopklopm,not a fan of razer would like something a little more professional looking preferrably black and white and i would prefer backlit as well the one i linked would suit my needs but i cant seem to find any reviews on it around here or find anywhere that sells it in canada i am willing to bump my price limit up if i find something i really like ,2,MechanicalKeyboards
looloopklopm,so i have done some looking and stumbled upon this would go great with my setup and i think browns would be a good choice for me only thing i would like is to have the numpad removed for a little less width https mechanicalkeyboards com shop index php l product detail p 2104 ,2,MechanicalKeyboards

looloopklopm,i can only really see three things you do not need a z170 motherboard those are for overclockable chips you could get away with something like the gigabyte b250m ds3h micro atx for about half the price that power supply is more than double what you need go for a 500 600w bronze psu and save yourself another 100 bucks i have never heard of that gpu before but i am relatively new to the whole pc scene i would swap that out for an rx470 or 480 depending on how intensive the games you are trying to play are hope this helps also order all your stuff through memory express if you can they price match online retailers and beat the difference by 10 also if you are in a city with one of their stores they probably have everything in stock if you cannot go through them amazon ca with prime shipping or ncix if you are on the west coast is a good bet i am a fellow canadian engineering student who also just built a pc,2,buildapc

looloopklopm,you americans are so lucky i paid close to double this for an rx480 build,2,buildapc

looloopklopm,definitely thanks for the tips ,1,buildapc
looloopklopm,i am putting a black and white build together when i get home actually thinking of putting a single teal led strip in i think that would look good without being over the top,2,buildapc

looloopklopm,let the man enjoy his build he is not asking for upgrades ,5,pcmasterrace
looloopklopm,what kind of games do you play are you super competitive or do you game for fun personally i think a 1440p panel would be wasted on a tn ips is just so beautiful ,1,buildapc
looloopklopm,ultra wide 1080 wo not that be super grainy ,1,buildapc
looloopklopm,i will be leaning towards that option as well after today haha,1,buildapc

looloopklopm,1531,1,pcmasterrace
looloopklopm,do what this guy says op,3,buildapc
looloopklopm,tropico 4 please but i will take anything ,1,pcmasterrace
looloopklopm,i am in the same position as you my parts are on the way so i cannot really say how good my choice is i went with a 60hz 1080p monitor without freesync i play the same games and have an rx480 on the way i should be able to frame lock at 60 and get a smooth game without freesync ,1,buildapc
looloopklopm,what kind of video card are you running do you game competitively or more for fun ,1,buildapc
looloopklopm,144 hz 1080 monitors exist just not in ips way too expensive to produce ,1,buildapc
looloopklopm,i am dealing with it right now brutal wednesday will be a good day,1,buildapc
looloopklopm,vr may require 16gb but regular gaming with his video card certainly does not ,1,buildapc
looloopklopm,where your ram ,1,buildapc

looloopklopm,if you think that bad wait until you actually buy your parts,2,buildapc

looloopklopm,find the thing you love most in life and then do it on evenings and weekends,1,AskReddit
looloopklopm,that great to hear i am picking mine up today actually i still have to wait for the rest of my parts to get here though ,1,buildapc
looloopklopm,scroll down at 1080 60hz and a 1060 8 will be plenty not a bad idea to go with 16 if you plan to upgrade however ,1,buildapc
looloopklopm,it is with a 1060 ,1,buildapc
looloopklopm,i have no idea honestly haha i would not think it would but i would look into it good luck man ,1,buildapc
looloopklopm,asus mx239h just ordered one yesterday i believe the bezels are only 8mm,1,buildapc
looloopklopm,with a 1070 that where i would be looking i have not seen a 1440 in person but hear they are beautiful i would go for a 27 ips you are going to pay more but think of it like an investment you will have that thing for a long time ,2,buildapc
looloopklopm,i would go with rx480 over the gtx 1060 750w power supply is also overkill along with the 16gb of ram,1,buildapc
looloopklopm,depends on what type of games you play are you big into competitive fps or more into adventure or mmo there are different types of panels ips does not come in 1080 144hz as far as i know but you get amazing colour tn panels what you linked do not look as good but they respond much faster than ips panels which is good for fast paced games a 1070 is overkill for 1080 60fps though ,1,buildapc
looloopklopm,do this op check our r headphones for ideas ,3,buildapc
looloopklopm,bear with me because i am fairly new at this as well i actually just ordered my parts yesterday 16gb as far as i know is overkill for gaming 8 should be plenty of room to work with monitors confused me the most out of everything do some research on fixes for screen tearing and what causes it that is basically all you are trying to avoid other than that spend based on what your computer can run and what is in your budget monitors will outlast the majority of your pc ,1,buildapc
looloopklopm,you do not need 8gb of ram with a 1070 you could do 1440p if you are still looking at purchasing a monitor an rx480 would suffice for 1080 60hz,2,buildapc
looloopklopm,cool thanks for getting back to me i actually went with the asus mx239h because i got a wicked deal on it and it looks really appealing to me ,2,buildapc
looloopklopm,that a good call i was debating the 8gb and this sold me will i need any extra cables or fans or anything like that i just have a feeling i am missing something,1,buildapc
looloopklopm,definitely go with the second option ,5,buildapc
looloopklopm,i am in canada so most ips monitors that are 144 or have freesync up here are like 800 bucks i think i am going to go with a 1080 60hz monitor and just use frame locking at 60fps to ensure i do not get tearing i am coming from a dell laptop so this should still be more than enough ,1,buildapc
looloopklopm,thank you so much i was freaking out last night trying to figure all of this out much appreciated i take it 1080 60hz will still look phenomenal coming from a dell laptop ,2,buildapc
looloopklopm,i am probably going to end up running an rx480 would going 1080p 60hz ips with a way to lock my frames at 60fps be feasible this is my first build and i thought picking a monitor was way easier than this,1,buildapc
looloopklopm,did you go with ips ,1,buildapc
looloopklopm,ok perfect i think i am going to be running an rx480 on my first build coming up i play mostly adventure survival games as well as cities skylines i am thinking of a 1080p 60fps ips i was just worried about screen tearing but i should be good if i can frame lock,1,buildapc
looloopklopm,do most games allow frame locking i think you may have just solved my problem ,1,buildapc
looloopklopm,no problem is there any reason you chose the 8gb 480 over the 4gb ,1,buildapc
looloopklopm,that would be awesome the whole 60hz 144hz freesync vsync is confusing to me i do not know how much you know about that but i have questions ,1,buildapc
looloopklopm,what kind of monitor do you have i put together almost exactly the same build as you but mine costs 1300 because canada but i am struggling to find a monitor that would work with this system ,1,buildapc
looloopklopm,everything is seemingly overpriced here ,1,buildapc
looloopklopm,i actually just found my original one for 145 with a 35 dollar mir would it be worth the extra 10 bucks for potential future upgrades also that one looks much better imo for my clear sided case,1,buildapc
looloopklopm,which monitor do you have ,1,buildapc
looloopklopm,ok thank you would not have known that otherwise ,1,buildapc
looloopklopm,what are the advantages of that mobo over the one i had picked ,1,buildapc
looloopklopm,is that really worth it from some quick research it does not look like it fps all that much ,1,buildapc
looloopklopm,i really do not want to go any higher in price from where i am right now i have heard good things about the rx480 and i plan to stick with it unless i can be convinced otherwise ,1,buildapc
looloopklopm,i actually did not see anything in there that was too helpful i do not want to start modding the thing only to find out it still has static in it i am leaning towards the capacitors being an issue but i do not know how to check if they are bad or not ,1,headphones

looloopklopm,my guess is they went with the cheapest option that would hold under the first design which still satisfied the clients needs ,2,videos
looloopklopm,well in the other design it would have been fine they did not take the time to check whether or not the load on the washers would change as for why they did not go with traditional could be as simple as a client being picky about aesthetics ,1,videos
looloopklopm,it did though the bolts now carry twice the weight as they did in the previous design ,3,videos

looloopklopm,my main question is will i hear the difference between something like that and cheap iems ie does a 8 10 on 15 dollars equal an 8 10 on 150 dollars ,1,headphones
looloopklopm,hey guys so recently i had done fairly cheap 20 iems stolen from me when i left them at work over the weekend so my question is should i splurge and go for something like the 1more triple drivers cad 150 or the shure se215 cad 130 or should i go for something that also gets great reviews but at a far lower price point the panasonic ear drops will i really notice a difference i currently have dt990s and love them if that is some indication of what type of sound i like thanks everyone ,1,headphones
looloopklopm,ok so if i post a picture and ask if anyone is using these such as the popular post about old ipods that is ok ,1,headphones
looloopklopm,i am debating between these and the 1more triple drivers thing is i am not sure if it worth the extra 100 bones over some panasonic iems ,3,headphones
looloopklopm,i think i am going to try a new tube do you have any recommendations ,1,headphones
looloopklopm,it currently running off my laptop which is not plugged in i have it running off a dac though so i do not know why that would be an issue also i think i am out of my 90 day warranty period ,1,headphones
looloopklopm,any recommendations for a new one that might not suffer the same fate ,1,headphones
looloopklopm,i am not hearing any crackling when the tube is out could that be just because nothing is actually making it to the headphones ,1,headphones
looloopklopm,they steal your car ,2,AskReddit
looloopklopm,i had luck fixing the chattering by putting more weight on my heel rather than my toe when you do not have enough weight down your skate can pop up and when you are doing it fast enough it happens sequentially which is what you described as chattering hope that helps ,1,hockeyplayers

looloopklopm,flights are just about the only reason to own a pair of bose qc they fit that niche really well glad you like them ,1,AskReddit
looloopklopm,the only gripe i had with them is they hurt my ears after a bit the bass is a bit muddy and clarity is not the best either but for 150 bucks or whatever they cost nowadays they are damn good ,1,AskReddit
looloopklopm,i would not either i would be worried about sound coming in in a quiet office though as long as there minimal sound going out they would be fine ,1,AskReddit
looloopklopm,do not know why people are downvoting you you are absolutely right bose is the pos headphone that markets itself as a quality headphone basically beats 2 0 except they do sound better with the noise cancelling versions especially you are paying for the technology in the noise cancelling and not for sound quality if there is anyone who wants a really good sounding set where you actually get what you pay for look at sennheiser beyerdynamic audiotechnica akg fostex grado as well as some sony or phillips models ,2,AskReddit
looloopklopm,bose are not even a big step up from skull candies and i say that in the nicest way possible ,2,AskReddit

looloopklopm,cactus club caf in wem is superb moderately priced as well i have heard very good things about rng rd and corso 32 but they may be tough to get into ,-3,Edmonton
looloopklopm,they are the 250s soundstage is pretty good although i do not have much to compare to although the one gripe i have with it is it sounds like a lot of stuff is coming from behind me bass is not as good as m50x but does not muddy everything up like them either a nice balance i think ,1,headphones

looloopklopm,i actually braided it it turned out pretty good except for a small twist i cannot seem to get rid of at the one end it roughly 3 5 feet long now ,2,headphones
looloopklopm,so i picked up these dt990 premiums about 2 months ago along with the bravo audio v3 and a behringer uca202 everything sounds magnificent coming from m50x things are so crisp and i can finally tell the difference between well recorded music and the not so well done stuff i have been out of town for roughly a month and listening to these the first time after coming back was a dream the only complaint i have is i get a tiny pop in my right ear every once in a while which i assume is due to the lack of shielding on the amp i do not find the highs too harsh at all on the 990s like some have mentioned having issues with overall very satisfied with this setup 9 10 ,2,headphones

looloopklopm,this is incorrect since the boat is displacing water the pressure at the bottom of the reservoir is increasing due to the rising water height this means more force is exerted on the bottom of the reservoir which in turn exerts more force on the columns supporting the structure the extra force is equal to the weight of the boat ,-2,pics

looloopklopm,with the vast majority of noise cancelling headphones such as bose qc you are paying mainly for the noise cancelling technology and not for the sound quality with other phones such as senns beyers etc all of your money is going into sound quality and build so you get a much better overall headphone ,3,headphones
