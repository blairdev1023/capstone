Seytai, i think this story is my favorite of the souls games because that sounds so badass to me we are not some rando undead who just so happens to get to the end instead we are a rando ash spawn who is tasked with subduing the lords and rekindling the flame or so i understand ,1,darksouls3

Seytai,i mean i did say i was new so i was completely unaware there were queues all i saw was a list of a few servers and did not know if there were servers considered dead or not figured as a new player it would be more beneficial to play on a reasonably populated server to increase my odds of playing and learning from other people ,1,ffxiv
Seytai,alright dual wield sounds like my kinda route no weapon skills makes sense since they are stamina ,1,elderscrollsonline
Seytai,fun is number one in my book just thinking of setting aside a useful character for high end content i do not want to end up being that guy who holds a team back in trials i would die of embarrassment and quit ,2,elderscrollsonline

Seytai,lol alright thanks for the tip ,1,elderscrollsonline
Seytai,sweet man thanks a bunch ,1,elderscrollsonline
Seytai,okay cool this helps me out quite a bit sounds like the burst type dps of a nightblade might be my thing but since i am new the tanky dk might make learning the game bit more easier and of course i am prepared to change things up when morrowind hits by thrn i should know what is what and since you are really good at explaining these classes to me got any relevant links to the kind of builds i might be interested in for both dk and nb ,1,elderscrollsonline
Seytai,why that i seen a few builds and discussions recommend dw due to the fact that you get 2 weapons as opposed to 1 with staves swords specifically adds more damage ,1,elderscrollsonline
Seytai,it typically a good idea to stick with a main character until end game before making alts that way you can actually do content with your guild while still experimenting with other classes it just a mindset that i stuck with while playing other mmos in the past leveling up multiples at the same time only takes getting end game twice as long ,1,elderscrollsonline
Seytai,really appreciate this post i guess i will just stick with 2 handed for now and level dual wielding as i go on my dk still leveling through story so since dk only gets 2 stamina morphs would it be worth considering a nightblade instead for more skill options or rather would a nightblade be a better stam dps ,1,elderscrollsonline
Seytai,can you parry all bosses ,3,bloodborne

Seytai,if i remember this fight enough the strat i use to beat them alone is kite the havel monster and the other melee character drop down into the water to bait some time from them then drive by hit the bow user until dead then keep kiting and widdle the weak but fast melee character until dead then all you have left is the havel monster play cheap because if i remember correctly he can still be hard on his own side note though i am pretty sure the reward for beating them is not all the amazing i beat them once and ignored them ever since ,8,DarkSouls2

Seytai,how far down are you pulling your pants down to piss man unless you yanking your pants down to your knees then i am sure you can run just fine ,1,gifs
Seytai,you did notice the cops were behind him right i do not know about you but i cannot see your unzipped pants and wang from the back and again if the cop did not grab him he could have booked it cops partner was further back and if i know anything about running away you typically do not run towards the guys trying to catch you ,2,gifs

Seytai,as far as i can see yes might struggle with some bosses but i remember playing with kunai and it helped melt most enemies he also has a skill i believe that marks enemies and while marked they take extra damage check out man of low moral fiber om the youtubes he primarily plays zero and should provide more than enough information on the character ,1,Borderlands2
Seytai,socks on a court are slippery,1,gifs
Seytai,took me a second to notice she lost a shoe and explains why she continued tripping ,2,gifs
Seytai,20 30 vit 20 endurance 30 strength 15 20 dex 19 20 adapt is pretty much the basic outline i use obviously you can add more or less where ever you like and put points into other stats if spells are something you want to use or if you need to increase weight does me just fine as a melee player ,1,DkS2Builds
Seytai,which is why they were informed on the correlation so now they wo not be confused silly man we need to actually talk to those outside murica as well as acknowledge them ,5,funny
Seytai,same thing ,12,funny
Seytai,oooooo but the pain feels so goood,4,funny

Seytai,lizard still learning the controls of his new human suit ,0,gifs
Seytai,in terms of stats what would you look at and think that is suspicious keep in mind we are talking about ps3 here everything is default server settings for the most part and no cq large ,1,battlefield_4
Seytai,up until now i thoroughly believed it was not possible but i cannot even explain what is happening other than leaving the game and calling it lag but again playing bf4 for awhile now and only now i run into lag on multiple occasions that can one hit kill me with questionable guns i do not know ,1,battlefield_4
Seytai,as a fan of the runner i miss autolock in bl2 and is the only reason i do not use the rocket runner made vehicular combat extremely fun ,1,Borderlands2
Seytai,on ps3 so no proof but that alright no one has to believe me and doing so wo not change what i am running into just a matter of changing servers ,0,battlefield_4
Seytai,been seeing a lot of sketchy one shot kills going on typically i overlook these sort of things because yes hacking on console is something that is believed to be impossible and not a thing i was someone who constantly said hacking is not a thing here on the ps3 first thought i have maybe it lag i feel like i am being one shot but really he is indeed landing multiple hits on his side however i cannot see how now all of a sudden lag is seemingly causing one hit kills not only on myself but multiple people when before lag was your typically rubberbanding there is a chance that people are using a cfw but i am unfamiliar with cfw on ps3 so i have no idea if that provides the same abilities as it did on the psp we are all skeptics here but as someone who been playing battlefield on console since bad company i have never seen this happen before on so many different occasions ,2,battlefield_4

Seytai,i can see why it annoying i typically ignore those posts but honestly though what else is there to post here any secrets have already been found character builds are peaked and optimised characters have been discussed and speculated upon opinions on the game series and dlc have been shared so on and so fourth there is not much to really talk about here ,1,Borderlands2
Seytai,oh i see thanks never heard of a rhino iguana but they look amazing ,1,gifs

Seytai,i get what you are saying but honestly that just not what battlefield is and truth be told if it ever becomes something like that i may have to quit the field for good i do not want to sound like the old school players that complain about the new but battlefield has become more and more cod friendly in certain elements that take away what made battlefield special ,1,battlefield_4
Seytai,scarce at best does not mean you wo not have a good time though if you get lucky maybe someone will invade you ,4,demonssouls
Seytai,sweetroll glazers,13,skyrim

Seytai,well yeah of course i think you and those who downvoted my comment took what i said far too seriously not like i said helicopters are impossible to take out or anything however going up against a damn good helicopter pilot who knows what the hell he is doing can really hurt your team and shut down tanks when abusing their limited vertical reach better bet your ass i am gonna tbag after taking you out ,1,battlefield_4
Seytai,ignore this i failed,1,skyrim
Seytai,let not forget that we fall into a whirlpool and somehow end up in a different time and a different location so i can believe this theory whether proven right or wrong ,2,DarkSouls2

Seytai,if anyone can take out lilith the og vault hunters are toast without bloodwing mordecai is just a sniper in which maya could phaselock or zero could use his decoy against him if you played bl1 at all then you have killed roland yourself numerous times considering he is ex crimson lance and the crimson lance engineers use scorpio turrets as well and brick again phaselock ,2,Borderlands
Seytai,without spoiling it does either one win ,7,Borderlands2

Seytai,man that bums me out i really liked atlas and the crimson lance ,2,Borderlands
Seytai,i was really hoping the gun you find on top of caustic caverns was gonna be the only atlas gun in the game considering it supposedly crimson lance hidden treasure missed opportunity if you ask me ,3,Borderlands
Seytai,atlas was bought by jack source please ,4,Borderlands
Seytai,yes and no you will see kriegs and axtons use tediores quite commonly depending on their build ,3,Borderlands2
Seytai,oh sweet that is actually really good to know will make having to replace my firehawk shield a bit more bearable ,1,Borderlands2
Seytai,you lost me at good example ,2,aww
Seytai,for the most part yes and as of bl2 i believe some were crimson lancers who refused to join roland and the others tannis was with dahl and one of the people they left behind her sanity diminished as she watched her colleagues get ripped apart by skags to the point where she was glad one of them finally died so that she could have the comfy chair ,5,Borderlands

Seytai,no joke that damn constructor and area as a whole came so close to making me rage quit my krieg and never play him again whoever designed the constructors to be immune to slag is a jackass ,1,Borderlands2
Seytai,awesome post thanks ,1,Borderlands2
Seytai,how do you run past that constructor throw on high compacity shield and pray you make it i tried running off to the left but he just does not let up on those rockets was right behind him so close to the gate but died with no second wind in sight i farmed a level 70 harold and leveled while doing so so i can use it i feel like if i can just get past that constructor i will be good ,1,Borderlands2
Seytai,do not believe so pretty sure it has to be an explosive ,2,battlefield_4
Seytai,on top of all the other tips here and more on the sound clues toss a nade if an enemy is anywhere near it they will yell giving away their position or at the very least their general area ,1,battlefield_4

Seytai,that is just rude i mean having you there would arguably make things harder so to invite you back and go through harder fights only to kick you at the end is screwed up as for me and randoms so long as they are not speed running the game like a mad man and ninja looting i let them get first pick despite me being host hopefully it gives of a good impression and compels them to do the same with others but that is only hopeful thinking ,9,Borderlands2

Seytai,some what spoiler the game story does not end with the dragon going to gran soren and talking with the duke shows more story then completing the quest in the everfall will reveal what everything means the dragons appearance how the dragon is created and why the dragon selects an arisen and encourages you to kill him the story is quite good and has a pretty damn emotional end ,2,DragonsDogma

Seytai,launch trailer wanted poster property of hyperion while not stated he was tortured you can assume they did something to him him also retaining a sane version of himself mentally can back up him being insane due to trauma often times creating two personalities or voices this sane voice is also the reason why he just does not go ballistic throughout the story killing friendlies so it more than just a voice in his head long story short severe trauma made him insane and you can speculate it was hyperion by his wanted poster or some other source if you wish ,7,Borderlands

Seytai,i agree the wasteland feel was boring asceticly but gave you a feel of yeah i would either die or go insane out here too now from a story telling perspective it was kinda needed in order to outline how threatening jack really was to show that lone wolves or reclusive individuals were willing to huddle together for safety under the only banner not affiliated with bandits or hyperion when you take into account how deranged a lot of those citizens of sanctuary are they might make up what looks like a civilized society but really the only ones remotely civil are the main npcs and even then you could argue how sane they all really are ,5,Borderlands

Seytai,hot chocolate does not have caffeine which is the main appeal of coffee ,1,funny
Seytai,reminds me of that commercial where this girls mom was drinking more creamer than coffee honestly it does not take much to make a bitter tasting coffee taste extremely sweet if that what you want little bit of sugar just as much creamer and then pour in your coffee at the end of the day sugar and creamer are just ingredients to a beverage and just like all ingredients you gotta find what fits and taste good and how much of each you need ,1,funny
Seytai,funny enough no coffee place or restaurant here serves coffee the way i like it either it always too bitter fair enough though seems like you have already done quite a bit of experimenting it typically something really specific that gets people drinking like my friend recently started drinking but he only likes dunkin donuts grounds brew he absolutely hates coffee otherwise ,2,funny
Seytai,why reddit why ,1,funny

Seytai,as someone who recently got ros after playing vanilla diablo 3 everything you do will carry over to ros when you get it so yes you can just get d3 and later upgrade to ros whenever you get it it should be noted though that the two are separate games ros is not just a dlc it an upgraded version of d3 with added content and changes so if you can afford ros then i recommend you get it over vanilla d3 ,3,diablo3

Seytai,exactly what i mean competitive aside it easier to carry a team in cod alone different gameplay is involved along with smaller teams in battlefield team play is needed whether you are together alone communicating or mute good team synergy triumphs unlike cod one amazing player cannot do it alone it something i love about battlefield but also very frustrating when you see your entire team chilling out on roof tops and since we are on the topic anyone notice the team play diminish with each game never get repairs revives ammo box or health anymore and that kinda insane when i think about it ,1,battlefield_4
Seytai, attack on titan theme song ,53,funny
Seytai,in situations like those if you find yourself alone just run you are better off letting them do their thing and regroup with your team and take them out together double date that ass disclaimer unless it rush play smart if you can get the vehicles to simply back off you are good if you are feeling risky position yourself accordingly land vehicles take massive damage if shot in it behind 2 good straight on rockets should kill them never prone if they see you if you think they saw you they probably did because it rare for anyone to run a setup without thermal and finally never chase a tank if he backs out a tank backing away does not always mean he low on health but realising how hot it getting and wants everyone in front of the tank instead of surrounding the tank hope these small tips help as someone who primarily tanks the above is how i typically die smart plays and overwhelming numbers uhh my app done pooped this was supposed to be a reply so calling u s0 b00sted,3,battlefield_4

Seytai,i was with you for awhile until you went after his skill as a player both modes are quite fun as someone who plays both and i could argue that while hardcore might not exactly be harder it still provides an interesting and exhilarating challenge you still have a map positioning is still important in rush at least and aim is still very much needed you absolutely have to worry about more things in hardcore than core like team killing cannot be chucking grenades all willy nilly like most people do or placing claymores in places that will also kill your team things like at mines will also prove deadly to friendly vehicles at the very least i think hardcore could teach people to be less trigger happy and put a bit more thought into their shots even if the kill time is short i am with you on snipers though in hardcore they are freaking everywhere and it annoyingly stupid how easy the kills are ,6,battlefield_4

Seytai,like your decision to piss and moan on a subreddit all while you pass off the fact that you are secretly superior than all of your fellow countryman good on you keep fighting the good fight my fellow brain dead shit stain ,7,funny
Seytai,most bosses are meh sure but dat darklurker alonne and fume and not to mention the ivory king while some of these bosses might not be the hardest compared to other titles i feel like they stand out the most by far compared to the rest of ds2 ,2,DarkSouls2
Seytai,multiple houses an entire world even ,3,funny
Seytai,you play as a character who is fucked in the large scheme of things and does what others tell him her to do ,8,DarkSouls2
Seytai,dat ramen tho ,14,Borderlands2
Seytai,everyone else seems to have you covered but let me pitch in some advice that could help if you do not already know about it pay attention to the pawns inclination this seems to get over looked despite it possibly ruining what might seem to be a good team set up a fighter with guardian could help keep you safe be wont attack unless you yourself are attacked and will constantly stick near you it worth looking into it it what i personally look at when hiring pawns ,2,DragonsDogma
Seytai,happens to me too right off ledges ,1,demonssouls
Seytai,you will obviously be weaker in comparison so long as you are aware of that i would recommend getting all the augments at the very least just so you have them and get some stats out of it without having to spend half a playthrough as a class you dont enjoy ,1,DragonsDogma
Seytai,only rooms that stand out as creepy to me at least creepy enough to stand out are both in ds2 never played ds1 with that said though ishimura sp freaked me out so much second is the daycare i remember the first time i played i said nope saved and quit until i found the courage i needed ,1,DeadSpace
Seytai,i love isaac i think it safe to say most people do he a normal guy who got mixed in with some shit and can no longer escape it even if he tries and he obviously tried with that said and i hate myself for saying this i would like a new protagonist but have him be introduced in a different way instead of playing as the new character off the bat maybe play as isaac and pull a dead space 3 intro where isaac sadly but finally dies in some insane way that just rips our hearts out and leaves us drowning in our own tears to the point we need to pause the game and reflect about our time with isaac i am sure i am alone in this though and it would be tough to replace such a great character ,1,DeadSpace
Seytai,division 1 makes it sound badass but if you went and looked at it you would see that the amount of positions i guess in division 1 has a large pool of people like being top 1 in something on bf4stats but being ranked 15 000 lol so it ai not all that special ,1,battlefield_4
Seytai,tentacle impalement hung from the ceiling fan watching co workers die and getting excited that you get the comfy chair now i think we know where my votes at ,12,Borderlands
Seytai,shit myself every time ,1,DarkSouls2
Seytai,lol i get mania and bloodlust confused keep thinking bloodlust is melee ,2,Borderlands2
Seytai,did not have troubles with it actually a lot of people also said they struggled with bnkr and yeah not an issue then again most people go down the mania tree i went down the hellborn tree so i was not trying to smack everything lol ,2,Borderlands2
Seytai,i recently got krieg and while tough at first later became my favorite character after i got some skills he both challenging and extremely strong so i recommend trying him out ,3,Borderlands2
Seytai,call it barebones,1,DestinyTheGame
Seytai,i am having painful flashbacks of my first fishing trip on the beach ,1,funny
Seytai,i want melee weapons but actually be a weapon type instead of a generic melee like when i first saw zero in the trailers i thought they were gonna introduce swords and what i am gonna say next could very well get down voted and that okay reddit i forgive you but i think stealth should play a part if melee weapons become a thing or at least the option to crouch and sneak about and perform stealth kills unique to that character i love the face paced nature of borderlands but i think allowing a stealth approach could spice things up on the 4th playthrough the game ,2,Borderlands
Seytai,was slightly disappointed but got over it quickly figured it would not be better then the anniversary weapon i already got from a vault run ,1,Maplestory
Seytai,i actually saw mention of regalia in another thread went and applied already lol names seyto ,1,Maplestory
Seytai,alright i will have to explore a bit tomorrow then thanks for the recommended streamers to look at ,1,Maplestory
Seytai,yeah but i get the feeling it will cause me lag i am on a laptop so it not the strongest thing in the world have not tested to see how well i can have a stream running while playing but assuming it decent what streamers would you recommend i imagine even if they are not streaming live i could watch one of their saved streams ,1,Maplestory
Seytai,i miss all the maplestory shorts people used to make or re enactments of songs or comedians ,2,Maplestory
Seytai,you should go with what tropics suggested it been doing pretty for me granted and i absolutely hated training at harps because i do not like all the platforms but i got from level 105 111 now ,1,Maplestory
Seytai,alright i will give it a go hopefully i can keep up in damage ,1,Maplestory
Seytai,i am seeing a lot of talk about cubing and see people talk about something called lines what are lines exactly also what is the hammer transfer thing it does not make much sense to me ,1,Maplestory
Seytai,nice someone who lacks the vast knowledge of maplestory now i will add you when i figure out what is gonna be my main lol still messing with characters ,1,Maplestory
Seytai,i am sure they do it would be silly to think only one person on reboot is a kaiser lol i just have not seen any in my time of playing so far which sparked this curiosity of mine ,1,Maplestory
Seytai,a rare kaiser appeared ,1,Maplestory
Seytai,awesome thanks a bunch ,1,Maplestory
Seytai,wait sorry but just from the names of the books listed do mastery books increase the amount of times you can level a skill like increasing a skill capped at 15 capable of going to 20 and a skill capped at 20 capable of going to 30 thanks a bunch for the help so far now knowing that they are simply sold makes me want to go play hayato or any of the other classes ,1,Maplestory
Seytai,how do you go about getting mastery books i got the impression it was a cash shop thing but with a quick skim i did not see anything ,1,Maplestory
Seytai,i have been reading up on class guides to figure out which one i want to sort of stick with but i see mention of some of the cooler unique classes requiring mastery books or something are these still a thing are they really so required the class i have been looking at to playing is hayato if it helps but seeing a lot of cons that kinda steer me away ,1,Maplestory
Seytai,kings ransom does a pretty damn good playthrough not sure if he goes and explains everything but he does try to shine some light on what might be going on ,4,DragonsDogma
Seytai,another thing is low level missions do not disappear which i guess is good but if you got ocd and having quests all over the place bugs the hell out of you then do not do it friend and i used the free one and ended up doing the missions anyways ,1,DestinyTheGame
Seytai,i just imagine titans having something like that one hispanic dude from the anime bleach punch someone and some sort of fire forms in the shape of a skull ,1,DestinyTheGame
Seytai,i just have a ton of time on my hands ,1,DestinyTheGame
Seytai,that another thing the hell is a sherpa i have heard it come up but got no clue what it is ,1,DestinyTheGame
Seytai,holy hell i forgot about this thanks for replying though basically though they can touch it so long as they do not get frozen this is still probably one of the coolest phenomenons i have seen ,1,gifs
Seytai,iron,2,skyrim
Seytai, question ,1,DestinyTheGame
Seytai,i personally say bl1 but considering i started with bl1 and you did not it will give a different feeling if we are real with ourselves bl1 lacks in comparison to bl2 in the way of small mechanics and story dialogue as someone who started with bl2 you might see this as a downgrade and might find it boring in comparison nonetheless great game i would look up gameplay videos there are not much in the way of spoilers so you can watch whatever if it does not seem your cup of tea and you want something more like bl2 then pick up the pre sequel as i imagine would be a safe pick ,1,Borderlands
Seytai,so an atlas assassin then ,2,Borderlands
Seytai,your questions were answered pretty well but i just want to touch up on some things specifically the corporations during the starting events of bl1 the vault was a myth like pirates looking for a famous lost treasure dahl went to pandora to find the vault in order to obtain new resources they eventually abandoned pandora due to hostile creatures and no guarantee of a vault being found in bl1 you eventually find what is to be a key and atlas who has been searching for the vault after the leaving of dahl need it atlas is the leading corporation in technological advances and they have a siren it speculated that atlas has found a vault previously though what it had i do not know and knew where the one in bl1 was located fast forward to the end steele dies atlas loses their siren and therefore can no longer open up vaults they could capture lilith but what is the point they cannot force her like jack did with steele dead atlas sends knoxx as a clean up crew but things do not go as planned and evidently atlas loses their foot in the door steele knoxx and the assassins dead means the crimson lance is no longer functional and atlas abandons pandora with atlas gone hyperion decides to finally move in directly here i like to believe that hyperion orchestrated the defeat of atlas in pandora allowing hyperion to take what the vaults have to offer without having to deal with atlas jakobs had a settlement but was essentially destroyed by zombies and they really did not care too much though they do help you it suggested maliwan either does not care enough for the vaults or they are looking elsewhere i mean vaults are not only on pandora or its moon hell just because atlas and dahl left doesnt mean they completely gave up on the vaults a lot of this is info found in game mixed with observations and speculations so it no completely concrete but feel it close enough on the corporate information ,3,Borderlands
Seytai,i just recently went back to pick up left over trophies lost all my previous saves so i had to start over i can easily say that bl2 is my favorite but playing bl1 was not any less fun then when i first played it less story but more dismemberment,2,Borderlands
Seytai,mister shank his ability would be to call chaz and perform a double shanking on an enemy ,1,Borderlands
Seytai,or they got dem new kicks that glisten in your twinkling eye as you walk through the bathroom door ,3,Showerthoughts
Seytai,i am now unkillable,1,Borderlands
Seytai,agreed such a kick ass fight in bl1 definitely a memorable one as an underleveled noob ,1,Borderlands
Seytai,there it is if only it had that same terrifying effect as mothrakk i remember hiding under the catch a ride ,2,Borderlands
Seytai,lol figured was there a specific build to use ,1,Borderlands
Seytai,in the main game no unless you include terramorphous sp but he not really a secret there also the rakkmoth thing that spawns in place of bloodwing but if i remember correctly it does not drop anything noteworthy and is basically a reskinned fight ,1,Borderlands
Seytai,you made my cheerios soggy you bastard ,1,Borderlands
Seytai,this looks cool as fuck and sounds dangerous like does it freeze just the ground or literally everything it touches the star fish seem fine until the last frame where everything is still ,1,gifs

Seytai,she ran at him so fast she bounced off a little ,1,gifs
Seytai,i do not think i have seen a comment with this many down votes before i feel like my down vote is but dust in the wind at this point ,1,funny

Seytai,i am essentially working on all four main characters but i would probably main both maya and zero ,1,Borderlands2
Seytai,yeah with only 10 bucks i feel like i should get the two upgrades since both are 5 bucks but i had the feeling most people probably use gear from other dlc to power through those tough enemies ,1,Borderlands2
Seytai,feel free to use my pawn cannot remember what his setup is though i know he either a strider or ranger with only daggers love that aggression psn is seytai,1,DragonsDogma
Seytai,til the heart is it weakness who would of thunk side note though pawns are so cute they are like kids learning something new and constantly want to repeatedly share it with everyone then one day you throw them in the ocean ,4,DragonsDogma

Seytai,i cannot remember,65,Showerthoughts
Seytai,i love you too,2,DragonsDogma
Seytai,thanks for correcting me you cannot imagine how long it took me to even post what i said making sure it sounded right nonetheless apply that logic to the dog wolf debate ,1,darksouls

Seytai,punk because anarchy ,2,funny
Seytai,turned phone off for class turned it on three hours later and was shocked to see it look so beautiful ,1,baconreader
Seytai,i was using his exclusive as an example you cannot get him to spawn solo without using the coop glitch bug in 6 man coop the game would be too easy or at least easier with the addition of two others to balance that you could add higher tiers of enemies but make them exclusive to 6 man hopefully that makes a bit more sense ,1,Borderlands
Seytai,so if 6 man coop was a thing some of the higher tiers would need to either be super rare when less then 5 or 6 people are on or make the higher tier enemies exclusive to 5 6 man coop like vermi essentially is ,1,Borderlands
Seytai,farewell my child,1,gifs
Seytai,the problem i see with this difficulty since i do not believe difficulty scales all that much the more players there are so it would be easy even if they made it a challenge it a matter of higher level mobs rather than more so playing solo or 4 player coop could in turn be a serious challenge if encountered by an enemy meant for 6 players the other issue is loot similar to the above loot will either be too hard to find alone or too easy with 6 players loot chance does increase with more players right or am i mixing up games here other than those it would be freaking amazing in hectic situations ,3,Borderlands
Seytai,if only we had the sort of community ds has ,3,DragonsDogma
Seytai,the sword looks awesome there along with the rest of your character though it mainly due to how dark everything is at first i thought you were wearing a long plain black cloak and black hood ,2,DragonsDogma
Seytai,what is your sword and armor ,2,DragonsDogma
Seytai,combat and fashion the ending as well ugh both the endings give me chills and a slight chub ,2,DragonsDogma
Seytai,i made progress but then it got harder and scarier and my tears began to fill my buckets seriously though bbi is so brilliant first time i felt fear like dark souls fear which is fear of the unknown in tight spaces ,1,DragonsDogma
Seytai,support kits i have picked up never even have ammo on them it always like xm25 and c4 so pro,11,battlefield_4
Seytai,i lol would i am the kind of guy who cares how i look hell my weapons camo is blue sky though the soldier camo is so similar amongst each other i cant tell the difference between them granted i am still on a sd tv as i play better on them but the only camo that actually stands out is firestarter ,0,battlefield_4
Seytai,personally i think it less about what class there is a lack of and more about pawns actually doing their class correctly mages and sorcerers being guardians is bad they could have the skills i need but what is the point if they are dead a squishy low defence hanging around a melee character is no good with that said being on psn finding a non guardian mage sorcerer is rare and very valuable ,2,DragonsDogma
Seytai,thanks for actually telling me why seems most people prefer to downvote then to say anything at all the logic behind that lol ,1,Borderlands2
Seytai,sorry was a legitimate question i do not have the dlc or keep up with things constantly i was actually hoping you would explain ,1,Borderlands2
Seytai,how is he not related i have seen more convincing evidence that he is and none that he is not in fact you are the first person i have encountered that has said this ,-13,Borderlands2
Seytai,i was the champ at the corkscrew challenge ,1,funny
Seytai,a warrior arisen ranger with pioneer inclination mage with support spells primarily sorcerer with all offensive spells where this all falls short is every mage and sorcerer being a freaking guardian nevermind the cast time they cannot even begin because every attack i dodge they end up taking it to the chin pretty simple team if you ask me ,5,DragonsDogma
Seytai,who cares ignore them wanna see more of the shit you listed post them yourself in an attempt to revitalize this place into what you wanted and maybe people will come around do not make an equally as useless post bitching and moaning about people reaching out to the dead community doesnt matter what they are asking for that a chance to coop ,5,demonssouls
Seytai,i am confused you want them to stop making those posts however terribly annoying they must be to you while you sit on your ass watching this reddit in hopes people will start posting something new the games old as fuck it at the point where you will get nothing but posts asking for help if you want better posts then take up art and post fan art or link us to your active youtube channel or organize co op plays down vote me ,13,demonssouls
Seytai,do not think so as dark arisen is more than just new content it adds tweaks however since you have the vanilla if you get dark arisen you will start with some cool gear for having a base game save file ,9,DragonsDogma
Seytai,calm down dude no need to call the man retarded over something so simple ,3,DragonsDogma
Seytai,you have out done yourself ,3,DragonsDogma
Seytai,hopefully i am not too late but for the love of god do not make it a guardian nexus a mage hanging around melee arisens is counter productive ,2,DragonsDogma
Seytai,strange i do it rather easily once i expose the heart and knock it down once from there i just time my charges and hit the heart ,1,DragonsDogma
Seytai,how so ,1,DragonsDogma
Seytai,whopping 338 ,1,DragonsDogma
Seytai,normal difficulty wearing the dragon gear found in everfall and wounded heart longsword nothing too special ,1,DragonsDogma
Seytai,i find that getting an act of vengeance the really long charge with a devastating attack one tends to keep most larger enemies down i went up against two of those undead dragons drakes wyvern in bbi and could literally spam that attack keeping him stunned in the ground long enough for a sorcerer to get off a large spell ,1,DragonsDogma
Seytai,flying enemies have not been an issue you can hit most of them with a jump attack and most of them will fall after one hit that excludes anything like griffons of course but that where a ranger mage and sorcerer pawn team come in handy ,1,DragonsDogma
Seytai,strange do not think i have ever seen one of those before until tonight in bitterblack isle ,3,DragonsDogma
Seytai,i had one appear out in front of the city recently and it was before the griffon main quest did not kill it but it did scare the hell out of me ,1,DragonsDogma
Seytai,i am thinking i might have to do the same i run around as a warrior and main pawn a ranger need a good mage and sorcerer who are not freaking guardians lol does me no good when they are charging a huge spell at the feet of bosses right next to me ,1,DragonsDogma
Seytai,i think i just might so long as my phone permits it side note they should write a book or something for the game to add more understanding and clarity maybe based around edmunds arisen days ,2,DragonsDogma
Seytai,mmmm i see i see completely forgot about that title of his makes a lot more sense even if i feel most people still would not think too much of it if the pawns hand glows around him from the sounds of it the arisen is legend and prophecy but something tells me the dragons deal is not known or even that arisens are immortal unless the dragon is killed hell not even the dragonforged knew how edmund dealt with the dragon i also doubt a pawn would go hey edmund how your sad immortal life going hope the sacrifice was worth it as hilarious as that would be it would also seem that arisens do not stop being arisens even after slaying the dragon take our arisen for example so the pawns would still recognise edmund as arisen no matter what to add on a theory of mine is i think edmund hated being an arisen due to it leading to the lost of his loved one if it wasnt for the dragon choosing him she would still be alive with him pawns would be a constant reminder of her even being an arisen himself he completely ignores our right if arisen as if it were just a legend by saying i would take just about any help at this point implying he sees us nothing but an extra sword sorry for such a long reply truly enjoy these kinds of topics ,5,DragonsDogma
Seytai,i do not completely agree with this theory do not get me wrong it makes the most sense however do not people know he was an arisen even if the pawns addressed him it not like anyone knows of the dragons deal therefore people would not think anything of it at least that what i think unless i am missing something ,1,DragonsDogma
Seytai,whoa calm down dude got no idea why you are all pissed off was just amazed you decided to do a complete restart on your main account no need to be an ass over nothing ,1,DragonsDogma
Seytai,hero achievement is the one with the completing all quests right god was that a stressful one i worried through the entire playthrough hoping i did not miss anything or screw up ,1,DragonsDogma
Seytai,weak early a god later unless smacked coolest looking spells i have ever seen in a game ,1,DragonsDogma
Seytai,lol love it had to throw a pawn down a cliff cause he was in the way of a jump i wanted to make new playthrough idea throw your pawns at enemies ,1,DragonsDogma

Seytai,true but this thread is not exactly productive either if the people reposting the same thing are not reading posts similar to theirs what makes op think they will read this and stop answering that leaves you with the conclusion that this post is to simply vent annoyances which is no better then those raposts catch what i mean ,4,baconreader

Seytai,i hear you however role playing as a pissed off argonian who comes to skyrim in search of unnamed dunmers that tried to kill you or whatever makes for interesting play especially with the dragonborne dlc how would an argonion with a grudge against the dunmer deal with solsteim ,1,skyrim
Seytai,you should read lore my favorite race is the argonians but that because i played one in morrowind and i like lizards reading the lore made me like them more skyrim makes them and the khajit look bad but in their native land they sound bad ass trust me a little lore and you will find a race you connect with more ,2,skyrim
Seytai,i kinda wish the horns clipped through hoods in the game now looks so good in this doodle ,1,skyrim

Seytai,loved him from the start and it just got better as the story progressed i mean he looks awesome but might be put off at how young and pretty boy he looks however right off the bat he shows how dedicated he is to his job he snaps chris out of his depression by flashing pictures of dead soldiers in his face he vocally announces when chris is being a dick or how pathetically low he had sunk the dude has the balls to say what is what with no bullshit would you also have the balls to throw chris up against the wall and tell him he getting out of hand i sure do not then he straight up sacrifices himself and knows he wo not be able to live a normal life but accepted the outcome for a side kick piers was a grade a badass prepared to do anything to save the world from bio terrorism i hope he makes a cameo saving someone like assuming he somehow could survive ,5,residentevil
