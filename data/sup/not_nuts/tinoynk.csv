tinoynk,if you are at all open to watching foreign art movies then it possible you would like it i think it one of the most beautiful movies i have seen especially in terms of relatively straightforward romances it explores the subject with such nuance and if it comes to any concrete answers they are not the ones you would necessarily expect and even though the circumstances of the plot make of the interactions and behavior somewhat heightened none of it feels hamfisted and all stays completely grounded in the reality of the characters and environment ,2,movies

tinoynk,yea i did not read the article so i do not know the actual plans but also if we are going from the pov of somebody at the back they probably would not have any knowledge of what is actually in the rest of the train so it would leave tons of room to make new stuff up and expand the universe but still it tnt so i wo not watch it ,2,television
tinoynk,i thought post was who is the deadliest overweight character was far more interesting ,8,whowouldwin
tinoynk,that fair after all the 90 minute movie kind of existed on logically shaky ground the whole time still an awesomely fun movie though but i could see them setting up characters in different parts of the train and if they still go with the revolution route they could even take their time and have a whole first season leading up to it and then go from there it tnt so i almost definitely wo not watch it but the more i think about it the more i like the idea ,1,television
tinoynk,actually seems pretty easy especially logistically and production wise by definition the sets will be small and constrained and any cgi of the exteriors would not be hard at all also they do not even have to show that many cars in the first season and if it a success and they get a bigger budget it would go hand in hand with exploring more of the train now in terms of the writing script i could see it being tough to maintain but it could also lend itself very easily to an episodic series ,5,television
tinoynk,i am not saying there was not any plot progression and clearly if anybody gotten this far they should not require clearly spelled out exposition but there was more directly plot related stuff happening in the first 4 episodes again i am not complaining about the episode at all but i could see why people might wonder why we care about the pit boss getting fired or mike being an employment adviser or some creepy kid smoking cigs inside i am sure some of that will set up big stuff not all because lynch has no problems not following up on minutiae but again at a first completely surface level glance a lot of the episode is just letting the world breathe ,4,twinpeaks
tinoynk,it definitely did not spend much time explaining or exploring the mysteries that were set up so on that level i get where people would be coming from but i personally loved it also there gonna be 18 episodes if this was an 8 or even 10 episode run i might be more sympathetic to concern about spending time on stuff that seems inconsequential but we are barely a quarter of the way through there still a ways to go ,10,twinpeaks

tinoynk,it will all depend how it wraps up but if it sticks the landing it might be my favorite the first season is mostly consistently great from beginning to end though some of the oliver platt storyline cannot help but feel just a little tangential to the main plot i still enjoy it all but i do not think this third season has had anything as extraneous that third episode notwithstanding i also felt like the second season bit off a little more than it could chew by the time the resolution came around i loved the raising arizona reference and it was cool seeing wrench numbers as kids but the hanzee tripoli thing is just too weird i think the heights of the second season may be the best of the series but the ending was not perfect this third season seems to be the most focused and has also developed very nicely thematically it also probably the most intense i have ever felt the show largely because we actually feel a degree of investment in even the characters making mistakes with lester and the gerhardts there was not a ton of sympathy but even though i completely understand that all of the problems in s3 are the characters own faults they are still somehow endearing ,1,FargoTV

tinoynk,i would agree that spielberg was never the best director working so if his untouchable status is in pure quality of films then i would agree that not correct there also many directors i personally find more interesting or enjoyable but even though the mainstream approach of his films can seem to give them a very middlebrow or maybe even pedestrian quality i would argue that the technical craftsmanship on display along with consistently strong characterization makes the films i mentioned legitimately great and even second tier stuff like minority report and catch me if you can are just so enjoyable and assuredly made sure most of his movies wo not haunt you like something from kubrick or lynch but movies should be judged as to whether they accomplish their goals and spielberg almost always does that with flying colors ,2,movies

tinoynk,the script for alien is not a scientific document it a movie script so the purpose of having a character say it looks fossilized is just saying to the audience hey this thing is old the only alternative is that dan o bannon knew ridley would one day make movies about a robot creating xenos before the events of alien but he wanted us to think the sj was old as hell for the next 35 years so he had a character that would not technically know the exact details of the science he talking about make a statement that upon nitpicking becomes kind of unclear occam razor here people ,0,LV426

tinoynk,my point is that the godfather views michael as a villain he a villain who you are given a clear insight into his mentality so he also the protagonist but we are not supposed to see his progression in a victorious or heroic light i am also not saying that we see noodles as a perfect good guy or a hero but the movie does not do as much as the godfather to communicate its views of the protagonist morality maybe that a function of the fact it was heavily cut down or maybe leone just has no interest in any kind of moralizing but at the end of the day that angle is not in the final product i am also not saying i think it a bad movie i do think it pretty great but if we are comparing it to the godfather some nitpicking is in order ,0,movies

tinoynk,except for the one about glorifying the lifestyle not a single one of these reasons have anything to do with the quality effectiveness of the two as films if a shitty videogame made 30 years after the fact affects the way you view the godfather that fair enough but to me it seems wholly irrelevant i would also argue that the godfather does not glorify the lifestyle and portrays it in a pretty straightforward manner if not a downright cautionary judgmental one it very clear we are supposed to see michael arc as a downfall and while the audience definitely derives satisfaction from seeing him gun down solozzo and mccluskey his assuming the role of godfather is absolutely tragic the closing frame of the first movie really communicates a sense of dread and horror rather than victory also as much as i enjoy once upon a time in america it never had the effect that the godfather ever had on me the main problem is that we are not really welcomed into the characters even despite long stretches of backstory and context i still feel held at arm length from all of them it also does not help that our protagonist is an unrepentant rapist which the movie also does not seem to have any problem with even as somebody who willing to overlook uncomfortable aspects of a character especially if they ring true to the story and character and environment the way it handled in the movie is really hard to look past ,6,movies

tinoynk,as much as i would love to believe it a result of viewers actually getting off the bandwagon i think it has more to do with the fact that fox news best position ratings wise is during a democrat administration when they are able to whip up a frenzy among their viewers and scare them with the usual talk about abortions and mexicans but now their old buddies are back in charge so why worry about any of it it a similar phenomenon to the surge in popularity for those trying to keep the administration honest like nyt and colbert though fnc did well during the bush administration that could be due to the wars and the daily show really made its name during those years which had some turbulence ,1,politics

tinoynk,the first third or so is solid pretty much up until david shows up it deliberately paced and tries to get you familiar with the characters which reminded me a lot of alien however i found the characterization a little on the lazy side katherine waterston character really does not have much going on outside of the sad dead husband backstory which cannot help but feel heavyhanded i also thought billy crudup character was quite one dimensional he does get room to ponder faith and all that which is interesting but ultimately his character does not go anywhere or do anything remotely interesting or surprising but then once david shows up it just a mess there so much time spent directly explaining alien lore and none of it makes much sense katherine waterston kind of disappears while everything else goes down making the narrative arc sort of awkward and the kicker is that characters start making dumb decisions that make no sense and are simply distracting some of the best and scariest horror movies thrillers are so good because characters do the logical thing that makes sense but still get screwed when characters make blatantly bad decisions in the context of a horror thriller it undercuts the tension because you cannot help but think yea no shit you got killed ,21,LV426

tinoynk,planet terror is probably the only really good answer to this question but even still robert rodriguez definitely wanted the movie to be cheesy and over the top and gratuitous so i hesitate to call it bad if it what he was going for kung fury was made on a shoestring budget and is clearly trying to evoke old cheesy movies and video games so the tone it has while strange is not bad unless you think it just does not work and not sure how idiocracy would be so bad it good i know people who do not like it but they just straight up do not like it ,7,movies

tinoynk, american beauty is probably the most universally acclaimed movie that i really think is kind of bullshit it disingenuous and manipulative and none of the characters we see have any believability as real people and only serve to hammer home alan ball points i do not mind a script being a little didactic but it done with such a heavy hand and ultimately the message which include the classic rich white guys in the suburbs can be sad too thing is a horse that was beaten dead long ago i do understand its appeal because it beautifully shot and a lot of the performances are fantastic especially chris cooper and a lot of the ideas it bandies about have a veneer of intellectualism that definitely can stand out among many mainstream hollywood movies but at the end of the day it pretty vapid under the surface i also recently saw blow up and did not enjoy it i get it modern society distances us from each other to the point the guy cannot even bother to engage with the actual plot of the movie going in i had no idea about its borderline lack of narrative but even when i came to understand the direction the movie was going it still did not connect with me that said i see it value as a document relic and indictment obviously of swinging 60s london and culture at the time but does not really do anything for me ,2,TrueFilm

tinoynk,i think we are both on the same track page as name brand directors will often work with the same people especially editors and cinematographers since they not only probably have some level of artistic connection but also just are familiar with the way they work which makes the creation process much easier as for the question of why the distinction between best director award and best picture that has a lot to do with the oscars themselves best director almost always go to a movie that in some way showy high concept or if it just looks plain old difficult to pull off i would say 2015 best picture best director split exemplifies this perfectly though spotlight won best picture it a very small scale and quiet movie without any big setpieces showy camerawork or period piece conceits but i would say is masterfully directed and received universal almost unanimous critical acclaim on the other hand many critics found the revenant somewhat underwhelming but despite this it still ended up as a shoe in for best director largely because of the nature and scope of the filming process and the overt difficulty of the camerawork and content ,1,movies

tinoynk,it is harder to specifically identify good direction as opposed to acting cinematography editing etc but ultimately it comes down to the holistic combination of all of the technical elements and often has to be judged on a sliding scale commensurate with the intentions of the director it the job of director to oversee all aspects of the movie so if you find that not only are the individual aspects well executed but they all combine to result in a particularly well communicated artistic vision then i would say it was a directorial success but that does not mean a good movie is necessarily well directed take bob saget dirty work which though somewhat competently edited features a litany of continuity errors is lazily shot and blocked and has a moronic plot and minimal character development but ultimately the people in the movie are all absolutely hilarious and since the only goal of the movie is to make you laugh it a good movie or at least an effective one but not a well directed one ,5,movies

tinoynk,your point is that racism is a function of power structure rather than the actual color of the people doing the racism and that the only reason racism in america is what it is is because white people have been in power so white people are racist because they are powerful not because they are inherently racist that not necessarily wrong especially that white people are not inherently racist but how does that change the fact that for black america the choices made by the white power structure over the last few hundred years have caused a very unique and specific set of problems this does not mean you personally need to feel bad and spend restless nights burdened by the guilt but why do the mental gymnastics necessary to convince yourself that you are not to blame is it so hard to understand that black america got a disproportionately raw deal and at the same time not have to jump to your own personal defense your point treats the issue with the broadest brush possible and almost goes out of its way to ignore the specific history of racism here which was unique at its time in scope and refinement if you ignore history when talking about the present conditions of anything you are going to come to a bad conclusion and my assumption of you being foreign was to give you the benefit of the doubt if you have done a good job learning about history here and cannot see the connection between history race and the way our country as a whole currently treats race it does not really reflect well on your motivations critical thinking ability or credibility and suggests that you might feel threatened by discussions of race in america which is in and of itself interesting in a discussion about the fragility of white america ,5,TrueFilm

tinoynk,in terms of movies that blatantly make clear their intent the last action hero is a very obvious one robert altman the player is as well but rather than deconstructing a particular genre it examines hollywood movies and their conventions as a whole another type of deconstructionist movie is one that simply stripped down to the basic elements of which walter hill the driver would be a great example the plot is simple the characters are carboard thin caricatures and there not much of an attempt to emulate reality but it does not matter because if you like cops robbers car chase gangster movies it basically a skeleton of those types of movies without all the bells whistles ,4,movies

tinoynk,the movies you mentioned are all well received to different degrees especially including kingdom of heaven but if we consider that his prime alien and blade runner are still probably the top 2 in terms of overall consensus i am sure more than enough critics and fans have different takes but i would bet the pair of sci fi movies would probably win out in a poll with a good sample size so if in his prime the sci fi movies are tops and in his post prime the sci fi movies are tops my point still stands it kind of a clinical way to look at movies which i do not really love doing but not completely unfair ,1,TrueFilm

tinoynk,i also thought it was a little better the humor and shtick was just the same as in the first a little too wink wink and blatantly self aware but pulled off by talented enough actors that it still works but what really helped was that instead of having to spend time learning about the characters we already have that information and the movie can play with their relationships and personalities to full extent right from the get go and this is where the movie really excelled in letting us explore the characters and how they interact and feel about each other even in the midst of a typically numbing cgi explosion fest ,2,movies

tinoynk,my problem with calling villeneuve one of the great sci fi directors is just the fact that he only made 1 sci fi movie i just kinda feel like by definition we have to go by track record volume if his blade runner is great then he will definitely belong here but i thought that sicario prisoners and enemy have just enough issues that he does not have 100 of my faith carte blanche especially since it a sequel which certainly makes it a bit trickier and though prometheus was not very good it substantially better than most of the stuff ridley scott been doing in the same time period which is largely a reflection of how far he fallen as a filmmaker but if you consider prometheus to be at all better than his baseline of the counselor and robin hood and exodus and if the martian is his best received movie in a long time then would not it stand to reason that his ability to execute sci fi is well above his baseline abilities in non sci fi i never really thought of it that way but it is not untrue also alien covenant is not getting panned so it probably nothing special but again ridley scott is clearly far past his prime and given the great films he already made as long as we get solid offerings i cannot see why they would hurt his resume in the genre ,4,TrueFilm

tinoynk,it varies from director to director but generally it the job of the dp cinematographer to translate the director vision some directors may know exactly i want to do a slow zoom in there then a medium shot then extreme closeup while some may know i want to show that this character is feeling backed against a wall and then let the dp figure out the best way to do that the director usually has final say over everything but may not have the time to oversee every little technical detail of editing and filming ,1,movies
tinoynk,eh watch made in america instead ,1,television
tinoynk,the two are not mutually exclusive some movies have good performances and are well directed and some are neither so these are really two completely separate questions in terms of what makes good acting that somewhat subjective but overall somewhat easier to define than good directing some people might think of good acting as only realistic naturalistic performances while others might think of good acting as having an commanding stage presence etc both of those can be components in a good performance but ultimately i would say that the primary metric by which to judge a performance is whether or not the performance lets you understand the character as an independent being separate from the script and the filmmaker intentions sometimes this can be via a wacky and over the top performance like nic cage in raising arizona which nobody would ever consider realistic but i would say is a great performance good direction is far harder to pinpoint many people conflate direction with camerawork and more specifically fancy showy camerawork most directors do decide what type of shots to use and stuff like quick cuts or extended long takes often jump out to viewers and many people seem to consider such techniques to be good directing in and of itself but on the most basic fundamental level good direction by definition affects almost all aspects of the film a good director will notice flaws in a script and make adjustments or motivate an actor to get to a particular place for a performance to work or specify to the photographers exactly what his vision is or work with the editor to convey his vision etc it also depends largely on the director as they all have different styles and voices and just because the coen brothers do not go crazy with their editing and camerawork or paul thomas anderson does not have the snappiest most memorable dialogue does not mean that they might not be equally as good at their job ,3,movies

tinoynk,i think this case has been overstated quite a bit it true that the fiscal meat potatoes of the movie industry are not movies oriented to adults made for less than 100 million but it not like every single movie coming out is either moonlight or star wars hell one of the highest grossing movies of the last 5 years is american sniper a movie with a very mid range budget with mature subject matter then just off the top of my head i can think of spotlight hidden figures la la land the accountant gone girl the light between the oceans and i am sure plenty more that were made for between 20 60 million and geared toward adults overall it true that the focus of the movie industry is on the 200 million productions for kids that make a billion and the 5 million indies for critics that win awards but to act like there not a substantial amount of movies in between is just false ,3,movies

tinoynk,while i agree that aliens is mediocre alien is one of my favorite films of all time but though i vastly disagree with your perception of the film you did a damn good job of explaining why you did not respond to it i think so much of the appeal of alien comes down to how immersed you get in the atmosphere every time i see it i am immediately entranced by the set design cinematography score and overall tone i also love the narrative choice of just dropping us into the situation with minimal context which helps make you feel like you are there with the crew it also got a great cast and for my money the xenomorph is hands down the greatest monster in film history which definitely helps ,2,movies

tinoynk,i have only seen aliens twice first as a kid and i loved it but when i revisited it around a year ago i was really underwhelmed i think my main problem was that i really just could not get immersed into any of the proceedings the main problem i had was with the dialogue which usually is not something that sticks in my craw especially given my acceptance of cameron shortcomings in that area but it was borderline impossible for me to view any of the supporting characters as real people rather than caricatures i think one issue which is not a fault of the film is that it almost singlehandedly created the aesthetic of the space marine which makes it really hard to not see their behavior as cliche even if it did create the cliches i also get that their macho posturing is supposed to contrast with how quickly they dissolve under pressure but that is not really a particularly fascinating character or plot development i am also not a fan of the loud crying kid in action movies who constantly gets in bad situations and need the heroes to save them the mother daughter stuff between newt and ripley is a good touch especially contrasting with the inclusion of the queen which i do not think was a perfect choice but not a major problem and with ripley hearing about her real daughter at the beginning of the extended director cut but it still feels like a chore detour whenever they have to go out of their way to save newt i am also having a harder and harder time taking cameron self serious stuff at face value i love true lies almost endlessly mostly because the fact it a comedy really makes cameron inherent silliness far more palatable ,13,TrueFilm

tinoynk,fancy and complex camerawork does not equal good direction a lot of the time a long take or a tracking shot can be great but wilder ability to make his films visually compelling while using mostly restrained camerawork is one of his trademarks in my mind also like somebody else mentioned he was a fantastic director of actors not that jack lemmon and barbara stanwyck and james cagny were not great on their own but they each gave career best performances for wilder that might have a lot to do with the writing as well but even in witness for the prosecution for which he just wrote the screenplay adaptation the performances especially from charles laughton are just astounding ,5,TrueFilm

tinoynk,i really do not get why american beauty is still as loved today as it was when it came out i can maybe understand why it might have seemed somewhat fresh or insightful back in 1999 but watching it today it just cloying pandering and totally convinced of its own depth and insight while it has little of either my biggest issue is that none of the characters read at all like actual people they all clearly exist with the sole purpose of hammering home ball theses which seems like stuff ripped from a college freshman intro to philosophy musings i guess if you are at a point in your life where the we do not like need things man kinda of thing speaks to you i can see how there would be a lot to grab onto here but there really is not much past that and even the valid points it makes are not illustrated in a remotely interesting way i do not mind a script being slightly didactic but if it does not do things to make me see around the heavyhandedness its not doing its job properly the performances are mostly very good especially the fantastic chris cooper but the twist at the end with his character is just so hammy and trite ,1,movies
tinoynk,it was indeed nominated for picture and it won for best screenplay and actress the series definitely has more likable characters or at least a higher amount of likable characters but also in a far more exaggerated cartoony way it all fits within the tone of the show so it never a problem for me but the show does have a much more heightened tone than the film the film does have a lot of wacky humor but it never feels remotely surreal even given all the plot twists and turns that kind of tightrope act is just so impressive to me and one of the reasons it one of my all time favorites ,3,FargoTV
tinoynk,well the movie did not win best picture though it clearly better than the english patient it kind of unfair to compare the film to the tv series and i love both to huge extents but the film is just perfect granted it easier to construct a perfect 90 minute movie than an 8 hour series and i think that the first season in particular is very close to being totally flawless but while i can maybe nitpick aspects of both seasons there nothing in the film that should not be there or does not work 100 ,2,FargoTV

tinoynk,i sort of on one level understand the point but it such a ridiculously semantic one that even if you acknowledge the fact that the idea of marriage in our society specifically exists in the context of the abrahamic religions it still a societal construct invented by human beings and as such it up to the human beings who invented and use the construct to define it maybe they should redefine their idea of marriage as christian marriage and let the rest of us living in the 21st century have regular old marriage ,8,politics

tinoynk,i do think that there is a lot of stuff in get out that might seem somewhat generic but every one of these instances makes it clear that jordan peele understands why and when these tropes are usually used and their appearances in get out to me demonstrate that he using these tropes in a conscious way with regards to the cops laughing at the tsa agent i think that can be read as a pretty direct commentary on the black experience in america for decades us white people were told about their problems with the police but until the technology allowed us to actually see it the reaction was basically might be true but eh i never see it so it probably not an issue it definitely true that it a dumb idea for rose to leave around such evidence but the level of silliness there fits in with the tone of the rest of the film which is very heightened especially at that point maybe rose would not want to tell him about her history with black men because he would feel fetishized there plenty of white women attracted more to black men than white men but i do not know how a black guy would feel knowing that his gf is into him because he black i actually had not thought about that angle but maybe there something there the criticism about the success of the procedure could also tie in with my first point look at the recent rash of disappearances of young girls in the dc area and there almost no major public outcry if the same was happening in a white neighborhood i bet you would hear more about it ultimately your points definitely are not invalid but the way i experienced the movie i did not see these as issues also a lot of the film appeal is in its use of tension which remind me a lot of polanski even outside of the cabal of elderly friendly seeming folks whose founder name is roman the idea of a protagonist being totally alone against powerful often unknown or mysterious forces is polanski trademark and not only does that work here on a cinematic level but also fits perfectly in with the film thesis ,10,Screenwriting
tinoynk,it almost all the writing the characters all somehow feel like real people even though they are all at the service of the sprawling narrative whose primary purpose is to make a point one of the biggest problems in most shows movies books that have a political or topical point to make or an issue to explore is that the possibility of believable and organic characters suffers under the weight of a didactic and heavyhanded thesis but even though the wire does as good a job as any fictional narrative in illustrating very cogent and nuanced points it actually is able to maintain a world of characters we see as real people and obviously the narrative itself is such a complex balancing act of so many narratives with almost equal weight and all of it works and intersects so perfectly in ways that seem so obvious in hindsight but none that you ever see coming ,2,TheWire
tinoynk,honestly i think the acting is probably the technical area that most lacking not that there are not a bunch of legitimately great performances but more than a few of the major characters definitely have flaws in the acting especially in the early going for some sonja sohn is fine but her delivery is kind of stilted and there not really a ton in her character beyond the tough lesbian cop tropes even dominic west is very hammy in the early parts of the series and i do not think he 100 comes into the character until the 2nd season and even then his american accent is not great then there also a ton of non professional actors who take some of the bit parts like the deacon and while they do not come close to ruining the series it clear that they are not pros ,2,TheWire

tinoynk,it goes without saying that art in general often reflects aspects of the zeitgeist at any particular time but you could almost make the point that when it comes to superheroes specifically the relationship does not hold up and the approach taken by snyder especially concerning superman might have a different origin take the 70s for example when distrust of authority and government really came into its own after watergate and vietnam movies like network one flew over the cuckoo nest chinatown apocalypse now dog day afternoon the deer hunter etc which even if not containing a direct political message spoke to the cynicism and dissatisfaction especially with institutions that defined the cultural attitude at the time but though there are not a ton of superhero movies to look back on the main example is richard donner superman in 1978 which may as well be the first real hollywood superhero movie and is one of the most lighthearted and fun movies of the decade completely going against the overall trend of movies at the time tim burton movies can also be largely pegged as exactly what you would imagine a tim burton version of batman to be though there was a timely quality to the specific type of urban decay in his version of gotham sam raimi first spiderman came out in 2002 less than a year after 9 11 and it success may have a lot to due to with the fact that it provided wacky escapist fun at a dire time the big change toward the type of dark and pessimistic superhero movie started with the nolan batman movies which along with casino royale kicked off the gritty rebootization of the entire industry and the attempts to replicate it aesthetic is exemplified by the type zack snyder makes now i guess that a long way to say that he trying to capitalize on the aesthetic fad of gritty reboots and that i do not think there actually that strong a historical correlation between superhero movies and the overall societal attitudes of a particular time ,3,movies
tinoynk,also when it comes to 300 and watchmen both of which are based off existing properties i could not tell a single thing that snyder tried to personally imbue onto these the best adaptations know why they are re telling the story they chose but snyder thought process seems to begin and end with oh that looks cool i want to make something that looks cool i will make that i mean when robert rodriguez made sin city he hewed as closely to the source material visual style and narrative as humanly possible and there a lot of gratuitous style for the sake of style but it also made you feel like its manifestation as cinema was a natural conclusion of the concept rather than an unnecessary amendment ,11,movies

tinoynk,if the black guy hated all white people and believed that black people were superior then yea he is a black supremacist even if he did not shoot anybody being a black white supremacist does not mean that you shot somebody of another race it means that you think your race is fundamentally better than another the shooter in this case came to nyc specifically to kill a black guy i guess if you really want to be pedantic about your definition of white supremacist you can run wild with that but i do not think it completely unfair to label a white guy who specifically wants to murder non whites as such the definitions here are pretty cut dry so i am not really sure what is so confusing to you ,18,news
tinoynk,if he shot a black edited guy during a barfight i doubt white supremacist would be in the headline but since he shot a black guy specifically because that guy was black and the shooter hates black guys it got some relevance also there only been one white supremacist shooter in the news lately so if the author wants people aware of the story to realize that this article is about this story in order to get more clicks that also makes sense ,9,news

tinoynk, one of my main problems with stranger things was that they were taking entire scenes to do character development that spielberg would have done with a single line or expression less is often more considering the fact that all other netflix original drama series that i am aware of went 13 episodes and many of those series suffered from having too much filler especially bloodline stranger things is downright breezy in comparison at only 8 episodes also when you have a tv series even a relatively short 8 episodes you do still have more room to breathe than a 2 hour movie ,1,movies

tinoynk,i generally enjoy inception but it a movie that really does get worse the more i watch it it just spends far too much time explaining itself to the audience in a way that just seems so self conscious good sci fi should be able to drop you into it universe without needing to constantly hold your hand throughout the journey the amount of exposition has also been criticized to no end but it such a valid critique and is really impossible to not notice on multiple viewings ,2,movies
tinoynk,a lot of my favorite movies of all time are on the long side but i also love finding out that a movie is 90ish minutes i do not think there any correlation between length and quality but one of the best qualities a film can have is to be lean and efficient and it just more likely that a 90 minute movie will be more lean efficient than a 150 minute one but when a movie can go long and still feel like there no fat on it that just an incredible achievement and probably why many of the all time highly regarded films are on the long side ,2,movies

tinoynk,i never once said that obama was perfect hell i never said he was a good president if that was my point then your response would make some sense but that was not my point my point is this if you were to make a list of the obama related concerns of the average fox news watcher over the last 8 years i would bet that you wo not find drone strikes wage inequality or personal privacy on the vast majority of those lists on the other hand if you were to make a list of the trump relation concerns of the average liberal you will be able to find a bevy of real reasons that these concerns should be held that the only point i made and the only one i am making if you take issue with anything beyond that i would guess that you are willfully misinterpreting my argument or maybe you just need to work on those reading comprehension skills ,2,television
tinoynk,between 2008 2016 all we heard from the right in this country was how obama going to take our guns he going to put christians in concentration camps he going to let in all kinds of muslim terrorists he going to destroy america etc now how many of those things came true and furthermore how many of those things have any basis whatsoever in reality and fact the answer is exactly 0 however if you look at the concerns that the left has about the trump administration and compare them to the things said and done by trump and his administration you will see that there is a lot of consistency between the things the left is concerned about and the things that the trump administration wants to do i understand that if you have literally no knowledge of the facts at hand and look at our right left political discourse it might seem like the anti trump mudslinging is literally the same thing as the anti obama mudslinging but it really only takes about 10 minutes of thought and research and the most basic understanding of politics government to realize that the all sides are the same notion is just fucking stupid ,20,television

tinoynk,maybe you do have as full an understanding of the racial dynamic in the america as most americans and i was totally off base but i am sure that when i watch an english irish movie about the ira troubles or an iranian movie with religious characters or a south american movie about a time of political upheaval there are things that might not resonate or maybe even register with me as for you not finding it to be particularly tense or exciting i just have to disagree but obviously you are entitled to your opinion especially with regards to such a visceral thing as what you find tense scary exciting thrilling but personally i thought the progression of events was very well done in terms of the tension i felt it reminded me a lot of the narrative techniques polanski uses in particular that of rosemary baby almost every polanski film has a protagonist who feels like the entire world is out to get them and often that does end up being the case not only is this resonant to a lot of black americans but it also just terrifying and disconcerting to see it played out as it does in his films and i thought that get out plays with those same emotions very effectively as for your comparison to the dialogue about the benefit of the fembots in stepford wives i would say that almost a little on the nose if the thesis of get out is that black men are basically predated upon from all angles of american society we have almost literally every base covered here and not in ways that are always explicitly called out or discussed on screen but are insinuated through action and story clearly one of the main ideas is that white people deep down on some freudian level want to be black good dancers good at sports cool clothes etc it does sound very reductive and is one of the most surface level things in get out but again i do not know if most white americans let alone white non americans understand how significant of a meme not internet meme dictionary definition meme that is in black american culture also the idea of white women being dangerous or a path to losing your black identity is another meme in black american culture it something us white people sort of understand vaguely but not quite to the full extent where one could read this film as almost a sole commentary on white women which would not be invalid in terms of police the traffic stop at the beginning of the film is a very neat and clean way to show that he not in familiar territory anymore as well as showing us that he like most black men are used to being treated unfairly but what really does it for me is the ending showing us the image of an innocent black man standing over the bloody corpse of a white woman with highbeams flashing from an approaching law enforcement vehicle it an image so powerful and connected to so much baggage in american history recent and not so recent and it shows that he knows exactly what is going through your mind at that time and that what he wants you to be thinking about as for your complaint about the gf going from ally to enemy it made very clear that she been luring him in the entire time when he finds the box of photos of her in romantic poses with grandpa and grandma the stephen root character also remarks that her method of recruitment is more pleasant than jeremy which apparently involves being hit over the head and stuffed in a trunk of a corvette as opposed to banging allison williams for a few months ,1,movies

tinoynk,that what we thought with edgar wright and how would that work out at this point it seems clear that keeping a tonal consistency is non negotiable and overall i think it a smart decision on the part of kevin feige co by definition these movies have to service the universe as a whole and if given 100 creative control i doubt that a writer director like sorkin or edgar wright would arrive at a final product that exactly what feige is looking for and i cannot blame feige if he needs the final product to be 100 exactly what he looking for at this point given the success of the franchise it an approach that at least understandable i also do not know if aaron sorkin personality wise would be the guy to successfully navigate the demands and pre existing conditions of the mcu while making a definitively auteurist product i even believe that joss whedon said that it was vexing having to work certain things into age of ultron and this is a guy who been a major cog in their creative wheel for a while not an outsider joining the team also the main reason i would not want to see one of my favorite filmmakers join the mcu is because that will just be longer i have to wait to see something that actually their own ,1,movies

tinoynk,i really enjoyed green room it does such a great job of cleanly laying out a tense powderkeg of a situation and lighting the fuse and just letting you watch the chaos it also has so much authenticity of characters dialogue and decisions nobody explains anything that does not need to be explained nobody says anything that a normal person would not say and the characters all do the thing that you want characters in dumber movies to do but all that being said there really not a single thing underneath what is ultimately a very cool tense and well done thriller with a unique setting as for get out i personally found that it worked superbly even on the level of a straight up horror thriller before we even get to the subtext the tension and discomfort is felt immediately and only ratchets up at a constant rate the way that the mystery and exposition is doled out was also very skillfully done i would agree that the characters might not feel quite as authentic as those in green room but not only is that a function of jeremy saulnier particular writing style but also that his sole intention was to show us what it would look like for a punk band to battle neo nazis jordan peele on the other hand has far bigger things to do and say with get out even considering the fact that these characters primarily exist to illustrate a point in the context of the story being told they are all completely believable with the exception of the blatant comic relief which could be seen as a commentary on mainstream black cinema also given the fact that you mention 15a and 12 ratings i assume you are not american and i hate to say it but the issue of race in modern american is so complex i would understand if a lot of the subtleties might be lost on people who only have a basic understanding of the racial dynamic in this country in the context of other movies about race what makes get out so important is that white people are forced to think about the way they themselves think about race with most race movies white viewers can think oh well i am not the slaveowner or the klan member so i am alright but when get out the iconography is used so perfectly that it impossible to leave the theater without thinking deeply about your own thoughts and worldview just to give one example of the level get out works on just think about how he picks the cotton from the chair to plug his ears spoiler which ultimately is what saves him from losing his identity one could say that a pretty blatant example of the type of symbolism here but one that not everybody might catch the first time around ,4,movies

tinoynk,i regret now not adding an extra paragraph of qualifiers and clarification yes it will do just fine there will be lots of people who remember the lotr trilogy fondly and i would bet that it probably keeps it status as the premier fantasy epic of all time but at this point in time they are seen by many as some of the greatest films of not just their generation but of all time and maybe i am just super out of touch here but i do not know if people will be mentioning lotr in the same breath as no country for old men or there will be blood or children of men or sixth sense or the other great movies of the late 90s early 2000s ,0,movies
tinoynk,i have never been an a for effort guy snark aside i do really appreciate the technical achievements of lotr and i completely 100 understand why somebody would be completely blown away by how perfectly they were able to realize such a complex world and i guess i should have clarified what i meant by being talked about because clearly these will be the definitive fantasy epic films for the foreseeable future but as of now i see lotr being hailed as some of the greatest films of its generation and even all time that the only extent to which i do not see it holding up ,-2,movies
tinoynk,whether it started the genre or not people will still dismiss fantasy sci fi horror just because i do not think that necessarily fair so i was just pointing out that unless the world of film criticism changes dramatically there will probably be a barrier that keeps lotr from being mentioned with the other great films of the early 2000s that being said since the next generation of mainstream critics will have grown up with lotr maybe it will be the star wars of it generation but for reasons stated earlier i do not think that it has as widely accessible appeal as star wars does and that no knock on lotr it more an endorsement of how insanely perfectly crafted star wars is that it able to burrow into the subconscious of entire generations to the point you could be walking down the street and hear a lightsaber woosh or a tie fighter scream and though completely out of context you will immediately know exactly what you are hearing i was hyper aware of lotr at the time the movies were coming out and was very excited to see them as i had read and loved the hobbit and fellowship but i did not respond whatsoever to two towers largely because it got more bogged down in the lore and history rather than focusing on the characters i already cared about ultimately time will tell and maybe i am just part of the minority that did not find lotr to be particularly revelatory but especially compared to star wars i do not think it has quite the perfect recipe of elements that will keep it super relevant for decades it will probably always be the 1 example of a fantasy epic ever but my only point is that i do not think it will be remembered alongside the no countries and three kingses and magnolias and the other legitimately great films of the time period ,1,movies
tinoynk,copied from a response to the same point made to my post oh star wars has already stood the test of time that for sure but i do not know if lotr has that same staying power with star wars entire generations of kids were raised watching the original films on top of being bombarded by the toys and books and other merchandising so even when there had not been a star wars film made for 15 years it was still a major part of the zeitgeist i remember being a kid in the late 90s before the prequel movies were announced and star wars was still the biggest thing in the world even though there had not been a new movie in almost 20 years people are still aware of lotr and it definitely still a part of the zeitgeist but i do not know if kids are being raised with those movies like they were with star wars and even if parents will try to show their kids lotr i do not think those movies would click as well with kids as star wars did people love lotr because of it sprawling scope and endless depth and complexity of narrative and character relationships but i cannot see any of that stuff resonating with most kids on the other hand star wars is so successful because it taps into so many archetypes that appeal to us on a completely instinctual almost reptilian brain kind of way which is a type of success that i think is more likely to persist for future generations and though lotr might be the more complex and impressive feat of filmmaking it also a genre fantasy story that will keep real film snobs from fully embracing it ,-1,movies

tinoynk,oh you are definitely right about that but the fact that the direction is so subtle was basically my point to begin with there a ton going on visually but it mostly with regards to framing blocking and even when it does use camera movement to highlight something it is not like that true detective long take or anything and i am also not saying this as a negative criticism as more ostentatious direction would probably feel odd and out of place as that slo mo and flashback in the pilot do especially upon rewatch i was not trying to say that there is not any style in the wire but in comparison with the sopranos i think it pretty fair to characterize the sopranos as more overtly cinematic especially since it and even it characters are highly aware of gangster movies and their relationship to those tropes not sure if you have seen it but there a great video essay about the visual style of the wire super interesting stuff https vimeo com 39768998,1,TheWire
tinoynk,the wire is definitely very well directed but outside of the season ending montages where do you see creative liberties taken with regards to the visual style and i think rober iler was solid in the earlier seasons and occasionally perfectly hilarious but even given the fact his character is supposed to be an insufferable whiny entitled tool i rarely see anything really past that in the character ,2,TheWire

tinoynk,he definitely great at rich engaging stories in terms of the central premise and he does introduce a lot of really cool and interesting ideas however my point is that he has not been able to marry his high concept ideas with characters that actually feel organic and genuine again i enjoy all of his movies overall but my experience with them especially upon rewatches is usually alternating between being astounded by a big setpiece and then scoffing at on the nose dialogue or lazy characterization ,3,movies
tinoynk,and given how boring and monotonous nolan dialogue skills are thank god for that ,1,movies
tinoynk,i think it actually has potential to be the best use of his talents for how talented he is at visual storytelling and spectacle he really a mediocre writer most of his characters are pretty shallow and surface level none of the dialogue is distinct or interesting and recently he seems far more preoccupied with blowing our minds than actually crafting a complete film here he already said that there wo not be much dialogue and unless he has plans to make up history and introduce aliens or time travel or something his actual skills will be on full display without opportunity for any of his flaws as a filmmaker to become apparent for the record i enjoy all of his movies but c mon ,2,movies
tinoynk,by far the most encouraging thing i have heard about this is that it will have very little dialogue http www thewrap com christopher nolan dunkirk little dialogue i have enjoyed every one of nolan movies and i am always going to see his stuff in theaters but his dialogue writing skills are mediocre at best it will also be nice to see him work on something where he can solely focus on the story and characters at hand rather than wasting time figuring out ways to omgz blow your mind ,2,movies

tinoynk,if i see a highly regarded movie and it does not click with me i wo not immediately jump to it sucks sometimes like with requiem for a dream or american beauty i do think those movies have massive fundamental issues that despite some very good things in them do keep them from being good movies at all but on the other hand with toni erdmann and tokyo story both of which are apparently amazing movies i just did not get i understood the plot and was able to identify a decent amount of the filmmaker intentions but outside of that i just could not wrap my head around why any of this would be interesting to anybody that kind of a harsh way to put it but that the best way i can put it and so with those movies i cannot say they are bad i just legitimately do not get them i plan on revisiting them later as i suppose i do with american beauty and to a lesser extent requiem for a dream but as of now they went right over my head ,1,Screenwriting

tinoynk,you are right that oscar nominated movies usually fit a certain preconceived rubric and i will agree that the movies nominated for the oscar for best picture are never actually the best movies of that year but it a little odd to bring up the criticism of something being formulaic when defending superhero movies ,1,movies
tinoynk,you are right no one metric is the sole standard of a movie merits and because logan does a lot of things well it a very good movie and the things it does not completely nail do not make it a bad movie but just because they do not completely outweigh the positives it does not make the criticisms invalid or worth be shouted down into oblivion or maybe these days it does who knows ,1,movies
tinoynk,that a fair point and my personal top 10 of each year would deviate pretty significantly from the academy but if you then want to use the actual demographic the academy picks from as a function of which you are considering the type of movies the academy usually picks i do not think this will really take off with them anything possible of course and depending on how the rest of the year plays out i would not consider it the most insane thing in the world if it gets a best picture nomination especially since they theoretically expanded the field to 10 to accommodate more blockbuster type movies but i will say this much if it does get a best picture nomination from the academy there will be 9 or maybe a full 10 nominations used ,7,movies

tinoynk,have not seen hidden figures lion or the theory of everything so i cannot comment there but they all seem pretty paint by numbers to me which is a reason i have not rushed to check them out the imitation game is very unoriginal and that a big reason why it not a good movie at least logan though apeing conventions from other genres and movies does a really great job at making me feel like the characters i am watching are real people rather than going through literally every single step of the hollywood biopic checklist i know it an unpopular opinion but man that is not a good movie and sure there been bank robbery movies before hell or high water and even ones with social political commentary ie dog day afternoon but what makes hohw so special is the perfect scripting of the events and characters and does a great job at doling out just enough exposition exactly when needed i would also contend that the brothers robbing a bank to pay back that bank to keep their oil rich ranch might be at the very least a tiny bit more original than father figure and kid on the run from bad guys bridge of spies is not exactly revolutionary in it approach but the choice to almost split the film into halves is pretty interesting and not completely without risk and lincoln is a pretty unique film it reminds me of stuff like jfk where you have 3 hours of basically nothing but conversations and information dumps but somehow it manages to feel cohesive and contain a legitimate narrative that a pretty damn impressive feat in my book ,-5,movies
tinoynk,it very good the performances and character stuff are all legitimately great but it ultimately does not really do anything remotely original or special unless you consider the fact of a dark violent superhero movie to be original again i really enjoyed it but at the end of the day it a pretty standard on the run from powerful bad guys road movie it not ridiculous to see it as a rehash of even recent stuff like midnight special and bloodfather and obviously children of men that does not make it a bad movie or anything but the fact it a pretty boilerplate road chase movie transplanted onto the x men universe does not make it the genre defining masterpiece of unparalleled artistic ingenuity that some seem to be praising it as ,1,movies
tinoynk,you seem to be having trouble keeping more than one thought in your head at a time maybe it hard for some people but it really helps to understand issues which might contain elements of nuance which in the real world is basically everything since you seem to have a pretty significant degree of intellectual density this is probably useless but if you can keep up try to follow me here the idea that one can understand not approve endorse support but understand the motivations for a terrorist in the context of them being a human being with their own experiences and whose outlook and worldview is shaped by said experiences is not mutually exclusive with the idea that terrorism is a danger posed to many people worldwide that needs to be addressed by effective intelligent and rational solution if you cannot understand that these two things can be true at the same time that on you ,2,politics
tinoynk,looking through 2008 man that was a shitty year for movies so yea tdk might sneak in there and i enjoyed logan but it has no business being nominated for an oscar edit boy lots of downvotes going through 2008 via rt i would say that the wrestler let the right one in and in bruges are the only legitimately great movies i have seen from that year frost nixon is really close to that class and i have not seen milk or the visitor but i hear they are great and are on my radar for the future so if possible i will get back to you on that if the issue is with my second statement sure maybe 2017 will be a shitty movie year and logan will end up as one of the 10 best american movies let alone movies that will be considered by the academy that far from an impossibility but i would bet against it ,-27,movies
tinoynk,where did i say anything about leaving anybody alone i specifically said that i understand the need to take action against such groups but by taking wrong actions we hurt ourselves down the road if you deny the fact that botched and careless use of force helps propagate to terrorists then i suppose your premise holds but that at the very least a faulty foundation on which to stand and i would say it straight up incorrect but if you do accept the fact that botched and careless use of force can serve as recruitment tools for terrorism are you just choosing to completely ignore that fact if so your thought process is being completely dominated by an emotional need for revenge while i understand this instinct it a stupid one ,2,politics
tinoynk,maybe because no superhero movie has been one of the 10 best films in its respective year it not really that complicated ,200,movies
tinoynk,in a vacuum your point is correct and i do not think anybody would necessarily disagree but when you are factoring in the realities of the war on terror and what it entails it seems reasonable to me that the more heavyhanded the strategy the less effective it will be long term at curtailing terrorism it an issue that needs to be taken seriously but it also one that seems to be more effectively fought via intelligence clearly at times force will be needed but it of the utmost importance that such uses of force be done responsibly otherwise you can kill one high ranking terrorist but if done sloppily you will just create more fodder for propaganda and recruitment not saying that such a person should not get got but if they cannot get him right they should not go for it at all ,5,politics

tinoynk,i would agree that the vilification of muslims is a far bigger issue than the type of apologism in referring to but an inherent aspect of our current political climate seems to be that what one side thinks is a complete and utter non issue the other side sees as the only issue or at the very least a major issue and as a function of that there will be some issues obsessed over by one side that are legitimate issues but blown out of proportion to the extent that it becomes a boy crying wolf scenario and then the other side ends up having a wolves are fantastic position ultimately the idea that the fear tactics of the fight with regards to muslims is dangerous and the idea that having any religion play any role in public policy is dangerous are not mutually exclusive ,1,politics
tinoynk,look i completely understand that many problematic elements have co opted criticism of islam as a thinly veiled vessel for unmitigated racism and bigotry but this blind lionization and glorification really needs to stop at the end of the day it a religion and it just as fake as the rest and if we expect the world to function properly in a modern sense we all have to accept the fact that the belief in any religion is strictly by definition bad for everybody ,5,politics

tinoynk,i do not really disagree with your initial premise that critic opinions should not really affect how one views movies but i fail to see why that should make you want professional film criticism to disappear into obscurity the kind of people who complain that critics are wrong and all pretentious hacks do not listen to critics in the first place so in that instance critical consensus does not affect their moviegoing experience on the other hand some people do have tastes that generally line up with critical consensus and for those people it a valuable tool to use when deciding what movie to see a lot of those people also enjoy thinking deeply about the films they have seen in which case reviews and criticism are even more valuable i highly doubt there anybody in the world who says oh this movie looks amazing and i want to see it but critics do not like it so i wo not see it maybe those people do exist but the kind of people who see and enjoy critically panned movies probably already know that they do not agree with critics and as such do not listen to them in the first place it seems like you are inventing a problem that does not exist almost strictly by definition ,1,movies
tinoynk,he has a point i do usually pay attention to critical consensus when deciding what movies should be on my radar but i also heavily factor in the cast crew director writers etc for example if a movie has a 65 on rotten tomatoes but it by a director i like with actors i like and has content that sounds up my alley i will definitely see it but if a movie has a 65 and is by a crew i am indifferent to and does not sound like the kind of movie i usually enjoy i will pass on it i guess at the end of the day you should take into account all the information available if you want to put any effort into curating your moviegoing experiences ,2,movies

tinoynk,as for the trainspotting comparison your points are not necessarily wrong but they are not tied into the point i was getting at i brought it up in context of the two being drug movies and working off the not incontrovertible premise that aronofsky intended people to view requiem on some level as a relatively straightforward cautionary tale of drug use clearly as i mentioned in my earlier post this was far from his only intention and there is far more going on than a reefer madness update but the straightforward drug angle is at the very least a major aspect of the film intent though admittedly not the only one in that context assuming both filmmakers wanted people to come away thinking among other things that being a junkie is bad trainspotting is actually slightly more effective to me because while being highly stylized filmmaking editing the almost light breezy tone and that we are given the inner monologue of somebody completely fine with his status as a junkie at no point do i think a viewer can reasonably say to themselves oh that looks like a blast despite the fact they may have had a blast watching the movie regarding your observation that trainspotting is unrealistic that fair but i think that largely a function of the filmmaking and the editing which give it that propulsive energy the dead baby scene is also a low point in the characters struggle and that a pretty damn rocky bottom but to me that has more power than the fates of any of the characters in requiem because the structure of the film itself actually has ebbs and flows rather than just a precipitous downfall so when placed in the context of the film it stands out a lot more ultimately if you want to completely ignore the drug angle of requiem then that fair and the film would definitely have more power and you can ignore everything i have said and i know that it was based on a book so as for the content itself i suppose i cannot blame aronofsky but that does not change the fact that to me it has such restrictive tunnel vision that it overpowers any other potential it may have ,1,TrueFilm

tinoynk,it also would not be a bad idea to introduce a group of benevolent islanders who befriend and maybe assist the visitors at some point so the villains are not just all the residents of the island but one particular sect group of island natives that way you can even have some avenue for exposition if need be ,2,Screenwriting
tinoynk,peter weir picnic at hanging rock is definitely a classic of the unanswered mystery genre the entire film centers around a mystery and all of the characters are obsessed with it but after 100 minutes we know absolutely nothing about what happened and the only clues we are given just make everything more bizarre it also just an amazingly powerful and haunting movie ,59,TrueFilm
tinoynk, the invitation is the only one i would say is remotely overlooked especially around these parts it also definitely the best of the ones you mentioned really has some great character work going on there ,2,movies

tinoynk,true they were not just generic indians or even comanche or cree or something real and then having the one native american character at the beginning be the one to give the exposition on them also reinforces the idea that they are something totally different ,1,Screenwriting
tinoynk,not really in terms of government politics but today culture is very sensitive and having the villains be a tribe of native savages and the heroes be civilized probably white guys would not go over so great with the sjw crowd at least if there no attempt to add any depth or humanity then again bone tomahawk did manage to have that element and avoid seeming racist ,1,Screenwriting

tinoynk,i mostly play h2h categories with daily lineup changes and in this format i really do not like having a backup c the main reason is that i like to use my bench spots for sp since in a league with daily lineup changes stacking your bench with sp allows you get production from all of your rostered players but if you use your bench primarily on hitters you are going to end up with a lot of production left on the bench i do like having a bench hitter but i like that hitter to be good for one and also to have some positional flexibility unless you want to burn a useful early ish pick on a 2nd catcher that catcher just is not going to be a good hitter and imo wo not be worth the opportunity cost of getting to keep another useful pitcher this is not as relevant in a league with weekly lineup changes but i still would much rather use that roster spot on another player ,1,fantasybaseball
tinoynk,op phrasing was kind of vague there i had the same thought about the leftovers which i knew was supposed to be weird and out there but i had no idea there was any possibility the happenings were in somebody head sure if you have watched enough of mr robot you get the idea that there a lotta shit like that going on but if you have not started it yet and avoided reading and hearing about it you might just think it a show about hackers and i do not think you would have to be an idiot or under a rock to be in that situation ,1,LegionFX
tinoynk,the last movie i watched was big trouble in little china and jack burton is pretty incompetent so not even a remote chance unless you let me consider wang to be the main character in which case he has experience fighting some sorts of supernatural ancient chinese demons and sorcerers and some kind of toonforce y stuff going on though a bullet to the dome would just about do it for him i would still probably be fucked all 6 times and the last video game in played was madden and the last qb i played with aaron rodgers also fucked unless we can parlay and convince him to take olivia munn instead but i do not think he just looking to get his rocks off or that he okay objectifying women like that but who knows maybe that his celebrity crush ,1,whowouldwin

tinoynk,i also think there something to be said for the fact that stuff like the dialogue and script which are some of biggest problems are things you may not notice until the second or third time you see the movie because despite those problems the dialogue is being delivered by an all star cast and the execution of the concept is so novel that if you are seeing it in theaters you might not really notice the flaws though they do exist ,2,TrueFilm
tinoynk,a great movie is just a movie that either succeeds on all levels or has so few or such minor flaws that what the film does well unequivocally overshadows the issues and in my first reply i made sure to say that i do not think there any inherent limitations on superhero movies i just think that none have actually achieved that level of what i consider artistic success ,1,TrueFilm
tinoynk,that a very good point and it also possible that the imitators and descendants dilute the effect and it would not be fair to blame a movie because it got cheaply ripped off a hundred times i am also sure that the dark knight will stand the test of time and be remembered as a seminal movie but i also do not know if it will be in the same conversation as stuff like no country or there will be blood or the other movies from the same era widely considered great ultimately time will tell ,3,TrueFilm
tinoynk,that last part is definitely very true but i feel like going offense early is the conventional wisdom overall on the other side of that though you do not necessarily want to spend so many early picks on offense that you are stuck passing up good values later because you already filled a spot and obviously you still need to do work choosing matchups but if a lot of teams in your league have 2 3 bench hitters you can get a huge advantage on the counting stats and generally without sacrificing too much in the ratios i was going to say that i was mostly referring to roto cats but it probably even more useful and relevant in points ,1,fantasybaseball

tinoynk, though i admit i was a bit disappointed to know that the demon lenny will turn out to be not one of david personality but like the guy in the ice cube said a parasite i do not think these are mutually exclusive i forgot who said it but there was a line in e4 that said something to effect that david can make it real the devil lenny angriest boy might have originated as aspects of david psyche that actually manifested themselves in some sort of real way but since they are born from david power they need to feed off it hence the parasitism ,2,LegionFX
tinoynk,i like stockpiling sp for my bench spots though i do not mind keeping one bench hitter ideally with some positional flexibility i am sure my theory has holes but my thought process is that in a daily lineup change league you can actually get production from all of your rostered players with a deep pitching bench if you have a good bench hitter but nowhere to play him every day you could easily end up with a lot of production on the bench but since you can switch p in and out of lineups every day and chances are you wo not have more than 6 sp going on any one given day assuming a standard 2 sp 2 rp 4 p you can get 100 of the production from your rostered players provided there is not a terribly restrictive ip or gs limit this is not quite as relevant in weekly lineup leagues and there i think there a lot more value in a strong offensive bench ,5,fantasybaseball
tinoynk,i do really enjoy the burton films but probably because they feel more like tim burton movies than batman movies i am not the biggest burton fan but they have such a distinctly auteurist feel to them it clear that we are seeing a cohesive vision of a talented artist that being said i do not know if i would call them great though i would have to think a little harder about the exact reasons maybe it just the campy tone i cannot quite get past but i do have a lot of respect for both i mean for somebody in 1990 to base the entire visual scheme of a massive budget superhero blockbuster on 1920s german expressionism is just so ballsy and it probably the most interesting thing about the two films not that nolan batmen of which begins might be my favorite are devoid of directorial interest or value as i find them all at least enjoyable however it also might be hard for me to keep myself in the mindset of the time they came out when the gritty reboot was a legitimately fresh idea but since that tone approach has been replicated seemingly endlessly since then it in some ways makes the nolan trilogy slightly less remarkable in hindsight maybe it a bad approach but i do not think it unfair to re evaluate the films in a vacuum rather than being a prisoner of the moment when omgz a dark serious superhero movie was the freshest thing anybody ever seen ,7,TrueFilm

tinoynk,one of my favorite film podcasts i never see mentioned is battleship pretension as you can tell by the name they are slightly more oriented to the art house indie scene one of the two hosts moreso than the other but though they take their film seriously and have really interesting ways of thinking about film they do not take themselves too seriously and even often have comedians come in as guests the format is also great as instead of doing the typical movie review news thing they pick a certain topic to explore every week and these topics can be almost literally anything now that they are 8ish years in some of the newer episodes are kind of grasping for content but it 100 worth combing through the backlog and picking out episodes that sound interesting ,2,Screenwriting

tinoynk,i have been pretty blown away by legion so far if any superhero property has transcended what i see as the limitations of the genre that might be it but i think it also benefits from being run by a guy who does not have any concerns outside of crafting a great tv show as far as i know there no plans to merge legion into the movie universe and at least at this point in the show there been almost 0 connections to the movie universes or even the comic books from what i understand i do not think that connections to a great universe is necessarily a huge issue but for some reason the standalone nature and just the weirdly awesome kind of lynchian tone does make me think of legion differently from other superhero properties ,16,TrueFilm
tinoynk,it not a perfect masterpiece the script has some stuff that could get cut out or abbreviated and ultimately the road movie on the run from bad guys format is not anything incredibly original midnight special as a recent example op might be a little hyperbolic in his praise of logan as a genre defining opus but he not really that wrong in how different it is at least superficially from most recent comic book movies while many of the major sweeping differences are superficial the violence language visual tone editing style relative lack of cgi etc it does make a sincere effort and i think a pretty successful one at rooting the center of the story in the two main relationships logan has throughout the movie it also goes a long way not having a movie dependent on what are ultimately cartoons for the record i also kind of have the same opinion on you that superhero movies can only be so good but ultimately that because no superhero movie has been that good the dark knight included but not because i am not open to the possibility that a superhero movie can also be a legitimately great film logan has not broken that barrier into what i would consider great film but it is really damn good ,92,TrueFilm

tinoynk,if you think i was criticizing your pov for being too personal you misunderstood me completely i was criticizing your insistence on using one sole metric to determine the skill of a player and to make it an even bigger problem this metric is a team metric not a player one in science and research methods you get the best and most accurate result by observing the most variables possible and using the largest sample size possible making a judgement of a player based solely on super bowl rings violates both of these rules so if you want to do that fair enough but it just a fundamentally flawed way of thinking now when it comes to movies this gets infinitely more complicated because while anybody can see that barry sanders was more individually talented than emmitt smith it a lot tougher to prove that citizen kane is better than the dark knight let alone transformers especially if you are coming from a place where you can even consider the possibility that ticket sales objective quality of art sure i could go on and on about welles innovative use of deep focus and narrative structure and the epic and towering performance at the center and that while nolan has a great grasp of visual storytelling and knows how to convey gravity his on the nose dialogue and relatively clunky screenwriting keep tdk from being the undisputed masterpiece many claim it as but i have a feeling that you will just hear all of that as pretentious babble that does not make a difference to you and that fair because ultimately nobody can begrudge somebody for liking whatever art they respond to which is where the sports analogy breaks down if somebody thinks that twilight is the best film ever that means that there something in it they personally responded to which is valid even though in terms of traditional technical film criticism it not a good movie however if somebody thinks that lamont jordan is the greatest rb of all time there literally not a single leg they have to stand on even if for some reason they really had a personal love of lamont jordan ,1,movies

tinoynk,as with most things in the world judging the best of anything is complicated far more complicated than looking at one single metric ticket sales super bowls etc and making an entire holistic judgment based off one metric regardless of context or application of personal viewpoints opinions etc is simply unwise when it comes to things like sports or movies areas in which i have lots of knowledge and have spent lots of time thinking about i am very confident in my own abilities to accurately synthesize the wealth of information available and come to a conclusion so let follow the sports example since there actual numbers and stats that are relevant to the discussion the two things i use to judge a player are how good they appear to be when i watch them and then the consistency and degree of their performance the number of super bowl rings is borderline irrelevant to me especially in football since it such an intensely team oriented sport giving one of the 22 starting players of a team all of the credit or all of the blame for success or failure just seems kind of silly now if you are arguing greatness i think your line of logic has a better chance of holding up since greatness has more to do with legacy and impact and popularity best simply means most skilled and i do not see how you can watch emmitt smith and barry sanders play and come away thinking that smith was more skilled obviously he was a great rb in terms of stats and accomplishments you could argume that he was the greatest but he also had maybe the best offensive line of all time a very solid qb and very very good defenses barry sanders on the other hand never had a defense or supporting offensive cast anywhere near the same stratosphere as emmitt smith and he still put up better numbers now i guess if you want to blame barry sanders for not being able to block pass and play defense that fair enough but that sounds like a silly argument to me if you are ignorant about the subject matter or just plain lazy in terms of how much effort you want to put into thinking about something i can understand how more rings better might make sense but ultimately it betrays your lack of knowledge on the subject ,1,movies
tinoynk,gun to my head i have to say i prefer the wire and think it does more impressive innovative and unusual things but man when i watch sopranos episodes from the season 2 4 peak i have a hard time believing the fact that there ever been better tv but ultimately they are just so vastly different on almost every level outside of the fact they are both about crime in terms of content the wire is sprawling and very macro while the sopranos ultimately comes down to the psyche of its main character and how he perceives and interacts with he world around him the sopranos is also very cinematic with dream sequences and non digetic music and fancy tracking shots and the like while the wire is obviously almost documentarian in its style however the sopranos clearly has the better performances even besides gandolfini just about every major character except aj fuck him is perfectly played ,18,TheWire

tinoynk,it really is such an interesting and unusual movie it really does not surprise me that many people feel underwhelmed by it but what me and many others who do love it respond to is really just the impeccable honesty of the script which might not being something everybody looks for and responds to i have a lot of friends who judge a movie based on what happens in it basically it seems like they can read a wiki summary of a movie and tell whether they would like it or not so while the content of moonlight might seem like run of the mill weepy oscar bait being about a poor gay black kid with a crackhead mom it actually manages to handle and address these issues in a way that is not manipulative remember crash and feels 100 rooted in the character as we know him for a lot of people this probably does not mean much but for me it such an invigorating and captivating experience especially coupled with such beautifully textured imagery and photography ,2,movies
tinoynk,movies these days especially big budget types almost never have opening credits any more ,2,movies
tinoynk,i was absolutely blown away by the honesty and beauty of the movie on paper a movie about a poor gay black kid with a crackhead mom sounds like such trite cliche oscar bait and while the script does address these things it does it in a way that actually feels genuine rather than manipulative manchester by the sea has this element as well and both scripts absolutely knock it out of the park imo any reason in particular the 3rd act fell flat i feel like the fact that the movie changes gears might make it a little hard to adjust to each chapter maybe it was hard to get back into it tonally or something ,14,movies

tinoynk,i have only seen one comment here make this point but it probably the most important outside of always calling zone make absolutely sure that you wait for the offense to call their play before calling your defensive play so you can see their personnel the number of runningbacks tight ends and wide receivers they will have on the field for that play if they have 4 wr on the play and you have your base defense only 2 cornerbacks you are going to have linebackers and safeties covering wr which will end poorly make sure to call a nickel play adding 1 extra cb when they have 3 wr a dime play adding 2 extra cb when they have 4 wr and a quarter adding 3 extra cb when they have 5 wr if you are playing somebody online and you see that they are almost always passing the ball even out of 1 2 wr sets which can happen you can err on the side of almost always calling nickel or dime or calling dime when they have 3 wr rather than 4 i also like to run a 3 4 defense and user control one of the olb into coverage or qb spy pressure usually by changing their assignment from a blitz to zone coverage it leaves you more vulnerable to the run but in my experience admittedly only playing draft champions just about everybody passes all the time ,2,Madden

tinoynk,when it comes to the intersection of macro sociology and individual responsibility there clearly a lot of gray area but i usually find it unreasonable to expect somebody to completely defy the mainstream conventions of whatever their environment is especially when their environment is as ideologically homogenous and economically limited as the kind of countries where terrorist groups can thrive even in places like the deep american south people still have access to real history books and opinions besides their own again it would be hard for me to expect somebody who lives in a small conservative southern town to completely and immediately eschew the beliefs of their cohorts but at least they do have reasonably accessible avenues to do so as for your point about fear of muslim terrorists you are completely correct that the extent the right uses it to galvanize their base is disgusting and much of it is based in nothing more than pure racism as for your last point i would have to personally disagree but i live in manhattan which not only is more likely to be a target of international terrorism than maybe any other place in the country but the kind of right wing nutjobs you see shooting and blowing stuff up are almost nonexistent here but for those living in say rural pennsylvania you probably have a good point ,1,politics
tinoynk,that might be a function of the fact that liberals in america all by default already recognize right wing extremism as a major issue on the other hand many on the left seem to be okay ignoring a multitude of the same issues many of which are far worse that exist in many muslim countries i would also have to argue that while right wing extremism is in a vacuum as vile as anything coming from any other source the real world examples of their actions just pale in comparison to 9 11 the london subway bombs paris in 2015 madrid in 2004 etc i would also have less of an issue making a complete equating of the two if any of the right wing terrorist attacks came from anything that could even be remotely construed as a legitimate organization brevik roof mcveigh the laundry list of abortion center attackers none of them were part of any sort of al qaeda al shabab al nusra boko haram style group if anything i would contend that while terrorism is more prevalent amount muslim groups it more justified than terrorism from right wing groups or at least understandable sympathetic i can understand the thought process of a kid from wartorn afghanistan getting drawn into a jiadhi group they do not have any other context in which to put their experiences of american military presence other than the invading american devil and all the people they trust tell them that the invading american devils are not human and need to be killed though my worldview and experiences have led me to believe that murder is wrong mine is one based on education and the internalization of a vast variety of opinions and viewpoints which i use to shape my ideas about the world around me and these are opportunities not afforded to most of the people who end up as the footsoldiers of jihad on the other hand guys like roof and brevik and mcveigh had all the opportunities to learn and grow and try to understand things about the world they live in they may have been raised by and around people with similarly extreme views but they still had the internet and they still had a secular western education but even with these opportunities they still thought it necessary to murder a bunch of innocent people so if anything my thought process might actually excuse actions of muslim terrorists while condemning similar actions made by members of the political right even more than most ,3,politics
tinoynk,so because russians and ugandans are homophobic but not muslim that means that we should not pay any attention to injustices in the muslim world i completely understand and agree with the fact that there are many people who hide behind claims of social justice when really they just want to promote hate against brown people who seem different from them but that does not mean that any criticisms of problematic policies and philosophies from the muslim world are automatically bigoted and islamophobic ,2,politics
tinoynk,he does target islam but how many countries have codified laws centered on regressive christian buddhist or jewish tenets i am sure there are examples here and there but even the outright illegality of abortions or gay marriage pales in comparison to the widespread acceptance of stuff like honor killings and executions for adultery or homosexuality not to mention the denial of even the most basic rights for women leaving the house alone driving etc for somebody who pet issue is being anti religion can you think of another religion more deserving of such ire maybe you can and i will gladly admit i am wrong if you can think of one and as far as the terrorism thing goes sure there been more than a handful of white racist nationalist terrorist attacks mcveigh brevik roof etc but it would be hard to deny that global terrorism in general especially of the organized variety in the last 20 years has been defined by anything but jihadi groups it does not mean that they are terrorists because they are muslim but there clearly systematic issues that contribute to the current trend of jihadi violence many of these issues are rooted in a lack of education and economic and political stability in many of these areas but such issues are only exacerbated by the hyper religious environment in such areas ,5,politics

tinoynk,i cannot stress this enough focus on hitting earlier than pitching you can still get ace ish caliber pitchers in the 3rd 4th rounds but all of the elite hitters are gone by then i almost always take hitters with my first 2 picks get an ace with my 3rd and then how i proceed from there depends on how the rest of the league is going but overall you are much more likely to find startable pitchers on waivers than you will be to find legit hitters also if you are in a league where you set your lineups every day it really behooves you to use almost all of your bench spots on pitchers this helps you stack up k and w and stash more possible studs ,4,fantasybaseball

tinoynk,it impossible to avoid the fact that tarantino films rely heavily on borrowing elements from the films and media that shaped and influenced him to a point that people accuse his work of being derivative clearly blaxploitation cinema is a major influence with the esthetique du cool you describe being a highly recognizable link however i have to reject the premise that his construction of characters can be attributed to a wholesale ripoff of blaxploitation tropes though almost every aspect of his films is indeed an amalgam of old references tropes etc he draws on a far wider pool of inspiration than you seem to be implying it also seems like you might be equating a degree of coolness with blackness butch coolidge is definitely cool as hell but unless you consider being cool and self assured an inherently black trait i do not see how that supports your premise i also do not necessarily think that the character coolness is any more reminiscent of blaxploitation cinema than the kind of hard boiled pulp fiction or films noir that directly inspired the movie the same thing goes for vince vega if anything maybe you should be condemning elmore leonard for imbuing his characters with exactly the kind of esthtique du cool that you are talking about as his dialogue style is usually considered the most direct antecedent to tarantino ,7,TrueFilm

tinoynk, and i as a canadian only see guns as death machines and believe my right to walk around freely and not feel threatened that joe blow should be able to carry a gun the point is rights can be subjective although i agree that basic human women rights should not be subjective oh i am basically 100 with you on the gun thing but if anything that speaks to my point that just because something is the law of the land does not mean that it valid or should be followed also guns in america is a thing you have to opt in to rather than a mandated behavior like wearing a certain article of clothing sure you are statistically more likely to get shot in american than canada but it is not like by stepping onto american soil you are actually putting yourself at dire risk to get shot or that it now your right as an american to be shot on the other hand by stepping onto iranian soil a woman gives up her right to dress how she chooses again guns are a stupid thing that small dicked americans need to feel useful while the right to wear what one wants is a right apples and oranges here ,1,news
tinoynk,your pragmatic argument is a fair one and if it was my job to foster good relationships with iranians i would do whatever was necessary because that my job and i cannot blame anybody for doing their job to the best of their abilities though that depends on the job i suppose but diplomacy would not necessarily be an exception i am not necessarily tearing into these specific women as i am decrying the fact that they would even feel the need to do this in the first place let alone the possibility that they would prefer to not wear them and to compare gun ownership to the right to not have to cover your head with a towel is ludicrous guns are a tool that we americans see as useful enough to treat as a right but i do not see any fundamental universally objective reason this needs to be the case on the other hand demanding specific groups of people dress a certain way is absolutely a deprivation of a fundamental right ,1,news
tinoynk,because sw and marvel gives us characters we care about sam worthington is just such a blank boring slate of nothing we have no reason to give a crap about any of the admittedly impressive visuals outside of the fact that they are just cool to look at and that they provide a fun ride people latched onto marvel because even besides the charisma of rdj as tony stark they made sure that all of the characters are thoroughly fleshed out they all have very different personalities motivations etc and are almost universally well portrayed ,0,movies
tinoynk,i am not asking the women to burn a koran and eat baby back ribs in front of iranian diplomats i am just expect them to be afforded the right to not wear something they do not want to especially since the symbolism of the hijab is that of dehumanization and theft of agency identity and i will treat anybody with respect provided they show respect let say i am at an obligatory family function with family members who are homophobic or racist luckily i do not have many of these i wo not go out of my way to needle them on said views but if they bring them up and i am in a position to respond i see no reason to treat such ideas with anything other than scorn and ridicule i avoid impugning the individuals themselves and stick to focusing on their beliefs and ideas and when people believe such unambiguously terrible things as wholesale bigotry i do not see how this approach is problematic ,1,news

tinoynk,there is the practical reason of being able to use cuts and edits to cover up forgotten lines botched blocking etc however the reason why most films have the editing they do is that it often as easy if not easier to convey something specific to a viewer by using editing an editor may choose to show a reaction to dialogue or action instead of the dialogue or action itself or choose one shot over another and this is almost always in service to whatever the editor and director want to communicate you should check out walter murch in the blink of an eye though some of the chapters are specifically about technical aspects of editing most of it is about the theory of editing it really a great way to understand the purpose of editing and how and why it can be so effective ,24,TrueFilm

tinoynk,i have no disagreements with simon thesis as with everything else in the series it relevant prescient and accurate but the fact is there just far less moral gray area in the journalism storyline than the rest and moral gray area is what makes the wire so fascinating in the first place it just not quite as compelling in terms of tv viewing because it so conventionally framed in terms of good guy bad guy when the rest of show has trained you not to be thinking in those terms ,1,TheWire
tinoynk,the protagonist is indeed almost always the good guy especially in mainstream american films but would you consider michael corleone a good guy that probably a fairly sizable exception but still illustrates my point that from a pure screenwriting perspective the character with the goal and arc is technically the protagonist regardless of their moral standing or our approval of their actions ,1,Screenwriting
tinoynk,this is an interesting case because i think you can view jake as the protagonist since it his arc and he has the most screentime but the entire movie hinges on alonzo so though supporting he also in some ways the main character protagonist and main character are usually synonymous but this is an instance where i think interesting arguments can be made in either direction ,1,Screenwriting

tinoynk,if anything he gets way too much credit for being cerebral and intelligent people see big twists and omgz we are in dreemz or some weepy backstory and apparently think that sufficient as a basis of subtext for the record i enjoy all of nolan movies largely because he has such a great eye for spectacle and really knows how to give events considerable gravity but the first thing that takes me out of his movies is the mediocre dialogue which all sounds the same regardless of the character delivering it and the fact that his characters are constantly explaining things directly to the audience these are two of the biggest cardinal sins of screenwriting and as his profile and popularity has increased i think these issues are actually becoming more and more glaring the dialogue is usually delivered by great actors and they are always able to sell it and as i said before he so good at constructing a massive distracting spectacle that you might not notice the sloppy writing the first time or two around but it really is an issue of his i also feel like he preoccupied with blowing our minds rather than letting a story develop organically from well constructed characters i am really looking forward to dunkirk since the nature of the story might let him rely on his natural strengths ,11,movies
tinoynk,is that really an unpopular opinion it got a 79 on rotten tomatoes which is definitely solid but for a prestige y biopic with an oscar winning performance it could definitely be higher i have not seen it but that largely because a lot of the people and critic i like and usually agree with seemed to agree that it was pretty trite and shallow a more unpopular opinion would be that the imitation game is not really all that good the performances are good but everything is so shamelessly hollywood y even to the point they shoehorn in what is basically a romance subplot and while this could be an interesting development they do not explore any of it ,2,movies

tinoynk, american beauty is overrated it well acted and it looks great but i cannot get on board with a single thing the movie is trying to say if kevin spacey character was portrayed as the immature brat he is i would have a much easier time but the movie seems to expect us to legitimately sympathize with him and root for him when he just having an incredibly run of the mill midlife crisis and then it also expects us to see wes bentley character a high school hipster who seems to have just found a philosophy 101 textbook as some sort of enlightened spiritual genius who really know how it is man i understand how in 1999 this stuff would have seemed fresh or original but at this point the whole rich suburbanites can be sad too thing is a horse that been beaten dead long ago i also think that the extremity of requiem for a dream ends up completely undercutting any message it wanted to tell ,1,movies
tinoynk,it not perfect but it is pretty great i think the fact that it so small kind of underwhelms people who go in expecting some sort of mind blowing transcendent experience but for what it is it an absolute home run personally my only real issues were that some of the dialogue is a little on the nose but it all very well written does sound like it genuinely comes from the characters and is all very relevant and ties in with the themes of the film so it not a serious gripe what is great is the writing of the characters the socio economic subtext and the way the information and exposition is doled it in particular ben foster character is just mesmerizing at first he seems like a generic loose cannon extrovert brother character which we have all seen a billion times but he actually makes that type of person seem so real and never like a contrived movie character i am also a sucker for intelligently supplied exposition and plot and this did that perfectly so many movies especially those about criminal plans and schemes have the characters explain things they already know solely for the benefit of the audience stuff like this always takes me out of a movie so to have the brothers plan unfold so organically was really invigorating and the performances are absolutely unimpeachable all around ,1,movies
tinoynk,it not bad but it very very different there definitely humor and laughs throughout the whole series but there a lot more blatantly joke y stuff in the 5th and it actually most effectively viewed as a straight up satire but the last 2 3 episodes the finale in particular are absolutely amazing i have always found the finale to be basically perfect which is impressive given the challenge of wrapping up a story of this scope and complexity my main gripe of the season outside of one particularly absurd storyline is that due to the focus on journalism the industry institution david simon is actually a part of it loses a bit of the objectivity that makes the rest of the show so great the main journalism story is still interesting but there an explicitly clear good guy bad guy dynamic at play this goes against one of the major strengths of the series which does use characters like rawls and stringer and royce as obstacles and in some instances frame them as villains but even then we are given reasons to understand and sympathize with their decisions and actions in the case of the bad guys in the journalism storyline it clear that simon has nothing but contempt and disrespect for them ,3,TheWire

tinoynk,my original point is that nolan films are generally self serious and any humor is few and far between cherry picking a few instances across his entire filmography does not change the fact that every single one of his films has a seriously dire tone throughout and his ability to convey gravity is one of his strengths so i am not even really intending it as a major knock on him it just an observation i guess i regret using hyperbole i will make sure in the future to account for a certain intellectual density ,0,movies
tinoynk,so in order to make any statement about any filmmaker i need to make sure to not use any hyperbole exaggeration or generalities i figured we were all intelligent enough to be able to understand these concepts but apparently not if somebody says that spielberg is a warm and sentimental filmmaker would a reasonable response be oh well munich is very gritty and emotionally cold so he not warm and sentimental this is a literally 1 to 1 analogy here if your answer is not yes you do have the capacity to grasp what i am saying not sure why that eluded you and everybody else this long ,1,movies

tinoynk,every single one and i have enjoyed them all but they are all very dour and self serious i was probably a little hyperbolic saying that he the most humorless because darren aronofsky does exist after all but i cannot see how anybody could believe that nolan films are not generally devoid of levity and there are instances of humor in his filmography but the guys made about 16 hours of film it would actually be impressive if he did not manage to sneak a few jokes or laughs in there i mean inception has that one part where jgl sneaks the kiss from ellen page and it gets a laugh but i think that literally the single moment of inception that is not incredibly serious and i am sure there a good chinese food restaurant in wisconsin maybe even 2 but it does not mean that wisconsin has good chinese food ,1,movies

tinoynk,much of the show is of the same quality as the wire but it completely different the sopranos is focused on more individual level psychology while the wire concerns itself with institutions on the macro level it also far more cinematic replete with montages and non digetic music and flashbacks and dream sequences rather than the documentary style vibe of the wire but still a must watch series and the only thing that rivals the wire ,21,TheWire
tinoynk,shit like this is why all reasonable people need to stop coddling these medieval magic believing morons and call them what they are it would be great if every religious person could believe what they do and not let any of that spill over into other aspects of their lives if every religious person did that i would have no problem with any of it the problem is when the stakes of a particular belief system is literally the fate of the universe and the ultimate showdown of good evil silly things like the science and economics and environmental policy and the constitution take a backseat and that is not a flaw of certain religious people it a necessary aspect of being religious it really just a simple fact that if somebody believes in magic which let be real is a necessary part of most religions their entire worldview is fundamentally compromised and jeopardizes the well being of the entire world ,7,news

tinoynk,if there is a difference that difference condemns the white ones there never any circumstance where harming innocent defenseless people is acceptable but i can at least understand why somebody born and raised in a wartorn unstable region could get wrapped up in the dominant ideology of their region and get manipulated to think that the problems of his region are the fault of the west and to act on that i do not think one would need to suffer from any type of serious mental illness to make such a leap however if you are from an economically and politically stable area ie the america where you suffer from no oppression and have the ability to learn about the world and expose yourself to a variety of opinions and ideologies and you still feel the need to go gun down a few dozen people i cannot see how such a leap could be made by somebody without drastic mental health issues ,6,politics
tinoynk,violence with the intent of achieving a political goal is terrorism regardless of the motivations or backgrounds of the perpetrator i have also seen a lot of people decrying the double standard of white terrorists being unhinged crazy while foreign terrorists like jihadis are just coldhearted caluclating terrorist masterminds while there is a lot of problematic racial coding involved i do think that there a real distinction at play here many jihadis not necessarily the ones calling shots though come from unstable and ideologically homogenous places for somebody born and raised in such an environment i do not think it would take a whole lot for a chemically balanced person to commit horrible acts in the name of an ideology they have never had challenged and in the context of a life full of struggle struggles which could be easily blamed on the west on the other hand though i do not know the life story of dylan roof or anders brevik i have to imagine that their lives and backgrounds were generally normal or at the very least stable if somebody is raised in a politically and economically stable society surrounded with opportunities to learn about the world and made aware of our society intolerance for unprovoked violence and they still feel the need to kill a bunch of innocent people i think it very reasonable to consider that there something legitimately wrong with their brain chemistry but before you hammer me for endorsing the media portrayal of white terrorists as isolated incidents and jiadhi terrorism as a systemic issue consider the fact that my point could also be read as sympathetic of jihadi psychology while completely disregarding the legitimacy of any motivations held by white terrorists so at the end of the day i will probably have pissed everybody off ,4,politics
tinoynk, how does a person artificially limit a question what is artificial about it his point is that by restricting the metric at hand to terrorist organizations rather than all terrorist acts including lone wolfs the resulting data would be skewed in a direction that clearly reinforces your previously held belief as to your main point it is true that worldwide there are more people groups and money going to groups using violence to advance political goals aligned with islam than there are aligned with christianity right wing ideologies so that a very careful way of me agreeing that there is indeed more islamic terrorism than christian right wing terrorism and personally as a resident of nyc i am more concerned about jihadis but that because i live in a place that actually matters aka not some shitty flyover state where the highlight of your town is a 24 7 wal mart and because the only trump voters here are the wall street types that actually should have voted for him rather than country yokels who think mexican islamic abortions are the reason their shitty manufacturing job does not exist anymore however despite my personal concerns since 9 11 these groups have not posed any kind of a consistent threat especially none that is demonstrably different from any other type of terrorist threat sure there was san bernardino and orlando but the degree to which they were connected with a broader network is debatable at best which speaks to your focus on organizations and ultimately the volume and scale of these attacks is comparable to attacks like charleston and the canadian mosque and the various abortion center attacks that have occurred over the years now maybe you want to say that we are just lucky that we have not had attacks like nice or paris but i would argue that a large reason islamic terrorism is not as big a problem here as it is in europe is exactly the pluralistic elements that right wing terrorists like brevik and dylan roof see as something to be extinguished to be considered english or french there centuries and centuries of history and pomp and circumstance you need to live up to and an immigrant can never do that but america is a nation built on assimilation to be american just throw on some jeans crack a shitty lager and watch some football boom you are part of the crew also i would posit that christian right wing terrorist groups are not as developed as jihadi groups for the simple reason that their lives are not as bad for most jihadi terrorists they come from destitute wartorn regions where they have seen every attempt at sovereignty countered by western colonialism that a damn good way to become radicalized to the point of violence but as much as white christian right wingers bitch and moan most of them are doing just fine the ones who do lash out are almost certainly mentally imbalanced but that because you would have to be legitimately insane to shoot a bunch of kids at a summer camp or a bunch of people at a church when you have all of your basic needs met and are able to exercise your political rights or maybe white militant christians are just straight up pussies who cannot walk the walk and stick to their 4chan message boards ,2,politics
tinoynk,i felt this way after the first 2 seasons but the last 2 really pushed into that very top tier of tv for me ,7,television
tinoynk,i thought it was good until the confusingly abridged last season but for some reason it never seemed as good as the sum of it parts which were all great the cast and performances were all unimpeachable the set design and production value is fantastic the characters are layered and the plots are always complex and reflect things going on within the characters but for some reason i rarely felt any level of visceral emotional investment and i felt with shows like the sopranos or the wire or breaking bad but the last season was really just a travesty the best thing about the series is that it took it time so carefully and deliberately to construct this tapestry of characters and storylines so to give them all an incredibly rushed sendoff was just embarrassing ,5,movies

tinoynk,the number 1 rule is to always have at least as many cb as wr if they put out 3 wr run a nickel 4 wr run a dime 5 run a quarter if they have a good receiving te you may want to add an extra cb in possible passing situations man coverage also does not work so stick to varieties of zones and this is pretty cheap but very effective in draft champions but i always run a 3 4 with a lb corps of speedy 4 3 coverage lb and then drop both olb into coverage nearly every play while user ing the lolb with this lolb you can spy rush or cover depending on what your opponent is doing this only leaves the de as pass rushers and it incredibly vulnerable to the run but since dc players pass like 95 of the time it usually fantastically good money ,1,Madden

tinoynk,the most important thing when calling plays on defense make sure to wait for the offense to call their play after which you can see their personnel how many rb te and wr they have in the play make 100 sure that you always have at least 1 cb per wr if the offense has 3 wr choose a nickel play and if they have 4 wr choose a dime or quarter play if you only have 2 cb on the field and the offense has 3 wr one of the wr will be covered by a lb or s who are usually not good at coverage and you will get easily burned also if they have a great receiving te you may want to consider him a wr though if they are smart about mixing up the pass run it can be incredibly difficult to deal with these type of te ,1,Madden

tinoynk,cheeto did not purport to hate white people he purported to hate white suprecemacists now given the fact that this basic concept has eluded you for the duration of your life this may be hard for you to follow but give it a shot nobody chooses to be white or black therefore it unreasonable to think less of another person for their whiteness or blackness that called prejudice and it wrong however people who do think less of others due to their skin color make that choice consciously they were not born that way and they can change that belief to look at somebody like this and make a judgement of their character due to their belief that skin color has anything to do with intelligence moral standing right to equality etc that is not prejudice there no pre judging there just judging and it a judgement based on pretty clear cut and relevant facts i do not however include religion in this model because if you want to believe in magic that on you it pretty simple shit i guess people who think calling out racism is racism do not really have the critical thinking ability to take their trains of thought more than one station past the terminal but i really gotta implore you to try it some time we have brains for a reason use it ,2,nyc

tinoynk,i do not think his instincts or points about journalism were incorrect but there more of a clearly defined good guy bad guy dynamic within that particular institution while the other institutions were all portrayed with varying shades of gray and that lack of moralizing is one of the things that makes the wire so interesting it true that they do make clear that the motivations of templeton and the chief editor are for career advancement which is understandable and relatable but they still feel like characters specifically constructed to make a point on the other hand somebody like bill rawls starts off as that kind of one note antagonist obstacle but by the end of the first season he been totally fleshed out to a point where it actually easy to sympathize with him and understand his position to a point where one might even admit they would do the same things as him maybe there something i am not realizing that keeps me from buying those characters but they are one of the few instances where i do not see the subtlety and nuance i see in the entire rest of the series ,4,television
tinoynk,i agree that the end points of all the characters were all arrived at pretty organically the main issue with s5 i think is that simon was too close to the source material of journalism and could not approach it with the same objectivity that he did police drugs union labor schools government etc the tone is also slightly different from the rest of the series there laughs throughout but s5 has the most distrinctly satirical comedic tone with some almost straight up jokes like the psych eval of the serial killer which actually perfectly describes mcnulty ,21,television

tinoynk,i would say there are significant issues at the script level everything just feels so conventionally hollywood y i cannot imagine any viewer ever being in danger of thinking they may be watching something close to actual history and i am not a guy that cares about historical accuracy but when the writing is so lazy to hit basically every step of a paint by numbers biopic for such an interesting story and character it needs to be called out for example charles dance character is just an obstacle rather than an actual character good villains are good because their motivations are understandable but here the guy is just a dick and spurns a talented guy who they chose to hire because they know he talented for what reason eh who cares movie needs some conflict and then the attempt at having a sort of romance though it obviously is not is borderline disgraceful it really shows for how progressive hollywood thinks it is and many times they try to address stuff like like homosexuality or gender roles they often end up being accidentally regressive it does have good performances and it shot well but it really not a good movie ,33,movies
tinoynk,i was pleasantly surprised at the love for hell or high water i loved it but even with all the critical attention i did not think it would get nominated for much more than best supporting actor and maybe screenplay silence deserved nods for picture and director especially director though it would be tough to choose who to knock off and i am sure the late release date did not help i am also hoping bradford young gets it this year i loved his work on selma and most violent year and arrival has that same incredibly textured and tactile feel to it as for the bp itself i would probably rank my preference as manchester moonlight hell or high water arrival la la land hacksaw ridge fences did not see lion or hidden figures,33,TrueFilm
tinoynk,depends on the scoring format and the transaction limits if there a liberal transaction limit you can even hold off on pitching and focus on primarily streaming a competent ish pitcher with a not awful matchup should be a shoe in for a decent amount of points in a typical points breakdown so if you can just get as many of those guys in your lineup as possible you can probably ride that and a stacked offense but most points leagues at this point are good at keeping streaming from being too exploitable of a strategy ,1,fantasybaseball

tinoynk,i really have to agree and it one of the reasons i do not really like aliens despite being a huge fan of the original and the franchise in general ripley has a lot of great stuff going on and though i hate kids in action movies and newt is no exception the theme of motherhood and how it reflected in the aliens with the queen is laudable but all of the marines are just cardboard cutouts to the extent i imagine that it intentional but also does not really make their scenes much more palatable to me maybe i am the victim of having grown up in a world where these marines defined the space marine cliche and as such i see it as cliche when it actually the originator of those things but even keeping that in mind has never really helped me get over my issues with the marine dialogue that being said i do think there something to be said for the fact that the marines are initially framed as elite supersoldiers and their dialogue reinforces this but then when shit hits the fan and we realize that they are nowhere near as competent as they seem to think their bravado is exposed as empty posturing and there is some nice resolution when vasquez and some of the others cannot remember specifically who or the circumstances sacrifice themselves with the grenades overall cameron dialogue is mediocre at best i think one of the reasons my favorite of his movies is true lies is because as a comedy the dialogue actually works 100 instead of being the thing that drags you crashing down out of whatever otherwise immersive experience he crafted around it ,8,TrueFilm
tinoynk,yea that a little premature but i can see why people give up after going down 3 scores that being said i almost only play draft champions and a lot of the time if you do not like your team and get off to a shit start it super tempting to just start over and not waste your time playing with a lineup you do not enjoy ,6,Madden
tinoynk,the only thing i had that was close to an issue is that a lot of the dialogue feels a little didactic and preachy but it was still well written and hit on very relevant themes so i did not even find it to be that problematic for one the story is so clever but simple and can be enjoyed as a pure bank robbery tale or as a socio political allegory anybody who a fan of westerns crime thrillers should be easily able to get into it the performances are also pretty fantastic across the board chris pine is never spectacular but always very very solid jeff bridges is hammy but awesome and ben foster absolutely steals the show not to mention jeff bridges partner and a slew of bit roles from character actresses like dale dickey and katy mixon all great i also thought that the script was fantastic particularly how the exposition is doled out from the start you know these guys are bank robbers but their reasons for doing what they do and their ultimate plans are explained in such a natural and graceful way i hate movies where characters who know a plan repeat a plan solely for the sake of the audience and there absolutely none of that here i can understand why some people might feel underwhelmed given it unanimous critical praise despite it excessively low key vibe but it really just a great movie sucks you could not recognize it ,3,movies

tinoynk,it depends on what somebody actually means by not getting it if they are able to understand the intent of the filmmaker and the mechanics of the film but do not understand why it appeals connects with others i think a negative review is more than valid but if they are legitimately not able to understand why the content of the film is supposed to be interesting in any way then i think they should be cognizant of the fact that they are completely missing something it pretty rare that i will be completely lost as to a popular or acclaimed film appeal but when i watched tokyo story and more recently toni erdmann i was able to follow the stories and recognize the character dynamics but whatever reason these are supposed to be interesting or enlightening or entertaining was completely lost on me but my reaction is not to go and say oh those movies are overrated rather i just acknowledge that i either do not have the context or cinematic vocabulary to understand what a filmmaker was going for or maybe just was not quite in the right mood for it which might have been the case with toni erdmann as i saw it right after work without having eaten since lunch so when my thoughts became dominated by dinner options rather than the proceedings onscreen i realized that i might not have made the best decision ,1,TrueFilm

tinoynk,definitely an interesting interpretation and a great point regarding aronofsky thematic throughlines as an auteur though i feel like drugs addiction is a bit of a different case than wrestling or ballet mostly since drugs are either directly or indirectly a larger part of life for more people than pro wrestling or ballet almost everybody known somebody who had drug issues if not had them personally while i doubt most people know people in the world of nyc professional ballet or pro wrestling though it may seem counter intuitive it much easier to get away with having a movie be largely symbolic metaphorical when it about something that is not necessarily directly relatable to everybody bringing me into a metaphor about identity or obsession is so much more interesting and effective via the world of high stakes ballet or washed up pro wrestling than drug addicts because the specificity of the universe heightens the believability and i do not mean believability in a the wire or a john cassavettes kinda way since elements of black swan and the wrestler are quite heightened the former more than the latter rather in a way that makes you invested in the characters and personally i just find it hard to get invested in any of the characters in requiem because it hard to see past the artifice of the screenplay given how extreme everything becomes for everybody involved it also has the baggage of being a subject routinely touched upon by message movies and rather than playing with the the laundry list of tropes and well defined expectations that come with such a movie it steers directly into them sometimes embracing such conventions can be interesting but i did not really any of that here done in an way that i found worked ,7,TrueFilm
tinoynk,i sort of agree and disagree the end result ends up being dominated by style with the substance being quite weak but the problems with the substance or message is not due to lack of effort which i feel is usually the implication when it comes to the style over substance thing but just a misguided direction from the start i suppose one could blame aronofsky for not going further than drug addiction is terrible lets make it look terrible which is a pretty lazy thought process but there definitely a lot of evidence that everybody trying very hard to imbue the product with substance though i guess whether that matters at all is up for debate ,5,TrueFilm
tinoynk,there not many movies where i am willing to overlook impressive technical achievement because of a problematic message or a problematic approach to the message but something about requiem has always rubbed me the wrong way my main issue is that i cannot help but feel like the film is so blatantly manipulative and disingenuous and it ends up undercutting the message it trying to convey which is a relevant and important one drug addiction is a very present issue and can be almost mundane so by heightening almost every aspect to almost cartoonish extents i feel like it would be so easy for somebody to say well i love my drugs but hey i am not having my arm amputated or doing public sex acts for money or seeing my fridge turn into a monster so i am probably alright i suppose it not a good idea to judge a film message based on the way it could be interpreted by the lowest common denominator for lack of a better term but drug addiction can be such a terrible thing i do not see any reason to exaggerate anything i mean trainspotting takes a legitimately comedic approach to the subject and it still looks like an awful way to live also if i found the quick cuts to be aesthetically pleasing i may have been able to appreciate the movie more but outside of ellen burstyn fantastic performance i could not find much to buy into artistically or intellectually ,32,TrueFilm
tinoynk,it would probably just die out i also found it to be a shitty business model in the first place if i understand correctly they end up paying for each ticket bought with moviepass so the more a user uses it the less money they make as that more tickets they need to buy i am no business major but i feel like if your service makes less money the more it used that might be a problem and then you have people like me in the most expensive markets possible using it very regularly which probably did not help their bottom line but man i really do miss the glory days of 30 unlimited in a market where movies are over 16 but that was just absolute highway robbery the format it at is still a reasonable deal for my area so until they up it even more i will stick with it ,2,movies
tinoynk,it 16 99 to see a movie at an amc here in nyc so even at 40 month for only 6 movies it still way more than worth it for somebody with disposable income who loves going to the theater also there a ton of art house indie theaters here so between indie movies and repertory screenings of classic there always at least 6 movies to see even in the shitty doldrum months also when it was unlimited i absolutely exploited the shit out of it by stopping by an amc on my way home to get a ticket for something i would never see to get the amc rewards points so i guess i reap what i sow ,3,movies

tinoynk,if there is any social cultural political relevance to the popularity of slasher films in the 80s i cannot think of one occam razor would probably dictate that it almost solely a function of the success of john carpenter halloween which made 70 million on a budget of 325 000 http www the numbers com movie halloween tab summary hollywood is a copycat industry and since studios were shown that they can make a slasher horror thriller for dirt cheap and make gobs of money you had a slew of imitators like friday the 13th a similar parallel could also be drawn to the rise of found footage horror after the blair witch which did not even use a traditional film crew or cast and as such had an absolutely ridiculous return on investment ,0,AskHistorians
