nick_storm, you will quickly value someone you enjoy spending time with outside of the bedroom as well do you think a successful relationship requires that you be proud of your so for his her and proud that he she has selected you and what if you like them you appreciate them but he she does not impress you or make you feel proud ,2,AskReddit
nick_storm,i think 1 should wildesheer those things are incredibly hard to kill and they are not afraid of grimms in fact he was hoping to encounter nick and monroe grandfather even said that their presence foretells omen ,1,grimm
nick_storm,grimms are also notoriously very hard to kill ,2,grimm
nick_storm,haha nope that was definitely the final nail in the coffin that is nulliette ,2,grimm
nick_storm, if you would have told me in season 1 that i would be shipping nick and adalind i would have think that you were crazy i think for a show to be able to do this it speaks volumes of the phenomenal writers and actors ,2,grimm
nick_storm,sorry here it is i think how nick and his family trubel defeated zestorer was a bit of a reach the final fight scene could have been bigger better and more epic it is hard to believe that those four could kill quickly what nobody else has even been able to harm so i think it takes some imagination on the audience part to realize the power of the grimms ,3,grimm
nick_storm,i am small and lean and i must have fast reflexes because i can move kinda fast when i see an opportunity my defense is pretty good i can hold my own against most other whitebelts and i can hold on for a bit with a blue belt my offense is weak as hell though against someone at least as good as me i have a tendency to ride it out until i see an opportunity or tap in the beginning like everyone else i used too much strength and burned out real quick noticing this i then did a 180 and became too relaxed to the point of letting everyone and anyone get to my side control having noticed that i am starting to balance out and knowing when to be aggressive and when to chill and bide my time ,1,bjj
nick_storm, while i do not mind the time jump at the end i would have preferred a shorter jump to maybe a year in the future so that it ended with nick writing his story instead of a grownup kelly writing it i think that would have left people feeling unsatisfied about what happens to kelly and diana instead i would have liked to have seen the main cast in the flash forward nick adalind together monrosalie renard hank wu the triplets and diana and kelly ,1,grimm
nick_storm,yeah diana did not travel through that portal with nick it kinda makes you wonder how powerful diana really is that she can remember what transpired in an alternate timeline ,2,grimm
nick_storm,i think you answered 3 with 4 adalind and renard hunting wessen doubtful plus adalind back with renard even more doubtful i always took dad to mean nick ,1,grimm
nick_storm,yeah i actually think i may have missed an episode i am very excited to watch it now the story continues and i agree that zombie mode would have come in very handy and now that you mention it i really want to see what that fight would have been renard vs zombie nick renard would be so dead not sure if that a good thing or not because we see them come to an understanding and join forces in the end and i rather like that ,1,grimm
nick_storm,i actually do not remember this beat down at all could it be that there still one more episode left o,1,grimm
nick_storm,i did it not the best ending ever but i was on the edge of my seat i think spoiler s how nick and his family trubel defeated zestorer was a bit of a reach the final fight scene could have been bigger better and more epic it is hard to believe that those four could kill what nobody else has even been able to harm so i think it takes some imagination on the audience part to realize the power of the grimms ,1,grimm
nick_storm,i have noticed that about grimm but i thought that zombie mode was more of a plot hole because it looked like it was going to build up to something like a boss fight when he would use it and go berserk but that never happened also i noticed that about halfway through the series the focus of the show changed the first several seasons were about building up nick to be this badass grimm with all these extra supernatural or maybe normal for grimms abilities he seemed unstoppable and thrived under pressure and challenge then the series started having longer arcs and i noticed it was less about badass nick and more about the bigger plots ,1,grimm

nick_storm,believe it or not i did not downvote you granted i did not upvote you either training by striking a tree seems impractical to me if your intention is to strengthen your skin or your knuckles that might work but i think you would might have better luck with a sandbag sandbags are what we use in traditional wing chun while i like know to an extent and respect most of those martial arts you have listed what you portrayed in the video does not seem like any of that i saw a few chain punches in the beginning but then it just kinda breaks down into random swings and then spin backfist punches just sell it even more and then when you say you have practiced with a sword i cannot help but think of this guy https www youtube com watch v cgbe0l2zwbc swordsmanship is cool but you are more likely to look the fool than use it to defend yourself in a real life scenario i do not mean to disparage your passion for martial arts but from what little i have seen of you train it does not seem very practical for self defense all of those styles you have listed are great and can be used in self defense but try to ground yourself to the real world by boxing a little as well ,1,WingChun

nick_storm,it a good question you cannot go wrong either way they are both excellent choices for firewalls however i believe openbsd is inherently more secure than vyos or the base operating system it runs on which i think is debian the other reason is that i found editing the firewall rule sets to be too cumbersome slow and tedious in vyos consider this arbitrary example in vyos set firewall name foo default action drop set firewall name foo rule 1 action accept set firewall name foo rule 1 state new enable set firewall name foo rule 1 protocol tcp set firewall name foo rule 1 destination address www google com set firewall name foo rule 1 destination port 80 443 set firewall name foo rule 1 source address 192 168 2 1 this is the equivalent rule in pf block pass out proto tcp from 192 168 2 1 to www google com port 80 443 and when you have got many n zones that becomes n 2 rulesets to manage i know it possible to edit the actual rule set file in vyos and that helps but it still not as easy as pf ,1,homelab

nick_storm,it an information disclosure vulnerability basically there a potential to reveal the version number of ios look around in the comments for the relevant links ,1,networking
nick_storm, cisco refers to the major version as the code train eg the 9 1 train vs the 9 6 train and minor releases as the maintenance release number eg 9 1 1 note that sometimes they will write the maintenance release number in like 1 or 1a when a letter is included it indicates a rebuild there are entire presentations available just on understanding these version numbers i think this paragraph here is worth its weight in gold this alone has made more sense to me any other document i have read on their version numbers thank you not upgrading at all is unacceptable without some sort of justification such as verifying your config is not affected or using compensating controls imho if your consultants are advising you to ignore a problem you are affected by then you should likely find new consultants who actually understand how cisco releases code for the asa we are working on it ,2,networking

nick_storm, i do not know why you plugged the ap directly into your laptop plug the ap into the switch router plug your laptop into the switch router and you are done as far as adoption is concerned then you can connect via wifi easily i think you are implying that by plugging both of those devices into a switch router dhcp would assign them to the same subnet my switch router would not do that i was not really making use of dhcp at the moment so my switch is was only for trunking devices together i would not run the controller on your laptop though yeah it not permanent i plan on eventually deploying the controller to a vm on the management subnet ,1,homelab
nick_storm,yes you know my pain the trick for me was to statically configure the 192 168 1 0 24 subnet as you did except i picked 192 168 1 21 for my controller adopt it blah blah blah once that all done and settled statically configure the ap to a static ip in whatever subnet you want once you hit apply your controller will expectingly disconnect then you can change the ip address of the controller appropriately to the same subnet and it should re adopt connect easily ,1,homelab

nick_storm,my issue was that i was trying to adopt the ap without first assigning my controller a proper ip address in hindsight this is obvious i was using a laptop with one rj45 port which was connected to the ap i did not have wifi hence the need to setup the ap the controller was running on my laptop with a self assigned 169 ip address and the ap was being auto assigned an ip address of 192 168 1 20 i first tried to statically assign my laptop ip address within the management subnet i did the same to the ap but the settings would not really tick without first adopting it it was then that i tried to statically use the 192 168 1 0 24 subnet since the ap defaults to it as soon as i did that it started adopting and then applied the queued change of setting the static ip address to the management subnet rinse and repeat a few times until i figured out the gist of it tl dr make sure the controller is in the same subnet as the ap especially if the ap is defaulting to a particular subnet ,14,homelab

nick_storm,initially i was going to make my management network something completely isolated it makes sense if you think about it it critical to the functioning of the network so it should be quarantined off unfortunately i started realizing that you lose certain benefits as you do when you think about security vs convenience for example if you wanted to be extra safe you would not allow your management network to be remotely accessible at all because if there a will there a way so then you kinda lose the benefit of ipmi and networked psus etc then i realized that your management network actually has quite a bit of need for your other non management servers such as ntp ad nfs etc for example esxi can integrate with your domain which is very handy ultimately i think completely isolating the management network from the rest of your network services is overkill for my needs i would rather just put in other security measures ,1,homelab

nick_storm,i think dr erskine from marvel captain america the first avenger put it best because a strong man who has known power all his life can lose respect for that power but a weak man knows the value of strength and compassion i like to think that this can apply to more than just power my friend and i were probably amongst the few that had never had a relationship until our early 20 and now that we have he and his new gf are so completely infatuated it disgusting and i have been told several times that i am a great guy and that i deserve someone special edit formatting,1,LifeProTips

nick_storm,she a narcissist i think anything you say will only encourage her you cannot win an argument with an idiot i would just drop her completely and let her figure out what went wrong ,2,seduction
nick_storm,i kinda like it do not get me wrong i get nervous and anxious and become an emotional wreck when she does not respond after 5 minutes but it reminds me that i still have something interesting going on in my life and it feels good to know that i can still get those butterflies after all this time besides i plan my dates to have fun so win win ,1,AskReddit
nick_storm,i disagree about fighting back being a moot point now i may be talking out of my ass here because i have no real world fighting or rape experience but a lot of positions that seem vulnerable or disadvantageous are actually not so in brazilian jiu jitsu most of the fighting is on the ground you typically learn to fight while on your back with your legs wrapped around the aggressor guard position there much more to it than that but i do not want to get on a tangent i suggest bjj because i think it especially useful for women https youtu be 8hfsybg95rg because in bjj there an inverse relationship between size strength and skill ie the more skilled you are the less size strength matters but bjj is not a panacea it a lot of hard work and training and there are no guarantees i do not know your situation or fighting experience if any so i wo not say it would have helped you or saved you i just think there always a reason and a point to fight back if you are in danger ,1,TwoXChromosomes

nick_storm,sorry i did not mean to imply that i now understand or get it i have not been there i have not truly experienced what women experience constantly so i may never truly understand i merely meant that i understood a little better than i did before which was none at all also i am sorry about what happened to you ,1,TwoXChromosomes
nick_storm,similar situation i have heard about women getting catcalled and sexually assaulted at clubs but it not something i witness everyday it always felt like the issues in the middle east very real but very far away that is until i was felt up by a presumably a gay guy in a gay bar the immediate feeling was so shocking and unnerving that my brain just froze a few moments later i comprehended what had happened but by that time it was over as quickly as it began the funny thing is i could never understand how women in rape situations would not resist and fight and kick and punch and bite and do everything in their power to stop him i read an study article that explained that in these situations there is a very real paralyzing effect happening in the victim due to complete shock and fear and it was not until my much less serious sexual assault that i could understand that inability to fight back ,14,TwoXChromosomes
