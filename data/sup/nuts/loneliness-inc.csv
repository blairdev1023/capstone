loneliness-inc,if i posted what i post here over at trp i would be driven out of town for being a beta bux i elaborated further in a comment i just wrote a minute ago ,3,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,i cannot tell you definitively why other subs do what they do i can tell you that this is one of the main reasons i stick around here and not on those subs you mention the common denominator between mrp and trp is they are both populated by many men who are disillusioned they were raised with one idea of women and then they were hit very hard by the realities of life men experience a more intense pain in this regard because women have more to fall back on more people to notice them more people to care for them and the government and courts on their side of course all this is generally speaking men are invisible if you do not succeed no one cares about you if you do not make it less people will notice your absence so all this is likely to hurt men in a more deep and personal manner when the laws and culture surrounding sex and marriage become so slanted spinning plates becomes very tempting additionally men need sex more than they need commitment women need commitment more than they need sex this is why men are the gatekeepers of commitment and women are the gatekeepers of sex both genders need both sex and commitment it just a matter of who needs what more a man letting go of his need for marriage in favor of spinning plates is akin to a woman letting go of her need for sex in favor of being in a stable marriage that supports her lifestyle there are many many women like this sugar babies are the obvious ones but there are many regular women who marry men for the stability even though they are not sexually attracted to them one of the outgrowths of the sexual revolution of the past half century is that there are not any rules anymore everyone is free to do as they pleas we therefore live in a society filled with men and women engaging in all kinds of terrible behaviors behavior that ruins society there nothing we can do to change this all we can do is 1 navigate wisely 2 inspire ourselves and those who are willing to listen to make choices that are good not only for themselves but for society as well this is what rpw is about which leads to a side note the easy route is to choose a path that either good for yourself or good for society it takes wisdom to make choices that are good for both but it absolutely possible ,2,RedPillWomen

loneliness-inc,yes men will try to gage your interest before making a move we do not just make moves on anyone and everyone only players do that because they are just looking for sex anyone with a wet vagina and boobs is good for sex men who are looking for a relationship will only approach if they get the vibe that there a chance if you act in a manner that says i am closed off a lot of men wo not take the chance approaching you even though some will ,2,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,the situation you find yourself in is a very tough one and unacceptable it acceptable as long as you accept it but you should not accept it something has to change things like this do not happen out of nowhere there always a cause maybe the cause has something to do with you at least partially maybe it has nothing to do with you i do not know this post will hopefully provide some food for thought https www reddit com r deadbedrooms comments 5vyl1u infidelity all the best ,1,DeadBedrooms
loneliness-inc,my wife and i dated for two weeks engaged for 3 months married for over 10 years my parents dated for two weeks engaged for 8 weeks married almost 35 years marriages in our community tend to last and are generally much happier than your average north american marriage how do we do this 1 we do a lot of vetting before ever meeting 2 the goal of dating is to marry if you are not ready for marriage yet i am not going on the first date with you 3 the purpose of dating is to determine whether this person is suitable for me to marry or not 4 why not vs why yes https www reddit com r redpillwomen comments 5v2chd why not vs why yes how to vet for your ideal mate 5 marriage is real it therefore taken seriously if you are already living together and having sex why would you need marriage anytime soon bottom line is if your goals are crystal clear before you start dating you can do it in a few months there so reason you need to date so long before deciding unless you just like being indecisive unfortunately today it popular to be indecisive in this regard ,6,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,the idea is correct man as a giver woman as a receiver i will point out a few examples where you can see this 1 the most obvious being in reproduction a man gives semen which is received by the woman to create a child 2 the leader gives ideas plans directives etc which the follower receives internalizes and carries out see this post for more https www reddit com r redpillwomen comments 69pi24 the captainfirst mate dynamic 3 a giver gives 100 cents in every dollar there only is the thing itself that being given it a receiver who can stretch a dollar further a man can go out and earn more dollars a woman with her resourcefulness can stretch the existing dollars much further 4 a giver gives the dry essence of something semen is the essence of the baby an idea is the essence of intellect a directive is the essence of what needs to be done a receiver expounds on the essence and makes it tasty and flavorful a woman develops a drop of semen into a whole baby develops raw ingredients into a tasty meal and develops a simple directive to be better than it could have ever been on its own there are more examples but these are on my head at the moment ,2,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,a year and a half is more than enough time to get to know someone well enough to marry and move away with them it normal to have jitters you just need to determine whether it jitters or red flags only you can make that determination ,9,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,there are several reasons i stopped reading trp main sub this is one of them no not every woman will cheat that ridiculous i am not saying that women need to fight this urge constantly i am saying that the urge is there it possible to set up life in such a way that the urge is almost entirely buried for example if you have a relationship that fulfilling in every which way you do not get too close to the other gender are never in seclusion etc all these things minimize the likelihood of this urge coming forth or even being felt at all but the urge is always there because it natural similar to the sensation in your stomach caused by starvation or the way the body will preserve itself these are natural however if you keep yourself well fed you wo not ever experience these things but they are still natural even if you never experienced it and you plan your life to never experience it ,3,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,i did not read the op i was only commenting on your comment as a man myself i would not try to assume what a woman is feeling during various points in the cycle i just need to know at which points to steer clear lol ,2,RedPillWomen

loneliness-inc,gas station food fills your stomach now but will case you stomach explosions later even though you can refrain from eating gas station food when you are hungry does not change the fact that you would eat it due to your natural inclination to eat when hungry ,3,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc, have i ever been in a rough patch and looked around me to see if there is something better yes i have have i ever acted on it in short you are capable of cheating if things get rough everyone is capable of cheating for one reason or another you just choose to never do this due to various reasons which you outline very good reasons i might add the fact that you will never cheat because of the reasons does not diminish the human nature which makes cheating tempting under the right or wrong combination of conditions ,3,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,i get hungry i like hamburgers i will eat hamburgers whenever i am hungry it does not in fact i am able to go an entire lifetime without eating a single hamburger because humans have free choice the idea of awalt is that this is human nature same is true with regards to all other rp tenets however we maintain our freedom to chose https www reddit com r redpillwomen comments 615jm7 nature and the freedom to choose certain things will increase or decrease the temptation and likelihood of someone cheating men and women cheat for different reasons but whatever the reasons are just because we can choose not to does not mean it is not human nature i have been thinking about writing a post on the matter when i have some time ,1,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,yes really not at all there are many men like this ,1,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc, do not ever argue yes that what i said arguments are bad for your marriage but you will have disagreements what then i like to use the 3 text rule i will describe how it done over text or email but the same can be done in conversation as well you present your point of view this is text number one he countered with the issues he has with your opinion this is when you send text number two text number two is only to clarify whatever already is in text number one do not add new things text number three is to clarify whatever is in the first two texts that it after this it time for some space here are some rules for when you are doing this in conversation always remain calm stick to a single issue be respectful in your speech listen until the end before responding do not cut him off never accuse just present the problem remain calm do not present a problem if you are not ready for him to fix it recognize that he may fix it his way and not your way if you are bringing the problem to him to fix you need to be ready for this ,8,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,acknowledging the disease is half the cure you have found the right place start reading the sidebar especially the post about the sad sexless woman read the posts that are posted here gain knowledge instead of beating yourself up about being a bad wife ask yourself what a good wife looks like then start making small changes to get there beating yourself up is easy but wo not get you anywhere making small defined changes will just be patient nothing will change overnight and he will be very skeptical in the beginning you will have to be persistent feel free to reach out anytime if i can help ,5,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,her comments are not fair here why in order for a man to be successful he will have to be willing and ready to put in the time and effort a man can choose to take an easier route and be less financially successful but let face it financial success plays a big role in female attraction to men unless he has some other super character trait which is keeps her attracted despite his low income it important for a man to have a solid income even though it is not the deciding factor so for her to make that comment is to not understand anything about male female dynamics ask yourself if your bf was content being a cashier at the local grocery store which has more favorable hours would you have the same respect for him or would you start to see him as lacking ambition ,1,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,wow i am really flattered i know that many people like my posts and comments but this is a compliment from a different league thank you with my comment being downvoted i suspect that i may have come across as diminishing the seriousness of the issue that was not the intention either way i am with you in hoping that op makes the right choices ,1,RedPillWomen

loneliness-inc,you are right 50k is indeed a lot of money to lose and it makes trusting more difficult however what is the solution here to break up the marriage or to strengthen it to bring husband and wife closer together or to drive them further apart to build trust that now shaky or to further destroy it sure op can find justification to end her marriage over this but she does not need us for that she needs our help to mend what is torn here anyone can find reason to drive two people further apart that easy no one needs rpw for that rpw is here to offer tools to bring couples closer together and to mend such issues as per your question regarding lying i am not going to justify lying however i do know that people who are deeply embarrassed will fudge the numbers he very likely fudged the numbers for this very reason if this is the case it something he will need to correct but it does not signify a complete betrayal of trust ,5,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,you may not want to hear this losing money in a bad investment is not a financial betrayal financial betrayal is when someone gambles with their essentials to play the market not when they use bonuses to do so financial betrayal is when someone spends money in a manner that betrays the family not when it well intentioned look it sucks it no fun to have lost so much money that for sure but if he had good intentions and he did not gamble the essentials such as the house and bulk of his income then he did not betray you he just failed in this specific business venture every successful man experiences failures every wealthy man has experienced losses often huge losses i know this because there are enough successful men amongst my family and friends that i know this happens to everyone the more successful someone is the more and the bigger the losses are as well this is a test of your commitment and devotion to him it a test of your belief in him and your trust in him will you stand by his side forgive him for his mistake comfort him and trust in him if you do your marriage will become much stronger than it ever was until now if you do not it will be damaged tremendously possibly even beyond repair the choice is yours it in your hands ,0,RedPillWomen

loneliness-inc, i do not know if he can learn to be alpha since i view it more as something you either are born with and have or do not this is not true because women are born and men are made let explain that this statement is with regards to smv only that where being alpha is important for a man when it comes to rmv you do not want a through and through alpha rmv is something that both men and women need to work for women are born because generally speaking men have a much higher and stronger sexual desire and drive than women have women are the more desired gender sexually speaking additionally the features that men desire in women have more to do with the shape and look of her body and face etc these are all things she born with all she has to do is enhance these features by keeping herself healthy and clean etc men are made the things that women desire in men are not things he born with no one is born with a 6 pack on their stomach no one is born a leader no one is born knowing how to take charge or stand their ground these are all learned traits true some people have an easier time learning but that does not change that these are learned every man has all of these desired traits within him you as a woman have the power to motivate him to become all of these things you have the power to give time incentive or to tear him down and make it almost impossible for him to become the leader you want him to be let take a look at what you are doing i constantly remind him about stuff we have to do this is nagging plain and simple if you engage in this you will tear him down and make it highly unlikely for him to learn eventually he may learn but not with you if you keep this up he will learn from his experience with you his ex gf is that what you want what you need to do is not say anything allow him to fail to take care of whatever he was supposed to take care of when he says something about it simply say i was relying on you to get it done say that calmly and gently forgive him for messing up and reassure him that it okay to have failed here and there because you believe in his ability to succeed do this and i guarantee you he will be up and alert trying to live up to your belief in him this is a power that woman have over men ,7,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,i am a man and i agree i do not like it bare ,1,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,true but the flip side of that is it hard to be home when all she does is nag and complain crappy sex life i am not saying this is what happened but it certainly a possibility most marital problems take two people to create and perpetuate you will hardly ever land in this kind of mess solely from the actions of one person which begs the question which came first the chicken or the egg the answer to this question is it does not matter what does matter is this will i fix my side of the equation regardless of whether my spouse will fix theirs ,1,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc, so my question is how would you respond i would not respond someone who treats you that way does not deserve your attention delete him from your life and move on do not respond positively or negatively just move on ,21,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,becoming policewoman wo not help with anything it will only drive the wedge further ,1,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,this absolutely this op please listen to the wise ms sadie ,1,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc, i do not think i have full responsibility for that this is not about taking full responsibility it not an all or nothing you can take responsibility for the things you are responsible for while not absolving him of responsibility for that which he is responsible for ,2,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,i do not agree that it reduced that much ,2,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,that is not empathy that shaming empathy is to feel the pain of another that not what was done here what was done here was to shame op for trying to understand why her husband did what he did when she said she gets it she was trying to see things from his perspective when that called disturbing that shaming not empathy ,4,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,one of the main tenets of rpw is to take responsibility for the things you are responsible for and to not take responsibility for that which you are not responsible for one thing is clear you are hurting right now on top of that you seem confused as to what exactly is going on here you can view this in two ways 1 how dare he 2 how did we end up here with respect to the first way to view this how dare he that a very valid point to which none of us have the answer with respect to the second way to view this how did we end up here this is where we can attempt to help you based on what you shared with us obviously this is not the entire picture he out of the house a lot when he does come home the two of you do not spend much time together it does not seem like you have been a soft landing for him to come home to the sex has not been fulfilling in these bullet points i am not blaming you i am pointing out where you may have been able to do things differently i am only addressing your side of the equation because you are the one who posted here i cannot address your husband unless he posts as well the bottom line of all this is that here a man who was likely overworked and very lonely who was sorely lacking sexual fulfillment among other things all it took was for a student to be friendly to him and the temptation was too great did he have sex with her i do not know what seems pretty clear to me from your side of the story is that this was likely the state of mind that he was in it also seems like he a lousy liar who is not well versed in covering his tracks you can go ahead and divorce him but if you do not understand what went wrong you may end up repeating this again with another man this is the harsh truth there no soft way of conveying this truth please understand that affairs do not happen in a vacuum people in good marriages do not just wake up in the morning and decide to have an affair just for the fun of it the overwhelming majority of affairs are enabled by the state of the marriage and the unhappiness of the cheater sometimes this unhappiness is reasonable other times not only a tiny fraction of the population cheat out of sheer arrogance this does not seem to be the case here again none of this is to justify whatever he did this is just to understand what may have happened here ,2,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,these are very good points ,5,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc, none of it is your fault you do not know that your comment i get it is really disturbing there is nothing to get here why is it disturbing why is it so terrible for her to try and understand why he did what he did you can understand without justifying understanding what led to this can only help ,5,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,not necessarily you are right that it makes it more challenging but you are wrong if you think this challenge is impossible case in point me my wife and i did not have sex until almost 4 months after we met this was a little over ten years ago am i from a completely different generation than today men i do not think so different but not that different let also remember that you only need one do not compromise your core values because of scarcity mentality ,6,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc, i think a good solution to this is to judge our partner not by their results but their effort that exactly the point men tend to judge more according to results women tend to judge more according to effort both are right and both are wrong depending on the situation for example if you truly put in a lot of effort but the baby sat in a soiled diaper for 3 hours you would rightfully be judged by the results otoh if you put in an effort to cook a nice meal and it flopped you ought to be judged by the effort but there a lot of gray in between where he says it should be judged like this and she says it should be judged like that ,2,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,true but if we understand our nature we can understand what is reasonable and what is not we can use this knowledge to better our marriages to say never keep score at all is unreasonable everyone keeps score to some degree that why you would feel taken advantage of if you were contributing way more than your spouse that why i laid out the two methods of keeping score like a sale and like a gift we can choose to treat our giving like a gift and not like a nitty gritty sale ,2,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,converting everything into dollars is not a good idea imo this is a recipe for becoming very petty and nitty gritty about everything what you describe here is akin to a sale with a mortgage where you do not have to pay everything up front but you will then have to pay it all interest ,3,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,thank you for your input it a good mindset to have to see yourself as being responsible for 100 when both parties have this mindset the marriage usually works out well unless there are other issues however what happens when you invest 100 and your spouse only invests 30 what is bound to happen is that after going like this for some time you will end up feeling taken for granted like your spouse is taking advantage of you this is because while you were not doing any specific thing in order for them to counter it with something else it was not entirely free it cannot be it a gift and a gift comes in exchange for something just not as confined as a sale your point is a very good one ,1,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc, ,1,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,thank you for your important point it true sometimes we just need to recognize that our spouse really put in more effort than we may be giving them credit for but another thing which i did not want to get into in the post for fear of drifting off topic men and women tend to score things differently for example a man who scored a 10 000 deal today will view this as 10 000 points whereas his wife will tend to score that as one point the same as a 1 deal otoh she will tend to score changing the diaper cooking supper sweeping mopping washing the dishes washing machine dryer and folding the laundry with one point each whereas he will score it based on how long all that took so it is not just that we need to recognize the effort of our spouse but we also need to recognize that they may have a different method of measurement each way is right and wrong depending on how you look at it i alluded to this in the post but did not want to get too much off topic ,2,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,your wife has been dealing with this issue since she a child she now old enough to be a grandmother stop and think about that for a moment she dealing with this issue for 2 generations unfortunately this means that from your standpoint things will likely never get better for her she can take the reins and seriously combat this negativity within her but you cannot bank on her doing so she has about 4 decades worth of not effectively dealing with this issue behind her although she can finally get this under control it unlikely that she will if you are past the infatuation stage with the other woman and it still going well why not make her the main piece and your wife the side piece if a piece at all why are you rewarding decades of neglect there comes a point when you need to think about your own needs too your wife issues do not need to be your issues if you had little children i would understand the hesitancy to divorce but you do not have children you do have years and years of suffering is that what you want in life ,2,DeadBedrooms
loneliness-inc, if he the commitment minded type then it does not exactly matter what the situation looks like on the surface this is not true it true that he may not realize during the period of nre when he head over heels infatuated with you however we all know that this stage does not last forever it cannot last forever as soon as a few months pass you better have some good rmv because even the most blinded infatuated man will realize that you cannot cook clean or keep house this will be an issue unless he does not care about these things but do not count on that remember women own sex and men own commitment this means that in order to get sex from a man you need to have some smv this is easy for you because woman own sex you do not need to be a supermodel to have enough smv to be desirable to a man however if you want to keep him for many years to come you will need rmv homemaking skills are a big factor in a woman rmv ,-1,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,you are welcome ,1,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,okay g d willing ,2,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc, so yeah some guys will wait around make you think things are serious and then enjoy the sex when it happens but when pressed will leave when you try and get much more serious while you cannot always prevent this from happening the occurrence of this pattern can be greatly reduced let take a look at how you described what that woman did and when she felt like the relationship was serious she would start having sex with the man she was dating this lasted awhile then when she would ask where the relationship was going and wanted to get serious they would leave just from the way you described it i can tell you where that girl went wrong she had sex before establishing views and goals for the relationship some men will wait a month or three if it means having steady sex for 2 3 years after that it an investment of time and patience with quite a good return problem is she wanted marriage and children etc but she never asked him where he stands before having sex she assumed that getting serious and exclusive means ltr as in the forever version of long term he never had that in mind he had a more casual idea of ltr that only includes a few years at a time this does not mean he was deceptive establishing this stuff from the get go can save a lot of heartache sure there are deceptive people but most people are not deceptive ,5,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,you talk to him this is only difficult to do if you date for eons under assumptions it then difficult to start asking questions but if your boundaries and limitations are discussed from the get go you will have no problem discussing this as well it true that doing this will turn some people off from dating you but imo you would rather such a person be turned off early on before you have sex and or get entangled in several years of dating only to realize that you are fundamentally incompatible ,1,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,this one to each their own of course but i tend to caution living together before engagement i have heard the claim that you do not truly know someone before you live together but i disagree if two adults are honest with each other and spend ample time together perhaps staying with each other periodically or taking a trip together there should not be any major surprises we talk about cohabitation as a relationship stage but that not all it is it a commitment in itself especially financially if you are on a lease with another person you are legally bound if you live with someone breaking up is a much bigger ordeal and i feel like someone would be more likely to ignore red flags to avoid that hardship i would say personally my biggest hesitancy is that living together often muddies the waters the old why buy the cow addage may not be flattering but it still something to consider if a man has someone to make his house a home care for him when he sick provide sex on tap and cuddle with on a cold night without the risks of marriage why move forward for these reasons my husband and i agreed early on not to live together before engagement but also because we wanted to enjoy the last of our days living alone for the rest of our lives we will discuss what to eat for dinner what to watch on tv whether or not we need another deer head on the wall if it appropriate to decorate said deer head with a santa hat so we chose to enjoy the time apart while we could and i am glad we did we have lived together for three or four months now and still no surprises ,3,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,unfortunately yes if money is one of the foundational pillars of the marriage the money maker will be tossed aside in the event that he loses his money ,5,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc, so how is it ridiculously large trait if a woman wants a man with money so she can be a sahm how is it a ridiculously large trait if a woman wants a man who works for a corporation so he has stable income are you marrying a person or a piggy bank if you expect your man to provide the high value of a higher standard of living that comes along with a higher income you ought to be offering a higher standard of value to him as well that when it reasonable if you just expect to be pampered then it unreasonable ,5,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc, have you ever tried to attract better men and failed and settled for what you could get i know this mindset is very common but i will take issue with it nonetheless why is getting together with someone you can get settling objectively speaking it is not settling at all rather it simply a recalibration of your expectations to make them more realistic ,5,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,this comment is worthy of being a post of its own if i was a mod i would consider adding it to the sidebar ,3,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,if you are going to ask the question and discuss the topic you ought to define marriage as well in my opinion marriage occurs when you commit to being each other partners when you create that committed bond divorce occurs when you break this bond and go your separate ways the paperwork is legalities and each religion has its specific definition but the definition i just described is my view of a more universal idea of marriage in light of this i think there should be absolutely no cohabitation prior to marriage in a recent post i made some arguments on why having sex prior to this point is a bad idea of course there are other reasons why it may be a bad idea from a religious or legal standpoint ,5,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,that certainly a key point but i wanted you to read the whole thing because i think your issue with the dynamic stems from a lack of understanding what the dynamic is or a hesitancy to accept the necessity to have this dynamic ,1,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,i did a few days ago why having sex during the vetting process is a bad idea https www reddit com r redpillwomen comments 6cvfh5 why having sex during the vetting process is a i cannot get into sex before marriage because marriage itself means different things to different people cultures and religions additionally if you are not having sex before marriage you ought to have a short engagement period say 2 4 months it unrealistic to be in an intimate relationship for a long period of time with no sex because of these and other reasons i kept the abovementioned post more generic ,1,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc, conservative women told me as long as i followed hard and fast rules such as keeping my weight and emotions under control saving myself for marriage prince charming would come for me and i would have to be vigilant against a large number of men hounding after me what we discuss here is guidelines for maximizing your odds for success there are no guarantees in life it is not as if you ad 1 2 and 3 and you get 6 it not a math equation i have had very little attention from men and never catch interest from the ones i want even if i am always receptive to them and help them okay time for some brutal truth 1 if you got no attention from men while being surrounded by men all the time that would be a reason to reexamine how you are presenting yourself but the fact that you get very little a very subjective measurement attention from men means that at least some men are interested in you 2 never catch interest from the ones i want i hear you it frustrating to be interested in someone and not have them be interested in you however let remember that there may be a whole host of reasons why they are not interested reasons that may not reflect on you at all maybe they are not interested at all atm maybe you just are not their type maybe something else 3 your being attractive and feminine is the way you present yourself to the world and therefore what is assumed to be the way you will be in a ltr this increases your odds for finding this type of relationship as opposed to casual sex but that does not mean that every last man on earth is interested in the same type of relationship i feel like the conservative approach is not helping i am so displeased with it i want to stop trying i feel like shifting to the feminist style of pursuing men and giving sex in the hopes of gaining commitment i am lonely i am angry at 20 years old i should be better than this but i am not i hear your frustration loud and clear but it simply does not work that way as has been discussed here so many times my wife was almost 22 when she met me she was a kissless virgin at the time i was the first guy she ever dated we are married for over a decade now the fact that you have not found someone yet as frustrating and lonely as it is does not mean you wo not find someone who good for you your life is not over now that you are 20 giving away sex will just lower your smv and rmv ,3,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,you basically gave him everything he needs and wants and waited a year and 7 months before broaching the subject of your needs and wants what reason does he have to suddenly commit two tons of obligation for the rest of his life when now he getting all the perks without commitment as the saying goes why pay for the cow when you can get the milk for free this is something you really should have looked into within the first month of seeing him you certainly should have not moved in with him nor should you have had sex with him before getting his commitment however you cannot rewind the clock you need to have a conversation with him about commitment not to pressure him for a timeline of when he will commit rather ask him about his plans and thoughts on that idea of commitment marriage and children in the first place if he is not on the same page as you then you have your answer if marriage family and children are an ideal for him you will find that out by having a conversation with him in a manner that does not pressure him for a timeline the method in which you had your conversation with him backs him into a corner and that is why you got the response that you got or did not get ,19,RedPillWomen

loneliness-inc,if you just happen to meet someone 10 years older that one thing but if you cannot date men your age and have to date men 10 years your senior the questions begs itself why what is it about 33 year old men that 23 year old men do not have the next question is what do you have that appealing to a 33 year old man of course from a standpoint of smv you are on top of the world now but if you are not looking for just sex if you are looking for something long term you will need a lot of rmv from this standpoint what do you have to offer to a 33 year old i am a 33 year old man and if i was on the dating market today i would need a really strong reason to even consider dating a 23 year old woman not because there anything wrong with a 23 year old woman but because 23 and 33 are worlds apart almost as far as 23 is from 13 i am not convinced that quality men of 33 who are looking for a ltr and a family are really interested in a 23 year old woman i think there plenty of reason to not date a 23 year old when you are a 33 year old man unless he just looking for sex ,16,RedPillWomen

loneliness-inc, if you are with me that an ltr starts to make sense at around one year of relationship i am not with you on that at all this premise is the foundation upon which your disagreement is built but i do not agree that it needs to take anywhere near that length of time to make up your mind one way or the other if you date seriously in a focused manner utilizing the why not mindset described in the linked post it should not take you longer than a few weeks to decide whether this person is suitable for you in the long run or not two months is on the longer end it only takes this long when you employ the why yes method that when even a year is way too short a time frame to make such a big decision honestly if you want to wait for the third date just do it but do not expect to be in an ltr after the third date and do not expect that any man of value would wait a year before you allow him the holy grail of having sex with you an interaction that should be completely natural and not restricted by such superficial rules i am not sure whether this part is directed at me or the generality of rpw it certainly does not apply to me because i am a man who married for 10 years now i will just address one point nothing on this sub is a rule everything is a guideline ,6,RedPillWomen

loneliness-inc,thank you for explaining yourself further i can explain argue refute but that would be getting carried away so i wo not if you would like we can discuss this over pm i will address the point that pertains to dating being judgmental is part of the vetting process in dating part of suvival in a chaotic world and part of being human this is not being judgmental it using judgment being judgmental is to view someone negatively using judgment can be a positive in this case judging whether this person is right for you or not is judgment not kindness this is a very necessary type of judgment which need not be a negative at all for example if you determine that this person is not for you it does not mean that person is not a wonderful potential mate they are just not for you specifically the result of this is kindness for both of you you got there through the use of judgment like i explained above kindness and judgment intertwine with one another and balance each other out ,2,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc, kindness and compassion and all that is needed to sustain a relationship and build a family using only kindness and no judgment is how you end up with spoiled children and a spouse who takes you for granted trp is about sex and distancing yourself from feeling connected to someone to maximize sexual conquest trp and rpw https www reddit com r redpillwomen comments 67h6wf trp rpw ,2,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc, i believe what you are talking about are not exactly kindness and judgment but rather compassion and blame no that not what i am talking about i specifically distinguished between good bad and kindness judgment what you describe here is how kindness good and judgment bad the post explains how it not so this is the difference between judgment and being judgmental when you cross the street you use judgment to determine whether it safe to cross based on the speed of the cars and the speed of your walking is that judgment absolutely does it have anything to do with blame not at all it not a negative it a positive if you do not use it you will be hit by the car likewise we all use judgment in our interactions and relationships we ought to balance it with kindness as explained above and you are right that being judgmental is not good ,2,RedPillWomen

loneliness-inc,very good points i will just add it extremely rare for a relationship to be successful and happy when the woman is dominant and the man is submissive in theory it can work but in practice it hardly ever does this is why we assume the dynamic to be with a dominant man and submissive woman because this dynamic has worked for thousands of years and still works today ,1,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,judgment itself is not bad you need to judge people and situations to maintain personal safety judgment also helps you calibrate your responses to anything so they are appropriate for the situation at hand being judgmental of people is a negative being judgmental of people is when you view them in a negative light this is not necessary all that you need to do is to judge their actions to determine how to interact or not interact with them but we ought to always judge the person favorably judgment is a trait that more dominant feminine in nature maybe one day i will write a post on that edit i just wrote a post on that you cannot remove judgment from your being what you can do is to redirect it towards places which it appropriate and useful in other words instead of trying to break your nature try channeling your nature towards good things ,12,RedPillWomen

loneliness-inc,when you are in a life partnership you get to have an opinion about what you would like your life partner to wear wearing what your husband asked you to wear does not mean you are being controlled it means you are fulfilling his desires when it comes to religious standards the question is are you at the same standard that he is is there a big discrepancy between your idea of appropriate dress and his if the discrepancy is small it workable if it big it may cause resentment later my wife dresses modestly and always did i would not have even considered dating her if she did not i wanted someone who on the same page as me we are there minor adjustment sure there were but it went both ways she also had clothing preferences for me which i gladly took on because they are minor changes ,28,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,when you say single motherhood you are referring to a thing an idea not just someone who happened to become a single mother in that case it toxic g d created us with two parents because we need two parents for a healthy upbringing can a child be raised by a single mother or father when tragedy strikes sure it happens all the time but it much more difficult for the parent and child to achieve the same things that others achieve with two parents when a person deliberately brings single parenthood upon themselves it reflects their arrogance and selfishness ,9,RedPillWomen

loneliness-inc,good point but even with weight loss i would be put off with major changes too but you are right weight loss is a good thing as i said in my original comment obesity is not a body type ,4,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,in today day and age where casual sex is not shamed by society as it once was if all a man wanted was sexual release he would have a lot of fwb and ons type of sex and no man would ever enter a monogamous ltr the fact the so many men enter ltr demonstrates that to the vast majority of men sexual intimacy is way more important than just sex it true that the intimacy is more dependant upon the sex but the main thing here is still the intimate connection but let say you were right let say he sees you only as a sexual object which he uses for his release would not that mean that you are so desirable that he committed his whole life to you that pretty damn desirable if you think about it additionally all we can see in each other is skin we cannot ever see deeper than the skin that the base perception we have of one another and we try to go deeper from there in a sense every person only sees the element of object the externality of the body of the other person in this sense we all objectify each other all the time so instead of constantly trying to fight this mindset perhaps there a way you can embrace it and turn it into something positive ,17,DeadBedrooms

loneliness-inc,what is an issue for one is a non issue for another there no body type that objectively ugly there beauty in every body type and no obesity is not a body type you need to remember that the industry needs to have unrealistic women featured because the way you entice someone to buy the product is by giving them a sense of the unattainable something that out of reach but not too far out of reach if you would only buy the product you too can lookalike that woman of course this is all subconscious and happens in a split second we do not notice it happening but it influences our buying decisions this is why advertisers do it this is how they make mega billions but your man may not need whatever feature it is that you do not have he chose you remember that if he needs you to get surgery for you to be attractive to him where will it end i would say you are better off without such a person if there something you can fix by all means fix it but if it the actual shape of your body face whatever embrace who you are and enhance your god given features ,8,RedPillWomen

loneliness-inc,that true ,1,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,yes the idea that a person would choose porn over sex makes you wonder wtf when you think about it but there seems to be so many cases of this why you have to remember that we only get one side of the story here and even that is edited to reflect virtue of the writer it natural for people to paint themselves as virtuous but this means we do not have even half the real story so let think about it why would anyone choose porn over a readily willing partner it makes no sense right well if a person shuts down but wo not leave the marriage for whatever reason you may or may not agree with they stop caring about the needs of their partner they may say they care but they do not that why they will jerk it to porn at exactly the moment they see fit to the exact type of porn they want at that moment but why would anyone want to shut down there are many possible reasons you could fill a book with reasons i will just name a few possibilities i am not by any means claiming to know what goes on in individual people heads after being rejected repeatedly for years they just said the hell with it after trying to communicate for years they gave up maybe they are afraid of being criticized yet again maybe she nags him about every little thing to the point that he cannot bare to be in her company maybe he feels she too difficult to ever pleas because nothing is ever good enough for her why then does he not divorce good question different people have different reasons why they do not just divorce you may or may not agree with those reasons but they are still the reasons they do not divorce so you have a desperate woman complaining about her husband who chooses porn over her at face value it seems like what the actual f however this story has played out here so many times and the other side of this story has also played out so many times that it not that hard to connect the dots true i cannot tell any specific woman that her husband chooses porn over her because xyz but i can say that many of these stories are not as black and white as they appear to be as explained above ,16,DeadBedrooms

loneliness-inc,very good point the main purpose of staying at home is raising children absolutely ,3,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc, i do not think that phrase means that other people are literally responsible for your children there a reason that communist leaning people tend to use this phrase more often it implies that you cannot do it alone that you need the community it takes a village to raise your child ,1,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,it can be beneficial sure but it is not a necessity the saying implies necessity it takes ,1,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,if you lived alone on a farm your children would grow up just fine without daycare in fact a few generations ago that exactly how children were raised they socialized with neighboring children but 100 of raising them was by the parents first time parents are clueless that usually not the case when they hail from large families this whole phenomenon is a recent problem that exists mainly in families of 2 2 kids where the kids did not get to observe how children are raised ,4,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,two parents can raise a child without the help of the village grandparents and daycare relieve some of the burden but it does not take these people to raise a child ,1,RedPillWomen

loneliness-inc,based on everything i wrote here you can understand how money does not bring happiness it can bring fulfillment when you earned a lot of money but it wo not bring happiness many wealthy people derive great fulfillment and satisfaction from their chase of money but they are miserable nonetheless ,3,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,imo what you are describing here is fulfillment and satisfaction these are not the same as happiness those two require going somewhere achieving something etc it a movement from point a to point b and from point b to point c etc not a physical movement a mental emotional movement happiness is the opposite of this happiness needs not to achieve or have anything it about having gratitude for what you already have even if that nothing other than the fact that you are alive there no movement here only introspection ,3,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,of course you have to have your own life and your own happiness i was picking on your words because the way they were written they had a selfish attitude ,1,RedPillWomen

loneliness-inc,i was raised in an abstinence before marriage upbringing no damage whatsoever to my very high sexual desire i will just say this not all ideas of abstinence were created equal some have a very positive message behind them others have a very negative and shaming message behind them saying no to something is not inherently bad we say no to many things every day in fact the more important something is the more you protect it protection by definition is saying no to intrusion unwanted contact etc it is not the actual saying no that the issue the issue is when the message is done in a manner of negativity ,2,DeadBedrooms
loneliness-inc,having a spouse with mental illness is a life sucking emotionally draining financially costly thing there no better way to put it millions of people stay by the side of their spouse despite these hardships and some make it work better than others but it never ever a walk in the park in your case you already divorced twice but he still part of your life as if you were still married minus the benefits of being married you have only the responsibility without the love companionship and sex this is incredibly difficult you need to choose one or the other either you continue to care for him or you date other people you cannot do both at the same time having sex with many people may fill the void temporarily but what impact will it have in the long run probably not a good one much success ,3,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,any person can be happy no matter what hardships they have in life happiness is a choice material and spiritual possessions help to remove discomforts discomfort can make unhappiness easier and happiness harder removing a discomfort brings happiness therefore people mistakenly draw the conclusion that comfort brings happiness but it does not do you know any wealthy people i know quite a few i wo not say they are all miserable because that would not be true i will say that there plenty of misery and unhappiness among the wealthy and people of status having it all removes discomfort but it does not bring happiness happiness comes from gratitude when you are the recipient of something you do not deserve this is why a person will be happy when discomfort is removed because all of a sudden they feel tremendous gratitude for the removal of the discomfort but then they get used to the new normal and the gratitude disappears they feel entitled to their new situation entitlement misery gratitude happiness ,13,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,your discomfort is understandable and your fears are rational but even if they were not you should still let him know how do you effectively let him know without being a nagging shrew present your man with the problem not the solution in this case lay out what you see and how it makes you feel do not tell him what to do just present the problem and go from there telling him what to do may seem like a good idea but that will likely get his defenses up therefore that ineffective communication the point here is not to start an argument or to be right the point is to stop the offending behavior let assume that it innocent and he just did not realize that it a problem while this is not the only possibility it is a possibility nonetheless if this is the case when presented with the problem he will employ a solution in the event that he was getting a bit too flirty this will be his wake up call in a manner that allows him to save face and return to being the husband he wants to be without it turning into world war three ,22,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc, and in a good marriage the man would make his decision completely with favoring and honoring his wife feelings unless they were self destructive or something this is a loving relationship with radical trust and respect this is an extremely important point ,3,RedPillWomen

loneliness-inc,it is a compromise because you want 1 more sex 2 more enthusiasm during sex she wants 1 less sex 2 you cannot be enthusiastic about something you do not want the compromise you get more sex but do not require her to be into it this is not the same as starfish sex a starfish is when a person just lays there and would rather you leave them alone the sex they do give is done begrudgingly a healthy compromise would be for her to give you more sex because she loves you and wants to make you happy even though she is not in the mood for it you accept this gift of love even though you would prefer for her to want it too this by definition is a compromise because you meet in the middle all this assumes that you love each other find each other sexually appealing and wish to live a happy life together with the only problem being a discrepancy in sexual drive and desire ,1,DeadBedrooms

loneliness-inc,okay good anger management issues are above my pay grade 1 give him space men tend to sort out their emotions in quiet solitude intruding will backfire let him be 2 when he ready to face you he is not ready to talk yet remember that a barrage of words will scare him away and next time he will take much longer to reemerge 3 gently and softly ask if he feels better light touch 4 if there something to apologize for do so now in a sentence or two with no clarifications or explanations just apologize for doing xyz or for making him feel like abc 5 only once he settled should you gently ask whether he up for talking about it it should be clear that he can say not now but he must talk within 24 hours 6 when you talk stick to the issue at hand do not mix in any past issues arguments or failures 7 use less words men will get overwhelmed by lengthy emotional drama he likely to lose you halfway through the lecture not because he is not listening but because he can only take that much emotional drama at a time save the outpouring for your female confidant 8 state the actual problem try to avoid accusatory language stick to how it makes you feel he loves you and cannot bare to make you feel negative feelings accusing him will cause him to get defensive 9 lovingly bond via his primary love language 10 do not forget to correct whatever you need to correct ,3,RedPillWomen

loneliness-inc,you misunderstood the why not method is when you connect with the person themselves beyond the stuff they have to offer when you connect with them because they tick the boxes what will happen when someone else ticks more boxes this is a real question for most people because the why yes method will result in a more superficial connection if you are not like that that a virtue that you have that many people today are lacking when you are open to connecting with the person as they are beyond the boxes they tick the question that remains is is there a reason why i should not marry this person or why not it can be something big like a criminal history or something little like the way they twitch when nervous it could be anything or things when you cannot identify anything that will get in the way all you are left with is a solid connection to the person themselves a deeper connection than the superficial box ticking connection is it now clearer how this is not settling side note i know people who invest millions many of them employ this very method of why not to their investing they first need to connect with the person and trust what they are selling they then look for what might go wrong why not and if they do not see anything wrong they invest ,1,RedPillWomen

loneliness-inc, this came up in therapy last time i was sorta feeling sexy all day i was thinking about my husband it was a night where i work late and i planned on coming home and initiating but he was painting some trim he had installed so in my head i thought okay sex now would not be convenient but he would feel obligated to stop painting because he knows we are trying to fix our db the first thing that strikes me about this little story is this were you flirting and or sending him sexual innuendo at various points throughout the day to communicate this desire if not it may be a good idea for next time to prevent the feeling of going from 0 60 in 6 seconds ,3,DeadBedrooms
loneliness-inc,i understood your point you did not run away yet but there destructive stuff running around in your thoughts if you do not redirect these thoughts you will lose this good man 1 you entertained the idea of a backup plan when times were tough 2 you speak about your attraction being diminished when he offers to provide for you 3 you speak about losing interest in your past men when they began to treat you as a very important person vip these three things are all mentioned in your post please understand that each one of these three will destroy any future marriage you may enter i am not saying they can destroy a marriage i am saying they will they are that destructive the chase is what drives us to find a suitable mate once you found him the chase serves no useful purpose any longer if you still have an urge to chase you ought to redirect it towards your man by finding ways to continue to chase him in whatever quirky cute way he will appreciate once all the above emotions and tendencies are in check the only question left is why am i not as excited as i feel i should be i do not know i cannot answer that you may never be able to answer that either please consider this point though excitement is the opposite of stability see honesty and games linked in the last comment the idea of marriage is primarily stability it important to have excitement as well like the heated house analogy in that post but the bottom line is that stability is not exciting this may be why you are not as excited as you hoped you would be you are also nervous about losing your independence this can diminish excitement also ask yourself whether your level of excitement alone is a good enough reason to negatively effect your relationship with a good man see why yes vs why not and where are all the good men linked in the last comment ,3,RedPillWomen

loneliness-inc,1 you will never find one person who is 100 compatible all the time in every which way 2 for a man in his early thirties to be that attached to his friends and have that level of fomo is concerning to me but what do i know 3 having a discrepancy in interest is fine having that much of a discrepancy will cause issues 4 it does not matter what is objectively enough or too much time together what matters is what you need your need is not being met and that an issue 5 another issue is your refusal to accept his offer to you this type of thing can bring a couple to an impass in any area of life it the kind of all or nothing that does not leave room for compromise it okay for him to do something only because it important to you even though it is not important to him as long as it not done begrudgingly you need to learn to accept such gifts of love do i think you are incompatible based on what i read here it hard to know from one post tbh it does sound like there potential if the right approach is taken ,17,RedPillWomen

loneliness-inc,i hear you and that reasonable imo i still think you will need to be flexible on a bunch of things if you are flexible you will do okay my father suggested to me to make a list and to then chop down the list to 3 deal breaker items 3 things which are absolute musts in a partner the rest should be seen as pluses you will be happier in the end for example i came from a group of study all day every day book smart learned type of people many of my friends married intelligent women who did not have half the knowledge they had i would have been okay with the same difference was that many of my friends would not ever date a highly educated book smart woman i was among those who were not intimidated by that indeed my wife is highly learned now i know what a huge plus this is in a way i could not appreciate a decade ago but because i was okay without it it was a bonus when i got it had i expected it i would not have felt as good about my choice of a woman ,2,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,for sure they can but will they fit into your specific taste of sweet and romantic honey molasses sugar and maple syrup are all sweet people with a sweet tooth may like this form of sweetness but not that form i agree regarding dividing responsibility the pitfall here is what is fair in the book men are from mars women are from venus there a whole or half chapter about how men and women keep score differently because we measure value differently we therefore consider different things to be fair unfair again this is not a criticism it a question about how realistic your expectations are ,2,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc, movement i would not call it a movement a thorough understanding of human nature does not necessitate movement and certainly does not necessitate movement towards any one direction what you describe here is a big part of why i a man hang out around here and not over at trp see my comments on this post to u southernathena i also think that you should read less of trp and pua that stuff is men locker room talk it nsfw nsfl and nsfw ,3,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc, pro society exactly in my last comment i was nitpicking on your contrast of trp being about the male imperative and rpw being about the female imperative that would be trp vs twox rpw is pro society and pro family and pro harmony between the sexes as you just described ,5,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,points 9 and 14 the more dominant he is the less likely he is to jive with those two ideals please read sadie post a case for the greater beta for purposes of food for thought look i am not in any way saying that your list is bad or wrong those are all good things to want in a mate what i am saying is that the combination of all those traits in a single man is a bit of an unrealistic albeit possible dream ,2,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,this is a good list to have ,3,RedPillWomen

loneliness-inc,but who the right man what criteria will you bend and why and if you are making amends do not you think you will resent having settled once the nre wears off what struck me most was that you want him to be strong minded and a leader in some areas of life but to follow your lead in others i got this idea from your list did i misread if so how ,1,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,thank you very much for your thoughtful input i would agree that trp takes a turn towards immoral with its constant promotion of an immoral hedonistic lifestyle which is self centered and does nothing to better this world sexual promiscuity of this nature is considered immoral by arguably every code of morality except for the ancient greeks i would say that rpw is very family oriented a family included at the very minimum a man and a woman i would not say that geared to the female imperative i would say it geared towards harmony between both male and female imperative trp and twox and many others have something in common us vs them it like the row of little boys opposite the row of little girls in the school yard these are shouting boys are better than girls and those are shouting girls are better than boys what is beautiful about rpw is that we do not have to engage in that kind of childish behavior general acceptance that women are children i think that whoever came up with the term was probably describing how women are more emotionally driven and more prone to mood swings etc then the 17 year olds took it from there let face this simple logic if women are children you cannot get frustrated by their childish ways if you get frustrated by their childish ways you expect them to be adults you cannot have it both ways i touched on the idea of personal responsibility in several of my posts needless to say i believe that women are adults and responsible for what they say and do ,8,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,hmm the post is all about how rpw is different than trp for the bulk of the post i focused on rpw what you are quoting does not sound like it was ever posted on this sub it sounds like a rant from a frustrated man who was just hurt by a woman he loved if you go elsewhere on the internet you will find plenty of anti male rants that are just as offensive if not more so rp theory is about understanding human nature human nature is amoral see the linked post above for an explanation of amoral human nature does not treat the genders equally in many many ways here at rpw we use our knowledge of human nature to better our marriages hang around here with an open mind and many of your objections will melt away ,1,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,i think what you want is unrealistic here why on one hand you want someone who is dominant in charge leads and takes initiative etc otoh you want someone who will fit neatly into the way you want him to be these are two opposing character traits that you want from the same person to find a man that fits this bill is almost impossible and definitely unrealistic imo ,11,RedPillWomen

loneliness-inc, basically it seems to be a kink incompatibility but this individual genuinely believed they were addicted to porn and wanted to lose interest in their kink and cease their use of pornography because they had not had sex with their spouse in 4 years and it was a super mild kink at that one that their spouse has never attempted with for them wow that some serious sexual shaming and deprivation right there i do not blame them for being so into porn they were deprived of sex for 4 whole years but anyone worth their salt in the counseling world knows pornography is not an addiction the research does not support it can you elaborate on this for the non addiction specialists among us ,3,DeadBedrooms
loneliness-inc, any tips from those of you who have a spouse with mental illness my wife has severe general anxiety disorder gad and clinical depression i have learned over the years that as much as i would love to help her with her mental illness i cannot there absolutely nothing at all that i can do to help her nor is there anything you can do to help him he alone can help himself you can support and help where he allows you to help even then most of the work needs to be done by him otoh you need to be careful not to offer too much help or he will become overly dependent you want to be supportive of him in his struggle while not enabling him in slacking off from responsibility he will need to know that this is serious business and that you wo not tolerate him not taking his medication doing what he needs to do you need to convey this message through actions only never through words which come across as nagging at best and threatening at worst ultimately if he does not take responsibility for his own mental health your marriage will suffer greatly and may even fall apart do an online search on the rate of divorce where one spouse has a mental illness vs the rest of the population hint it much higher last i looked into it it a fine balance that you need to walk between being supportive without enabling bad behavior it like a tightrope i am angry and hurt but i am actually primarily worried totally legit i feel your anguish ,5,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,from what i gather many most women here have similar reasons for joining rpw when we were dating my husband said that he wants to be with me but if i did not want to be in the relationship he would be able to move on at the time i felt like he was not that invested and did not care but i later learned that he would be really broken up if our relationship ended but he was thinking logically and knew he would survive even though it would be painful for some time this is spot on it also has to do with men not showing emotional weakness but of course a broken relationship will hurt just as much for a man as it does for a woman even if he really will move on afterwards ,4,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,it did not sound like it at all your post was very well written it just could have used that added line for clarification because this is a sore point around here ,2,DeadBedrooms
loneliness-inc, you can have both stability and fun lusty adventures at the same time surely absolutely you can as you should i go on to explain how that possible the statement you quoted is describing how at their core they are opposites because one is stationary and one is movement what i explained in that post is how they are not mutually exclusive even though they are opposites kink provides exactly this in a ltr relationship at least in my experience makes perfect sense to me kink or bdsm is a wide range from relationship dynamics for casual sex to a marriage enhancing dynamic some kink dynamics involve teasing denial games the games you mentioned in your linked post but not all are like that i know this additionally willingly agreeing to playing a game is extremely different from being played the games i spoke against are of the being played variety mine is a master slave dynamic my master gets sex any time he wants and i am always excited every time he wants it i get constant commitment from him through the ownership factor for me kink is always lots of laughter always a mess and never boring because there all kinds of things to do together this too makes perfect sense the important thing that keeps everything within the context of a stable relationship is that both parties need to be very good at separating fantasy and reality i have seen relationships fail when this separation blurred as does this the fantasy reality separation is also very lousy in any portrayal of bdsm in media movies books so i guess people tend to think bdsm is inherently bad i do not really follow the media i have nothing at all against many bdsm practices some of them sound like things i would like to try some day but will likely never happen to use a home metaphor the foundation ground for my relationship is friendship not casual friendship but partnership type friendship kink is the housing structure and ltr is the gate and walls around the property i do not agree with this in this post https redd it 51oknp i explain the difference between the intimacy of friendship and the intimacy of sexuality and how they are almost impossible to live together i would love to hear your thoughts on that one ,2,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc, i hope the women here will chime in with what rpw is means because while you wrote efficiently and authentically about what trp is means you were not able to capture the heart of it from a woman view thank you you are right i cannot ever write anything from a woman view because i am a man i also hope the lovely ladies of this sub will chime in with some female perspective i did ask for it at the very beginning of the post please take my response in the good faith it written in of course it not meant to be a dig but it does directly point to the heart of male interaction and interpretation on rpw as is a current topic on this sub that was the inspiration for this post ,3,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc, solid post through and through from beginning to end definitely sidebar material i would like to add an important note with regards to many instances of cause and effect that you describe you doing x causes your spouse to react with y is not always intentional or even conscious people slowly begin to react differently over time and often do not even realize how much they are changing while some people withhold sex and affection out of malice or abuse most people are good people and do not do that ,2,DeadBedrooms

loneliness-inc,very true i personally think that the major things should always be discussed early on this way if there are deal breakers we only spent a few days with each other and we move on when we date for 3 years only to find out that we are incompatible because of xyz it that much more frustrating ,8,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,this is where religious people have a huge advantage before you ever start dating it known that both parties want marriage there are clear guidelines of what is acceptable and what is not it spares people from dating for 3 years only to find out s he has a completely different view on marriage children ,13,RedPillWomen

loneliness-inc, i think in the beginning it has to be conscious or she will send him 35 texts a day and he will freak out because she clingy when really chicks just text more i agree that much of it past the beginning stages is unconscious and i would not hold that against anyone my wife and i married over a decade ago hence my flair in the days when texting took a whole lot more work punching the numbers once twice or three times to get the desired letter we also come from a community that has social norms on these things certain boundaries and limitations guidelines not restrictions on how much contact occurs during the dating and engagement periods back then it seemed like a nuisance but the older i get the more i see just how wise the wisdom of old actually is it was an anecdote of two people stuck in a modern marriage very appropriate summation ,4,RedPillWomen

loneliness-inc,thank you i appreciate your appreciation of this it learned nature for me it feels very good to feel some success i love discussion but i have come to truly despise debate debate is a pointless waste of a hoarse voice where everyone ends up digging in their heels and no one changes their mind discussion is where we are open to learning from one another ,6,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc, i would even go so far as to say some of these things lead to the others for sure once a couple enters into a vicious cycle it can become difficult to know where it started and where it continued it takes both of you to perpetuate a vicious cycle but it takes only one of you to break it ,3,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc, then you will have a whole new issue to deal with the name of this issue is hospital visit ,2,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc, here is the context i was referring to it is still worth reading the original post thanks for the shout out ,1,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,1 ultimately none of us can advise you with regards to your specific sexual rhythm as this is something that each couple needs to figure out no two couples are the same 2 being physically dominated does not automatically remove him as the leader in the relationship especially if you are only doing it because he asked you to you can see it as you following his command i have seen many posts where women complain that their men are not dominating enough the men try to be more dominating but this only frustrates the women even more why because when he acts dominating because she asked him to he still following her instruction her desire was for him to take control and stop following her instruction 3 your current arrangement is very unhealthy due to the fact that you are apart almost all the time ,2,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc, i would agree but it does not necessarily need to be sexual in my opinion i think anyone male or female who employs these kinds of manipulation tactics in a marriage is feeling disrespect overall that might mean no sex but it also might mean no follow through when he says he will help out around the house or look for a better job it could even be a symptom of a lack of gratitude or general lack of positive reinforcement agreed gratitude or appreciation or both ,1,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc, what little and big things should i do to keep myself motivated and also show my appreciation to my boyfriend for his investment in me 1 make a daily and weekly schedule and stick to it 2 in that schedule include cooking meals for him packing his lunch 3 keep the apartment neat and clean 4 do the grocery shopping 5 leave the house right after he leaves to work go for a walk or something but always leave the house this will help you transition from sleepy lazy mode to schedule accomplishment mode much success ,19,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,what you describe is still hurt not hate i do not see how this expresses his hatred towards her i do see how what he said is hurtful to her anyway semantics ,1,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,i agree with you that everyone plays mind games especially in the beginning a lot of it comes subconsciously consciously speaking i personally have a moral objection to it which is why i never engaged in it with my wife not during dating and not now or ever did i say or do things which caused dread of course you cannot avoid it i can say that i never intentionally engaged in this i do not remember the story of lucy and barry but i do remember you posting it and then deleting it ,1,RedPillWomen

loneliness-inc, it feels disrespectful it feels disrespectful because it is disrespectful not to mention underhanded and childish to flirt with other women in front of me this is the main reason i did not like mrp when i lurked there for a while i came back to it several times to see whether it was just those few days that were heavy on this terrible advice but nope it was front and center every single time i visited that sub i think it would just piss me off exactly you and every other person with a sense of self worth encouraging me to approve mine you mean improve as far as improving his own appearance encouraging me to approve mine goes that actually has happened his motivation however has primarily been his own appearance and health as i am already big on self improvement we have to stop for a moment and think about what would lead someone to want to attempt dread game in the first place we know why plate spinners do it but why would a married man engage in this simple he is not getting enough sex and or intimacy etc when this happens the first thing anyone thinks of is i must be undesirable it must be that i am too fat ugly my game is rusty or whatever they go online to find answers and they learn about dread game it makes sense and they try it without thinking through the consequences of engaging in this in other words dread game within a marriage is usually just a symptom of bigger problems ,11,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,hi kara seems like we can always rely on you to start a good discussion thread the idea of dread is playing with your spouses emotions awareness is an intellectual thing while being aware of something may minimize its effectiveness on you it wo not eliminate it because emotions do not always follow what logic dictates besides a cunning person can always come up with new ways to catch you off guard and play with your emotions i personally am morally opposed to dread game this is why i wrote my recent post honesty and games https redd it 5zv41z rp theory in its pure theoretical form is amoral which is not the same as immoral nevertheless rpw does take a moral stance on several key issues for example rpw is very pro marriage ltr and everything that will enhance it we are also very opposed to anything that destructive to the structure of the relationship i personally think that dread game is destructive within a marriage even though it can be used constructively is certain cases i expounded on this in the linked post what do you think about dread game how would you answer your own question ,4,RedPillWomen

loneliness-inc, i have only known one monogamous couple who lasted past a decade logically speaking a kinky sex lifestyle is to turbulent with excitement to be stable for the long term excitement is the opposite of stability this level of excitement may be anti stability that what my logic would think although i cannot say for sure because i do not know enough about it thank you for the website i will have a look ,2,RedPillWomen

loneliness-inc,once again we have a beautiful post beautiful in its simplicity and practicality good job ms sadie ,3,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,you are bending yourself into a pretzel trying to explain how men and women are the same in this regard when we really are not 1 your point is that women within a very narrow and specific age group are just as sexual as men you just confirmed that men generally speaking are more sexual than women if you look in the post itself you will see that i wrote the following while both men and women desire both sex and commitment in healthy circumstances where they were not burned or scared away the order of priority is opposite for men the desire for sex is stronger for women the desire for commitment is stronger i never claimed that women do not have or cannot have strong sexual desire i did say that generally speaking this is more of a priority and a stronger desire for men 2 the article you quoted itself explains how a woman desire tends to fluctuate more in other words generally speaking men have stronger sexual desire 3 in brothels the world over throughout human history in every kind of society imaginable from the freest to the most oppressed in the overwhelming majority of cases men hire women for sex not the reverse this is because male sexual desire is far greater than female sexual desire generally speaking thus women are on the supply side and men on the demand side of the sexual equation ,1,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,you are very welcome very interesting point you raise i was never in such a relationship nor do i know any up close so i cannot comment on it but what you say makes sense logically as far as sexual satisfaction and commitment goes did do you have such a relationship for the long haul do such relationships tend to last longer or fall apart faster thank you for your input ,2,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,you are very welcome ,2,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,this is an issue i mentioned briefly in the post i mentioned that it a discussion for another day and provided two links which cover some of what is different today did you read those articles the answer to your question in very short while the sexual dynamics changed drastically over the past few decades human nature has not changed you are referring to sexual dynamics i am speaking about understanding human nature to the betterment of our marriages ,3,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,very good points ,2,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,you are right but you do not need to bash people who do not know better have other reasons for only wanting sex and disregarding intimacy you are right that this mindset reduces everything to just sex sex within a marriage when done right builds intimacy and therefore gets better stronger and deeper as time passes many people today are completely clueless to this because they grew up with having shallow sex with many people instead of lasting sex with one person this is to the extent that many see it as a negative to only have one sexual partner in your life ,5,RedPillWomen

loneliness-inc, if sex can be this profound bonding experience that hls report they need that they report is very meaningful why are they able to have one night stands or friends with benefits in their past when you are hungry enough even gas station food will do but even a well fed person will crave that hot dog or whatever every now and then they are not mutually exclusive same goes for sex i personally never had casual sex and i do not plan on ever having it just like some people will never eat hot dogs even though they may want it sometimes yes my inner evangelical is showing ,2,DeadBedrooms
loneliness-inc,is it possible for sure is it probably not at all being emotionally invested in you does not mean he will want to commit to you he a man not a woman men do not commit because of an emotional connection men commit because 1 they often cannot get sex without it 2 they believe in family values and wish to build a family 3 they want your exclusive commitment 4 other reasons an emotional investment in you is critical for a man to keep his commitment to you otherwise it becomes dry and stale but a man will never commit because of the emotional connection this is an area where men and women differ and again he is fully capable of being sexually attracted to and emotionally invested in more than one woman at a time his attraction to you and emotional investment in you do not automatically equal commitment to you ,2,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,i am familiar with steel factories and the type of people who work there it what most people would say regarding construction workers and cat calling men have desire for many women simultaneously the fact that these guys are married does nothing to diminish their desire for you while it does not justify their actions because people have agency it does explain why they are doing what they are doing men and women are very different in this regard ,1,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,1 a building will collapse if built on a shaky foundation the taller the building the more likely it is to collapse faster and cause more harm you started this from a ons moved it to a fwb and now you want commitment with a foundation like this it almost impossible to have an everlasting successful relationship 2 he 34 you are 23 this is not just an 11 year age gap this is almost a generational gap he was born into a world of cassette tapes no internet and many homes still had rotary phones you were born into a world with compact discs internet and a computer in most homes it also almost generational because at 34 he very set in his ways at 23 you are not nearly as set in your ways in short you are his sex piece for the time being yes he loves you but that unlikely to change his views on marriage 3 only you can decide whether this is a deal breaker or not your friends cannot decide that for you 4 having a ons causes your rmv to plummet it almost impossible for him to now see you as marriage material you may see this as unfair but this is still the way it is ,8,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,1 you say you do not find him sexually appealing was this always the case or is it your shifting hormones due to the baby if you were never sexually attracted to him you will have an extremely difficult time fixing this issue almost impossible many couples end up divorcing for this very reason after years and years of hurt if there some attraction that just hidden somewhere under all those hormones you ought to take steps to fan those embers into flames 2 telling your spouse that you do not enjoy sex with them is a good way to kill your marriage 3 go on birth control until you figure this out 4 it possible that it just the nre which wore off which you interpret as a loss of attraction 5 my advise to you is to fan that little spark of desire throughout the day think about sex with him fantasize for a few minutes whenever sexual desire enters your mind turn a fleeting spark into a small flame do this for a few months and see whether your desire for him grows or diminishes much success ,4,RedPillWomen

loneliness-inc,very good post ms sadie i would like to add within the way you steer yourself in the direction of how you would like to be perceived you can still be yourself how so let say you are very talkative and you talk over people you cut them off and you are condescending towards them so you work on those three things you do not interrupt you listen to what they are actually saying and you talk to them instead of at them wonderful but what about your talkative nature does it need to dissappear absolutely not you just need to steer when how and to whom you are talkative then you can talk to your hearts content it may mean making new friends and talking to more people instead of loading all your talking onto a single person but you do not have to give up talking altogether same could be said with regards to any other trait rpw is about learning how to steer them in the right direction it is not about squashing your inner self ,9,RedPillWomen

loneliness-inc,hi lexi i read your entire post and i can see you are in pain over this i will attempt to talk to some of the issues and to try to explain things from a man perspective i cannot say anything with certainty because i do not know your so i also think that both of you handled this poorly which just exasperated things let get into it 1 men naturally desire variety this is not a reflection of your quality as a partner it just that men desire variety porn is the closest thing to variety within a monogamous relationship 2 otoh women require fidelity even with the branch swinging nature of hypergamy it really one branch at a time for the most part this may be a contributing factor to your feeling inadequate the feeling of why am i not enough because you have no need for variety you cannot fathom that he does men know this about women even if they cannot always explain it in words men know how women feel insecure and jealous as a result of their porn habits therefore unless you really made him feel like it really okay for him to watch porn chances are that he will feel inclined to just hide it from you i am not saying it the right thing or the wise thing to do i am just explaining why so many men do this 3 all this is amplified by the fact that he knows how opposed to porn you are he does not feel like he really allowed to watch porn according to you this will give him more reason to hide things now that he was busted he will likely hide it better next time hello incognito shame wo not solve anything it will just push him further into hiding 4 it seems like he does not like the fact that he uses porn maybe he has religious objections to it maybe he simply ashamed of his desires and behavior therefore he expressed the opinions he expressed he very likely is genuinely opposed to porn even though he could not say no to the desire when it came to him this means he human 5 whether he has a problem or not i do not know i do not know the extent of his use his temperament etc i therefore cannot tell you whether he using it to excess or not what i can tell is that in your opinion any use is excess use this mindset wo not help with anything i understand why you are inclined to think and feel the way you do but it still is unhelpful these are just some points that jump out at me from your post again i am not condoning anything just pointing things out ,8,RedPillWomen

loneliness-inc,in my not so humble opinion no man or woman should ever reject a bid for sex affection or any other form of intimacy ever for any reason it precisely this type of rejection that builds hurt and resentment that can cause permanent damage to the foundation of the relationship i would wager to say that this is a major cause of many divorces but but but you may be saying but how can you always be up for sex affection closeness and intimacy what if i am not feeling well what if i am just utterly exhausted what if i just need space ah yes you are right but you are incorrect sure you may not be able to always have sex when your husband needs it just like he wo not always be able to listen when you need to talk we are human beings with limited energy so what am i saying i am saying to never ever reject sex affection intimacy closeness if your husband or wife makes a bid do not ever reject it if you cannot engage fully at the moment delay do not reject kicking backwards when he comes in to spoon you sighing heavily when she comes to talk to you or anything of that nature is rejecting your spouses bid for sex intimacy closeness connection or whatever else never reject ever instead say something along these lines sweetie i really want to listen to what you have to say but my head is still racing from work can i have some quiet space i would love to listen to you once my head clears then listen 100 or you are one sexy guy and it feels so good to be desired by you wink wink i would really love to jump your bones right this second but my stomach is really twisting like a pretzel hopefully it will be settled tomorrow and we will get right back to business then get back to business asap when you do this your partner will never feel turned down they will never have that terrible feeling that comes as a result of being rejected by the one person who supposed to love you like no one else your marriage will be so much better as a result needless to say if you are always delaying it will be taken as a rejection use sparingly and only when absolutely necessary ,38,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc, fear of rocking the boat fear of more rejection after repeatedly being turned away physically a person can feel unwanted they may not feel safe opening up if the ll barked back in the past or if they are the type who always right and does not listen their hl spouse will hesitate before opening up they may want to protect your feelings they may feel like they tried to communicate in the past but did not have a listening ear if the ll spouse often reacts with i am just a lousy husband wife their hl spouse will be less likely to open up these are just some possibilities some are more logical than others some are counterproductive people do not always take the most logical or productive route ,29,DeadBedrooms

loneliness-inc,i always find such posts amusing and disappointing you speak about the damage that is caused by most religions and go on to describe the damage caused by catholicism it well known that christianity in all its many forms has had negative views on sex some more negative then others but they are for the most part negative even the notion that sex is dirty comes from them but why do you have to bunch together most religions of the world together with catholicism do you know what most religions believe with regards to sex this kind of post comes around every now and then and it always the same thing op or someone they know grew up with whatever brand of jesus religion and has a negative view on sex op concludes that most religions are bad for sex do you see the disconnect there are many more religions in the world that are not related to jesus at all do not bunch them all together p s i am not arguing for or against any specific religion here i am simply pointing out that we ought to have some posting integrity here ,2,DeadBedrooms
loneliness-inc,that terrible it sounds like your father allowed her to walk all over him after all these years i can see why it drives you crazy my marriage is not quite the same as that my wife is legitimately anxious depressed and often truly incapable of functioning as an adult does she sometimes use it as a get out of jail free card to shirk responsibility probably but for the most part it legit at her core she really does appreciate everything i do for her nevertheless in the day to day i need to defend myself against being taken for granted this is how i found trp to begin with ,4,RedPillWomen

loneliness-inc,it difficult to give an accurate assessment of your relationship from here but i will mention a few points that jump out at me these points may or may not be what is really happening i do not know 1 does he know what your needs are if yes are you sure how did you convey your needs 2 you seem to be minimizing his contribution while inflating your contribution to the relationship it obvious that certain things are of greater value to you and other things are of greater value to him is it possible that you are each doing for each other what you like and not what the other needs see point 1 if there no exaggeration at all why are you still with him 3 in addition to the first two points it seems like you may be acting as a doormat at least to an extent 4 there a saying you get what you tolerate not what you envisioned while i do not fully agree with the premise behind this statement there is some truth to it which may apply to you 5 the point of dating is to determine whether you would like to spend the rest of your life with this person or move on to someone else 6 keep reading around here and you will find plenty of useful stuff read the sidebar if you have not yet you can also pm me anytime if i can be of help ,5,RedPillWomen

loneliness-inc,almost every man that i know will keep trying for a very long time before giving up of course everyone deals with anxiety and depression at some point in their lives but that is not cause for people to make statements like i did above i will try to describe this as briefly as i can without highjacking the thread i am a full time husband and half a wife a full time father and half a mother i bring in all the money do all the cooking and housework and the overwhelming majority of child rearing i have to deal with and pay for her never ending dark cloud that is always present this is not a case of hunker down for 6 months this has been ongoing up and down for at least 7 years straight now i am physically mentally emotionally and financially exhausted by her mental illness this is the brutal reality i am committed to her heart and soul i am not leaving her at least for now what i am saying is that if i ever find myself dating again i would avoid anyone with mental illness i cannot take that chance again ,5,RedPillWomen

loneliness-inc, my personality disorder unfortunately no one here can really help you with this very serious problem we are just a bunch of peanut gallery internet strangers who are in no way qualified to help people where real professional help is needed having a six month rule is a good thing i would make it at least a year tbh my wife suffers from clinical anxiety and depression what can i say if i ever had to do it again i would not enter a relationship with such volatility your bf is very accepting of your issues and that wonderful for you but he is not an infinite being and neither is his patience you are good for now but if you do not get your act together he wo not be accepting of this stuff forever he merely a mortal being i hate to be adding insult to injury please understand that this is not my intention my intention is to caution you to not ruin the relationship you have ,24,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc, divorce is the last thing i want to do good of course no one has any issues with or fears of marriage when everything is going fine the problems begin when things do not go as planned it then that the business element of marriage has to be the focus in order to determine who owes what to whom why would i even want to risk giving up this lifestyle you would not but many women do exactly that there someone i know whose wife divorced him as soon as he sold his company for x millions of dollars there are many other examples of this behavior which cause the modern man to be weary and cautious with regards to marriage of course it the good women who suffer as a result or any number of other ugly things that provide extenuating circumstances but might be difficult to prove if you are making someone pay you ought to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that they indeed owe the money no one should ever be made to pay anything just because it difficult to prove 1 my spouse does not want me working as such my hard earned education is languishing 1 that a choice you agreed to you do not have to agree to that and it certainly should not be codified into law 2 if that your agreement i would agree that you should get something in return but that something should be a set amount based on the value of what you agreed to not a percentage of his future earnings in an agreement like this everything ought to be quantified 2 it in the best interest of our child that i do not have a 9 5 job i agree 100 this really touches on a different question is it incumbent upon the husband to sustain his wife the answer to this question is the premise to much of the perspective and differences of opinion on this matter and while men are very quick to cite their fears regarding gold digging women taking them to the cleaners women have an equally valid fear and a reality that i argue likely transpires more often getting dumped when she 55 and he 60 so he can run off with a hot young 30 year old as part of his mid life crisis what then of fairness if this should happen to me and i get blindsided should then be rendered to work minimum wage because i naively built my life around the institution of marriage and child rearing or should i have lived in my marriage like a prepper does spending one life making decisions not with the marriage in mind but the worst case scenario of divorce that not healthy and everyone worse off including the kid this is one of the very sad results of the breakdown of standards in marriage i have my thoughts on this but they would be too long for this comment maybe i will write a post if i have some time in the coming days i appreciate your very thoughtful reply ,3,RedPillWomen

loneliness-inc,they would not be left destitute because they are splitting assets once assets are split why should one spouse be forever entitled to the earnings of the other spouse it makes no sense they should both go their own ways now if a woman quit work to be a homemaker and was indeed a good homemaker you can quantify this x years is worth x dollars which should be part of the settlement there should not be ongoing percentages being paid by either spouse a divorce should sever the relationship with permanence unless there are children involved ,11,RedPillWomen

loneliness-inc,i think no fault divorce is unfair all on its own that someone can initiate a divorce just like that and still have the upper hand is nothing short of absurd if the law says that fault is not a consideration in divorce proceedings then for sure there should be no alimony alimony would only give incentive to women to divorce and get alimony especially if their husband is wealthy and they are a sahm i am not arguing against all alimony i am arguing against most alimony for the reasons mentioned in the above comments ,9,RedPillWomen

loneliness-inc,if he unfairly being made to pay you cannot get over the resentment until the injustice stops if he paying what he owes well he owes it of course he will say he does not owe them anything and they will say he owes him even more it impossible for us to know who right and to what degree they are right or wrong i personally think that alimony is generally unfair most of the time dissolving a marriage should be like dissolving a business split up the assets and move on with your life unfair alimony is one of the reasons that mgtow exists ,14,RedPillWomen
loneliness-inc,let take what the first two guys said at face value in both cases the issue is them not you let take what your current man says at face value again the issue is him not you it is possible for men to lose desire when under a lot of stress that is not just a female thing if it a temporary thing that part of the ups and downs of married life if it goes on for a long time something needs to be done either way knock the self blame out of your head it is not you it them you just had bad luck to land with three such people in immediate succession one thing that really concerning right now is broken promises no matter how stressful life is repeated broken promises without any attempt to make things better is unacceptable ,4,DeadBedrooms
loneliness-inc,what i wrote above is truth that every honest man knows unfortunately there are many around here male and female who would rather not take responsibility for their hand in their own misery it always easier to pile onto the insensitive guy with the porn addiction than it is to accept responsibility again i hereby make no assumptions with regards to op i speak here in general terms ,5,DeadBedrooms
loneliness-inc,would you be able to ask your exes for the honest truth they may give it to you as uncomfortable as that is it may be worth a try this may be you it may not be you it having happened 3 times raises the chances that it you but it does not make it definitively you i would ask your exes to be honest and truthful and see what they say you have nothing to lose ,11,DeadBedrooms
loneliness-inc,i am sure there are even if we do not really hear about them around here the real question i always ask is how did he end up with a porn addiction to begin with no one wakes up one morning with an addiction it always something that builds over time and there are usually drivers of various kinds which drive a person to the point of addiction in some cases the hl man is driven to addiction solely by his own lack of self control he just lost himself in the endless novelty of it until he became addicted in other cases the man is driven to porn by the severe emptiness and loneliness caused by being stuck in a db marriage which is difficult to leave because of having small children he turns to porn because that much easier than being rejected yet again after a while he becomes addicted and no longer sexually interested in his wife who in turn wakes up and desires him again but then it too late she then comes here to ask for advice about her husband who does not want her due to his porn addiction the truth is that this woman is responsible for her own misery i do not know which description adequately describes you and i am not making any assumptions about you what i am doing here is presenting you with two very general sides of the porn addiction coin obviously specific variables are endless the point here is to give you some food for introspection to take a serious and honest look at your past and determine whether you have a hand in your current db or not knowing this matters a lot to be able to determine what to do next if you are a primary or partial cause of the problem you can be part of the solution as well if you are not part of the problem in any way there less you can do to solve this and attempting a solution would have to be from a different angle all the best ,3,DeadBedrooms

loneliness-inc, what am i doing wrong a big part of the issue here is the societal acceptance of casual sex as well as men having a serious disadvantage in divorces these two factors alone are enough incentive for men to say no thanks to marriage and to just stick with casual sex but many men still believe in the traditional family unit religious circles are filled with such men if you are part of a congregation that the best place to look it hands down better than any other place in terms of finding a life partner there are other issues inherent to specific religions though if you are not religious it will be much more difficult to find the type of man you are looking for and probably impossible in the capital of vanity la what you can do is to be upfront about your goals early on and to only get in bed with someone once you are well underway to achieving these goals ,7,RedPillWomen

loneliness-inc,several things jump out at me from the gist of this post 1 in your mind you are not at fault for anything you have a ready excuse for every wrongdoing yet he is responsible not only for damage he caused but also for damage he caused because he should have known that xyz will have abc affect when it comes to you though you do not seem to hold yourself to that standard 2 you started in bdsm as a way to give up control but in fact to him he was still under your control the whole time if he being dominant because you want him to he really submitting to your authority what you need to do instead is to step out of the way and allow him to take charge do not make him take charge 3 if you want to fix anything you will have to be ready for some rejection there no way around it 4 your recognition of the problem is a good start but your defeatist attitude wo not help you at all as long as you believe that it doomed it will be doomed believe that you can fix it and you will 5 it seems that your whole issue is almost entirely brought upon by you while i do not think you did so intentionally it was still caused by your actions therefore it incumbent on you to do the heavy lifting in terms of making changes you seem to be expecting him to make all the changes while you sit back in your armchair 6 if you want change you will have to make the changes regardless of who responsible 7 he probably too afraid to lead if this is the case you will have to demonstrate through actions that it safe for him to lead respectfully ,10,RedPillWomen

loneliness-inc,nothing wrong with not living together before marriage however if that your choice you ought to have a much shorter engagement period you can wait a few months before having sex you cannot really wait a year or three technically you can but it not healthy for several reasons i know many people who waited until marriage and they have very strong marriages while it sounds logical to want to try it out first here a counter logic to that think of it this way do you want to marry someone who needs to try you on for size the way you try on clothing or the way you try out a new car i sure would not i am a person not an item to be tried on more important than trying out actual sex is to ensure common core values and life goals and a deep emotional connection the emotional connection will be in its infancy because it something that hopefully continues to grow over time but the basis for it is something that can be established within a month or two the details of sex can always be worked out later in other words if value of sex is primarily the physical activity you would need to try out the physical activity for size but if the primary value is the deep intimate bond you ought to not have sex until somewhat of bond is established and nurtured ,9,RedPillWomen

loneliness-inc,what you describe here is the thought process which you may use to allow your desire to fade away no one is forcing you to give in to these challenges is it difficult to maintain desire and intimacy through challenges like these absolutely however 1 your spouse does not need to be patient forever 2 you need to own that shit if you allowed your desire to slide and for anxiety etc to take its place that on you it your responsibility ,1,DeadBedrooms
loneliness-inc,you make some very good points here i just want to clarify one word that you use guilt this is not about guilt it about ownership and responsibility there a difference between the two even when one party is absolutely guilty for causing the db it usually unwise for their spouse to come at them from a standpoint of guilt and blame rather it usually wiser to come at them from a standpoint of ownership and responsibility to say you need to own your shit and the shit that caused by your reasons you need to acknowledge and work on correcting the negative impact that these reasons are having on our marriage whether you are at fault or not ,3,DeadBedrooms

loneliness-inc,in addition to what i wrote in my original reply about rewarding bad behavior and in addition to what u myexesparamour pointed out he needs to stop chasing her this is not about becoming a cold hard emotionless stone it is about not fighting a losing battle that he stop wasting energy trying to play a game which he is bound to lose unfortunately some people do not take the needs of their partner seriously until the partner begins to withdraw and or has one foot out the door why they do not take things seriously before it reaches that point why do they take things for granted i do not know i wish i had the answer one thing is clear op wife is taking him for granted and not taking his needs seriously i have pcos so i have some understanding of what it like to have sex with pcos i am just trying to provide a little perspective from my own experience this point is moot here why pcos may cause issues with vaginal penetration but it need not kill desire if the wife of op let her desire for her husband fall to the wayside that entirely on her whether she at fault or not is irrelevant either way she responsible she needs to own it additionally there comes a point where all the excuses blend into one another and do not really matter anymore whether they are good excuses or not does not matter anymore people enter relationships for the sex and intimacy that comes with it there are times when that not feasible because reasons this is all good and fine as long as they are temporary once the reasons become permanent their validity does not matter anymore the spouse will find themselves in a situation where their needs are not being met for extended periods of time as justified as the reasons may be they wo not fulfill the very real need for intimacy that the spouse has edit i should add this https redd it 5tw7rv ,3,DeadBedrooms

loneliness-inc,the reasons why none of your communication with her has gotten the idea across is because it all done based on the premise that 1 you are always there for her 2 you will always desire her 3 you will always pursue her 4 you will always comfort her when she gets upset 5 you never hold her accountable for anything in other words you handed her a great deal of power over your happiness power corrupts you keep rewarding her bad behavior with even more attention and emotional investment why would she change anything when the less she fulfills your needs the more you fulfill hers you are fighting a losing battle you need to step out of the game just refuse to play she cannot get her head into the game of sex and intimacy do not pursue her this is rewarding bad behavior just do your own thing she needs to understand that time is ticking and she will lose you if nothing changes she has issues wonderful you have needs if her issues are incompatible with your needs you will need to break up one of two things will happen when she realizes this for real 1 her issues will suddenly not be as great as her need to keep you and she will work on them in earnest 2 her issues will win over and you break up either way you will have clarity ,15,DeadBedrooms

loneliness-inc,you make several good points but your conclusion that this is the result of being a sahm is flawed women have been stay at home moms for many generations across many cultures and places yet the phenomenon you describe is a fairly new one so what changed we live in a time when everyone deserves everything everyone deserves to be happy everyone deserves to have whatever kind of sex they want everyone deserves to have as much money as they want everyone deserves as many vacations as they want everyone deserves deserves and deserves some more of course this is not really true but it is a mindset that out there in the world today furthermore we live in a time when it okay to throw things out the minute we are done using them or the minute we do not want it anymore there need not be any reason for throwing it out because we deserve to do things even when they make no sense this applies to anything including people so many people will quickly suggest ending a marriage at the first sign of trouble everything is disposable including people of course this is not really true either but this mindset is also out there furthermore we live in a time when it utterly wrong to expect anything from anyone especially if it a man expecting something from a woman and even more so if it a husband expecting anything from his wife we ought to never expect anything everything is to be a gift of love that comes spontaneously when everyone feels like it and the stars line up this is not really true either but the mindset is out there combine all of the above together and you have women who have no checks and balances on their behavior they can nag and bitch at their husband as much as they feel like it they can control when where and how sex will or wo not happen they can spend as much money as they would like they can expect everything while expecting to not be expected to give anything in return what you will end up with is a woman who will quickly get bored of this life there no direction no limitations it out of control and therefore bound to crash whenever it does crash they can divorce their husband and take them to the cleaners for all they are worth society and the courts will be on their side after they are done they will have a line up of guys with whom they can start the process all over again none of this is to say that women are bad people god forbid they are not bad people they are just people people are human and humans need balance when balance is out of balance human nature gets ugly unless you are introspective enough to re balance yourself so here you have modern women in your neighborhood who have everything given to them and all they do is bitch and whine until they finally divorce rape their poor husbands indeed women initiate far more divorces than men this whole dynamic is the very reason why men got together to start trp because feminism swung the pendulum way out of balance in a manner that strongly favors women and disfavors men the pendulum can only swing so far in one direction before it forced to swing back the real tragedy is that this stuff is a swinging pendulum altogether the truth is that men and women can and should live in harmony with each gender contributing their part to the family the extended family the neighborhood the community the city the state province the country and the world there really need not be an us vs them at all this is why i love this sub so much because this sub recognizes and always deals with the road of the healthy balance and not just what benefits the imperative of this gender or that one ,8,RedPillWomen

loneliness-inc,i will address your question without actually reading the article sexuality is the participation is sexual activity whether it full penetration or the smallest gesture of foreplay etc intimacy is the strong bond between spouses there are many forms of intimacy sexual intimacy is only one type romance is the actualization and expression of desire and imagination this is my understanding of what romance is there a lot of overlap between these three concepts and this can lead to a lot of confusion and frustration the problem that will arise from a massage hug kiss or any other such thing is this spouse a thinks they are beginning a sexual activity and spouse b thinks they are beginning an intimate or romantic activity spouse a is therefore upset that spouse b rejected sex and spouse b is upset that sex was expected because they thought they were engaging in intimacy or romance both sides are legitimately frustrated here and they will need to work something out between themselves i do not think a standard solution can be given here generally speaking romance only exists in a sexual relationship therefore it reasonable to expect romantic gestures to lead to sex otoh it unreasonable to expect every romantic gesture to lead to sex where to draw the line there no objective answer what can be said is that if one spouse expects there to always be sex after a back rub they are being just as unreasonable as the spouse who expects that a back rub should never lead to sex eventually spouse a will refuse to give massages lest they experience another sexual rejection spouse b wo not try to get a hug when they need it lest their spouse want sex this often leads to plenty of frustration and resentment this is an issue which is crucial to solve because if left alone it will result in no more back rubs no more massages no more hugging no more kissing and no more physical affection which will lead to no more contact at all the marriage will only go downhill from there ,2,DeadBedrooms

loneliness-inc,i am going to disagree with some other commenters here 2 3 times a week does not mean everything is good for some sure some are genuinely satisfied with once a week and do not like to be touched more than that for others 5 6 times a week is necessary there no objectively correct number as per what constitutes a db if you need 5 6 times a week and you get 2 3 times with hardly any physical affection between those 2 3 times you are bound to be unsatisfied and rightfully so i do not understand why some people are minimizing op feelings on the matter does op really need to wait until they are at the same misery of 2 3 times a month or 2 3 times a year for it to be a legit problem why not deal with it now while the problem is relatively smaller sometimes i cannot understand some posters yea misery loves company but do not we all want less misery not more of it ,8,DeadBedrooms

loneliness-inc,sexual intimacy is the opposite of the intimacy of friendship to attract and maintain a relationship of sexual intimacy we dress our finest shower and scents hair and makeup polite language smile a lot we display confidence we generally display the best version of ourselves for attracting and maintaining sexually intimate relationships friendship is the opposite we will dress in anything no particular effort in grooming foul language burps and farts emotional meltdowns in friendship you are free to display the absolute worst version of yourself and still be accepted as is of course any ltr will have to tolerate a certain amount of their partner at their worst they will be exposed to emotional weakness eating habits and bathroom habits they will be exposed to their partner at their worst and need to be ready for that however your worst is not sexy it will chip away at sexual attraction for some it will chip at it faster for other slower but it is not sexy to anyone therefore one ought to minimize display of their worst elements and compensate by displaying more of their best side bottom line being a friend is the opposite of being a lover in a ltr you will need to tolerate your spouse at their worst and your spouse will need to do the same for you just try to make that easier on them by keeping your worst for your friends and your best for your lovers i know that does not sound good but you know what i am saying ,6,DeadBedrooms

loneliness-inc,how do you define marriage is a relevant question here is marriage a vow is it a commitment to one another is it a commitment to god is it to mate gaurd gaurd your genetic line or is there a little bit of all of these and other factors to a marriage is an open marriage only open for sex open for feelings for commitment with permission dadt if marriage is only an agreement between husband and wife they can decide to open it to whatever degree they want but it hardly ever works out like that because marriage is not limited to being a simple agreement ,2,DeadBedrooms

loneliness-inc,so why are you here just to point fingers at people ,1,DeadBedrooms
loneliness-inc,very solid points the purpose of writing this post was to argue for empathy empathy as opposed to sympathy is to identify with the feelings of another that does not mean you need to agree with those feelings nor do you need to agree with the choices they made as a result of those feelings it does mean listening and identifying with in this case the pain of others the poster you are responding to seems to be having a hard time with having some empathy you explained things very well here ,2,DeadBedrooms
loneliness-inc,can you argue a point without getting personal do you know how to do that ,1,DeadBedrooms
loneliness-inc,not a good comparison in death the more time that passes the more you are removed from the physical presence of the person who died while you may never forget them you do forget to a degree to the degree that it is not front and center in your mind and heart and becomes more so as time passes in a dead bedroom the presence of your spouse is a constant reminder of what you are missing additionally the fact that you are staying means that you cannot just seek out a new partner this makes you stuck in a position of your needs being unfulfilled on a regular basis it a constant sting you cannot just accept that many people cheat when they are in this exact spot you may not agree with their decision but that still why they did it ,3,DeadBedrooms
loneliness-inc,acceptance of what you cannot change will not remove the misery and sadness ,3,DeadBedrooms
loneliness-inc,your reasoning is valid but does not invalidate the reasoning of others that different than yours ,1,DeadBedrooms
loneliness-inc,because people have needs for many people sexual and emotional intimacy is a core need you cannot just accept life without it living without it is living in misery yu can accept that this particular partner wo not give you what you need you can therefore decide to leave or to cheat as mentioned above people have their reasons for doing so you do not have to agree with their reasons but i do not think it fair for you to expect them to just be happy with this core need being unmet ,4,DeadBedrooms
loneliness-inc,i would bake you a cake even though i would rather cook you a good piece of meat good point it is not always black and white sometimes there are reasons for adultery and cheating sometimes those reasons have validity even if you disagree with their validity ,2,DeadBedrooms
loneliness-inc,you raise a valid point however there is no reason is incorrect there can be reasons even if you do not agree with them some people expect their spouse to stay faithful and wo not tolerate infidelity of any kind with permission or without it the family dynamic can fall apart if the issue is ever raised they also are appalled at the notion of owing anything to their spouse in their mind their spouse ows them absolute fidelity but they do not owe sexual intimacy in return the husband or wife of such a person may want to keep their extramarital affairs hidden for this reason they may have other reasons why they wo not divorce as mentioned in the post you may not agree with this conclusion and you do not have to you should accept though that people have reasons even if you have valid reason to disagree with their reasoning therefore you should say there no reason rather say this reasoning is highly faulty or something of that nature ,10,DeadBedrooms
loneliness-inc,no need to get personal here if you want to refute my point go ahead i mentioned nothing about my own marriage nor did i mention anything about yours do not assume things you know nothing about ,1,DeadBedrooms

loneliness-inc,people are hardly ever rational when asked such questions op has good reason to not tell her cheating is an overall bad situation no one is going to argue with that the only question here is which is the least bad route to take you say to tell her op does not want to tell her there are valid reasons both ways ,1,DeadBedrooms

loneliness-inc,good question blame is a troll do not feed the troll think about it does it matter who to blame no it does not matter one bit what matters to you to her and to your marriage is the actual fallout it does not matter who at fault therefore never engage in blame yourself engage only in offering constructive ideas when appropriate to do so when she blames you look at her dead in the eyes and say nothing nothing at all when she blames herself look at her in the eyes and say nothing the first few times just let her know that you wo not be participating in blame games if she interested on figuring out a solution on bettering the marriage you are here to do so but if she needs to blame someone be that her or you you simply wo not engage i wish you much success ,2,DeadBedrooms

loneliness-inc, and what do you do when spouse needs wants you around all the time remember what they say on the airplane you must put on your own oxygen mask before helping others the reason for this is simple 1 your own life takes priority over anyone else life in this case your own sanity takes priority over anyone else needs 2 the help that you wish to offer is useless if you are dead in this case your assistance to your ill spouse will be compromised at best if you do not care for yourself too i feel a lot of sympathy for folks who are trapped in these sorts of marriages and convince themselves that there is no alternative and no escape many such marriages do indeed end in divorce and i did write a little about that in the post but divorce is not always that simple sometimes there are valid reasons not to jump ship or not to jump ship just yet some people may see it as their mission in life to remain and care for a mentally ill spouse and that okay some people are fundamentally opposed to divorce ever i am not okay with that either way self care is very important some people who divorce over mental illness never forgive themselves or move on it a very sad thing ,5,DeadBedrooms

loneliness-inc, obviously the word obviously is a word that describes an assumption you are assuming things about what i know or do not know on what basis do you assume probably based on a misreading of a basic text comment you know what they say assume is to make an ass of you and me let me explain my one line comment with a bit more elaboration you cannot choose your hormones hormonal shifts and the resulting sensations sensitivities depression or what have you are all things that a person cannot chose but you can chose your attitude op mentioned how she is convincing herself of certain negative ideas this is an issue of attitude having depression only makes engaging in these negative thoughts more tempting it does not remove the personal agency that human beings have to steer their way towards and away from thoughts many people can do this on their own some need help bottom line while depression may cause her to be more inclined to think of dying she is not destined to engage in these thoughts she can with the right attitude steer away from such thoughts ,-1,DeadBedrooms

loneliness-inc,the premise of your thinking includes the notion that people are either honorable or dishonorable honorable people are incapable of dishonorable things you can only love one person at a time you are not absolute about this one let just call bullshit on all three and replace them with the following three people are good at their core they just have many different drives and desires which tempt them to do dishonorable things a person chooses to engage in honorable behavior one moment and dishonorable behavior the next moment one does not knock or discount the other therefore everyone is capable of the greatest good and the most abhorrent bad most people are not used to doing the most abhorrent bad but they are certainly capable of it if they chose to go down that route you can love more than one person at a time even though juggling is not something everyone knows how to do with regards to the actual cheating i can empathize with your feelings on the matter i can understand why you would engage in this even though it a bad choice however what you need to do is to contemplate whether you really wish to marry a person for whom sex is a chore also think about whether you want to marry someone who rips apart your drives and passions as being never satisfied with anything do you want someone who will build you up or rip you apart ,5,DeadBedrooms
loneliness-inc, what he saw was a disinterested unappreciative neglectful wife if that how you treated him that what happened having reasons as valid as they may be for being disinterested unappreciative and neglectful does not change the fact that you were disinterested unappreciative and neglectful when your spouse is disinterested it hurts when your spouse is unappreciative it hurts when your spouse neglects you it hurts treating your husband in this manner hurt him you need to own that having reasons for doing so does not change your bad treatment of him having reasons will help him be more understanding and forgiving but it will not take away his hurt having reasons treating him poorly and not letting him into what is going on with you and how you have been feeling what exactly do you want from him did you marry a prophet that you expect him to read your mind ,8,DeadBedrooms
