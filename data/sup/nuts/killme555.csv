killme555,by our i am including the mods sure then could would not reflect very highly on them though now would it does not matter our subreddit we do not like you you are not allowed to post anymore ,1,Incels
killme555,it not like i randomly brought up men die protecting their girlfriends and wives more often than women do for their boyfriends and husbands the thread derailed a bit and i was replying and it is feminist brainwashing if virgin women think anyone who has a preference for virgin women sees them as nothing but a sex toy like i said it not like non virgin men who have their experience seen as a good thing think they are seen as nothing but a sex toy that gives more pleasure ,1,dating_advice
killme555, why because it our subreddit also i am fairly sure that being banned despite following subreddit rules is the definition of partiality and capriciousness does not matter if the mods here want to ban you or every non incel despite not breaking the rules they are completely allowed ,1,Incels
killme555,no i posted this on r incels originally but posted here for more answers kisslesss virgin is a common term on r incels ,2,dating_advice
killme555,i am not talking about a situation like that though but just wanting to date a woman who is a virgin not fuck them once to be their first and not talk to them again a man who is interested in getting in a relationship with a virgin obviously does not only care about her virginity and not her because she will eventually not be be a virgin anyway but because of reasons like insecurity he will not have to worry about guys in the past who have had sex with her being far better now i do not have an answer for why women prefer non virgin men but my guess would be that they do not want to take something from someone they would prefer a shared experience between two people and not a one sided ownership of someone else that is placing an awful lot of importance on a person first time when most western women are sex positive feminists who think you should not place a lot of importance on your first time ,1,dating_advice
killme555,they would all reject me so no if a girl liked me but did not want to date me because i am not a vegan then i would ,5,Incels
killme555,maybe if you approach a woman more attractive than you you would be considered creepy but just saying you prefer attractive women i do not think would get you called creepy also wanting a virgin woman often implies to people that you are quite possessive or jealous which imo duh you do not wanna share your so but nowadays that considered backwards by many because again society is ratchet yeah that probably is a reason too wanting a virgin woman might be seen as insecure too and as a man it pretty much unacceptable to be insecure if you want to date a virgin because you are insecure you would be called creepy but if a woman wanted to date a virgin man because she insecure no one would say anything ,4,Incels
killme555,it still seen as bad even if there not a big age gap though here https www reddit com r okcupid comments 5i2gdg mens common preferences are considered bad but db4v8av is a example of it being seen as creepy it seems if you are 18 and prefer a virgin woman it always seen as bad ,0,dating_advice
killme555,i am not whining and you did not even give an answer ,-1,dating_advice
killme555,i guess it mostly the second you would not be called creepy for wanting to date someone out of your league it just that adult female virgins are very rare but that does not explain why even if you specific you only want a virgin woman it still seen as creepy ,2,Incels
killme555,no they do not it the reason that men get killed protecting their girlfriends wives much much more often the other way around most of these guys are getting shot stabbed to death so their extra strength means nothing they are just more courageous and you are being obtuse i am not you just never answered the question of my thread ,-1,dating_advice
killme555,so why is a male saying they prefer women with less experience seen as creepy how is wanting to date a volcel creepy ,3,Incels
killme555,i agree men have more courage than women for example which is why we make up the majority of firefighters police military but that still does not answer my question of why this double standard exists ,0,dating_advice
killme555,i am not saying why do men prefer less experienced and women more experienced men but why is it considered not okay for a man to prefer less experienced women but it seen as okay for a woman to prefer experienced men if both are evolution like you have said why can a woman say i do not want to date virgins and face no negativity but i cannot say i want to date virgins without being seen as creepy sexist etc i think the answer to this is we live in a society that favors women but i am interested in seeing other answers ,2,dating_advice
killme555,so i guess it feminist brainwashing then when a man is seen as more attractive because he not a virgin he does not think he being objectified as a sex toy that can give more pleasure he just sees it as being more attractive to her ,-1,dating_advice
killme555,so why is wanting a male with more experience seen as fine but wanting a female with less experience seen as bad creepy because we live in a society that favors women ,1,dating_advice
killme555, believe it or not i and her have just as much of a right to lurk and post here as you do we may not be incel but that does not change that this is a public subreddit no you do not have a right to post here as much as the incels a mod can ban you at any time even if you have not broken the rules and complaining to the admins wo not get you unbanned either you only have as much as a right to lurk ,2,Incels

killme555, i am sorry but your assumptions regarding everything else we have discussed show that you do not really understand i mean in most of the west a moderately drunk woman giving consent to sex and having sex with her makes you a rapist is just not true and is exactly part of the stigma you believe does not exist yeah it true that why stuff like this http i imgur com tox1v7s jpg exists you are trying to be open minded which is commendable but you are not listening to someone giving you different facts opinions and testimonies yes i am i could say the same thing about you because you do not agree with me next time you hear a story about rape please try to carefully assess any assumptions you make about the victim and the perpetrator and whether they are based in fact at all well alright ,6,Incels

killme555, i am sorry but this is simply not true you seem to have a romanticised view of rape and suicide rape victims most certainly bear scars for life never said they do not i said they likely wo not be suicidal about being raped 5 years after it happened they will probably just have some trust issues etc i am not sure how and where you start drawing lines here how do you rank misery if it an 8 year old then they have it worse but as soon as they hit 16 suddenly they will just get over it yeah it hard to compare so i will just not talk about little kids getting raped people older in general can cope with problems better than little kids though actually there are people whose job it is to statistically evaluate how many victims come forward that is just saying they claim to have been raped not that they actually have been and with the lines of what is rape being blurred in recent years it would not surprise me if a lot of those women claiming to have been raped but never reported it to the police just regretted sex had sex while slightly drunk etc and unfortunately you not seeing any stigma does not mean it is not there if anything it means it more perverse as it so commonplace while i cannot prove there no stigma you cannot prove there is it like me saying there is stigma to having a friend of yours murdered i cannot prove it and you cannot disprove it you will get support once it agreed you are a blameless victim but getting to that status is nigh impossible you will be believed to be a blameless victim by most people anyway even saying something like walking alone at night as a woman is a bad idea is considered victim blaming these days many rape kits are not even tested because it not seen as worth the effort people question you and go into intimate details of your sexuality use any kink you may have as proof that it was not rape try to find any reason to show it was justified and your fault and not actually rape this is sadly the reality of being a rape victim today i disagree all this is considered socially unacceptable yet this is what happens it can be as blatant as saying the victim deserved to be raped or subtler like saying well maybe if you were not walking alone at 6am well your skirt was very short etc i agree that when it pointed out it not as acceptable but it still happens every single time there no proof it happens every single time it not much of an argument if i am expected to just agree problem here is again our differing definitions of good life being raped absolutely messes with your ability to trust and get close to people let alone getting into physical relationships most rape victims are not depressed and suicidal after maybe a year or 2 they get in relationships have kids get friends etc most incels are depressed suicidal and have no relationship kids or friends because of that just look at this subreddit lifelong therapy hell no brother also the vast majority of incels do not even need cosmetic surgery that an excessive last recourse option that you will in all likelihood never have to go to even it is more expensive which i am not sure about it not like rape victims have to go to therapy every day for their entire life paying say 200 a month is much easier than paying 10000 at once 20k is pretty much the minimum too as it like 1 good plastic surgery 2 decent plastic surgeries if you need 5 done it closer to like 70k the vast majority of incels claim they are too ugly so i will just believe them as there no reason i have seen to believe they are not guess what everybody has regrets this is not an incel thing this is not even specific to suicidal and depressed people this is the vast majority of people everybody has years they regret and wonder what could have been regrets vary in severity an ex incel regretting they never lived their teens and 20s properly is worse than a woman wishing she fucked more guys before getting married i really do not know where you get this idea i mean in most of the west a moderately drunk woman giving consent to sex and having sex with her makes you a rapist i do not mean most rape victims were drinking regardless rape is rape no matter the level of inebriation how does this even have to be debated whether she sober mildy tipsy or passed out drunk if she does not consent it rape i really do not care what the alcohol blood level is again my point was having sex with a moderately drunk woman in most of the west is rape even if she consented i am not talking about moderately drunk women who did not consent but who consent was invalidated by ridiculous laws and we are right back to the beginning this whole conversation having gone nowhere your inability to understand a what rape is b how it affects victims and c the existing stigma around it is sad i understand these things fine i just do not agree it probably not your fault confirmation bias and a lack of exposure to other kinds of people and experiences are tough things to get over just try to keep an open mind and try not to disregard differing opinions as uncomfortable as it may be well i am talking to others to see their opinions so i am being open minded ,2,Incels
killme555, you have never been sexually abused raped or molested for a lot of people i would be willing to say most those things do not go away over time when you are raped it not just a fleeting moment your entire agency was taken away it manifests in trust issues promiscuity self loathing obesity self harm vaginismus suicide attempts substance abuse anxiety depression ptsd the list goes on surviving the rape means surviving the rest of your life wondering why it had to happen to you therapy wo not fix all of those issues and it can take a lifetime to figure it out they might not go away completely but depression contemplating suicide will reduce one day later wo not compare to 6 months later 6 months later wo not be as bad as 3 years later 3 years later wo not be as bad 11 years later etc and being incel can lead to pretty much all those things too self loathing obesity substance abuse anxiety depression self harm etc only difference is these things will reduce with time for rape victims but increase with time for incels https www nsopw gov en us education factsstatistics aspxautodetectcookiesupport 1 that does not say most rape victims were sexually abused as children men are the most under reported group of victims how can you find support if you cannot even talk about it well support is out there it better then there being no support like in the cases of incels ask any survivor and they will give you an example of someone telling them they asked for it it not socially acceptable really it the most common experience survivors have it obviously not socially acceptable it like saying an innocent person who got murdered asked for it some might still say it but it rare and not socially acceptable to say fair point not everyone is dysmorphic but a common theme that i have seen here is self hate whether it for autism perceived beauty or lack thereof social anxiety whatever those are all things therapy can address you are no less capable of seeking help than a person that was raped therapy can help rape victims live a good life therapy cannot make an incel not be an incel only becoming more attractive can these are two situations that you cannot compare rape victims do not get off easy and believe me when i say that you would not want the experiences of somebody that was the victim of sexual abuse it really sucks that you feel so miserable and alone and my heart goes out to you but it not the right to compare the two i did not say they get off easy the reason i am comparing it to rape instead of say getting hit in the face once is because rape is much more severe than getting hit in the face once ,3,Incels
killme555, no it not a bad comparison you do not think the trauma following rape is on going it is but it lowers with time 1 day later is not as bad as 6 month later 6 months later is not as bad as 4 years later 4 years later is not as bad 15 years later for an incel the older you get the more depressed suicidal and hopeless you get you do not think they will dwell on what happened the same way and incel would supposedly dwell on wasted youth they will but they have other advantages like getting more support being able to live good lives after getting raped but most incels are too depressed and suicidal to live good lives etc i really doubt that well i guess we disagree i cannot show it 5 max like you cannot show it more it a small number anyway 99 of people will still be supportive to a rape victim ,1,Incels
killme555, are you aware of the mental health issues that come along with sexual abuse depression and suicidal ideation are just a few things survivors experience they will fade with time an incels depression and suicidal ideation increase with time being an incel is not as bad in your teens compared to your 20s your 20s compared to your 30s etc statistically a large portion of rape victims were sexually abused as children and will be revictimized the whole good life before being raped does not hold a lot of clout large portion most a large portion could be 10 i doubt the majority of rape victims were sexually abused as children male survivors face a whole new world of stigma when it comes to their experience usually culminating in a pervasive sense of men cannot be raped women and men tend to face accusations of lying accusations of having asked for it people not believing you support going to the rapist and the feeling of needing to protect their rapist men still can find support groups and live a good life after getting raped all of those examples are very rare telling rape victim they asked for it is socially suicide it acceptable at all if your insurance covers therapy sure but incels can also seek therapy to deal with body dysmorphia regardless of your insurance covers it still less expensive and while there might be some incels who just have body dysmorphia there are plenty of us who do not so therapy is not going to make us not incel fuck everything about this last paragraph well alright in my opinion having sex with a moderately drunk women is not rape with that logic a married man who has sex with his wife after she drank some alcohol is a rapist ,5,Incels
killme555, rape victims tend to be depressed suicidal suffer from ptsd become unable to grow close to people and maintain a relationship yes some rape victims do live a good life after the fact similarly nothing is preventing you from living a good life as an incel they are going to be similar kinds of life they will become less depressed and suicidal with time that common sense the chances a woman would be suicidal about getting raped 5 years after it happened are low for an incel not only do you not become less depressed and suicidal with time you likely will become more as you enter your 20s then your mid 20s then your 30s then your mid 30s etc i am not sure what you are basing this one on many rape victims are attacked because they are easy targets same kind of target as for bullying so same argument as you here what are you making of childhood rape victims what kind of good life has an 8 year old lived before being raped many sure most i doubt it there no proof that easy victims are most of the rape victims and not average women who had average normal lives before getting raped i am just talking about adult rape victims or at least 16 a 8 year old who got raped probably has it worse than most incels but a 40 50 year old incel probably has it worse you most definitely have not been a rape victim the number of victims who come forward is ridiculously low because of the stigma having been raped is a label that follows you around i do not think there a way to tell how many actually come forward and i have not seen any stigma of being a rape victim or not any more than say being a person who had a friend murdered you will get mostly support if you bring it up some people might treat you different but that is because of how serious rape and murder are treated some many people actually blame the victim for being raped being drunk dressing provocatively having previously had sex with their rapist not saying no clearly enough a reasonably prominent american politician once said that actual rapes did not cause pregnancy if that not stigma and lack of support i do not know what is that is rare saying a rape victim deserved to be raped is so bad it complete social suicide and i am pretty sure this american politician got a lot of backlash for what he said probably covered in media too and this is not even broaching the subject of male victims which are still not often recognised as victims the number of people who think teenagers raped by their female teachers are lucky is insane or spousal rape which again is often not actually considered as rape male rape victims have it bad compared to female rape victims but at least they can find support groups with ease and the rest of the points apply to them like that they can live a good life after getting raped first therapy is not cheap and therapy does not even always work it much cheaper compared to cosmetic surgery second treatment for being incel is not necessarily cosmetic surgery but that a fundamental argument that unrelated to this rape argument third there is no treatment for being raped once you have been raped you have been raped no amount of therapy will make that go away once you have been incel so there no getting back the years you were incel either the years you probably spent depressed and suicidal missing out on you will always wonder what it would have been like to live those years normally this is exactly what i am talking about all rape is rape stranger in an alley forcing you down and fucking you is rape boyfriend ignoring your crying and pleading him to stop and fucking you in the ass is rape guy picking you up at a bar when you are unable to form coherent sentences and throwing you in the back of his car to fuck you is rape uncle taking you into his office to share some special time with you is rape all of these are rape all of these have long lasting consequences all of these are attacks to your personal space all of these are traumatic events that leave physical and mental scars i am not talking about someone drunk enough to not be able to form sentences i was talking about someone being moderately drunk which is rape in most of the west now but regardless being incel is still worse than severely drunk and unable to consent type rape and forced rape and passed out raped etc ,7,Incels

killme555, common sense no it entirely depends on the person i could make the same argument for incels that they get less depressed over time but that sounds ridiculous does not it the same applies to rape victims it possible to leave inceldom but not get unraped bad comparison because incel is an ongoing thing being raped is not as time passes you are going to feel less depressed about it like if a friend family member dies you feel less bad as time passes the second day will compare nothing to 2 years later you cannot be unraped but being incel will do long term damage too like always feeling like you missed out on the time you were incel whether it be all your teens or all your 20s i doubt that for god sake there are people in the comments saying they do not think rape exists there are people on this sub that think you cannot be raped by a chad that is just 2 guys in the entire subreddit it probably 5 regardless 99 of people will be supportive to a rape victim ,5,Incels

killme555,except nothing shows a nice guy made this or nice guys agree with this moral of the story is you hate nice guys what an odd group to hate ,-13,niceguys

killme555,fucking white knights in this thread just lol if you think op actually thinks she ugly not just trying to get compliments from reddit white knight losers she probably getting fucked by her 8 10 boyfriend as you write your cringeworthy compliments ,1,amiugly
killme555,that is because i posted in a feminist subreddit for a bit r thebluepill they like to mass downvote anyone with a different opinion ,-1,OkCupid
killme555,he can but he needs something to make up for being obese like money status being very tall and he needs to try much harder an obese woman can get a boyfriend with ease ,4,Incels
killme555, this is actually much worse than a male incel and now this is going to be upvoted by all this subreddit retarded normies women can get boyfriends with ease anyway too like this http www nydailynews com life style health obese woman loses weight marathon sex article 1 1116995 woman they just cannot get the men they want tall handsome rich has status confident and charismatic etc some times ,4,Incels

killme555,the insecurity would be solved with the shoe lifts it not like i am insecure about my height when i am at home i am just insecure about it when i will be judged by it outside and lying is preferable to being short at least they would see if they like me instead of just rejecting me ,0,OkCupid
killme555,it just 2 inches though if the majority of women would reject a guy because he 2 inches shorter without shoes most women are extremely shallow ,-1,OkCupid
killme555, the difference is that women who wear make up are not saying that they do not wear make up you writing 5 9 on your profile is lying that a great way to start any relationship i am not lying i would put 5 9 as my height as i am wearing the shoes lifts so i would be 5 9 and i am not saying i am not wearing lifts either both me and women wearing makeup are just not mentioning it if as you say it just 2 inches and she should not care about it then why bother with the lifts anyway it just 2 inches 2 inches will still make me more attractive especially since i can say i am average height instead of short ,-5,OkCupid
killme555,sure they are the majority of women i would prefer dating women who care very little or not at all but they are a small percent of women ,4,OkCupid
killme555,i do accept my height but most women still feel like this http i imgur com 1w5acge png about height ,4,OkCupid
killme555,i think i will just go with 5 9 i would put 5 9 on my profile what will you do when she notices what about when you are at your her home and the shoes come off nothing it just 2 inches and i will go for women i am taller than at 5 7 if she cares a lot about a 2 inches difference i will try to find a woman not so picky will you get all defensive when she calls you out on lying about your height no 2 inches is not much if she notices calls me out on it i would not care women use makeup and similar things to raise their attractiveness men should be allowed to raise their attractiveness too if she cares a lot about it negatively then i will try to find a less picky woman ,-4,OkCupid
killme555,no fuck you ,2,CringeAnarchy
killme555,it against the rules to just vote especially massively 100 like r badwomensanatomy often does and other feminist majority subreddits like r thebluepill persona doing so get banned from said group you need to be manually banned by the subreddit mods and they cannot tell who voting anyway the only thing they can do is mention to their users to stop voting in linked threads but the admins do not care if the feminist majority subreddits break reddit rules so the mods of these subreddits do not care ,2,askMRP
killme555,wow incredible you wrote some random shit on r incels and got banned you are the master troll ,-2,CringeAnarchy

killme555,no you did not get lucky you are just an average guy you are average height i am assuming at an average weight with an average face and your hair is just beginning to thin so does not affect your attractiveness much a guy who is very short very ugly moderately ugly and moderately ugly etc who gets in a relationship is lucky and i used to think like you a bit when i was 14 and a sea of raging hormones but i got over it as well and that when i first kissed a girl got a girlfriend got dates not pining and moping and sitting alone in a dark room wondering why i was sitting alone in a dark room irrelevant if you were a 2 10 your life would be different you just grew up to be an average attractiveness male with an average life and that what you honestly do not understand the people telling you this shit are people who were where you were at some point at 14 lol being an incel when you are 20 is far different than being an average teen you were not at were i am but thankfully we wised up and started giving a shit and stop treating people as prizes to be won and transactions to be engaged in and started treating them as people no you just did not end up as 4 10 there plenty of incels who give a shit and treat people as people the other big irony of most incels is that they keep telling the normies what is required to have either sex or relationships despite never having either normies are ignorant of what it takes because it came to them naturally people just happened to be attracted to them because they are not 4 10s the vast majority of normies would not be able to get in a relationship if they woke up half a foot shorter severly balding and with a very asymmetrical face ,0,justneckbeardthings
killme555,yes all this is terrible advice like do not call people normies because it childish and implies that we are a different species it just a label it no different than calling them non incels but normies is quicker to type stop basing your whole life off of getting laid intimacy is important to most people and in the masclow hierarchy of needs it listed as a need too only people who have never had a problem receiving intimacy would say something so stupid nobody wants to date bitter misogynistic dudes with entitlement complexes most of us do not have entitlement complexes so terrible advice rape is never okay nobody deserves sex more terrible advice as 1 of incels think these things most people who give this sort of advice think the worst of us and no incel wants to talk them they are obnoxious and look stupid too just randomly posting women are not sex machines you cannot just put nice tokens in and get sex women do not like douchebags they just like confident guys treat women like people you do not deserve sex no one is entitled to sex ,0,justneckbeardthings
killme555,i did not delete it my comment probably got caught by a spam filter if i delete a comment it wo not be in my post history the women who got her faced ripped off by a monkey has husband women are different they can easily find a partner always it why incels and every similar forum is 99 100 male flavor flav had 4 kids before he even got famous i do not know who he is so i cannot say much but from a google search he nearing 60 so it normal he not conventionally attractive physical attraction is a factor but confidence and showing that you give a damn about others as well as yourself by taking care of yourself and being someone others want to be around such as being charismatic matter just as much if not more to you ever attracting anyone you still need to pass a minimum of physical attractiveness if looks did not matter at all sexual orientation would not exist if a person had a good personality you would be attracted to them that not how it works however did it ever occur to you that a lot of the people who posting that you all call normies even without seeing them are just people who wised up and realized that all that stuff is bullshit no they are just more attractive they are not short ugly balding etc i was single all through highschool and college it was not until i had a friend who acted like barney in how i met your mother who pushed me to go out there did i break the curse as i used to call it its not even close to impossible unless you all want it to be impossible you are most likely not unattractive your experience is not going to be the same as a short balding ugly male i made it out of the pit of i am just destined to be alone and the rest of you can too if you all just give up these limiting beliefs about yourselves and the world and put in that time for most incels that will only happen if 1 they get cosmetic surgery or 2 they meet one of the very few women in the world who are not shallow ,1,justneckbeardthings
killme555, the fact that you call people who seek to consistently improve their lives normies seems to be a testimony to that that wrong you are not going to be called a normie for trying to improve your life normie is just a label given to those who are not incel do you understand how destructive that entire place is even if you we exercising with a trainer 5 days a week going to school and working a 6 figure sallary job r incels would still not be beneficially in the slightest because of how its warping your thought process r incels is no different than a subreddit like r depression it not beneficial but it still a support forum and one of the only places incels can speak freely and have others agree with them here is my simple question sir what makes you guys special everyone has some sort of dating issues at some area of their life some more than others dating relationships social skills fitness finances etc all of those take time and practice to get good at they are not innate abilities that only the special among us have to quote mandela greatness is not in some of us its in all of us we cannot date anyone the vast majority of people can i do not know if that makes up special but we never claimed to be special what makes you so special not even just you but all of incels the quest for companionship is something at least 95 of humans have and is the source of sadness and regret of some kind for everyone at some point what makes the incels so different the quest for companionship for incels means being able to attract anyone the quest for companionship for 95 of humans is being able to attract certain people most people could find someone if they just lower their standards and why does normie advice seem to work for everyone except you all normies tend to be more attractive there are unattractive normies too but they just got lucky and ran in to the few non shallow women in the world normies do not understand the importance of physical attraction and that is one reason r incels exists it one of the few places on the internet you can say i am too short ugly etc to date without being told useless advice like just be confident or just be funny as if that would make up for the fact you are unattractive what the hell is a normie in the first place someone who does not believe your life is predetermined shit based on genetics a normie is a non incel can you honestly tell me that all of you or at least the vast majority of you all took all the advice on improving your lives did it consistently with discipline for at least a year and had absolutely no positive results in the slightest no i have not seen any proof that is the case i have not seen any proof that is not the case either ,1,justneckbeardthings
killme555,it nothing but an assumption that we do not do what normies do u bautin wants to believe that because it makes hating us easier there no proof we do less than normies nothing more than a baseless assumption it also just an assumption that those who claimed they have tried half assed it again because u bautin hates incels and wants to justify his hatred with facts he pulled out of his ass ,-5,justneckbeardthings

killme555,i am pretty sure men make me at least 75 of the homeless population former offenders of violent crimes do contribute to that but even without them there would likely still be more homeless men beyond that we have got male cops who are more likely to be violent and commit domestic crimes themselves than the general pop shooting males who are more likely to be perps what can women do that they are not already doing which is often taking care of and providing for these guys women do not need to do anything i just wish their was more attention given to men issues you have black lives matter when the percentage of unarmed black and white people who are shot by the police is the same but no male lives matter when men are x5 more likely to be killed if they are unarmed compared to women ,1,TheBluePill
killme555,for their own issues i meant they will only gather for women issues ,0,TheBluePill
killme555,it not sexist to point out it men it sexist to say they all have fragile masculinity feminists seem to say any man who they do not like has fragile masculinity ,1,TheBluePill
killme555,i never said you cannot support both all i said is i am sad because most men do not care about their problems only about women and that feminist keep distributing men attempts to talk about their issues in real life despite claiming to be for equality ,1,TheBluePill
killme555, blacks are disproportionately represented there they are twice as likely to be shot by police when you segment by race and by of the us population men are also more likely to commit violent crimes so i am not surprised i am talking about unarmed people why would anyone care about the amount of armed people killed black people who are unarmed are not dying more than white people unarmed men are dying more than unarmed women though that is myopic of you most feminists i know have interacted with are pretty open to other ideas as long as it not antithetical to their beliefs well i guess lucky you but again you are focusing on the wrong things the gender divide does not matter men and women need to stand with each other in support of our collective human rights it happened yesterday and that trend will continue what we need to focus on is bridging the class divide the lack of a middle class leads to a much more divided voting bloc that true but i still care about men issues a lot since pretty much no one does ,0,TheBluePill
killme555, men are also much more likely to commit violent crimes and being shot by police seems to have more of a race division than a gender one it not according to here https www washingtonpost com graphics national police shootings 2016 in 2016 465 white people where killed by the police and 233 black people 2 where unarmed in each group this is compared to 923 men being killed by the police to 40 women 5 of the men where unarmed and less than 1 of the women where unarmed profiling is real but that because of race not gender i am certain men are more likely to be profiled too just like minorities but i have no stats on either group homelessness is likely as much a mental health issue as well as a cultural issue with regards to how masculinity is portrayed men are still much more likely to be homeless it really easy to be a man in 21st century america especially if you are well off enough financially it really easy to be either a man or woman but both groups still have disadvantages those exist but being opposed to women fighting for their rights just because men do not is silly i am not opposed to it i am jealous that women actually care about their problems instead of fighting those fighting for their rights unite with them and work to fight for the causes you believe in i do not think you can unite with feminists you can only become a feminist and join them feminists only associate themselves with people who have identical or very close to identical opinions ,-20,TheBluePill
killme555, and to say that men are just as disadvantaged is actually kinda insane yes men have some disadvantages but men also do not have politicians trying to systematically control what they can do with their bodies men face other types of disadvantages like being more likely to be shot by the police more likely to become homeless etc just because politicians want to control what women can do with their bodies does not mean they are more disadvantaged but i guess you are right about the rest this was mostly an anti trump protest ,-31,TheBluePill
killme555,the march just makes me sad because i know men cannot even gather 1 10th of the size of that despite being just as disadvantaged in the west most men do not care about their problems and just care about women problems and feminists and their allies would do the same thing they did in the toronto men suicide rate discussion ,-54,TheBluePill
killme555, brittany casey notice the only negative comments are from men hurts their fragile masculinity to see women stick up for themselves this is why i am not a feminist too many random sexist remarks that are supported by the vast majority of feminists ,-7,TheBluePill
