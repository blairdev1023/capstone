RPmatrix, he hit the car i honestly believe had he stayed upright he could have missed the car it was only coz the bike laid down and slid into the car instead of veering back to the right hand lane too that he hit the car as i have had the front end wash out on me hundreds of times riding dirt bikes where it possible to are cover from a front end wash out sometimes but when it happens on a road bike they go down so fast like this guy in a split second and there sfa chance of are covering it as it happens so fast one second you are braking hard the next you are sliding down the road on your arse beside your bike lol i have also watched it happen to other people and as long as you do not hit anything it one of the more gentle ways to stack your bike ,2,WTF
RPmatrix, the journey of a thousand miles starts with one step good on you bro keep it up and may i suggest you try taking 1000mgs of magnesium supplements a day it will calm your mind like you wont believe better than valium and as good as pot but without any ide effects the average western diet is woefully lacking in magnesium with the average person lucky to get 150mgs per day yet the reccomended daily intake is 450mgs p d supplementing extra magnesium to the tune of 1000mgs p d allows your body to catch up which it does almost immediately and a person whio diet is lacking in mg and are stressed and anxiousm your mind stuck in a loop thinkingthe same negative shit over and over take 1000mgs of mg you will clearly notice it effects within an hour or so oftaking it as the mg ions find their way to the brain and they begin to modulate and calm overexcited parts of the brain that have runaway becoz of not enough magnesium in their diet it 10 to find out and so far everyone i have told about mg who have tried it have told me how well it worked for them and they continue to take mg supplements on a daily basis i think it just might help you bro duckduck magnesium the original chill pill for a great articlle about the importance mg,1,TheRedPill

RPmatrix,ok motorcyclist here been riding bikes since i was 10yo and have done what this guy did and if you watch really closely he drops the bike justbefore the car hits him let me explain it called running out of brakes but fortunately for me there were no cars when it happened and i have dropped the bike or crashed into the fence as the case may be running out of brakes simply means you are braking as hard as possible without locking up the wheels but you need a little bit more road to stop becoz if you lock the wheels you stop slowing down and will begin sliding out of control which is what happens in this video as i shall describe step by step so he did not intentionally overtake his mate he ran out of brakes and could not stop in time was trying to avoid crashing into the back of him if you watch closely he going pretty quickly and for whatever are ason he starts braking waaay too late even though he jumped on the brakes as hard as he can he still going to overshoot the mark where he wants to stop which i imagine in behind or beside the other bike so he charges up and as he realizes at the last moment he not going to stop in time he chooses to swerve around the stationary bike and here where it all goes pearshaped when braking at maximum braking point where you are right at the point of locking the wheels if you were to brake harder or unweight the bike doing a quick flip turn first a fast flick left followed by a quick flick right to straighten up two things happened here first as he flicks the bike to the left you can see it slides a little to the left as he still braking full on but turning the bike changes the contact patch of the tyre s lessening the traction slightly but enough to cause first the rear wheel to lock on the left flick and with the right flick the front wheel also locks up you can see the handlebars suddenly turn full lock to the right which is known as a front end washout in motorbike riding terms and that what happens to this guy about 2 10ths of a second before the car hits him tl dr going too fast had to make an emergency stop but ran out of room so while trying to avoid crashing into the bike and cars in front of him he swerved into the oncoming lane locking his brakes in the process and dropping his bike which an oncoming car crashes into a millipoof later ,3,WTF

RPmatrix, ahh self employed that explains it be lieve me i know how you feel although it far from all bad eh where did you come from prior to the baa in all the books ive ever read i have yet to read 1984 although it has been referenced so often i feel i know it already it quite unique it needs to be read to grasp the totallity of a world orwell created in the 1930 it a short book a couple of hundred pages and it kinda depressing but it message is unique but it based in a world we would understand whereas with bnw the people are genetically engineered to fit various roles so normal is it to grow up from a bottle that the word mother has become one of the most offensive words one can use you can get both on audiobook brave new world was another world in where everybody has a rank from their in vitro birth where they have been made to fulfill a role from alpha to epsilon semi morons lol and their god is known as our ford lol yep ole henry becomes the god of this brave new world i preferred bnw to read but they are both worth the time and you will be able to find copies online no probs please accept that in my concern for yourself as regards to your injuries and loss i am not mouthing empty placitudes rather simply making an acknowledgement of them it is natural to have empathy touche again you have replied in one of for me the few acceptable ways anyone could which again confirms my belief you are not the average bear consequently i would be open to beginning a ph real time dialogue as talking about such esoteric topics as we have been this way via text that is fuckin difficult and does not allow for would ynamic changes of mind opinion which can occur in a are al time life conversation and now that ph calls are almost free it a viable alternative and i am up for starting it in the near future and i suggest that when we do exchange ph we do so when we are both online so that once i you have got the number you me delete said posts immediately as it not the kind of thing you want hanging around in your post history in fact i have deleted a number of my replies to you as they contained too much personal information i did not want left hanging in cyberspace what are your average working hours ie what time do you start finish although i guess that does not matter so long as you are not booked and are free to talk something which can always be resolved via txt fuck the communications revolution has been a truly amazing event you would be old enough to remember what life was like pre mobile ph and all that went with not having immediate access to most people places you would not have had a mobile until sometime in the last 15yrs no as for being online and ocial media mmy calculations suggest you were a tad too late to have a bunch of embarrassing shit in cyberspace tf can you imagine what your girls would think say if they could have read a 16 20yo herby diary woooo lol personally i am most grateful the madness of my youth remains un documented with the proof residing only in the memories of a small group of people that said what do you think of the current social media platforms ie farcebook et al have your girls ever been negatively impacted via their fb use do you monitor or restrict their online behavior much i think we might have some excellent conversations so long as you do not over react or take offence too quickly as my politically in correct self and views is most likely to say some things which might be quite close to the nerve ie talking about your past your ex etc and we could mis take each other until we become a tad more familiar with each others voices and intonation of them i have no interest in being involved in any kind of emotive arguments however i am interested in discussing such topics with you as long as we have a mutual understanding that imho the whole purpose of these discussions with you initially is to continue discussing what we have begun to which will include me challenging some of the ideas you have and to offer you alternative ways of considering the issues at hand which could be quite confrontational that said of course this cuts both ways in that any of these guidelines are open to discussion and i think i too could learn a lot from talking with you at least i am 100 open to new ideas or new ways of thinking about old ideas i am actually quite fascinated to learn more about how a female aussie teenager thinks in 2017 something i imagine you have a fair idea about i hope you too are open to new ideas and have the courage to change those things which you realize were mistakes for as my saying goes the is no right or wrong ther only right and left if you were left not right you were learning as we discussed at the very beginning of this intercourse about the difference between a wise man and a fool and about not only learning from one own mistakes but to also learn from other people mistakes i am far from perfect but i have learned that i am capable of giving good advice as i have experienced so much compared to most that not bragging as it a fact sadly i have been the recipient of much are sentment jealousy due to my natural skills i guess you could say it the tall poppy syndrome where people who feel they are lesser and try to bring you down to their level aka misery loves company or jealousy a curse however the converse is also true where a happy person can light up a room and i try to be a light rather than a drainbow and i am a very optimistic person so the latter is more my style i am inclined to make people smile and laugh d i am not a fan of selfish superficial self centered people at all but that a conversation for a realtime tm conversation lol anyway i am about to have some dinner but i will be back in an hour or so i hope ur having a good one sis hehe and thanks for the kind thoughts they are appreciated coming from anyone with your attitude empathy btw i wonder if i was a tad aspie asperger syndrome as i have always been a bit weird compared to my peers and sometimes i have very different opinions from most people although i have noticed more and more people these days esp the younger ones are begining to consider things most people in my generation gave zero thought surprisingly quite a lot of people i grew up with are now dead and yet i was voted the most likely to die young by almsot everyone who knew me and not just becoz i rode a motorbike for my first 6yrs on the road i did not even get a car licence until i was about 23 by which time i would had the 3 accidents i feared 1 someone going through a stop sign and i have got nowhere to go bang ouch 2 someone in this case it was an off duty cop doing a u turn in front of me leaving me nowhere to go but smash oooh aaarrgh ouch 3 getting hit from behind while i am doing a right hand turn that the crash which caused the injury which fucked up last year causing the issue which required surgery now that hurt but

RPmatrix, but i say the efforts to disrupt failed because despite the lack of direction the occupation was still happening as much as the media tried to write the occupiers off they still held the parks and the streets across the country that when it moved from the subtle methods into the more forceful police removals of the occupiers from the public spaces a complete tptb victory would have been the protestors arguing and splitting from within the fact that they had to resort to force meant only a partial victory ah gotcha and yeah bro we are on the same side lol occupy at least my direct involvement with it seemed to transcend the right left paradigm and actually address class issues in a non partisan non electoral politics way that i had not seen before at least in my life this is incredibly important and sadly something i doubt will happen again soon in the incredibly polarized america that i see it fucking crazy how extremely opposed to each other both sides are i hate to say it but i could see this left vs right crap in the us devolving into a civil war something i am sure tptb would not mind one little bit but people who leaned left or right could agree on at least a few things like the mic surveillance state debt backed currency etc even if only in broad strokes now the partisanship has almost completely taken over the right has taken to defending trump against all attacks primarily by latching on to things like seth rich and dnc corruption and the left seems to subsist on attacking trump as if he is somehow the only problem it would have been the same had the election gone the other way trump and clinton both make excellent lightning rods to deflect from any real criticism of the systemic issues of our political and economic system you say it the problem is the economic situation in the us could quite easily become the catalyst which sparks the civil unrest as the have nots rebel and these days the have not include many people with uni degrees of all sorts who are having trouble even getting minimum wage work it fucking crazy and one thing i think iis greatly to blame is how cumbersome the us ystem has become which means it has so much inertia it will take a lot to change it peacefully,1,conspiracy
RPmatrix, i think occupy was at least in some sense a truly organic movement but in some ways destined to fail by it lack of a central goal and in another unable to fail in that it had no goal other than awareness well said i agree 100 yeah including the fascism comment definition was an afterthought i normally find people who use the word a tad fanatical but as i wrote the post i realized that was pretty much exactly what i was describing and when i checked the definition viola i had to include it as it also the basis of the kommunism that so hated in the us the things with occupy was that it was shut down by force even when several groups are located outside of the city centers they will still evicted shortly thereafter althiough they did have a lot of suppport from the average white collar worker passing by their lack of a clearly defined goal was the main problem it did raise the global awareness of things many people had been blind to before esp things llike the 1 and all that goes wwith it i am looking forward to the day when someone comes up with a better organized activist group clearly focused on raising this awareness even more maybe then if another similar demonstration was done it might have a better result but that said i am more inclined to think if there even is a next time i think tptb will shut it down faster than i can say hit tptb desperately want more control over the internet it would not surprise me at all if those recent worldwide ddos attacks which shut down the us internet for several hours was clearly intended to create a window for someone to are move something that had or would appear online and or they were a test run to see how successfully tptb could hut down online comms in the case of a domestic uprising i hate to think what nefarious plans are in store for the future btw i did not get what you meant saying this the active suppression by nypd at the behest of wall st itself and dhs including in my city in some way speaks to the fact that it was not going in the direction the wielders of power wanted it to how do you figure it was not going as planned by the wall st boys ,4,conspiracy
RPmatrix, the reaction can again be organic but it often pushed or guided in the media by government sources or other parties who have an interest in the desired solution the reaction usually takes the form of the public demanding that some action be taken to prevent the problem from occurring again this describes the occupy movement perfectly but look how tptb chose to handle it and stopping those protests was a direct violation of the first ammendment congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances the actions taken against the occupiers was across the world were effectively the actions of fascist governments but goverment the people believe are democracies surely these actions are self evident that the people have very little say in the actions of our governments imho the real problem lies with the ptb henchmen their ennforcers who are prepared to accept money for acting against their own peers people it never ceases to amaze me how the people will accept the nuremberg defense i was just following orders doing my job yeah a job killing people in horrible ways it was not an acceptable excuse for committing war crimes back in 1948 and neither should it ever be an acceptable reason for commiting attrocities against any humans and the same should apply double in peacetime there should be no excuse for following orders that harm the civilian population any civilian population if only the people would wake up and realize that us would efence spending is simply an incrediby effective way to channel taxes to those people who are the friends of tptb wish to the bottom line really is that simple not to mention the us has not faced any threats from other countries since ww2 but that has not stopped them getting involved as that what makes the mic go around as eisenhower warned us about will happen if left unchecked and it was with the vietnam war with us involvement begun with a false flag incident being the excuse to keep on making weapons and more weapons made by companies owned by people like the bush halliburton et al with the murican people paying their taxes so that their gubmint can spend it on overpriced military hardware made by their mates it the perfect way to channel money to your mates and nobody noticed the scam until recently who can argue about the multi billion price of a submarine and should we be told that sub sunk and with it 5billion who is in a position to argue but you can bet half that money went to a small bunch of hareholders in the companies multiple that made the sub but worse the us as far as we know has spent over 6trillion in classified projects since ww2 that what they have told us has been spent but do not forget rumsfelds missing billions he was asked about on 9 10 01 or the more recent missing billions look who made all the money which we can now clearly see but do you think anyone is going to take halliburton or the clinton foundation to task ffs they are not even going to give hitlary a slap on the wrist for her totally illegal ap server in the closet fiasco the people no longer have any power in the us and if they do have anything which might disrupt tptb plan as we all know they die in a variety of unusual and at times unbelievable ways ie suicide by two shots to the back of the head definition of fascism a political philosophy movement or regime such as that of the fascisti that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader severe economic and social regimentation and forcible suppression of opposition ,2,conspiracy

RPmatrix,that good to hear i rarely spend so much time typing online to another person but i had a feeling vibe you herby are a bit different to many idk but this reply suggests this to me in fact sitting up and typing is one of the more difficult things to do as my back begins to cramp up after 5 10mins so i then need to lie down before i can continue and as much as i appreciate the thought i am pleased for you that your recovery is going well i wonder what difference if any such a comment makes to me it a bit like those people i had never known who would come up to me at my mothers fathers funerals and say i am so sorry for your loss and i would think really i have never even met you and i doubt you have any idea how i am feeling nor do you realize how i consider such comments from these people as pathetic attempts to pretend to be doing the right thing i am not accusing you of having this same attitude but i am not sure why you think it necessary to say such a thing how do you think making such comments does help it might seem strange but i think i am a little bit autistic re such things i am honestly puzzled by some people behavior eg those people in the us who will say to anyone who claims to have been in the military thnk you for your service wtf people who say such things have no fucking clue imo as there nothing good about what the us military does not since ww2 and even then i am not sure i think political correctness is fubar and a way to force get people to only talk about the currently approved newspeak topics as a way to control the narrative not unlike how the idea of conspiracy theorists was created by the cia to discredit anyone who questioned the official story re jfk death or a bit later on those who mentioned the gulf of tonkin incident was a false flag event which effectivey began america participation in the vietnam war were called conspiracy theorists until the official secrets were released proving beyond any doubt that the gulf of tonkin incident was indeed a false flag event and do not get me started on 911 wow the masses are appropriately called the heeple and useless eaters by tptb i grew up amongst these people and am

worked for them for 30yrs and the things he told me re the highly sophisticated stupidity he does which makes him and his clients huge amounts of money would be considered bullshit by the average person that why they are average people but at least these heeple are in no way 1 100th as ruthless as these captains of industry are my bil is a good guy but he sold his morals for a multi million dollar job and this is fucked up i have two nieces and two nephews the oldest is now 25 and she just become a dr alas she a stunning looking but deceitful woman who still cannot admit to her mother father a conversation i had with her on the ph 18yrs ago to this day she denies talking to me on that ooccaision but as i said to my sister how else would i know about x to which my sister will say with an exasperated tone oh i do not know and that that the problem here is that my niece has been regularly lying to her mother since she was a little girl but my sister cannot see wo not believe this and her father was at work for 12 hrs a day when she was growing up so he never saw it my sister lives in her own little and very wealthy world search domain en wikipedia org https en wikipedia

world me thinks we are heading into a 1984 scenario right now and imo that as fucked up as it gets ffs who would want to bring a child into this world the way it currently is there no way you can even assure them of a future worth living unless of course one ignores everything outside of their family like my sister does but she would be fucked without all the money she has and pretends the are st

struck up a dialogue with him after about 8mths via text we began to talk on the ph i spoke with him this morning he gone from being a 17yo virgin with bad oneitis for one of the girls in his church lol but as a direct result of my support and advice she now a notch on his bedstead lol and he working full time and considering a trip downunder at some time in the future had i not become involved with him i would bet cash money he would now be riding his bicycle around as a mormon missionary going from house to house preaching the lawd werd and being thoroughly miserable in the process i laugh

RPmatrix,y know i was open to this idea until i did some research on it and i discovered they have only been temporary changes in the schumann resonance in the article you linked it subtly says this but does not expand on it eg on january 31 2017 for the first time in recorded history the schumann resonance reached frequencies of 36 hz notice how the article does not say for how long the frequency stayed up it was considered an anomaly when in 2014 this frequency rose from its usual 7 83 hz to somewhere in the 15 25 hz levels hang on a tick it just said on january 31 2017 for the first time in recorded history but then it jumps back to 2014 saying about 2014 wtf if you do some research you will find the schumman resonance has often fluctuated this global electromagnetic resonance phenomenon is named after physicist winfried otto schumann who predicted it mathematically in 1952 schumann resonances occur because the space between the surface of the earth and the conductive ionosphere acts as a closed waveguide the limited dimensions of the earth cause this waveguide to act as a resonant cavity for electromagnetic waves in the elf band the cavity is naturally excited by electric currents in lightning schumann resonances are the principal background in the part of the electromagnetic spectrum from 3 hz through 60 hz and appear as distinct peaks at extremely low frequencies elf around 7 83 hz fundamental 14 3 20 8 27 3 and 33 8 hz anyway here an article in a new wave magazine from 15yrs ago one of the more balanced ones which states earth background base frequency or heartbeat schumann resonances fluctuates but is not rising dramatically despite a new age meme that alleges it the authors have been unable to substantiate a rising sr in the literature and ben lonetree readings directly contradict it sr is stable it is not rising those who say it is are ignorant dis or mis informed and parroting the mistakes or lies of others though it varies between geographical regions for decades the overall measurement has remained 7 8 cycles per second http sedonanomalies weebly com schumann resonance html i too make the mistake of taking some ideas too easily when they really should be challenged and contested as i did do re the idea of the schumman resonance increasing before accepting the word of some other person just sayin,1,conspiracy

RPmatrix,wow i am not sure if you are being serious but if you are i am surprised and sincerely impressed by your honesty for if you are this honest with yourself you are definitely on the right path to sorting out the shit of the past and making it the fertilizer of the future d i am impressed not becoz of your approval of my advice but becoz the difference between a wise person and a fool is that whilst they will both make mistakes the wise person will not only try to learn from their mistakes they will also try to learn from the other people mistakes as shakespear said nothing is right or wrong only thinking maketh it so or as i say there right and left not right and wrong and when you were left you were learning which is what we are here for life on this planet is a big school for us to learn from and all of our experiences are valuable if one cares to think about it as you are doing now and have been doing during this would iscussion tbh i was not expecting this response but if it sincere you sound like my type of person i was being curt and to the point as i am tired of having senseless online discussions with opinionated people i would not do so irl but i think you know what i mean funnily i think we would have clashed had we met in day to day circumstances that involved any kind of would is agreement lol but after having this online discussion with you that would no longer be the case so i was being very hort sharp and direct to stop you from bullshiting both me and you i thought you would stop replying long before now lol ime a typical female would for are asons i know well but wo not get into here but a word which usually not always negates all that goes before it but you did not respond with complete bullshit you were being quite honest which surprised me and consequently took the edge off my have rbal assault which tbh was what it really was it became from me more of a okaaay you seem to be quite genuine if a tad selective with your replies so i will throw in some food for thought and see what happens and wow really if the information i have shared with you has truly helped you i thank you for letting me know it was typing well spent d the two things we can give away and never lose are what we know and how we feel i can give you everything i know and yet still have it for myself and just as misery loves company a happy person can light up a room but this too is a conversation for another time we all fuck up if you do not fuck up you are not doing it right as iirc yoda said to his young student i am a master becoz i have fucked up failed at more things than you have even attempted but you can learn other ways from your and other mistakes by thinking about them or meditating upon them which most people do not do once their problem is over for they think why bother which becomes a habit that becomes their boring hard sad lives and sometimes our mistakes just seem so huge that it hard to ee a way to fix them and so you are sign themselves to thinking that just how it is and there nothing i can do about it and so they question it no further and maintain the tatus quo as best they can becoz they have no more ideas about what to do if only they were to look for answers outside of the people ways they currently know there a fair chance they will find some ideas they can work with and when they do they get great results and so they will hopefully continue on this path of discovery alas sadly those people living the formulaic lives as instructed by popular opinion lives that are entirely predictable and mindless are the people who are least likely to notice these things when they happen and ergo fail to act upon them so nothing happens do what you did and you will get what you got if nothing changes nothing changes and all things begin in the mind and if that person then acts upon that knowledge things will change and as everything leads to something else by moving forwards maybe not always but by moving things will change nonetheless and if you move in the right way there a fair chance you will get the right results sometimes life is like maths it logical sadly most people seem not to be there a great book by an israeli social science researcher named dan ariely he writen a few great books and this one is called rationally irrational and he explains the methods and results of his tests which are surprising to say the least as they clearly show people much of the time people in general do not behave rationally in many of their day to day decisions he writes really well and makes it fun to read his methods for working such things out are pretty cool too you might like it knowledge is power in this series of posts betweeen us you have done all these things and looking at it from this pov i am not surprised you say this was an interesting conversation and one that has left me with more questions than answers lol that another main reason i am impressed with your replies and responses after

help you change you and your children situations for the better best which is something i would be 100 happy to share what knowledge i have on whatever matters they are i grew up in a priveledged world going to private schools but my mother died when i was 13 and when my father when i was 17 i had just finished school and suddenly found myself on the streets i have had several successful business and am currently recovering from major surgery on my spine partially reparing and old motorcycle crash injury so i am not working but i have a small income that gets me by plus healthcare down here is all free i was only talking with my gp yesterday how the operation and hospital stay would have bankrupted me in the us it would have easily cost me at least 500k in the us probabaly closer to 1million whatever there no way i could have afforded it in the us but that too is another story and the truth is true is does not change so i have no trouble at all remebering all my tories

RPmatrix,tbh friend i no longer know who who then there far too much of the old false flag bullshit going on these days to really know who is really behind the flag they fly uniforms they wear false flag operations work so well becoz it so simple it works just do your plundering and killing dressed as someone else pirates had figured this out hundreds of years ago and if you fly your flag well your opponent might even open the door for you to come in eg we have all seen the bullshit false flag events in the us eg recently marathon movies schooling with crisis actors who keep popping up after they die a very strange occurance that been happening since the turn of the century 9 11 2001 to be precise moreand more people are dying in a terrorist event and then amazingly being found having respawned as somebody else it like magic i tell ya like the magic 911 passport but much better ever since then we have seen more and more false flag events where i have no idea exactly who was responsible and neither does anyone else but whereas i am happy to keep an open mind until i have sufficient evidence to support my opinion unlike most of these people who do not want to appear ignorant if asked about it so they obtain an opinion from various sources that 30 yrs ago were mainly the msm but the internet has changed everything esp when it comes to obtaining an opinion lol esp for people under 35yo evenn though they too are strongly influence by the mainstream media particularly through the advertising of various age and demographic specific products these people are also the first to post their opinions on fb or yt and things grow organically from there like those ridiculously well produced beheading videos made by i am not sure i am still undecided as i have read some quite convincing evidence that at least half of them are cia funded promotional videos supported by cgi trickery which does not surprise me one bit not with people who can and will turn towers into dust now as more and more people get there opinions equally from things like fb feeds and sites like reddit as they do from the msm which btw still has a very strong influence on society whether they like it or not esp with the conservative over 50 yo who often still get the bulk of their information about stuff from the msm via the tv radio and newspapers they have done so since they could then they want their kids to agree with them so they teach their children to have the same beliefs as they do whether or not these beliefs are useful or not people on the whole are selfish and stupid the kind of people i am thinking of would never even think of what we are discussing let alone actually know anything about it ignorance is bliss and religion is the opium of the masses whereas in people under 30yo where popular opinion reigns are highly influence by the opinions of their friends and the beliefs which get spread are not only 100 wrong they do real damage even though some are funny if it happens to someone else eg telling people they can fast charge their new iphones by putting them in the microwave or they can be made waterproof by download an app the crazy part is lots of people have fallen for such bullshit do not get me started on the effects of cyberbullying on a kid with shitty parents so as for the validiity of what i read hear or even see unless it with my own two eyes i am skeptical until sufficiently convinced otherwise that said it does not surprise me that duterte would use a false flag to give killings ordered by him to have a modicum of plausible deniability aka it was not me it was them points finger shows flag passport found in rubble ,2,Philippines

RPmatrix,i was lucky that i had a friend lt jim sullivan of the brockton police department he showed up at my bail hearing and said something to the judge and my bail was reduced to 500 00 is somebody trying to tell me something oh well back to work i built two more fuel implosion systems i installed them in a 1973 olds cutlass and 1966 mustang i painted my 1973 dodge station wagon bright yellow with big red letters all over it saying this car gets over 100 mpg and does not pollute the air the big boys are trying to make me and this car disappear help me i only got to drive my yellow wagon for 3 days on november 24 1986 brockton chief of police richard sprawls and other members of the brockton police department raided my tremont st brockton home they seized two shotguns a 12 ga and a 20 ga both were legally registered to me i used to use them for skeet shooting i was arrested and charged with for trafficking of cocaine again my bail was revoked i was placed in maximum security in the plymouth house of correction i was now sentenced to 15 years for the july 1986 trafficking of cocaine and waiting for the second trial for the november case i knew where i could get some solid evidence that would clear me but i did not know who to trust anymore so i escaped from maximum security went and got my solid evidence and gave it to the right person and surrendered the same day boy i was lucky they had over 240 law enforcement offers searching for me with guns dogs helicopters etc i ran like a jackrabbit through the woods my advantage was the woods were my old hunting grounds two days later brockton chief of police was arrested for stealing cocaine from the police evidence locker he was sentenced to two years in prison remember the cocaine that chief richard sprawls said he found at my home in july and november 1986 now i know where it came from the police evidence locker and it fell out of chief sprawl pocket onto the floor in my home where another brockton police officer found it well the massachusetts supreme court of appeals overturned my cocaine trafficking conviction grounds tainted evidence illegal search and seizure freedom and home here i come wrong again here comes the feds they had a warrant for my arrest for violating a new gun law that was passed on november 24 1986 that was just 10 days after my arrest of november 14 1986 remember the brockton police seized my two shotguns guess what i had the privilege of being the first person in massachusetts and the third person in the united states to be tried prosecuted and sentenced under this new law 18 usc 922g and 924e i did not stand a chance there was no case law in the law books to support my defense of this new law i was sentenced to two 5 years sentences for perjury because when i bought the two shotguns there was a box that said were you ever convicted of a felony i checked the no box because i was never convicted of a felony just a misdemeanor well the feds said under federal law my misdemeanor was a felony therefore i was guilty of 2 counts of perjury and they gave me 5 years on each count next i got 5 years for being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm now i have been sentenced to a total of 15 years in federal prison without parole i am still sitting in the courtroom after a week of trial my attorney said that the us attorney was trying me under the second part of the new law my attorney said the trial will be short wo not last more that ten minutes there was no way i could be found not guilty well it went like this 1 i was convicted as a felon in possession of a firearm 2 i was convicted of perjury 3 i was convicted of a second count of perjury bingo i hit the jack pot usc 18922g e1 states if you have 3 prior felony convictions and have possession of a fire arm then you are an armed career criminal and that carries a minimum mandatory sentence of 15 years without parole now i have a total of 30 years in federal prison without parole well the feds have me tucked away for 30 years where i cannot cause any more trouble with my fuel implosion system wrong wrong wrong i met a lot of powerful people in the federal prison with powerful connections on the outside among them kenny whose son was a patent attorney for a large patent law firm who did our us patent 5 782 225 while i sat in the safety of the federal prison system remember the feds sentenced me to 30 years without parole well on september 13 1997 friday the 13th my lucky day i was released from federal prison with 5 years parole stop something wrong here i only did 10 years of a 30 year sentence with no chance of parole well it took the federal courts to rule that it was legal for me to possess the two shotguns that they had no jurisdiction the case is now pending in the 1st district court they will not rule on it this september 2001 will be 4 years that i have been out of federal prison and have been a good boy nice and quiet until now my intentions in the past 20 years i found out that the oil companies will do everything in their power to suppress this kind of technology because it could reduce the gasoline consumption in the america by 76 over a 5 year term the government will lose mega bucks in gasoline taxes the major car manufacturers will lose billions spent on the technology of the fuel injection systems my technology makes theirs obsolete i put all my patent and shop drawings up on this website for anybody to use it free i am 58 1 2 years young now the sand is running out of my hour glass fast i do not want to take this technology to my grave with me if you think that i should get something out of this then build my fuel implosion system and after your 5th tank of gas send me the price of a tank of gas otherwise i do not want a cent if you believe that me and my patent and technology have been suppressed then tell as many people as you can about my story and ask them to do the same the reason i ask this is i believe that millions of people around the globe want this kind of technology and know it exists when we get enough people wanting this technology i have powerful attorneys who know and are able to present it to the courts of the globe i will take my remaining 7 cars that have my fuel implosion system in them out of exile and drive them from boston to california with the whole world watching and i think my chances of reaching california alive are excellent by me publishing this website i must be out of my mind what else could happen to me maybe i will get killed or something what will be will be thank you for your interest please help me spread the word and for those of you that think that my story is just a bunch of bad luck for an unlucky inventor you will be of those who oppose this

RPmatrix,we willl simply jam your streaming until we sink you which should only take a few hours at most then at this point we would say it said by someone that a few hours ago after being hit by a mola mola in a freak accident u boat was sunk which is why the radio cut out at the time it did wit the impact with the fich knocking out some of the electronics and it users out and they sadly went down with the ship there were no survivors from the crew of one for we i really meant to say them but english is not my first language so i think i fronted it to backwards no ,3,conspiracy
RPmatrix,you will find the link to the article that quote came from in my other posts itt and yeah it is pretty cool huh hehe ,1,Futurology
RPmatrix,pfffftt what a smutty mind you have op looking at this everyone knows it short for cucumber duh ,1,WTF
RPmatrix,i hear you but i am not sure that the way these guys are calculating these losses there are other ways than the one s you have just mentioned ,1,Futurology
RPmatrix, you are suggesting generating energy for this through solar power no not me elon musk who thinks he can have a car that has solar cells embedded in the bodywork all across the car which will be sufficient to power the car and charge the batteries fast enough so theoretically the car wil keep going until something breaks or the batteries wear out he thinks very soon the efficiency of solar cells will be high enough that the surface area of a tesla will have enough cells on it to generate sufficient immediate power it whilst out driving on the road there would be a small interim battery that holds a minimal required amount to keep the system running at night and in storms tesla has cornered the world market on battery research and manufacture they want need to buy about a third of the world lithium supplies this year just to make the batteries for the cars they are going to produce in 2017 it amazing crazy ,1,Futurology
RPmatrix,i wasn t even considering fuel cells as the energy tranfer system and nuclear power and grid losses wut there no way you can make any comparison to the would evice in this article and all the unneccessary complications ou have aded into the equation talk about straw men stick too the topic the picture in my mind should work well andd is much simpler but that just like my opinion man you have got your opinion and i have got mine ,1,Futurology
RPmatrix,correct however as always all matter contains stored energy it releasing that energy in a controlled fashion that makes all the difference as to how you can use that source of energy hydrogen gives up a lot of it energy when it burns it very easy to make hydrogen burn in burning it giving up it energy as heat which can be changed into another form of energy ie kinetic energy and the exhaust gases from combustion which can also be utilised to spin turbines anyway mypoint is easily available hydrogen easily availble energy which can then be converted into a myriad of other uses when this happens and you no longer need to be on the grid to have electricity i do not think that 12 in costs through losses is any big deal compared to the high energy bills of the past and anyway that all depends on the cost of running one of these as a power generator but these guys did say it incredibly low and i think they were generalizing with the currently available alternative energy products now being produced bottom line 12 is sfa of a loss esp if the initial cost is like a dollar ,1,Futurology
RPmatrix, my iphone was in the other room and also takes lousy pictures so did not try to take a pic it would have only appeared as a dot anyway i was going to ask you exactly this i was going to ask you how you thought it would look on a ph camera even a very good one the human eye is pretty amazing when it comes to picking out moving objects at huge distances shit you can literally see the sun move across the sky so we can see things which cameras often cannot except by using various long exposures but that not real time and esp in lower light conditions ie sunset we can see small moving objects from much further more clearly than most ph camera can anyway i imagine that even if you had got some reasonably clear footage of this orb and posted it here you would be quickly told it a balloon duh imho it sounds most unusual op definitely a ufo ,2,UFOs

RPmatrix, o 55 51 mol of h2 after electrolysis of h2o 111 90 g of h2 how did you get these numbers how did you acertain what amount of power electricity is used for the electrolysis different charges would create different rates of electrolysis and it not state how much water the 1 5v system was able to plit in a day 24hrs afaik there no constant to use to calculate such if i am wrong please enlighten me d,1,Futurology

RPmatrix,yes it a bloody strange situation as an independent swedish energy company elforsk although the authors of the paper wrote that they were not in control of all of the aspects of the process they concluded that even by the most conservative of measurements the device produced excess heat with a resulting energy density that was at least one order of magnitude and possibly several higher than any other conventional energy source 29 30 31 the test was partly funded by the swedish energy research consortium elforsk hmmm something definitely not quite right but i am not sure it rossi invention ,1,Futurology

RPmatrix,na this one must have been a baby as it was not much bigger than a couple of soccer balls,2,WTF
RPmatrix,ahh but the beauty here is that it not a closed system when you are using water as the primary feed source i get newton 2nd law but this in now way challeges it it just up until recently our ability to obtain the most available energy from non radioactive fuels is very low eg reciprocating engines like cars have are 20 efficient jet turbines are 50 60 effective but we do not get much better than that until now look up andrea rossi e cat to see something very similar that has already been tested but still many have are accusing him of fraud but this would iscovery itt only substatiates the possibilit he does have an effective device although he say his device works via cold fusion but apparently it not the type we are familar with and with all that said he could also be a total fraud idk in may 2013 a non peer reviewed paper describing results obtained from evaluations of the operation of the e cat ht in two test runs was submitted to the arxiv digital archive although the authors of the paper wrote that they were not in control of all of the aspects of the process they concluded that even by the most conservative of measurements the device produced excess heat with a resulting energy density that was at least one order of magnitude and possibly several higher than any other conventional energy source the test was partly funded by the swedish energy research consortium elforsk elforsk stated on their website that the results were very remarkable but that it was highly questionable to speculate whether nuclear transformation had occurred when no access had been provided to the reactant the only difference was that rossi kept the catalyst a secret so he could capitalise on his energy generators but he may have shot himself in the foot by doing so now that this oxide is years old news although iirc his catalyst was also nickle based very interesting nonethelesss i would happily bet cash money that this invention has in fact been known of for many decades but the powers running the power utiities made sure such knowledge stayed are pressed until they decided the time was right to expose it devices like these combined with a few solar panels a wind water generator and some deep cycles lead acid batteries and a household could easily become completely off the grid they could still use electric cars as their power systems should easily be able to charge a prius overnight shit the model 3 tesla roadster might have a built in solar roof that constantly recharges the car when it in the light you are just being a party pooper anyway i reckon the chances of tptb allowing the development of such devices will stop them getting into we consumer hands anytime soon btw this article was first published in june of 2015 and what is happened soince then nada that what and imho for the are asons i just suggested ,0,Futurology
RPmatrix,cool llet me know what you think and it really could do with watching it a couple of times as there so much going on at times with so many characters all real playing themselves most of the time it can get a bit confusing and the sound track rocks iirc so i hope you enjoy it ,2,WTF
RPmatrix,wtf are you talking about you are not quite correct with your assumption i do not utfse as i do i am not as stupid as your mirror looks so save your bitching concern trolling for those people who ask you to do it for them ie can anyone verify for me that what u gboob is saying about x and y is true so you can are st assured that it was not me if when such a thing occurs,0,WTF
RPmatrix,thanks for the heads up and the alt link good stuff friend imo he far too close for their comfort and everyday physics is beginning to caatch up to black budget physics which is not good as far as the have sted interests are concerned if it get taken down from vimeo you know there something going on copy it bro for posterity sake i am going to,7,UFOs

RPmatrix,i hit a smaller size wombat while driving i was halfway around a bend and doing 130kmh on a pitch black night when bang and my head lights suddenly went out at 80mph going around a medium tight bend at first just before i hit it i thought it was just a patch in the midddle of the road and only realised it was 3d like a rock about 10mts 0 1 seconds before i hit it and i still did not know wtf it was i would just hit as the impact had shorted out my headlight relay after hitting it the next thing i knew was i was driving in the pitch back using my rapidly fading aftervision you know the image that left behind happens when you turn the light off i was would riving by that i hit the brakes and stopped as quickly as possibly while i could still see and found myself perfectly in the middle of the road my car straddling the road center line once i stopped and fiddled about a bit i discovered that i still had low beam headlights only as the shock of hitting the little cunt had knocked out a relay so i could still drive i had no idea what i had hit so i reversed back to it and it was a widdle wombat who only apparent injury was a small cut on it nose i think it had been hit by a truck before me fortunately could still drive as i was miles from anywhere i just had to go a bit slower i would forgotten all about that until this thread jarred my memory it a surprisingly vivid memory i gueess it was hocked into me as it was a bum clenching moment edits many basic mistakes,3,WTF

RPmatrix, hydrogen from water is not an energy source hydrogen is hydrogen regardless of how you get it and hydrogen is indeed an energy source if it was not nobody would be talking about powering anything with it ,1,Futurology
RPmatrix, does not change the fact that you are always gonna require more energy to break water into oxygen and hydrogen than what you get from burning hydrogen not so and this discovery is an example this bi functional catalyst can split water continuously for more than a week with a steady input of just 1 5 volts of electricity that s an unprecedented water splitting efficiency of 82 percent at room temperature i have zero doubt the energy available from the hydrogen produced is far greater than the costs of all 1 5volts of electricity plus the catalyst nickle iron oxide which is cheap as and some water but you are right as using a quality feedstock like evian might be a tad pricey,0,Futurology

RPmatrix,solar panel manufacture is far from the most toxic manufacturing process around the problem is countries like china which make a large percentage of the world solar panels are well known for their lack of enviromental concern management of toxic materials in the us and most other first world countries such things are strictly monitored fabricating the panels requires caustic chemicals such as sodium hydroxide and hydrofluoric acid and the process uses water as well as electricity the production of which emits greenhouse gases it also creates waste these problems could undercut solar ability to fight climate change and reduce environmental toxics a new ranking of 37 solar manufacturers the solar scorecard shows that some companies are doing better than others chinese manufacturer trina scored best followed by california based sunpower but solar manufacturers in the united states are subject to both federal and state rules that dictate for example how and where they can dispose of toxic wastewater in europe recent regulations mandate the reduction and proper disposal of hazardous electronic waste that the next big problem with solar panels recycling them right now nobody is doing it so they are ending up as landfill http news nationalgeographic com news energy 2014 11 141111 solar panel manufacturing sustainability ranking ,1,Futurology

RPmatrix,it well worth it in itself but it possibly the best example of aussie cultural mentalities that as there more than one menatlity that falls under the aussie umbrella as there over 200 recognized nartionalities living in oz although we tend to stick to the basic genders y know guys gals gays lesbians and trannys as our way of compensating lol seriously though what the us calls third wave feminism happened in oz back in the 1980 kk that when all the lesbian feminist separatists appeared women who said shit like women need men like fish need bikes which is a pretty funny metaphor image imho and as the dykes often wore dark blue singlets we nicknamed them the truckies coz that what they tended to look like chunky truck drivers who wear blue singlets and specifically dark blue singlets were aka wifebeaters coz most working class men would first wear a blue singlet to their jobs in summer then get pissed on the way home and then when they got home no telly in those days they would have a sporting wack at beating the wife for any good reason like unwifeliness by doing things like not having dinner ready when he 4 hrs late but we are a young and progressive nation who pride ourselves on our collective cool and ability to remain calm in a crisis my guess is that it become an aussie epigentic trait our aussie born evolutionary advantage becoz with so many things that can kill ya down here that a bloody handy trait to have when the shovel hit the fangs as the people who froze instead of swinging usually died as the result so open minded as we are when confronted with all this exuality stuff by those raunchy gay fags from sydney in 1978 here what happened on 24 june 1978 at 10 pm as a night time celebration following a morning protest march and commemoration of the stonewall riots organised by the gay solidarity group more than 500 people gathered on oxford street in a planned street festival calling for an end to discrimination against homosexuals in employment and housing an end to police harassment and the repeal of all anti homosexual laws now here the true aussie spirit coming into play as the figure rose to around 2 000 as revellers out for the saturday night at oxford street bars and clubs responded to the call out of the bars and into the streets these were all the straight people who could see what was going on and it was not cricket so they joined in with the marchers against the police becoz the cops were being cunts and nobody here likes the wrong kind of cunts although the organisers had obtained permission this was revoked and the parade was broken up by the police after the parade was dispersing in kings cross 53 of the participants were arrested although most charges were eventually dropped the sydney morning herald published the names of those arrested in full leading to many people being outed to their friends and places of employment and many of those arrested lost their jobs as homosexuality was a crime in new south wales nsw until 1984 only two people who were arrested were fined the rest were released without bail and the charges dismissed but the overall effect was what we now call the striesand effect as all this only made the public more aware of the unfairness in the way being gay was illegal when prostitution is not na the aussie people were not going to accept that shit and the laws were changed by 1984 wooo the police response to a legal local minority protest transformed it into a nationally significant event which stimulated gay rights and law reform campaigns nowadays are lgbti rights an issue here in oz not that i am aware of and there nothing even like the us feminist madness i see on tv over here we figured out all that shit almost 30 yrs ago imho the one thing which has a huge but mainly unnoticed effect on our society is the fact that prostistution is legal countrywide the rules vary sliightly from state to state with only nsw legally allowing treetwalkers everywhere else it either via brothels colloquially known as massage parlours with happy ending lol or escort services and single women advertising their professional services but the consequences are a much less sexually confused country than the us although tbh it hard to imagine a more sexually confused country that the us the double standards are simply ridiculous eg you can have sex for money so long as it being filmed and the film is being made to make money or else it fucking prostitution gimme a break there no way an aussie would stand for such bullshit y know it times like this where i am proud of our my countries convict heritage it seems there was a stupid bullshit prohibited law that the average man agreed was a good idea sadly it become a tad diluted but at the end of the day we would much rather resolve our differences than to hold a grudge as you will see in the bra boys how the shit rolls during and after the cronulla riots the interactions between the aussie locals and a bunch of muslim blow ins who came from the subuirbs to their beach on a 42c day and began making sexist comments at aussie girls walking by which is what started the riots that day and they were definitely riots it was how the well knoiwn and respected alpha males of both groups took control and calmed everyone down stopping the fight and all any further bullshit was very cool 11 10 would recommend the

RPmatrix, if you say that racism against white people exists in certain contexts anyone who doesn think almost every culture has some form of racism is naive and with much to learn although ime knowledge of emotive things like love and racism tend to come from personal experience rather than other people or observation which many people simply do not have as they lead highly insular lives and avoid associating with those who are not like them so mall are the worlds these people live in many rarely travel beond their home towns and know even less about anyone else hometowns let alone countries if someone thinks that the non white cultures eg asians do not have issues with non asians then they have clearly never been to asia for starters and probably avoid asians whenever they can ergo sum their ignorance of anti white racism as i explained above lol if one of these people were to go to soweto in south africa and see how well your whiteness is recieved i have no doubt they would come back with a very different opinion if they live to tell the tale they will tell you how incredibly racist the blacks were to them lol regardless in some parts of the world white people are considered the baddest race there is people who say it impossible to be racist towards whites clearly have no clue as to what racism is in the 19th century many scientists subscribed to the belief that the human population can be divided into races the term racism is a noun describing the state of being racist ie subscribing to the belief that the human population can be classified according to race it was first defined by the oxford english dictionary as t he theory that distinctive human characteristics and abilities are determined by race which gives 1936 as the first recorded use additionally the oxford english dictionary records racism as a synonym of racialism belief in the superiority of a particular race by the end of world war ii racism had acquired the same supremacist connotations formerly associated with racialism racism now implied racial discrimination racial supremacism and a harmful intent the term race hatred had also been used by sociologist frederick hertz in the late 1920s as its history indicates popular use of the word racism is relatively recent the word came into widespread usage in the western world in the 1930s when it was used to describe the social and political ideology of nazism which saw race as a naturally given political unit racism is discrimination and prejudice towards people based on their race or ethnicity ergo sum any race or ethnic group which logically includes caucasions aka whites and anyone who say otherwise is a fool https en wikipedia org wiki racism,1,WTF

RPmatrix,that agreement known as opec insists that all oil trading must be done in us dollars which became known as petrodollars opec https en wikipedia org wiki opec the opec conference is the supreme authority of the organization and consists of delegations normally headed by the oil ministers of member countries the chief executive of the organization is the opec secretary general the conference ordinarily meets at the vienna headquarters at least twice a year and in additional extraordinary sessions when necessary it generally operates on the principles of unanimity and one member one vote with each country paying an equal membership fee into the annual budget opec often has difficulty agreeing on policy decisions because its 13 member countries differ widely in their oil export capacities production costs reserves geological features population economic development budgetary situations and political circumstances indeed over the course of market cycles oil reserves can themselves become a source of serious conflict instability and imbalances in what economists call the natural resource curse a further complication is that religion linked conflicts in the middle east are recurring features of the geopolitical landscape for this oil rich region however since saudi arabia is by far the largest and most profitable oil exporter in the world with enough capacity to function as the traditional swing producer to balance the global market it serves as opec de facto leader as of 2015 the 13 countries accounted for an estimated 42 percent of global oil production and 73 percent of the world proven oil reserves giving opec a major influence on global oil prices that were previously determined by american dominated multinational oil companies opec stated mission is to coordinate and unify the petroleum policies of its member countries and ensure the stabilization of oil markets in order to secure an efficient economic and regular supply of petroleum to consumers a steady income to producers and a fair return on capital for those investing in the petroleum industry this means that 3 4 of the oil traded worldwide is bought and sold in us dollars and if your country is not an opec member you could have trouble selling your oil eg for countries that export petroleum at relatively low volume their limited negotiating power as opec members would not necessarily justify the burdens imposed by opec production quotas and membership costs ecuador withdrew from opec in december 1992 because it was unwilling to pay the annual us 2 million membership fee and felt that it needed to produce more oil than it was allowed under its opec quota at the time although it rejoined in october 2007 similar concerns prompted gabon to suspend membership in january 1995 it rejoined in july 2016 in may 2008 indonesia announced that it would leave opec when its membership expired at the end of that year having become a net importer of oil and being unable to meet its production quota it rejoined the organization in january 2016 but announced another temporary suspension of its membership at year end when opec requested an opec are quest a demand a 5 percent production cut notice how all these coutries are joined opec once they discovered their oil trading hands were tied opec is an oligopoly https en wikipedia org wiki oligopoly and as with most oligopolies they are extremely powerful and influential and is the name for a group of companies with a monopoly on a product all this trading could be done using euros or yen or god forbid chinese yuan but if this were allowed it could would stop the us from having the controlling interest in this market as they currently do as well as removing all the associated profits from being a middleman in 3 4 pf the world oil supplies the us biggest concern is if say opec did not exist and the chinese yuan was allowed to be used to trade oil all the profits made by the financiers of us petrodollars would rapidly drop possibly to zero opec is most certainly considered too big to fail isis blackmarket sales of oil seriously disrupted iol prices for a while there a few years back this effect is still being felt by many iol producers as oil prices in 2017 are less than they were 10yrs ago just the usual skullduggery ,1,conspiracy

RPmatrix,well how about you stop behaving like one and maybe then you can learn something i am not trying to one up you and i meann no offence when i say as somone who nearly 40yrs your senior i am confident i know about things and i have experienced many things you have not this is not your fault as it hardly fair to compare our lives for who knows when you get to my age you too may have experienced not just as much but most likely more than me all i have been trying to do is to get you to think outside the box throw conventional and very conservative thinking out the window and come at an idea from another angle although to do so is far more difficult than most people imagine and as few people ever try or bother to think in such a way it easier to accept what you are taught by teachers of all kinds so not a lot of lateral thinking outside the square ever gets done we know of several great minds who were of this type of thinker from galilleo to mendel to newton to curie to franklin and tesla to the wright brothers and darwin to einstein and buckminster fuller et al these people used their minds to think about things in ways that other people had not they were able to make great contributions becoz of the efforts they put into thinking differently to everyone else in fact a number of very well known scientists were very solitary in their work as nobody else could understand it they correspponded with an elite few about their discipline of choice preferring a select few peers of their time eg a 17th century rich kid who enjoyed studying mathematics and back then only the very wealthy could afford such luxuries as studying but as his family were rich although he studied law he could afford to be mathematician nonetheless pierre de fermat was his name https en wikipedia org wiki pierre de fermat and what a mathematicion he was this kid was so smart and so talented at maths that soons his name was known in all the elite mathematical circles he also wrote all these number theory conjectures or mathematical problems some that were as old as calculus eg this last theorem he had worked out was something mathematicians worldwide had been trying to resolve for centuries and pierre fermat said that he had figured it out but the only working notes to his theory were in the margins of this book and nobody believed it would fit in such a small place lol so although fermat claimed to have proved all his arithmetic theorems few records of his proofs have survived many mathematicians including gauss doubted several of his claims especially given the difficulty of some of the problems and the limited mathematical methods available to fermat his famous last theorem was first discovered by his son in the margin in his father copy of an edition of diophantus and included the statement that the margin was too small to include the proof in number theory fermat last theorem sometimes called fermat conjecture especially in older texts states that no three positive integers a b and c satisfy the equation an bn cn for any integer value of n greater than 2 the cases n 1 and n 2 have been known to have infinitely many solutions since antiquity this theorem was first conjectured by pierre de fermat in 1637 in the margin of a copy of arithmetica where he claimed he had a proof that was too large to fit in the margin the first successful proof was released in 1994 by andrew wiles and formally published in 1995 after 358 years of effort by mathematicians andrew wiles wrote a book about how he went about figuring out fermat last theorem by thinking so far out of the box he was in another dimension altogether but he was the only person in 358 years of mathematicians trying to crack this last theorem that fermat had said he has already worked out but he died before he published his proof however people respected the fact he was a brilliant mathematician who had already produces reams and volumes of work of the highest quality so nobody would outright say fermat is lying he never figured that out coz it impossible as anyone who tried will know there is no answer oh really the answer was there and just had been waiting for someone to reconsider it in another way and poof the answer appeared it a great story the book a bit dry but wow what a feat i hope this gave you something to think about eg the ultimate logical science mathematics still has more unresolved problems like this conjectures in which nobody is even sure there is an answer just as they did with fermat last theorem except for fermat comments most people would have said it cannot be resolved and how wrong they were but the mind which believes there is no answer is the mind which wo not find one argue for your limitations and they shall be yours imho your absolute belief in hard science is at times actually and factually unfounded just as so many scientists who thought they had come to the final answer only to learn they are really just at the beginning ,1,conspiracy

RPmatrix,i have had an interest in this subject for many years did you know for instance that nikola tesla offered his wireless and free energy device to westinghouse who was his main financier but westinghouse would not have a bar of it becoz he could not put a meter on it and charge the people for using it free energy was onne of tesla great discoveries but he was stopped from sharing it with the world by tptb who had discredited him after tesla refusal to cooperate with them post the philadelphia experiments and he died quite poor a few years later and then the fbi stole all his notes after he died and has kept or tried to the info from the world since but russia maintained a scientific interest in tesla technology and helped a lot to are lease what they knew with other scientists the us have also had this technology since post ww2 so fortunately enough of his notes and the research of other scientists back then had already been published and with this many people have figured it out from the notes of tesla and other researchers in the fields he was into esp high voltage which are available online and elsewhere there a great site for all this type of stuff https peswiki com i think you will love it op d oh and here another one based on overunity devices http www overunity com community c24 which are fascinating in themselves there is some crossover in the ideas of both groups so yes yes there is amazing free energy devices that can be made but whoever makes one will get shut down asap if they try to hare it with anyone ever again yes there is most definitely currently available methods of producing energy esp into electricty for a loooong time sadly anyone who gets close to recreating any of these would evices is shut down immediately as soon as tptb become aware of them and if they are in the us they will be slapped with a secrecy order for the sake of national security and told to shut the fuck up or suffer the consequences ie dead family members financial and social hell think will smith in enemy of the state to get an idea and that the obvious shit they do it beyond fubar why becoz were a would evice that could can produce free unlimited electricity be obtained for say a few thousand bucks although they cost maybe 100 to make and they would never have to pay another power bill ever would absolutely destroy all the people who make their money trading oil and it derivatives so what you say a few power co will have to such it up and just would eal with it er no the owners of these utilities will never stand for that so long as their income is based on people buying electricity and all devices that cut into their profits inculding solar panels and wind water generators are the enemy and verboten and so they go and tell their congress men congressman that this just will not do and so said congressmen and women people who have been lobbied hard who might also be personal friends from the old boys club etc and well funded congressional supporters of the utility companies and now with electric cars that are so good get both and there goes 80 of your fuel expenses and 100 of what you spend at the pump and 100 the oil fuel companies revenue in gas sales from that consumer that why it aint gonna happen unless these people can maintain their incomes families of people are financed by oil and at this point in time that not possible afaik the rockerfellers were are oil barons as were many other famous rich people we know of and you say but oil is used for shitloads of things besides fuel for engines and you are right a huge amount of things from plastic to perfumes begin as crude oil but the oil fuel market is at least 50 of the business and free energy would destroy their incomes you have heard the word decimate which means to reduce by 90 to only leave a deci or 10 well big oil would have their profits cut by such a large percentage of at least 30 even 10 drop is huge for such a big business they would happily finance a war rather than allow such devices on the market maybe after a war that destroys their power distribution infrastructure they might go with this new generation generation but by then the way things are going most people will happily abide by the would irections given them via popular opiniions which have been manufactured by tptb and you will still have to pay them for it in some way maybe if enough people wake up and realize what is going on might this situation change i would put the chances at about the same that hitlary gets any punishment for her it indiscetions at the end of the day we are talking about familes who have made their fortunes from oil accepting progress and a 50 drop in income i do not think so nikola tesla offered his wireless and free energy device to westinghouse who was his main investor but westinghouse would not have a bar of it becoz he could not put a meter on it and charge the people for using it ,4,conspiracy

RPmatrix,consensus on gut feelings in general practice background general practitioners sometimes base clinical decisions on gut feelings alone even though there is little evidence of their diagnostic and prognostic value in daily practice research to validate the determinants and to assess the test properties of gut feelings requires precise and valid descriptions of gut feelings in general practice which can be used as a reliable measuring instrument research question can we obtain consensus on descriptions of two types of gut feelings a sense of alarm and a sense of reassurance methods qualitative research including a delphi consensus procedure with a heterogeneous sample of 27 dutch and belgian gps or ex gps involved in academic educational or research programmes results after four rounds we found 70 or greater agreement on seven of the eleven proposed statements a sense of alarm is defined as an uneasy feeling perceived by a gp as he she is concerned about a possible adverse outcome even though specific indications are lacking there something wrong here this activates the diagnostic process by stimulating the gp to formulate and weigh up working hypotheses that might involve a serious outcome a sense of alarm means that if possible the gp needs to initiate specific management to prevent serious health problems a sense of reassurance is defined as a secure feeling perceived by a gp about the further management and course of a patient problem even though the doctor may not be certain about the diagnosis everything fits in conclusion the sense of alarm and the sense of reassurance are well defined concepts these descriptions enable us to operationalise the concept of gut feelings in further research https www readbyqxmd com read 19761589 consensus on gut feelings in general practice,10,TheRedPill

RPmatrix,oh my friend i feel your hurts i am terrified of running out of cymbalta more than any other medication i did not know how i am going to get off this oh i know how you feel but i have some ideas for you though so then i decided to research cymbalta good stuff i would suggest doing as much research as possible about all the drugs you take are rx would and learn as much as you can handle lol there so much out there about them wikipedia is a surprisingly accurate place to learn about most drugs the data they have tends to be up to date and impartial they explain how ssri 8are habit forming i have done been through all this so i might be able to offer you some ideas to help you get where you want to be part of this education is first realizing and then accepting that most drs do not know shit about the drugs they rx sure they have read the lliterature but sadly much of this information is bullshit this is the one fact which suggests the drs are far less to blame than many of us feel at times they have been trained to read and trust the literature aka drs drug compendum which has been proven to far to often be lies and the drs have been lied to regarding many drugs and how are they to know otherwise except to consult the books they have been told are accurate this is why this company was fined so much as the lies it told the drs flowed on to patients just like yourself who are now addicted af which is another problem for the drs to fix which for most people these days getting some drug pill to fix it which they do not of course which provides even more work for the drs who unwittinglyy rx more drugs and round and round she goes what a business eh this company was fined 3billion for outright lying to doctors in their literature about the effects of their drugs specifically in this case the likelihood of withdrawals from their ssri the main one was paxil which is an ssri just as cymbalta is https en wikipedia org wiki selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor they are in the ame family of drugs who grandfather was is prozac fluoxetine and other drugs like tramadol which also have ssri effects including those crazy withdrawals the brain zaps mindfuck moodmadness the list goes on and the only way to safely stop is slowly i would say at least 6mths to stop a long term dose i will give you more specific info about this down the page a bit btw here a list of all the ssri and snri selective norepinephrine re uptake inhibitors on the market today https www drugs com drug class ssri antidepressants html http www nytimes com 2012 07 03 business glaxosmithkline agrees to pay 3 billion in fraud settlement html in the largest settlement involving a pharmaceutical company the british drugmaker glaxosmithkline agreed to plead guilty to criminal charges and pay 3 billion in fines for promoting its best selling antidepressants for unapproved uses and failing to report safety data about a top diabetes drug federal prosecutors announced monday which of course i should have done but my doctor have no indication any of this would happen and maybe the dr you see has read the latest data but most have not not becoz they are lazy just the opposite in fact they are too busy to have the time to peruse the latest drug info and usually learn about them on the go first from the literature and later anecdotally from other drs at the hospital they will work in before becoming gp but there are some really good drs out there you just have to find them imho as much as i hate trying to find a new gp if when i need to i usually begin at the community health centers as the drs who are there are the one fighting the good fight and who are not so jaded by doctoring fat fuckwits and they still want to make a difference i start here make an appointment to see a dr and i might have to see all 6 or so drs there before i find one i can talk to who seems to get me as i am a complicated and have chronic pain patient to have many drs wo not touch me with another dr pole so after the initial consultation where i put my cards on the table the dr who will even see me twice is the first sign i have to go by that this dr might be able to help me too i also ask people in the area if they know any cool drs etc becoz imho it your relationship with your dr which makes a huge difference in how you are treated i have a wonderful gp a gay guy in his mid 50 and he rocks i have been seeing him now for about 3yrs and the dr patient relationship we have is one of the best i have ever had and he knows as i and all his other patients tell him so he understands what it like to be a fringe person someone who got some stigma attached to their situations eg pain patients who need want opiate medications consequently he doens t judge you and the more open and honest i am with him the better it gets he rx all my pain meds morph and oxy and as i have a genuinely painful condition that has lots of proof from hospital specialists he can get a permit to rx schedule 1 drugs to me in my country if you are on any s1 drug for longer than 4wks the prescribing dr must first get one of these permits then only the permitted dr can rx the permitted dose of the permitted drug this stops the patient from using their illness disability to dr shop and get lots of schedule 1 pills from as many drs as they can which they then sell for the cash it only a small percentage who do this which is why such drugs are rarely seen on the streets here i found a fb group called cymbalta hurts and the stories are terrible and the only way to wean off the are capsules so to have to open the capsule and count the tiny little beads and remove little by little every single day i think it should be removed all together they put out a drug with no plan for discontinuation i can assure you this exact fact upset many drs firstly as they did not know about their addictive properties when they first began to rx ssri when they first noticed patients would require this fortunately that courtcase and fine changed the way many drs used these drugs as well as what they were taught about these drugs in med school about ssri which is almost the opposite of what they were taught in the 1990 anyway thought that was worth mentioning because that was one of the worst experiences i have ever had with my medications just awful several years ago i was had been taking the maximum daily dose of tramadol 400mgs p d and had been for 3 4yrs it was a decent enough painkiller but it side effects were too much for me shakes sleeplessness caused sexual misfunction etc etc and so a changed to an equipotent dose of morphine but neither my dr or me had considered it ssri type effects to have such severe withdrawals they were worse than morphine heroin wd it was crazy i had all the symptoms you have heard of but it was the totally krazy thoughts i was getting which spun me out the most ie walking across the road a thought comes out of nowhere that if i had a gun right now i would shoot that guy i was fucking stunned when that thought occured as i never think such things and i knew what was causing it so i went back on slow release tramal for 6mths starting at 200mgs per day and reducing it 25mgs at a time down to nothing the same idea works with ssri although i would organize it as accurrately as i could these drugs cymabalta also come in a variety of shapes and sizes tablets and capsules with those little balls you mentioned you need to tell your dr that you want to stop are stopping and would greatly appreciate having a form of the drug you can accurately halve ,2,Documentaries

RPmatrix,man i gave up trying to explain the pain to anyone as it was basically impossible the frustration this caused was almost worse than the physical pain itself it only been since i have recovered substantially that this noise began to quieten and it was only when it had basically stopped and my arm fell asleep and when it woke up that i realized it was almost exactly the same noise that consumed me the limb waking up but it stuck at that point where it stupidly unpleasant in a way it like being tickled to the point where it become pain and you are begging the person tickling you to stop but 100x worse i really know how you feel mate which is something i doubt happens to you to actually talk with another person who going through the same thing as it quite rare afaik although i guess missing limbs would be a fairly common problem with soldiers idk btw i am in australia and we have almost the exact opposite of the us healthcare system eg our drs are paid to keep us well rather than only treating us when we are sick they must submit a 5yr treatment plan for all their chronically ill patients which outlines the treatment and possible alternatives it nor perfect but it pretty bloody good i would not be writing this now if not for the amazing drs who treated me i wish you all the best with your are covery bro let me say it can get much better than most drs are aware of i think as it such a rare condition pl and if you want to and think you can chances are you eventually will back then in the mid 90 i was told i would be lucky to make a 60 recovery these days if i do not have some formal confirmation on paper of what happened to me 99 of drs wo not believe me as i have made a 95 recovery btw do you suffer from cramps cramps were part of the hell i lived in for 15yrs things slowly got better but if i had not kept up the hard work learning how to walk again etc i would never have achieved this level of better most people who get what i had rarely make a better than 60 recovery but imho that becoz they gave up trying to get better and so they have not learning to walk again was like learning to play guitar i knew what i wanted to do but i could not quite do it yet it simply took heaps of perseverance i compared it to climbing a mountain in the dark with no guides maps light or anyone who had been there before me to advise me on my progress bro if you ever want to vent or whatever about your situation please feel free to hit me up via pm at least you will be talkin to someone who walked the walk and who knows i might have some alternative ideas plus i have climbed this mountain and come down the other side victorious i have no doubt you can too if you want and i am here to ask about anything you want to know about whatever and whenever i will try to help take it easy mate and rest assured i know how you feel and i am totally behind you i have got your back feel free to pm me questions about how i managed this noise they might help d ,1,Documentaries
RPmatrix, it was in the documentary do you think i just made it up read again what your replying to percocet is 1 5 times stronger than morphine percocet is just aniother brand name for oxycodone oxycone is said to be 1 5x tronger than morphine https en wikipedia org wiki oxycodone paracetamol aka percocet but even the strongest percocet only have 10mgs of oxycodone in them which is equal to 15mgs of morphine or 1 50th of what i would take so even 20 x 10mgs 200mgs of oxy 300mgs of morphine i took that much x 2 5 every day for ten years and i never od would starting to catch on now i am so sick of this argument who right and who wrong when it comes to opioids opiate as i have already explained who i think is to blame the wod there a book you would probably like it came out last year called chasing the scream it the whole story from the harrison act until now and what science has learned about these compounds up til recently and it not what is being discussed here except by a few drs chemists who have brushed upon the are asons it so fubar in the us btw i am an aussie a country with the strictest opiate and drug controls to be found it much harder to access these drugs legally or illegally here there lots of heroin but you do know we have a natural opiate system called our endogenous opioids no the neuroscience of opiates is forming the belief that some people endogenous opioid systems do not work right a bit like how diabetic do not handle insulin right and so they need to supplement it maybe some people need opiates and once they find them it like feeding a hungry man and they need to supplement it as that what makes them feel ok with themselves big pharma are more than happy to push ssri snri antidepressants which are worse harder to stop than heroin and the drs give them out for any little thing as for someone twice recommending for people to take an acetiminophen we call it paracetamol overdose by telling them to take 1000mgs 3x per day wtf i am actually off to see my gp in a few hours and he a pm specialist who asks my opinion about some things as he knows i know as i have walked a walk he has not it great to know there are such drs in this world but then again ok pays it drs to prevent disease not treat it we spend 2 3rds per capita what the us does on healthcare yet it all free go figure ,2,Documentaries

RPmatrix, it is estimated that 1 in 20 people 5 are ociopathic it is believed that psychopathy is the largely the result of nature genetics while sociopathy is more likely the result of nurture environment psychopathy is related to a physiological defect that results in the underdevelopment of the part of the brain responsible for impulse control and emotions sociopathy on the other hand is more likely the product of childhood trauma and physical emotional abuse because sociopathy appears to be learned rather than innate sociopaths are capable of empathy in certain limited circumstances but not in others and with a few individuals but not others the fifth edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm 5 released by the american psychiatric association in 2013 lists both sociopathy and psychopathy under the heading of antisocial personality disorders aspd these disorders share many common behavioral traits which lead to the confusion between them key traits that sociopaths and psychopaths have in common include a disregard for laws and social mores a disregard for the rights of others a failure to feel remorse or guilt a tendency to display violent behavior in addition to their commonalities sociopaths and psychopaths also have their own unique behavioral characteristics as well sociopaths tend to be nervous and easily agitated they are volatile and prone to emotional outbursts including fits of rage they are likely to be uneducated and live on the fringes of society unable to hold down a steady job or stay in one place for very long it is difficult but not impossible for sociopaths to form attachments with others many sociopaths are able to form an attachment to a particular individual or group although they have no regard for society in general or its rules in the eyes of others sociopaths will appear to be very disturbed any crimes committed by a sociopath including murder will tend to be haphazard disorganized and spontaneous rather than planned psychopaths on the other hand are unable to form emotional attachments or feel real empathy with others although they often have disarming or even charming personalities psychopaths are very manipulative and can easily gain people s trust they learn to mimic emotions despite their inability to actually feel them and will appear normal to unsuspecting people psychopaths are often well educated and hold steady jobs some are so good at manipulation and mimicry that they have families and other long term relationships without those around them ever suspecting their true nature when committing crimes psychopaths carefully plan out every detail in advance and often have contingency plans in place unlike their sociopathic counterparts psychopathic criminals are cool calm and meticulous their crimes whether violent or non violent will be highly organized and generally offer few clues for authorities to pursue intelligent psychopaths make excellent white collar criminals and con artists due to their calm and charismatic natures the cause of psychopathy is different than the cause of sociopathy it is estimated that 1 in 20 people 5 are ociopathic https www psychologytoday com blog wicked deeds 201401 how tell sociopath psychopath,8,conspiracy

RPmatrix,you are half right the us corporation is an oligopoly as are all the so called superpowers and their allies an oligopoly from ancient greek ol gos meaning few and polein meaning to sell is a market form in which a market or industry is dominated by a small number of sellers oligopolists oligopolies can result from various forms of collusion which reduce competition and lead to higher prices for consumers oligopoly has its own market structure with few sellers each oligopolist is likely to be aware of the actions of the others china russia europe japan et al according to game theory the decisions of one firm therefore influence and are influenced by decisions of other firms strategic planning by oligopolists needs to take into account the likely responses of the other market participants how often do you hear the leaders of the us use the term strategic now you know why the us is an oligopoly and it pretty bloody obvious but nobody want to hear the truth as it means the will have to accept they have been lied to for as long as they have believed the bullshit which for most is all their lives the cognitive dissonance this causes stops most people from changing their minds as it easier to just continue as they have been all along coz if it not broke why fix it yeah er no it very broke but it like that story the king new clothes where nobody is prepared to go against general public opinion trying to tell this to an american is harder than convincing them they do not need to have guns any person who thinks their weapons will keep them safe from their goverment is deluded https en wikipedia org wiki oligopoly ok if you ask middle aged people who experienced the stalinist opression yeah i know but we are not talking about stalin here and it not 100yrs ago but what type of democracy where 99 of the people don t agree with something and yet it stull goes on eg the us and other countries phillipines deserve a mention right now shooting anyone invoved with drugs on the spot which still allows it police forces to kill with impunity i will tell you what kind none the us corpration is not a would emocracy it is an oligopoly https en wikipedia org wiki oligopoly and has been since well before stalin time the main problem with the masses esp in the us is their ignorance as long as people believe there is possibly an american dream life waiting for them if they work hard enough lol the american nightmare will only get worse and last longer the oligopoly will remain as they always have been while the average people strive to make money in the hope it will as they have been taught improve their lives and willingly give part of it to their rulers to do as they please ie finance their would efence forces industry if anyone thinks that the politicians who are currently working are serving anyone but themselves you have successfully been conditioned to believe a load of lies just as tptb have planned you to beginning in the school system ,5,conspiracy
RPmatrix,oh i have zero doubts people are dying from fentanyl od sorry if i came across otherwise i was more focusing on the major crackdown on rx would opiates becoz od of which oxycodone being a primary culprit has made a name for itself in the us to single out just one opioid drug as the kulprit is rather suspect imho btw i know a lot about this subject so if you would like any help with information data links sources just ask i would be happy to help ,1,conspiracy

RPmatrix, i am just curious who benefiting besides the normal characters good question i heard that almost all the oxycodone provided in the us comes from one company owned by one family maybe there a much bigger argument going on and somebody trying to shut them down just a thought in the long run tptb would prefer people use illegal drugs as the money raised by such sales funds black projects and when people are spending money on oxy which does not get back to them i can see this being a business decision and ime having worked in the d a world afaik 90 of all opiate od are accompanied by some form of benzodiazepine or alcohol consumption it harder than you think for an opiate tolerant person to od on opiates alone fentanyl is another story altogether do you have any data on specifically fentanyl deaths ,2,conspiracy

RPmatrix,the light electrical reality matrix aka lerm this interview was done in 1998 now go check out r holofractal and read about the electric universe which is exactly what dr neruda is talking about when he mentions the lerm the whole story is there but it will take you several hours to read it all there a lot of info there and remember this guy has defected from a super secret and very powerful group of people known as the acio who do not want him talking about such things becoz he felt he had to share with humanity the discovery of the ancient arrow wingmaker site in mexico and the things he learnt there things he considered so important he put his life mind on the line to make these interviews considering the power of these people that one hell of a decision to make he had worked there for over 20yrs before this happened what is really cool is they are 20 years old which means we can look back with 20 20 hindsight and see for ourselves how correct his statements back then are today and he nailed it with a number of comments but how can i be certain that you are not just making things up then like what as far as i know there is no current way to measure consciousness whatsoever that depends upon your definition of consciousness imo i tend to concur with this statement the term consciousness is notoriously difficult to define consequently many a debate about its character has been waged without the participants finding even a common topic as common ground by consciousness i mean simply sentience https en wikipedia org wiki sentience in the most unadorned sense this is the better article on consciousness imho http www samharris org blog item the mystery of consciousness ii there are the philosophical speculations about consciousness which shakespeare put so eloquentl with i think therefore i am to use the philosopher thomas nagel s construction a creature is conscious if there is something that it is like to be this creature an event is consciously perceived if there is something that it is like to perceive it whatever else consciousness may or may not be in physical terms the difference between it and unconsciousness is first and foremost a matter of subjective experience very simply either the lights are on or they are not this is what i perceive as consciousness have a look at the work of people like the neuroscientist sam harris there even an r samharris et al and their studies of consciousness using fmris https www samharris org blog item the mystery of consciousness so there is really no way of knowing whether or not anyone else in the universe is actually thinking or not let alone whether or not we all have a connected consciousness not yet but 20yrs ago the internet had only just been born and 30yrs ago fmri had yet to be made commercially available regardless it an amazing story and worthy of consideration imho why are you being so contrary c mon mate what is the name of this sub again edit added second sam harris link,1,conspiracy

and the truth is far stranger than you know it more like 5 15 people literally run the world playing the long game where they plan for at least 4 generations ahead of now if you are interested in reading more about them just ask and i will add some links for you to browse this interview was one of 5 done in 1998 with dr neruda yeah that right this is from 20years ago 3 yrs before 911 sarah anything you want to say before we sign off dr neruda yes if you the reader wonder how the information i ve presented about the incunabula relates to all of the various conspiracy theories about the new world order intelligence community illuminati freemasonry and all the other supposed clandestine organizations of the world i would respectfully ask you to suspend your prior notions about the motivations of these various groups these are not evil minded organizations regardless of how some portray them their members have children and families just like you and they take pleasure and disgust in the very same things as you do they are humans with all the same weaknesses for vice and greed but they also have a strong energy to improve the world it is simply that their definition of what a better world is may differ from yours if your interest is to conjure an antagonist for your amusement that s your prerogative but the issues i ve related tonight are too serious to be amusing they are deserving of your attention and discernment do your own investigation into the energy supplies of our world you may come up with different numbers than what i mentioned but only because the technology of the acio is more advanced than the petroleum industry nonetheless you ll see confirmation of this general condition look at the current events of your time whenever you read this interview you ll see how this plan is progressing it may seem to take detours but the general course is what i ve described it is moving in this direction not out of accident or because of the whims of the world s leaders you can be sure it is all part of the orchestration of events that are played out according to the well designed blueprints of the incunabula planners you may feel a certain anguish that you re being led to a future not of your choosing but if you want to have influence then you need to be educated and aware of the real forces that are defining your future this is a free will universe there is no hierarchy of angelic beings guiding the destiny of earth there is no ascended master who dictates the pathway to enlightenment for humanity or the individual if you truly want to express and apply your freewill make it a personal religion to know the facts learn how to look behind the stories that are being sold by the media and politicians and form your own conclusions keep your doubt intact about everything you re told from the political stage especially when you re induced to be patriotic it is one of the clearest signals to be suspicious of what you re being told when enemies are created especially new ones be wary of the motivations of those who claim them to be enemies investigate the facts look under all the rocks and verify your evidence each of you must become investigators and learn the art of research and analytical study if you want to feel more a part of the movement to globalization your insights and understandings may not change humanity s course one millimeter but they will change your ability to feel a part of this migration and have a sense of where humanity is moving and why and to those who prefer to strike out on their own path and believe that globalism is pure folly i can only explain to you that it must happen it is the outward expression of who we are and it is the natural progression of our species to unify around the inner essence of our identity instead of the outer fa ade of our particular nation or religious belief i believe everyone understands this to varying degrees but it is the methods of this unification that concern people and i share this concern if we re collectively informed about the plan and understand the end goal is something that holds a great promise for humanity we can pursue this goal with greater velocity and with added confidence that the methods will be in everyone s best interest this must be our goal and finally many of you may feel that globalization is a concept of the new world order and therefore dismiss it as a movement born out of greed and the lust for power yes there are always those who will take advantage of this movement to achieve personal gain but the reason to become a unified people on this earth is far greater than the personal gains of a few remember this as you read your conspiracy stories edit spelling,2,conspiracy

RPmatrix, it degrades if you are a fake pretending to be an alpha who then falls back into his old ways and are not the person she thought you to be but if you are someone of status and value then you will need to show some comfort or else it goes cold this is pretty much what i think too major bro here has nailed it obviously this is not a sub for ltrs so let me not even waste time on this topic and here too you are absolutely correct that some things change a lot in even a 3mth ltr women are unusual creatures when this happens and it can take some skillful game to keep a good ltr happening maybe you should check out r marriedredpill which is the rp for ltr it a good sub much less noise than here,1,TheRedPill

RPmatrix, no respond randomly to texts sometimes you are busy and do not respond for hours or even the same day other times you respond instantly agreed it called being spontaneous and following some wait 10mins rule is not being spontaneous if i get a txt and i am in the middle of writing an email i might read the text but if it a personal txt i will wait until i am finished doing whatever i am doing until i respond but aside from that one small point a few people have chosen to uselessly pick out to harp upon at least you matty spoke your mind ftr i liked the op overall it was 98 solid advice and instructions on how to be confident enough to be yourself and not fuck it up at the same time nothing there is a uniquely alpha behavior but it did cover many bp behaviors many guys do not even realize they are doing esp the classic bp shit that kills attraction quicker than she can get her panties back on doing the disneybp things many bp guys will do following their bp programming via the batchelor ette et al is truly cringeworthy and saddening to see as are the entitled attitudes of today woman who is equal in every way right who take pleasure in fucking with guys heads just becoz they can and it makes them feel powerful if you can get an honest answer from a hb about how much they use their pussy power you would be surprised most girls are acutely aware of the guys behavior towards them and by 13yo any natural hb is getting lots of attention from men of all ages can you imagine what it like to know every male between 13 and 30 is has been looking at you then by the time she 18 guys hit on her every time she goes out i public school streeet whatever she knows all the guys want a piece of her cunt we have all seen this power weilded by women in many self serving ways and they will tell you it intoxicating to have all these men almost fight over you it very primal and exciting for some our sexual behavior was never meant to be intellectualized lol tv shows like these so called reality shows along with shit like the bold and the beautiful which teach many a bp man and if his mum was single who taught him what she learned from such shit she then taught her kid s the things pretty much all the things which wiil make a fun time go from fucking awesome to wtf and the worst part is the mindfuck as they have got no idea what just happened they did all the things they see work on tv so wtf and many bp behaviors are instant plate smashers ie anything that even suggests that you need her on any level she want her man to be the leader she will be happy to follow a guy who is happy with himself which will show from their natural confidence as ime very few people are ject a truly happy person and until those men work out the basic stuff most of the things the op laid out are areas to be aware of how much potential you have to fuck up with with a few wrong words you thought were bon mots or good things to say but in 2017 women want to feel like they are doing the choosing which is normal and they are emotionally wired to feel and respond to situations where he can choose her mate remember women are always naturally hypergamous and are always on the lookout for her ideal mate awalt and never forget briffault law she can and will change her mind beliefs in an instant should doing so uit her better things like this change in ltr but thats another story altogether also never forget that just becoz she will fuck you even on a regular basis this does not mean she sees you as anything more than a fuck she decided soon after first seeing you as to whether she would ever consider you the appropriate genetic material to be the father of her child but you might be fine as a one or three night stand alas these bp guys have not yet learned that women can be extremely ruthless beings who will use them up and throw them out by cop if necessary once they have got their way and everything changes when they finally notice that girls shit does stink depending on what they feed their heads and the shit they can come up with can truly stink i think many of the guys who come to trp in anger mode are angry they could let her shit slide and once a guy gets a good whiff of her shit it can put him off women for a while many men have unresolved shit from previous are lationships and the smell is still hanging around as they ust do not know how to understand it so they can accept it this is where trp is priceless it explains all this and much more so by taking trp and wallowing it bitter truth is the knowledge which finally releases men from the devious machinations http www thefreedictionary com machination women are capable of in the 51yrs i have been alive the red pill manosphere has been one of the most useful and enlightening places for men i have ever come across the whole philosophy of trp is useful and effective in one way or another for every man until about 2000 when the pua scene got started in the us and not long after the game was published the development and growth of trp community has been amazing until this time there had been little information of this type to be found other than anecdotally from another man with treat em mean to keep em keen being the most rp thing i would heard until the red pill movement happened i was in my 20 in the 80 and it was basically the same game with the same rules but the sources of information back then about about the things we regularly discuss here were non existant and the men in my social scene still bp af thought it was vulgar to kiss and tell and so rarely if ever sat down to discuss and analyze female behavior as has been done now by trp community back then you has to figure it out for yourself trial and error sink or swim you younger guys here have no idea how fortunate you are to have this place and the people in it most of the guys i knew back then could have badly used trp knowledge most still need it all of them are now either divorced or separated from the mother of their kids with some on wife number 2 or 3 none are happy with their situations a few have become workaholics some have become alcoholics some both all are in fucked up situations they basically stay in becoz of the kids which is the worst excuse to stay imo as everyone suffers as a family ffs and many of these guys married first mistake to stunning women had been entitled smokeshows and never changed so eventually these guys evolved into beta providers becoz they knew no other ways it quite sad really do not be those guys do not get married even if you want to have kids fine just do not get married just do not edit addded some stuff and fixed a few errors,3,TheRedPill
RPmatrix,it due to people like vanevar bush and admiral byrd who found another country and people in antartica this group i mention in the above post which he did not join run was what became the acio and the acio is in a league of it own beholden to no one government and part of what we now refer to the shadow govt that runs tptb this is one fucking deep rabbit hole if anyone wants links or further info either look through my r conspiracy post history of the past month or just ask this is the are al conspiracy and our true earthly rulers are humans who believe the only way humanity will survive is by it becoming one world with a one world goverment and to be honest imho they have very good reasons for wanting to do so and it not they already have more wealth than they could ever spend it strange for the average person to get their heads around but these people believe they are the true aristocracy from greek aris right stocras ruler and honestly believe they are would estined to manage the world and it peoples and take this task very seriously the only people we have heard of that could still be associated with this group of aristocrats is the windsor the queen of england et al the real heads of this group organisation are unknown to us and way above such groups as the bilderbergers or freemason illuminati etc etc you i and 99 9999999 of the people on the planet have never heard of them and never will if anyone wants i will link them to a looong yet only partial explantion of these people and this group ,1,UFOs

style but that more my personal bias which meant i have read bugger all of his shit until strangely funnily enough goode came on the scene but his accounts of various stuff correlated with other accounts of the same group of people the people loosely referred to as tptb who were by that time arranging the post ww2 world to suit their desires which was originally going to be run by a dude named vanevar bush https en wikipedia org wiki vannevar bush i am actually inclined to believe goode story i believe an independent group that has it roots in the elite of that period ie 1920 through till post ww2 where they plit from the govt programs and continued with their own pace program which begun in the 1950 just look at the type of science v bush was known to be involved in most people would not understand 98 of it and was at that time 1920 40 was tudying things most people had never even heard of read the wiki link to get an idea where this guy and his peers heads were at afaik it was when humans began detonating nuclear weapons that our alien brothers chose to make themselves known to the powers that were at that time and bits and pieces of this tory have come to light since then and in retrospect were technologically far far and further ahead than any other scientific research group it was funded by the navy which insisted so as it believes that naval personel have a much greater sense of teamwork and all for one and one for all attitude than the other branches of the military and the main thing this group the acio required was solidarity and committment the group bush was to head was called the office of scientific research and development in all the osrd requested deferments for some 9 725 employees of osrd contractors of which all but 63 were granted this means than he asked for 9 000 people to be let free from their military contracts so they could go work for his group and only 63 people were refused him in his obituary the new york times described bush as a master craftsman at steering around obstacles whether they were technical or political or bull headed generals and admirals manhattan project bush played a critical role in persuading the united states government to undertake a crash program to create an atomic bomb when the ndrc was formed the committee on uranium was placed under it reporting directly to bush as the uranium committee bush reorganized the committee strengthening its scientific component by adding tuve george b pegram jesse w beams ross gunn and harold urey when the osrd was formed in june 1941 the uranium committee was again placed directly under bush for security reasons its name was changed to the s 1 section bush met with roosevelt and vice president henry a wallace on october 9 1941 to discuss the project he briefed roosevelt on tube alloys the british atomic bomb project and its maud committee which had concluded that an atomic bomb was feasible and on the german nuclear energy project about which little was known roosevelt approved and expedited the atomic program to control it he created a top policy group consisting of himself lol bush soon became dissatisfied with the dilatory way the project was run with its indecisiveness over the selection of sites for the pilot plants he was particularly disturbed at the allocation of an aa 3 priority which would delay completion of the pilot plants by three months bush complained about these problems to bundy and under secretary of war robert p patterson major general brehon b somervell the commander of the army services of supply appointed brigadier general leslie r groves as project director in september within days of taking over groves approved the proposed site at oak ridge tennessee and obtained a aaa priority in may 1945 bush became part of the interim committee formed to advise the new president harry s truman on nuclear weapons it advised that the atomic bomb should be used against an industrial target in japan as soon as possible and without warning bush was present at the alamogordo bombing and gunnery range on july 16 1945 for the trinity nuclear test the first detonation of an atomic bomb afterwards he took his hat off to oppenheimer in tribute this guy bush was a total genius and had the ear of all the president men he was considered on of the most important people of his era and yet few of us have heard of him when the technology some of his team was demonstrated a section of the office of scientific research and development was named the acio alien contact intelligence organisation and v bush was asked to run it but he declined it required his vanevar bush came up with concepts like memex concept bush introduced the concept of the memex during the 1930s which he imagined as a form of memory augmentation involving a microfilm based device in which an individual stores all his books records and communications and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility it is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory we call these things pc laptops ph and tablets in todays world he wanted the memex to emulate the way the brain links data by association rather than by indexes and traditional hierarchical storage paradigms and be easily accessed as a future device for individual use a sort of mechanized private file and library in the shape of a desk the memex was also intended as a tool to study the brain itself 2 after thinking about the potential of augmented memory for several years bush set out his thoughts at length in as we may think predicting that wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear ready made with a mesh of associative trails running through them ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified he was not far off a few months later life magazine published a condensed version of as we may think accompanied by several illustrations showing the possible appearance of a memex machine and its companion devices https en wikipedia org wiki vannevar bush shortly after as we may think was originally published douglas engelbart read it and with bush visions in mind commenced work that would later lead to the invention of the mouse ted nelson who coined the terms hypertext and hypermedia was also greatly influenced by bush essay as we may think has turned out to be a visionary and influential essay in their introduction to a paper discussing information literacy as a discipline bill johnston and sheila webber wrote in 2005 that bush paper might be regarded as describing a microcosm of the information society with the boundaries tightly drawn by the interests and experiences of a major scientist of the time rather than the more open knowledge spaces of the 21st century bush provides a core vision of the importance of information to industrial scientific society using the image of an information explosion arising from the unprecedented demands on scientific production and technological application of world war ii he outlines a version of information science as a key discipline within the practice of scientific and technical knowledge domains also now known as the internet his view encompasses the problems of information overload and the need to devise efficient mechanisms to control and channel information for use bush was concerned that information overload might inhibit the research efforts of scientists looking to the future he predicted a time when there is a growing mountain of research but there is increased evidence that we are being bogged down today as specialization extends the investigator is staggered by the findings and conclusions of thousands of other workers vanevar bush was the grandfather of black projects and a master of keeping things projects secret af using compartmentalization of the people involved and the eyes only and need to know methods for doing so bush helped create the joint research and development board jrdb of the army and navy of which he was chairman with passage of the national security act on july 26 1947 the jrdb became the research and development board rdb its role was to promote research through the military until a bill creating the national science foundation finally became law 95 by 1953 the department of defense was spending 1 6 billion a year on research physicists were spending 70 percent of their time on defense related research and 98 percent of the money spent on physics came from either the department of defense or the atomic energy commission aec which took over from the manhattan project on january 1 1947 96 legislation to create the national science foundation finally passed through congress and was signed into law by truman in 1950 97 the authority that bush had as chairman of the rdb was much different from the power and influence he enjoyed as director of osrd and would have enjoyed in the agency he had hoped would be independent of the executive branch and congress he was never happy with the position and resigned as chairman of the rdb after a year but remained on the oversight committee a fascinating individual who did so much and yet who of us have heard of him or his scientific discoveries developments and advances ,1,UFOs

RPmatrix,also this statement from dr neruda in 1998 about how tptb hated the internet as it was one of the few things they had never accounted for or expected which is something i have been saying for years sarah and once the incunabula has control over oil production what then dr neruda the dismantling of hard currency the incunabula desires to have an electronic currency because it tracks everything and enables a more thorough analytical insight into the affairs of the individual sarah so what do they want to do with all this information dr neruda they want to observe patterns and manipulate events in order to protect their dominance as a leadership body and as i said earlier they want to define the new systems and manage system change once this dominance is perceived as reaching a critical mass the incunabula plans to create a global body of governance that brings stability to earth and a set of policies that aid humanity at large sarah again you re telling me that their goal is to help humanity but i find it hard to believe dr neruda in a way it is the only way they can retain power if they concentrate wealth and services too much they will lose control of the population they seek to govern rebellion is never far away when empty stomachs grumble in unison sarah how will they dismantle our hard currency dr neruda there will be a gradual devaluation of the stock markets worldwide americans in particular have become accustomed to easy money production within the stock markets as well as lavish lifestyles this will not be permitted to continue indefinitely recessions will occur in waves until the value of currency is called into question this will begin in third world countries first and as these become the initial victims of feeble economic policies the incunabula will essentially force these countries to sell their assets at rock bottom prices in return for helping them out of economic crisis in the best of times the world economy is a fragile patchwork of economic systems that run at different rates without a smooth interface or a macro system in which to operate in the worst of times it is a house of cards vulnerable to the faintest of winds hard currency and the monetary system that supports it will become a scapegoat of the economic slowdown and electronic currency will increasingly become the solution to the general malaise of the global economy sarah i m not an economist so i don t even know what questions to ask but it leaves me with a queasy feeling in my gut i get the feeling that there s only one real power in the world and it s the incunabula and we re all just puppets of this elite group of moneymen isn t that pretty much the subtext of all your comments here dr neruda no not at all but i can understand how you arrive at that conclusion given that we ve been focused on the triad of power or top as we refer to it within the labyrinth group top is a reality on earth and it probably will be for many generations to come and it s certainly in the best position to dominate world affairs and development but there are other powers that can intervene and bring fresh opportunity to the world s people sarah like religious powers dr neruda yes that s one though they will never rival the incunabula in terms of impacting on world affairs sarah so who re you talking about give me some names or examples dr neruda the rise of personal computers and the internet was never intended to occur according to the incunabula it was one of the developments that genuinely surprised the planners within the incunabula and proved to be a very vexing issue for nearly a decade computing power was supposed to remain in the hands of the elite the internet grew organically and at a pace that no one thought possible and it caught the incunabula completely off guard sarah so technology is a power that frustrated the plans of the incunulaba,2,conspiracy
RPmatrix,exerpt from interview 4 dr neruda one of the first directors of the acio was a member of the incunabula s military force and was very much an insider in terms of working with some of its higher ranking leaders especially in america sarah can you disclose his name dr neruda vannevar bush https en wikipedia org wiki vannevar bush sarah how do you spell his name dr neruda spelling it out sarah is he related to president george bush dr neruda no sarah so he ran the acio when it was still in its infancy dr neruda yes sarah what happened to him dr neruda he was too visible and it was rightly feared that he would not be able to retain secrecy sarah why dr neruda dr bush was a gifted individual who exercised both technical vision and leadership skills he had access to the leadership of the government and the incunabula he could manage a large team of scientists and engineers as well as anyone could he essentially built the infrastructure for military research but his celebrity status was troublesome to the founders of the incunabula sarah give me a sense of the timetable because i have to admit i ve never heard of this man dr neruda it was right near the end of world war ii that dr bush was asked to head up a team of research scientists that had supposedly been assembled from the ndrc and spl to reverse engineer a recovered alien spacecraft that had been recovered in 1940 off the coast of florida these were actually top scientists from the newly formed acio the spacecraft had been placed in cold storage because of world war ii as the war ended bush became privy to this discovery through his network and offered his leadership to the project as i understand it he was just coming off the manhattan project when this opportunity presented itself sarah so he was considered a security risk and that ended his tenure at the acio dr neruda yes this reverse engineering project was held in the highest possible secrecy dr bush ran the operation within the spl through special funding from the oss which was the forerunner of the cia however after a year s time little progress was made and there were rumors attributed to bush that alien spacecraft consumed his agenda bush reported directly to james forrestal who at the time was heading up the navy but shortly thereafter became the first secretary of defense truman was president the spacecraft that had been recovered was sufficiently intact to conduct reverse engineering studies on its propulsion system which was the most critical knowledge that forrestal hoped to extract from the project sarah what year are we talking dr neruda this would have been between 1945 and 1946 sarah so what happened dr neruda bear in mind that my knowledge of these events is based on my study of the acio archive i wasn t personally involved in any of these happenings so i m not vouching for their absolute accuracy sarah understood dr neruda dr bush was asked to replicate the propulsion system of the recovered craft in twelve months and was given the resources of the acio in order to do so sarah and did he succeed dr neruda only partially the electromagnetic fields were not fully replicated in terms of their sustained intensity levels in metals because of electron drift which and i m struggling to keep this in layperson s terms was the primary reason they failed nonetheless there were prototypes built that replicated aspects of the alien craft s propulsion system and these were sufficient to galvanize funding and support for the acio sarah then why didn t dr bush join the acio dr neruda he knew it would require that he go underground and essentially become anonymous he didn t want anonymity because he was a prodigious inventor and liked the limelight accorded him from government officials as well as the scientific community at large also i don t think the head of the oss thought his mental capabilities were sufficient to the task bush was a great organizer of talent but he lacked the commanding intellect in physics to lead the acio as it was envisioned in those days that just one of many p s yes aliens are also discussed at length by this guy and this was in 1997 sarah so he was considered a security risk and that ended his tenure at the acio dr neruda yes this reverse engineering project was held in the highest possible secrecy dr bush ran the operation within the spl

project and another fifty knew elements of the project it was as i said before a very well guarded secret sarah how do you keep something like this a secret dr neruda there are entire departments within our government that have responsibility for this it s a very well engineered process that includes legal contracts clear penalty reminders and known deterrence factors that include very invasive technologies in the worst case if vital information was disclosed a different but related department would step in that would masterfully spread disinformation it was and still is virtually impossible to bring this information to the public sarah they had invasive technologies even in 1945 dr neruda yes while the invasive technologies were more crudely applied they were certainly effective there was nothing more vilified in these undisclosed organizations than traitors the entire organizational culture was designed to reward loyalty and severely punish disloyalty in any form

RPmatrix,ok fair enough nice tits now that cleared up d let see if we can agree on a few things or maybe learn something either both of us honestly while i too have seen a contrail from horizon to horizon that must have been a very high flying jet of some type as i could not see or hear even later the plane itself only the contrails and it was very high the thing is imho it the first chemtrail i have ever seen in my country as you would know true condensation trails dissapate quickly into the rest of the air and why this happens is well understood and explained by science as the links in my other post itt show until last year when i am fairly sure it was a military jet considering it flight path which both came from the airforce base near me and was completely unique and directly across my place flying at a very high altittude interestingly i saw this saw plane twice in one week last year it was exceptional in many ways including it contrail but that another story i have not seen one since now i am aware that it is possible to have ections or aotmosphere that allow highly unusual but possible contrails at higher than tropospheric altittudes as some ections of air holds more water than other ections but the flight paths of jets do not follow them which is why true contrails often occur in trips as the jet flies in and out of these wet zones that allow condensation to occur so high anyway 99 98 of all clouds and water vapor reside in the troposphere which is between 7 and 20kms thick the average depths of the troposphere are 20 km 12 mi in the tropics 17 km 11 mi in the mid latitudes and 7 km 4 3 mi in the polar regions in winter the lowest part of the troposphere where friction with the earth surface influences air flow is the planetary boundary layer but they too do not last and soon lose their tructure but even this is an exception all jet created condensation trails will dissapate in accordance with the science that explains gas vapor pressure levels and how and why they dictate how much moisture a gas can hold at a given temperature and pressure the links in my other post explain this in detail it this understanding together with fairly indispuatable photographic and other evidence that the things people call chemtrails are not con trails eg i live about 50kms out from an international airport so the jets are usually well close to cruising altitude when i can see hear them ergo they have passed through the troposphere where they are most likely to create contrails i live almost directly under the flight paths of jets flying so high they are halfway across the ske before i can hear them they actually freaked me out for a while as i had no idea wtf this loud loud rumbling noise was that happened irregularly as it eemed to come from all around me lol it was the planes i guess some jets are much louder than others as some i can see but cannot hear them at all we have many many flights crossing our skies and except the the event i related at the beginning of this post i never see contrails not one and i am talking about commercial jets flying at all altittudes just like the ones in the chemtrail videos all over yt i have watched these jets taking off for years and not one contrail let alone chemtrail have i seen nor have any of the people i have asked many have never even heard of a contrail let alone chemtrail my simple question is why not edits a few mistakes nothing major p s i have been wondering about this for a few years now and as of the past few days think i might have an idea why not ,2,conspiracy

RPmatrix, thanks for the kudos mate much appreciated to know at least one person appreciated that post which took me at least an hour to compile and tbh i really do not think it was my super game that got me into her pants lol but my natural sigma alpha attitude and behavior that allowed me to act as i did with help from another buff aussie guy it was the fearless and dominant behaviour my mate and i had shown her that impressed her the most that we showed when we helped collect her stuff as well as the way we dealt with her nemesis that really bp iranian guy who somehow thought that because she has come to oz and as she had accepted his hospitality which he had decided somehow meant that he now owned her and she was beholden to marry him this only confirmed to me that there are a lot of stupid men in this world imho i think it was the fact that i had demonstrated my ability to physically look after her as is a man role in her society and i think it was that plus i was a local and could help her in ways all the other people she had met could not or had not that played a large part of her attraction to me together with my basically precocious and in hindsight a tad foolish sjw type behavior when i had arranged and pulled off the recovery of her property from this dude that greatly impressed her followed by my complete refusal to respond to any of her shit tests that got my foot in the door and my dick in her pussy tbh it was almost accidental as at the time i was already quite happily fucking this swedish babe so i had no would esigns plans to game her but she was fucking gorgeous a genuine 10 and tbh it was her adulation of me for helping her that i took advantage of plus my little head thoughts sealed the deal so to speak ie dude she fucking gorgeous and seems to like you you will regret it if you do not at least give it a try that finally convinced me to have a go and it was stupidly easy when i tried in a way it was a drunken more honestly a grattitude fuck and had little to do with my gaming her and once was enough as the swedish babe helena who was a stunning but unconceited and shy hb10 that i would been fucking for about a month and who went off like a rocket in bed was far a more satifying situation afaiwc plus i had a cute 19yo german girl who was such a fun girl to be with with who i was also fucking at the time ime backpackers are super easy to seduce as they left their asd at home as they did not need to worry their promiscuous behavior would become known about at home and if they were attracted to me so long as i was would iscreet i encountered almost zero lmr from these international travellers after all almost every young hot chicks who go backpacking esp alone are out to have a good time i was just the first to stimulate her the fact i was also a local seemed to increase my smv and the attention i got from many of the girls esp the ones who knew i was already fucking a couple of other super hot babes pre selection at it best in action but this babe solmuz who everyone called sarah was far too passive in bed for my liking she then fucked my mate the guy who had driven her to get her stuff about a week later lol man what a crazy event i would forgotten all about it until today and it really opened my eyes to just how fucking crazy the men from her country tended to be fuckin hell which is why i do not want islam to become in any way a powerful religion in australia as we already have a uccessful and friendly society that imho can in no way be improved by muslim ideology esp the type of attitudes guys like this fuckwit entertained i am glad you enjoyed it just do not make the mistakes i did by letting my humanity go out pretty much white knighting for her i wo not ever do so again intentionally unless their personal welbeing and possibly lives were being threatened that why i told this story so others can learn from my mistakes,1,TheRedPill

RPmatrix,i was comparing australia with the us the me is on another level altogether it actually very rp in ways but their game is a few thousand years out of date you could say that the me muslim male game is based on dread which we all know is basically a tactic of last resort as the only thing you can do if your dread game fails is to either resort to violence to literally physically frighten her into a kind of stockholm syndrome where her fear turns into allegiance which is the ultimate phase and goal of dread game and to a large degree muslim women do not mind the domination although the women have become very cunning and band together in ways to gain control over the men in such societies it really fucking crazy and those guys can be on another world altogether with how they think they can treat women as literal posessions source me mainly one absolutely fucking stunning 23yo hb10 iranian girl who had come to australia on a working holiday visa via some crazy arrangement with her father cousin brother on her mother side kinda thing and this guy had picked her up from the airport and effectively kept her prisoner at his house for about 2 mths until she worked up the courage and ran away it a crazy story as the truth can often be but i met this girl via a couple of other aussie girls she was sharing a room with in a hostel i was staying in at the time this iranian girl solmuz was from tehran and her father was very moderate muslim and wanted his girls to live as they pleased so he had helped arrange the trip to oz for solmuz but he did not realize what he had actually sent his daughter into until she escaped this guy she are nted a room from though she was going to marry him after i still am not sure i had not seen solmuz around the hostel as she had been holed up in her room too scared to come out just in case the guy found her and these two aussie girls had taken her to the cops and helped her make a report about her property still at his place and get an avo against him as well which she had done but was still freaked as fuck but as these aussie girls were leaving soon and solmuz would be alone and were worried about her so they came and talked to me and asked if i was prepared to meet her and be her friend in the hostel after they had gone and afaiwc it was nbd so i said sure fuck me dead when this absolutely stunning egyptian looking green eyed brunnette hb10 on a bad day was introduced to me she spoke fluent english so that was cool but she was quite shy at first but that changed pretty quickly after i fucked her on the second night it was akward she was a bit of a starfish but once was enough and by then half the guys in the hostel were trying to hit on her lol y she was thriving in the attention and after what she would been through i was happy for her and it was good to see the fear had completely left her idgaf i was more interested in the gorgeous swedish chick i was banging and hanging with another 10 there must have been a half dozen 10 in the hostel i was at so a few days later my mate and i helped her pick up the rest of her stuff from this dude house he completely lost it and ended up first trying to fight we subdued him in seconds no punches thrown and then by chasing us in his car like a madman trying to stop get in front of our car and stop us at which point he would jump out of his car and come charging at us lol for maybe 5kms fortunately my mates superb driving and tactical manouvering together with my intimate knowledge of the area allowed us to escape this fucking madman shit bro i have not thought of that event which happened in 2006 for a long time anyway i was now this hb10 hero and she was like my puppy but what a temperamental puppy she was i could easily see the bitch in her but i reeled that in the first day by leaving 15mins after she said she would be down in 10 mins i waited 5mins more and then i left to go into town like we would planned she called me about 10mins after i had left and asked where was i in the hostel and when i told her i was halfway into town and would see her later when i got back i could hear her surprise lol a few hours after i got back i explained to her 10 means 10 and if she wanted anything to do with me she can save her silly games for the other guys coz i am not one of them and i will go as you saw today she apologized and i never had another shit test out of her the rest of the time i knew her but boy did she fuck with a few guys heads and hearts she had male manipulation down to a fine art and most of the males in the place orbiting her and another hb10 a black bob haired german babe it how women survive in such an antifemale enviroment but as the first two months of her trip had been a crazy religion based and problematic situation where she had been literally locked in the room by the guy who wanted to marry her solmuz had zero say in the matter fuck me i would forgotten all aboout solmuz we stayed in touch by email for a few years and then she stopped replying she was a lovely girl when i got to know her but i would not have wanted to lt her or someone like her too crazy from the repression of her culture and this babe told me she wore a fucking burkha back in iran she had to or face getting into trouble a fine i think with the religious cops fuck it all coming back to me now she was exotically beautiful and she and her friends used to go to some country next door to iran like iirc turkey or lebanon if they wanted to party hard as you say bro man she came from one crazy country when it comes to are ligion based male female relationships ,1,TheRedPill

RPmatrix, to mentally co create a fair and just and peaceful planet has anyone here heard of the hundredth monkey effect https en wikipedia org wiki hundredth monkey effect it not hypothetical as it been observer in all sorts of animals especially groups of the same species of birds who live hundreds of miles apart so they could not possibly have hown their cousins how to peck through the foil caps that used to be on milk bottles and then they rd drink the cream lol and this started with starllings in the uk iirc but it spread across the world within a few years of first happening in the uk and do i even have to mention crows what amazing birds they are anyway we too create our world with our thoughts by sharing them with each other and by natural selection and themn the support of the masses the people the best ideas go viral same if you look at your life you realized with all the plans you have you think about them first before putting those thoughts into actions and the ones that worked you stuck with and discarded the ones that did not this is how most people think things work but the next level up is where you realize everything begins with the thought which is follwed by the actions which bring that thought into reality on this level we the people literally do create the world we live in now look at all the groups of people who have agreed to think the same things all sorts of things from discussing books or religion all the way through to groups who are arranging military coups and trying to take control of countries using a variety of tactics most if not all the main groups we often efer to as tptb have very self centered actions and behavior and use violence to get their way but we can go one better and that if we join our minds to direct our thoughts coherently about the peaceful and prosperous world we could be living in if we did not sell our souls to the man and let our thoughts follow remember as a kid how you would think about something and not long after it would happen around to you by what you then called bizarre co incidece but it was no coincidence it was your pure thought and desire which made those thing become manifet in yout reality let go back to would reaming like kids and imagining like ohn lennon suggestec honestly if enough people actually did that how many is enough you ask good question i have it from a very good source that that number is the quare root of the population group at the time you only need the square root of a group of people to agree with you and things will go that way ie in a room with 100 people and a table in the middle it would only take 10 people to effectively move the table where they like while the other 90 people in groups of 2 to 5 have no power to stop just the 10 which is the square root of the people in the room sweet huh and the more people who agree to do the same thing the more powerful that group of people are we could collectively help change the world for the better if we sincerely did our best to treat other people as we want to be treated ourselves and if you are feeling biblically strong lol you should go with your brother twice as far as he asks great op op thanks for bringing up the idea ideas can go viral and virus can severel affect ystems and groups in both good and bad ways depending on the thought behind it so we must out decent human being those cunts out of power by joining our thoughts of peace love and mung beans mates ,2,conspiracy

RPmatrix, no one uses mts to abbreviate metres the correct symbol is m you are right i forgot the r as in mtrs so what is the correct symbol for mile this explosion was not 200m in size length or whatever if you mean that tanker explosion no apparently is was larger than 200mtrs if you mean the moab did you see it no neither did anyone else believe the media at your own peril and dude it was a very rough guess for something i saw on video ffs you must be fun to live with ,1,WTF

RPmatrix, they would use gasoline instead like wtf are you saying the moab of which you speak does use petroleum products as it primary explosive that why it called a fuel air explosive aka fae bomb aka thermobaric weapons the baric bit referring to the massive atmospheric pressure changes they cause https www vocabulary com dictionary fuel air 20bomb https en wikipedia org wiki thermobaric weapon https en wikipedia org wiki father of all bombs nicknamed father of all bombs foab russian 2 is a russian designed bomber delivered thermobaric weapon the us military also used thermobaric weapons in vietnam and afghanistan the cbu 55 was a cluster bomb fuel air explosive that was developed during the vietnam war by the united states army and was used only infrequently in that conflict unlike most incendiaries which contained napalm or phosphorus the 750 pound cbu 55 was fueled primarily by propane described as the most powerful non nuclear weapon in the america arsenal the device was one of the more powerful conventional weapons designed for warfare that the 750lb version the moab is 20 times that but it seems they have many weights available on 3 march 2002 a single 2 000 lb 910 kg laser guided thermobaric bomb was used by the united states army against cave complexes in which al qaeda and taliban fighters had taken refuge in the gardez region of afghanistan the smaw ne was used by the us marines during the first battle of fallujah and second battle of fallujah the novel explosive smaw ne rocket is effective against caves and bunkers the smaw ne uses a thermobaric warhead which produces an overpressure wave capable of collapsing a lightly constructed building it was used in combat during both the first and second offensives in fallujah 2004 you were saying ,0,WTF

RPmatrix, for those who do not know the moab blast radius is about 1 mile sorry bro but i respectfully disagree in september 2007 russia exploded the largest thermobaric weapon ever made its yield was reportedly greater than the smallest dial a yield nuclear weapons at their lowest setting russia named this particular ordnance the father of all bombs in response to the united states developed massive ordnance air blast moab bomb whose backronym is the mother of all bombs and which previously held the title of the most powerful non nuclear weapon in history https en wikipedia org wiki thermobaric weapon the russian bomb contains an approximate 7 ton charge of a liquid fuel such as pressurized ethylene oxide mixed with an energetic nanoparticle such as aluminium surrounding a high explosive burster that when detonated created an explosion equivalent to 44 t 49 tons of tnt in comparison the moab produces the equivalent of 11 tons of tnt from 8 tons of high explosive the blast radius of the foab is 300 meters almost double that of the moab and the temperature produced is twice as high https en wikipedia org wiki father of all bombs it the shockwave pressure wave that kills you these things can create massive shockwaves which are what really do the damage although the heat from the blast sure would not do you any good tse the search engine is your friend bro ,1,WTF
