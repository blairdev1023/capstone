JackGetsIt,i think there basically a non shooting civil war cold war going on between democrats and conservatives right now and opportunistic politicians and companies are cashing in on it instead of realizing that we are all in this together and they will suffer too if the us implodes in the mean time our government has basically become non functional lot of people are being left out of the political process because they do not line up with either party i grew up a democrat but have left the left for basically the reasons summed up in this video https www youtube com watch v hivq8vrga 8 on the other hand i do not agree with everything on the conservative side either i am more of a libertarian sucks because i feel like a lot of people that deserve a voice in the political process are not getting it and then they turn away from trusting the system and this has the effect of making the system even more corrupt and unfixable it a scary downward spiral ,1,AskReddit

JackGetsIt,cool i did not mean to sound like a dick but i have a lot of conservative friends that throw that line out there and actually mean it intensely and it totally shuts down a meaningful conversation about education it hard to have a conversation with someone that thinks all education should be private and teachers should volunteer their time it a bit insane i actually think there are some good arguments that you could decrease school budgets in some areas and get better results with some restructuring but that lost when people have really extreme rhetoric filled positions thanks again for clarifying ,3,AskReddit
JackGetsIt, so please do not trivialize i was not trying to trivialize i was just going on the info i had from your comment and i appreciate you providing more background what am i supposed to do send all 30 kids to the principal the answer is yes that teacher is shitty they should have done a better job protecting you but at the same time bullying is very difficult to protect because a lot of it goes on when the teacher is not watching you can find strength in dark places it is the only way to truly escape them i am glad you have come out of this situation seeing it this way too many people have things like this happen to them and they spend their whole lives playing the victim and trying to cash out on it that the impression i got from your first comment so again i appreciate you explaining further ,1,AskReddit
JackGetsIt, he even helped me figure out that most of my teachers where intentionally failing me even if i did passing work can you expand on this a bit also do you have any insight on his teaching system sounds interesting ,7,AskReddit

JackGetsIt, the budget has nothing to do with the performance of the schools can you please just read this back to yourself and pause a moment and think about that statement sure there are schools with smaller budgets that might have better admin student pop etc and therefore outperform schools in rougher areas that have grants for better technology etc but that blanket statement is just ridiculous ,3,AskReddit
JackGetsIt,bullying getting d when you felt you deserved more and having bad teachers is part of life i am sorry you had a bad teacher but saying that it massively altered your life sounds like you are trying to make excuses one teacher does not control your entire life course that just silly and a victimhood mentality ,-6,AskReddit
JackGetsIt,i do not understand the point of your comment are you giving oversensitive people a pass because of past historical transgressions if so that just perpetuates this over sensitivity which would not be an issue if it were just an annoyance but catering to people does not help them out of poverty it makes it worse in fact because now you have lumped a sense of dependency and projection of pity on top of squalor people do not work hard and rise up out of poverty with pity and hand outs it perpetuates and exacerbates their poverty ,6,AskReddit

JackGetsIt,i think it already starting to look like this a little but with etherium at the center right now bitcoin is actually at the center but that going to change here very very quickly long term i think litecoin will probably be a better store of wealth as well or maybe that will also be ether will we actually have huge stores of wealth in the cypto future or will all these coins make investing lending your money easier and safer i think that if the cypto future works out even a little bit like it founders hope then people and companies will horde their money a lot less and put it out for investing more the personal loan network will be really exciting with cypto actually everything is more exciting with cypto currencies note i am an amatuer in all this so feel free to explain to be how i am wrong just do not be a dick the only way i see ripple as the default central trading platform is if the company opens up more they seem strictly focused on the corporate adoption ,1,Ripple

JackGetsIt,this is just the nature of buying alt coins the only reason we really have alt coin markets is because of the stability of btc itself eventually i think a lot of exchanges will be running with eth or ltc as the preferred foundational coin because of the transaction time and costs the best way to cut down on fees is to buy and hold and avoid moving things around a lot ,1,siacoin

JackGetsIt, because someone attempted to put men on a pedestal i did not see that in his comment but upon rereading it i can see where you would get that impression i agree with your position that neither sex as a whole should be pedestalized i think the grand standing and hero worship comes because people are trying to overcome a narrative the gender war has done a lot of of white washing of the sexes when the reality is always a lot more nuanced like your father ,1,RedPillWomen

JackGetsIt,could not agree more on this especially dash there seems to be a lot of astroturfing for dash to grow i think what happens is people get into a coin when it in the 100 1000 satoshi range and then watch it run up to 50 or a 150 dollars and are still holding a lot of the coin after they have made that type of serious profit they become a blinded to any negative press about their baby investment a good investor would divest a little to cover losses but it seems like a lot of these youtubers are all in on a coin or two which is a bad plan imho on the other hand first to market is huge in the cypto world and these established alt coins like etherium dash monero might just run away with it all even if competing coins are doing the tech better we will see ,1,CryptoCurrency

JackGetsIt, eth is a shitcoin i hope you are joking or care to explain ,1,LitecoinMarkets
JackGetsIt,it just not a exy coin right now people want to ride a wave to money they do not want to sit and wait when the alt coins go through another collapse ltc btc and eth will be a safe harbor to run too and you and i will be there already the only way i see lightcoin truly failing is if eth becomes the standard metric of exchange and btc ltc are slowly phased out i do not see this happening for at least 3 6 years ,3,LitecoinMarkets
JackGetsIt,the only thing i see bad for cypto is a major push by governments to tax them out of existence in this case i think you would see a shift towards dash pivx and monero for their privacy abilities i also think that hostile government taxation could very well have the opposite of effect and might push people even harder towards cypto what will boost cypto short term is political instability like an impeachment when the us no longer becomes a safe harbor for investment and capital storage then institutions will look elsewhere i think a major exchange failing or a major security flaw that makes a lot of news will hurt the markets but only short term long term looks really really good for cypto hold ,2,CryptoMarkets
JackGetsIt,in the long term it going to be all of the above and first to market with the tech in the short term it simple the latest news that seems to pump price it seems like these companies teams like to manufacture a lot of fluff news and conferences just to pump their currency i like looking for companies that are actually working on partnerships and adoptions ,1,CryptoMarkets

JackGetsIt,ah that makes sense so if i am chase bank and i buy a million ripple at a dollar each i can charge 10 ripples to transfer to some banks and 5 ripples to transfer to others this would then allow me to signal to other banks how trustworthy i find them so it basically outsourcing the shuttling of money around the world electronically ,2,Ripple
JackGetsIt,if you throw a stone into the cypto investing space there a better chance of striking a moron then hitting a well diversified careful investor so i do not think op was out off his rocker assuming the latter ,3,Ripple
JackGetsIt,so it like a token for one free trusted fiat trade can ripples be used to trade large crypto quantities right now the crypto marketplace is gambling that banks will pay at least 22 cents a transaction assume i am a bank that interested in this ripple service can any amount be traded with a single ripple credit or do you have to pay more ripples for higher trades what if ripple currency became so over speculated even after the dump of all the currency that it was like 200 dollars a ripple and banks started using a ripple competitor is not there also a danger that ripple becomes a currency itself then again the banks stop using it because it to expensive to buy high priced ripple token just to do a money transfer ,1,Ripple
JackGetsIt,i think when it all shakes out he took money from the russians during his campaign and he still colluding there an active investigation going on his son in law kushner is basically being outed right now as a possible spy my guess is like 60 120 days till impeachment under the impeachment proceedings i am also guessing he will get charged with violating the emolument clause of the constitution all speculation of course but there are a lot of people closely watching the trump white house right now and if he did anything wrong it will be found as far as crypto is concerned i think an impeachment will weaken the dollar and strengthen holdings like gold and btc at least temporarily again i am speculating on all this ,1,CryptoMarkets
JackGetsIt,i think it bizarre that some of the hardcore btc investors think the financial sector is going to go way and it all going to be decentralized digital currency the big question is as the crypto markets bounce back stronger governments will have to eventually start putting laws and regulations in place for how they are going to handle all these currencies because they will inevitably be used for tax evasion i am wondering what governments will do when a large portion of their economies start using an untraceable currency like monero the political ramification of all this stuff is fascinating i am also really curious what the market will do with a trump impeachment ,1,CryptoMarkets

JackGetsIt,1 he knows 2 he paid to give you attention now this does not mean he does not find you attractive and does not mean he would not date you but this is a huge thing to keep in mind when meeting the opposite sex socially men need to be on guard for flirty waitresses the same way women need to be on guard for confident trainers 4 any social setting where a guy can show you his physical prowess is going to affect you as a female this is danger zone for crushes 5 guys that notice a girl likes them but are not interested or do not want to ask out right away or cannot date due to work or group dynamics will toy with the attraction and see how high they can drive it it kind of a version of male self validation and practice for higher level seductions kind of like a lion toying with a baby gazelle that really only a snack this also gives him time to scout out what you do and do not like and then caters the seduction to his target in a highly effective way 6 finally keep in mind that just because a male can get you to think he high value and has a lot of experience and interest from high value women does not mean he actually does a huge chunk of the time it just means he has strong social skills and reads women well this does not necessarily translate to other good traits of a family alpha that redpillwomen are seeking it might but not always i am not mentioning all these things to dissuade you i am mentioning them all because when a women falls into crush land every bit of logic and have tting routine goes out the window and gets run through the filter of the crush this leads a lot of women to pump and dump or plate status if you keep this high level of energy and covert flirting up and he still does not ask you out drop the crush or his services because you are own mind will take this so far that you will get into a danger zone where he will know that you can be easily had this triggers a strong reaction in men to plate note one last suggestion find a way to get on the topic of dating coworkers and clients and see what his stance on that is might help you to push ahead or get over it ,13,RedPillWomen

JackGetsIt,women have exit plans and so should men it mitigates emotional damages should a separation take place which it often does and can actually strengthen a bond between two people sounds like you are from the burn your ship school of thought which is valid but does not work in a legal and social framework that encourages women to leave men in droves if you need a cheat sheet to build relationships romantic or otherwise you are missing the major problem it probably you this is a just world fallacy which i believe you will find is a very dangerous one bad things happen to good people all the time for lots of different reasons it a masculine trait to be prepared and to be proactive my bullet points were mostly centered around those ideas they were not intended as cheats you cannot cheat at building a better financial iq or friendship circle some of my points might be considered cheating nice clothing presenting yourself as a person that has skills but both sexes cheat i am sure i do not need to list the cheats women use in the smp and you are putting yourself at a major disadvantage if you do not utilize some common sense strategies when dating ,1,TheRedPill

JackGetsIt,when young ladies start this process they normally are not very good at it and do not set up their manipulations well the biggest tell is how they bait you in more experienced older women play longer cons and do a better job setting you up not so much with younger ones just watch out for set ups here are some examples of set ups or cues that she setting up a manipulation acts excessively childlike appearing helpless at something randomly complimenting you excessive requests nagging asks lots of questions hangs around doing nothing probing for information lack of attention cold shoulder using gender differences when they suit her and using egalitarianism when it suits her acting differently when authority figures are around faking agreement submission stupidity knowledge and the most common one saving minor transgressions up to be inflated and used all at once on you with an authority figure present ex she wants more bathroom time for weeks she observers how much time you use the bathroom how you use it when you use it and may even trigger you to get angry stop knocking you are annoying etc and then when the time is right she blurts to dad that you are hogging the bathroom and goes into tons of detail about how much of a crazy hog exaggerating every detail and then explains how you attacked her on multiple occasions etc so the best way to beat these things is just to always be on guard and always know that she playing a chess game with you and observe her when she does not respond retaliate the way a guy does she was hurt the same way but she seeks revenge in other ways speak with women in a covert language to counter these things ,9,asktrp

JackGetsIt,it makes sense in the context of women having a much much more heightened sense of danger juxtapose that with the safest time in all of human history and you have the majority of female senses totally out of wack and open for exploitation this is my general take on why women use this language however your scenario is a bit more nuanced and specific imho another angle you might be seeing in those particular events is emotional bonding those women are using powerful language to illicit emotional response in other women and they do not really care or comprehend that men might misinterpret those words other women of course get what the girl is saying simply that her anxiety was heightened upon their first encounter it also a compliment that the other female was so well rounded women do not like females in the group that outshine other females it a very bad thing to outshine other females in group bonding so this was a way to say hey we were so unattached when we met and now we are besties the third and last observation i will add is that many women pay attention in school and excel in academics and especially english class these being college grads they have just come off of 16 years of writing papers and sitting through an english curriculum that highly encourages sensory language and exaggeration in writing so these women are also simply using hyperbole common in poetic writing to make better speeches it sounds like that hyperbole worked because it stuck out to you ,5,TheRedPill

JackGetsIt,i do not think you understand the core dynamics at work that men and women evolved from a women needs a lot of security and consistency to birth and raise babies those babies also need to be healthy and strong therefore women are attracted to physically fit men men with resources and men with status men with status can recruit more people and more resources to the baby raising and protecting process as a female you can read books all day attend seminars and blog about egalitarianism and equal relationships but fundamental evolutionary drives will always trump those ideas unless you are already rich and safe and can afford to experiment and even then the experiment fails because it a core trait evolutionary psychology is why women put up with abusive husbands or husbands that talk down to them they feel like the guy they are with are the best they can do they prefer a guy that is abusive to them every once in a while to a guy that lets her and her baby starve or get beat up on the street women have evolved to except and even like their conquerors https therationalmale com 2011 10 03 war brides in 2017 women have it really good because being abusive towards a girlfriend or wife is so guarded against and the state is so powerful that it grounds to place the man in financial servitude his whole life if he does it or if she even accuses him of doing it thus domestic abuse is on the decline with the exception of highly highly impoverished communities ie native american communities deep south i think the prevalence of domestic abuse in high poverty communities further illustrates the women crave superior males at all costs narrative because people in poverty will cling to anyone that provides some shelter protection and food even if they are abusive and they will dismiss and excuse the abuse because they are closer to violence and potential homelessness it very easy for an ivory tower feminist with a trust fund and wealthy cucked husband to tell impoverished women to just leave their abusive husbands and it another thing to be in that situation and have nothing to turn too except for the government which many women are doing and they are finding that the government does not make a very good husband and father so redpill men just accept this dynamic even if it goes against what they were taught it the dynamic that creates sound relationships relationships that have at least a chance of lasting ,3,PurplePillDebate
JackGetsIt, a woman who abandons her family can still get the house and half his money he loses a lot if he leaves and the state will put him in jail if he is too broke to pay up this is really the crux of it and there a higher likelihood of her leaving is she not submissive and not below him in a way if you are with a man who your equal then why would she not be on the constant lookout for a superior who should not be hard to find considering she already with an equal women simply cannot empathize and understand a mans positions without an emotional connection therefore they cannot understand how bad men have it in our community if they pick an egalitarian women who then leaves them often times women even move up the ladder socially after a divorce because they now have a fancy new victim card to play ,2,PurplePillDebate
JackGetsIt,you also get this in a more extreme form with daddy issue girls the lack of a father figure encourages women to mythologized and pedestalize masculinity warped hyper masculinity is like catnip to these women women that have strong father figures are more aware that men are human and have flaws because a good father pulls you aside when you are old enough to tell you that he does not have all the answers and cannot always save you but loves you anyways and pledges to do the best humanly possible to guide you to adulthood if she does have daddy issues be ready for her to crash when you do not fix all her problems for her or someone else appears to ,14,TheRedPill

JackGetsIt,yes it rape and or assault unless someone has given clear instructions i love waking up with your dick in all my holes honey then yea i wo not even do this with girlfriends unless they have give consent however you willing indicated to your partner granted a very new partner that you wanted the relationship to go sexual quickly allowing him to sleep with you having brief intercourse our laws should take account of this and this guy should not be prosecuted or should get a much more lenient sentence women should not have the power to destroy a mans entire life with 6 years of prison and a sexual offender label for this particular type of act women must avoid all together sex before marriage or at the very least allowing men into your bedroom and engaging in sex if they are not open to incidents like this one occurring ,0,PurplePillDebate
JackGetsIt,well said i was not raised thinking like this but my experiences as an adult have led me to the same conclusion people need shaped by culture society structure rules family spirit intellect etc etc to be molded to civilized beings while some are more moldable then others that basically the base state of men and women i do think with the right structure people can become near permanently changed over but it again takes good structure ,1,PurplePillDebate

JackGetsIt,that was my favorite part of the video i had to back it up because it happen so quick it funny you bring up attractive top tier women i agree with you that they do do the auto shut down thing but some of the highest quality ones actually do the shut down with a lot of grace and experience because they actually have to do it quite often it really some of the lower tier women that shut men down with such rudeness because they are using it as a self esteem boost because they probably do not have to do it as often as they would like as a man i have had the experience to be turned down by lots of women and i am always fascinated how different classes ages and types of women handle letting men down i am always really impressed when a women i am with handles turning a guy down with grace says a lot about her ,6,RedPillWomen
JackGetsIt,i liked this video it would probably make a few people i know wake up and be able to see their situations from a different perspective my worry of course is people actually taking the advice and sleeping with more men that change your oil over at redpill we call this a covert contract and we train men not to engage in them just because you do chores or rescue a women does not mean she owes you sex or a full on relationship that being said women have a bad habit of putting men even high quality men in a beta box that do things for them he might have just been being nice and you might have passed up a potential captain that would have made you very very happy in the long run had you not allowed your brain to switch over i think some women get so many offers for sex that they have to quickly put men in boxes and build a huge wall if you are a women and you meet a guy that acts traditionally romantic towards you and you are not totally repulsed you should be open minded and at least try out a short mid week date to see if there something more there coffee or a happy hour drink is a cheap investment lot of men do not realize they are signaling beta provider status to women when they do chivalrous things for them this is due to lack of fathers in the household and single mothers who might love and care for their boys but often raise them to pedestalize and treat all women with outlandish respect this is not a recipe for success for a young boy becoming a man and that young boy will grow up one of two ways hyper blue pill pedestalizing every women he meets and getting taken advantage of or hyper masculine taught to him by other boys in the street trying to play the role of a man and not understanding that masculinity is more than brute physicality and dominance ,6,RedPillWomen

JackGetsIt,yes grief comes when we know we have truly lost something very valuable to us and we cannot hide from that experience grief is especially brutal when we are unequipped and un experienced to deal with it and or we have inflated its value it occurs more frequently and severely when we lack emotional maturity therefore intense grief that does not kill us is a very very good thing if used properly we learn mature and grow i would even argue that after growth we really only experience discomfort at loss instead of grief extreme grief therefore was a sign of emotional deficiency nbsp losing someone in death pre emotional maturity ie childhood or as an average female no one can replace this person my life is over who will feed me and love me clothe me cry cry sad sad nbsp becoming an adult learning about death learning about basic psychology learning about loss learning to help others through loss conversing with others and reading good literature educating yourself building skills forcing yourself to get out of the house and take risk and build experiences learning to provide for yourself nbsp losing someone in death post emotional growth ie genuine adulthood people die it part of life but i will go on and i am a better person for having them in my life they want me to live my life to the fullest and i will build lots of quality connections in my life after this persons death they live on in my quality memories of them i am a better person now for having this person in my life and this is just a closed chapter of a big book of my life nbsp this is of course mirrored in the bluepill to redpill grief process and many other examples of life growth nbsp losing a hot women pre redpill i will never fuck a girl as hot i will never get to have a family with her i will never get to smell that tasty pussy again i will never have a friend like that this is my peak cry cry sad sad nbsp losing the bluepill mentality you will never get back the innocence you lose a dream the dream is a disney fantasy of a loyal wife who love you for you and not your money or resources nbsp losing a hot women post redpill there are lots of other hot women and i did not lose a good wife because all women have their faults that i need to lead and manage i will find another girl probably even hotter and actually i already have a number because i forgot about that cute girl at the grocery i was not afraid to chat with i think i will shoot her a text and even if that does not workout it does not matter because i have value nbsp to build on this further it all really just a process of expose oneself to painful reality supply yourself with the right nutrients for sustenance expose yourself again nbsp expose correct sustenance grow repeat nbsp you will find that most people that are emotional physically academically stunted have some combination of sheltering themselves no exposure and or the wrong nutrients if we do not expose more and more and grow we are doomed to repeat a cycle of intense grief and loss the ones that grow the fastest understand progressive overload and they are consequently the most content level headed and valuable among us nbsp tldr lift weights ,6,asktrp

JackGetsIt, you are only really a plate if you run into the issue of wanting commitment and bring up what are we which i do not have any desire to do this moment in time sounds like you have convinced yourself that you are not worth a commitment and comforting yourself in sex with a high value guy whom you know wo not commit if asked this wo not make you less gawky insecure or shy the likely outcome is he continues to have sex with you and you will bond very strongly to him and be hurt and as he inevitable moves on this is called being alpha widowed rpw seeks to teach women that there are better ways to attract and actually retain high value men and that fun with very high value men is fleeting and compromises your future security happiness and relationship stability i believe that very few rpw and rp men advocate complete virginity till marriage as that incredibly difficult in hyper sexualized 2017 but anything more then a few short sexual mates before marriage can start to seriously effect you ability to bond strongly with your partner of course mileage may vary but this is the general recommendation of both the subs keep partner count as low as possible if you want to marry and have a family as a women ,7,RedPillWomen

JackGetsIt,you could be right redpill is still in its infancy maybe toddler stage and all of the sound and the fury may turn out to be nothing if it never succeeds to produced better quality men then it truly was a wasteful endeavor i think our society has a glut of quality men and women right now and we better put our heads together and figure out what is gone wrong ,1,TheRedPill
JackGetsIt,a foundational tenet that truly crosses over both our subs is that men are the gatekeepers of commitment and women are the gatekeepers of sex therefore men need to guard against women who give sex freely and women must guard against men who give commitment freely even if it gives you a self esteem boost while this strategy is oppositional in nature and may seem harsh and cruel on it face upon closer inspection it actually quite poetic in it polarity and one might even say beautiful because it can weld men and women together with a furious lasting intensity as two magnets when misaligned always oppose one another they create a strong bond when properly aligned a women who respects herself and her captain earns a man who provides and defends because he found something worth providing and defending ,9,RedPillWomen

JackGetsIt, i am wondering if my recent post prompted this discussion a bit of course i lean on the side of helping the normies as much as possible and here why where would science education be today without guys like carl sagan brian greene bill bryson and neil degrasse tyson it critical that a certain portion of the brilliant minds of any field put that power into making dense material fun and palatable it also critical for people learning about the pill to be able to write and flush out what they are thinking and to get some feedback if we are constantly poo pooing and banning these posts then someone that might have become a great high level contributor is snuffed out i have read some comments in this thread that suggest a deep level redpill with entry standards but i do not think that the best idea maybe we do need a are dpill for dummies sub or an everyday pragmatic redpill sub how about a are dpill authors sub where people post drafts for feedback we nearly already have a redpill for dummies sub in the form of asktrp a redpill for dummies sub might be a place to send newbs that refuse to read the sidebar or a place for meta posts some of the teens over the summer inevitable try to create a sub like this and always fail because they do not have the support from the veterans unfortunately the community of redpill related subs is getting a bit unruly lately in general so i doubt creating another sub is a magic bullet just thinking out loud thinking about the redpill authors sub some more it could be a place where banned but potentially good posts are sent for revision this would allow the mods to delete more posts without the fallout that newbs and normies get turned out in the cold edit 1 another spin off sub might be are dpillscience where evolutionary psychology biology and other fields related to gender relations that produce articles that might support redpill theories are posted and discussed this sub would feed more quality well sourced well written main redpill articles as a bonus ,2,TheRedPill

JackGetsIt,there are a portion of jobs that you can sleep with co workers with few repercussions but even in those settings be prepared for her to use the job as an angle to get something out of you plus if you break up with her you have lost access to all her friends and all your co workers are forced to pick sides and it almost always on hers so you still have a job but closed down future sex options also since work is involved even the seemingly coolest girl in the world can flip the switch and use hr against you and say bullshit sexual harassment shit almost always not worth it ,5,TheRedPill
JackGetsIt,think of this less as i will show her and more her and her network are watching women careful monitor through friends family how you are doing after a break up and being successful and moving on is a signal to not just her but all of your wavering co friendships that you are a valuable person and they would be wise to maintain contact with you women do a lot of damage control and spin after relationships in the hopes of winning friendships to their side and men would be wise to try to throw a towel in this arena it can effect your future job friendship and dating prospects there a side bonus that you can use the post break up frustrations to make yourself a better person in general it much more valuable to be productive and positive in the wake of a break up then to be down and depressed it also common for women to crawl back if you gain success and handle a breakup well of course you should not take them back nor should you do it for this reason but it certainly will help your confidence as you move onto other relationships ,9,TheRedPill

JackGetsIt,but science is not the short term middle term answer either i am an atheist myself for argument sake science of course fails as a cultural glue and religion fails as a science so modern society desperately needs something in between the two i think that academic institutions attempted to compete for that spot but feminism has basically torched that idea remaking society based on ivory tower theories is very very dangerous i think this is a great thought experiment and might make for a a good new post discussion what can we base future society on that will keep it cohesive and productive capitalism religion science chivalry academics tribalism political movements art my vote is some manifestation of cultural tribalism everything always devolves back to that it just too strong within our genomic expression science will always be marginalized because to many people do not have the upbringing and mental processing to comprehend the complexity of scientific findings i find this sad because i do believe scientific understanding is the long term solution to societies issues however i also think we risk botching everything because our chimp brains just are not handling the technology as it grows we will more then likely have a major war or environmental catastrophe before society efficiently orients itself around scientific realities ,1,theredpillright

JackGetsIt,and what may i ask are you basing this experience off of i would have said and written the same post when i was in college it hard to believe that a girl would turn a six pack 20 year old down for a 30 or even 40 year old but that because in a male mindset youth and aesthetics are king not the female mindset the female mindset places skill game resources maturity and social status above all lots of teenage and college aged men have not made anything of themselves and have no confidence women do not want to date men running the race they want men that have crossed the finish line and are training for bigger races i think the only reason you get the impression that younger women do not go for older men is that they simple date what is available to them and that often boys young men in their age group due to school and social dynamics edit to be perfectly honest with you even after i was redpilled i did not believe it either until i started approaching younger women and having success i am not trying to humble brag but i am mid 30 with modest looks modest income and modest to below modest game and i still pull under 25 year old ass on a semi regular basis i do live in a big city so that helps ,17,TheRedPill

JackGetsIt,if you are both young how do you know that the path you want him to change over too is the right path character over the long run how do you know you are right how do you know the seed is a watermelon and not a strawberry bush this change him mindset is counter intuitive and incompatible with the captain first mate dynamic a women who needs to change her man or shape her man or direct her man a thinks he not good enough in his current form or not evolving fast enough and b thinks she knows better then him or other influences in his life they evolve sometimes drastically as they mature certainly but evolve implies a natural process not another person imposing change or sculpting change it is inevitable that the core relationships and influences which are around during this period affect the trajectory of that evolution this is again different then active change influence and how do you know the other influences do not know better then the wife a redpillwomen should only strive to inspire provide comfort sex intimacy consistently and give advice when asked directly anything beyond that below that sets up a bad dynamic that can have very very bad emotional consequences for both parties i think many people bark desperately and misguidedly up this tree because it a bad tree not because they are doing it wrong but it inaccurate to say it impossible it not impossible to do the changing most of the time it downright easy because men are programmed to take care of and provide for women but it is nearly impossible to have a healthy outcome let say a female active molding and shaping ends up making her man a better person and he brings more love and money into the relationship the women quickly grows to resent him and becomes miserable in the relationships because she had to effect the change this is very hard for even the most mature and knowledgeable women to understand because it under the hood of their emotions the same way a mother is not attracted to a son she has molded a wife loses attraction for a man she now sees as a child women need a near constant dynamic of a uperior captain to maintain attraction and intimacy the risk of trying to change a man is never worth the superficial reward of quicker money resources or emotional gifts another way to think of this is a good women is a botanist in a greenhouse not a farmer her job is not the biggest best crops in the shortest amount of time it keeping the greenhouse conditions right for plants to grow the way they are intended to grow and when they are mature you appreciate them for their beauty and harvest the fruits naturally it always better for these things to come naturally because a man is far far more deeply inspired by receiving the growing conditions and nutrients he needs from a loving wife then following some set of instructions i am not saying you are endorsing changing a man i just wanted to be clear about the dangers of this process for women and men alike ,5,RedPillWomen

JackGetsIt,i had something similar happen with my fiance when women are ltr fiance or married they have two things going on one they are invested in the relationship and most of the time they are anxious that the relationship will fail because if they have gone this far they think the guy they are with has a lot of value women are always risk averse and more concerned with losing what they have then gaining something more so a lot of drama comes from a place of insecurity comfort tests are more likely then shits tests but that can be wild childish comfort tests i think what is going on is that because you have a lot of redpill knowledge and most men are downright clueless about redpill she probably picking up on a lot of inadvertent dread you are throwing out basically the narrative in her head is going heywire because she thinks you should be shifting to billy beta by now and every time she throws a tantrum you do not respond with backpeddling and trying to save the relationship even if you deeply like her and want to continue to marry her in her brain warped by modern media and feminism you should have switched by now a lot of modern women do not have redpill training they cannot be comfortable if they have not nearly cucked their men then they wonder why years from now she finds no attraction go to redpill women and you will find countless posts from women who broke their husbands because of all the power the state give them if the divorce goes down they are very upset that the attraction is gone the answer here if you want to stick with her is to start trickling out a very very small amount of beta and watch for actions that she might interpret as dread women pick up on the smallest things and run with them in their heads all day http img0 joyreactor com pics post auto 218082 jpeg so since you have decided to live with and marry this person you better get very good and all the covert communication she will be attempting to elicit from you a lot of times even telling her hey i do not mean it that way wo not help she will think what she wants to think finally get over to mrp and start learning about the differences between dealing with women inside of a marriage and outside of a marriage redpill knowledge still applies but it a whole different ball game because you have neutralized your most potent weapon being able to walk away women know this and use it to their advantage relentlessly in relationships dread is your new tool and if a women thinks you are dreading her for no reason she will get a lot of emotional damage and you will pretty soon have an anxious wreck of a women on your hands i basically did this to my wife for years and it ended our relationship do not rule out that you might need to walk from this relationship she has not got the ring and should be on best behavior it can only get worse after marriage even with the proper leadership from you ,8,asktrp

JackGetsIt,if there nothing sexier then a man who values fairness and expects or even better wants to do his share in the home then why not just date these guys from the onset the reality is they are not sexier women date the former because they are more attracted to him and they are more attracted to him because he triggers very old very well established female desires desire to be safe desire to have resources desire to mate with the fittest male of the group just because a guy is fair thinks women should be smart and wants to do housework does not make him a quality male it does not mean he wo not lose his job it does not mean he will be able to defend her if she is attacked it does not mean he can navigate social groups sandberg is just advocating well established female sexual strategy that became vogue when people started living longer and capital storage became a thing alpha fucks beta bucks sandberg translated cannot find a high enough alpha willing to settle after fucking them through your highest quality years fuck it marry a beta with some resources and marry one who will wait on you hand and foot and worship you that will make you happy ladies since women are universally not getting happier i would say she dead wrong ,23,PurplePillDebate

JackGetsIt, i have to date meet people in order to find a man to settle down with your original question was not how should i break up a date it was how do i end after several dates and emotional connections are established ie a relationship there a big difference between serial dating and serial relationships i doubt you would be getting a lot of guilt tripping and insults from men that you are simply refusing to have a second or third date with if that really the case maybe you should re analyze how you are setting up these first dates and where are they coming from maybe some of the anger is coming from guys upset you are not giving it up quickly this is common today because so many women are riding the sexual carousel and giving it up quickly this is actually a good sign quality men want you to delay sex hell we are impressed when a women can delay sex if your getting a lot of guys who are disrespectful to you after holding off sex for awhile then you are again just finding a lot of shitty quality guys with the pickup methods you are using ,5,RedPillWomen
JackGetsIt,the truth is often counter intuitive if you are looking for a magical break up method that going to have a guy giving you a nice pleasant send off with no communication or even thank you you are going to have a very bad time redpill women is not the place for this type of advice most of the time when a women breaks up with a guy it because she perceives he has some weakness and she thinks she can do better she might simply have found an upgrade that she cannot pass up and this is tough on men this weakness normally comes out even more when you cut the relationship off a lot of things that women do to mitigate these insults or guilt tripping actually make them much much worse finding a guy friend to help doing it in public letting him down easy with a slow fade out going on a vacation making him break up with you etc etc you see you are trying to see men as women with male bodies men have very different motivations and schema women can pick up on subtle covert messages and work with them the core male mind is almost autistic it needs direct harsh truth it prefers bitter truth to emotional comfort it does not like covert communication and can actively ignore it passively giving him signals that your not interested less sex less time going on a vacation etc it never makes things better guys that truly have abundance and do not get bitter after break ups are probably guys that you would not want to walk away from anyway so it just a tough thing about relationships that you need to embrace and mitigate by simply dating less and finding a captain to settle down with instead of serial dating edit one more point you also have to understand that when men get into relationships even high quality men we are always on a much longer road to finding quality women again we have literally dropped female connections at our partners demand and used our resources extensively on building the relationship women can literally find a man in hours after dating and men need to re establish connections and get back into a social scene women specifically cut off a male social scene when they are in a relationship so as to mate guard men go along with this because they are often out gunned in the relationship iq department men also do not see the breakup coming and have not prepared for it like a women naturally does ,4,RedPillWomen

JackGetsIt,women shit test men for a number of reasons but primarily to test a mans smp value and fitness thus women use testing to gauge their own desire it like if every women you met was behind a sheet until you prodded her with questions and tests and the sheet can go back up at anytime even 20 years into a marriage men have no need for testing because we literally test smp value visually the only male equivalent shit tests would be questions and observations about a women long term ability to keep up her looks which is almost always a fat no i think what you are really asking for is a comfort test equivalent for men which if caught conducting is deadly to relationship dynamics because if you are sniffing to see if a women is relationship material then it a tell that you want to ltr marry her this omission messes up the dynamic for women and can lead them to lose attraction for you women should always be hunting and pushing the commitment boundaries not you the best way to comfort test women is simple vetting meeting family and friends observing omissions about exs designing very very subtle traps to get her perspective on things like girls nights out cheating etc you will find that even a little prying exposes most women as cock carousel riding whores so be ready for lots of disappointment if you meet a redpill women in this sea of feminisit sjw insanity and you are a guy that must have an ltr marriage etc hold onto that lass like there no tomorrow ,2,asktrp

JackGetsIt,genetics and culture are two different things furthermore it would be impossible to establish a rock solid theory because the word intelligence itself is incredibly subjective let say you locked down some definition of intelligence and you designed a test to compare cultures and one culture shows higher scores if that was a valid and repeatable test then it could be repeated with other groups around the world because culture is transportable thus negating a racial advantage same goes for a racial experiment any positive results would void data on cultural findings because it should be repeatable across cultures you will also have to explain what you mean by a race of people because my understanding is that depending on how far back in the genetic record you want to go race becomes very difficult to pin down one example of this is a 2007 study on native americans 12 000 years before present eastern siberians walked across beringia specifically a grassy land steppe in what is now the bering strait all native americans in north and south american according to the research connect their genetic racial lineage to these crossers so what race do we label these people are they siberian russian native american or are we suppose to go back further to give them a racial label because 70 000 bp eastern siberians were in present day india and china 100 000 bp they were in the fertile crescent 150 200k they were in central and eastern africa so are they african european middle eastern what is the cut off is there a certain amount of years in a region that makes you a race what if you stayed in a region instead of migrating does that make you a race we could also talk about how a certain percentage of humans interbred with neanderthal and can carry up to 4 neanderthal dna should we try to design experiments and test these peoples intelligence do we test people and call them half breeds in society and promote them up or down there evidence that neanderthals were actually quite intelligent but again how do you define intelligence i am not trying to be a dick my understanding is the whole conversation is incredibly muddled and to complicate things researchers that try to do this work are shamed and dissuaded from doing any legitimate research edit i also did not downvote you that coming from other places ,3,TheRedPill

JackGetsIt, one of my biggest mistakes with this community was reading too much and having mindsets i do not agree with borderline tone policing but i will except it because technically you are saying it your problem most of the conversations here revolve around the typical sorority girl not really true quite the opposite lot of convo about regular girls who when given the option or it suite their interest normally act like sorority girls or worse how much do you read so i spend my time finding high quality women and testing them to see if they are ltr material ok that fine but it only mitigates your risk of awalt women are in the business of convincing men they are quality so they are very very good at deception screening women is not a silver bullet if you cannot get the girl to talk about things that interest you then you are doing it wrong sure but this is kinda of common sense but if you have not fucked her yet she could just be setting you up for an orbiter position after you have fucked her and she still intently listens to you sci fi talk then you still might have a shitty person but at least you know she sees you as a higher value man then herself for now i see so many people complain about how useless women are and it incredibly incorrect you just do not live an exciting life therefore you do not deserve exciting girls you are setting yourself up for a big fall here young man you missing the point the people that complain that women are useless are just in the anger stage dismiss women have uses the redpill positions is that women are children they struggle to be loyal reliable and consistent which often leads to being useless you are not going to magically find a unicorn because you live a cool life your just going to get access to better quality and better looking but still childish and immature women your still going to have to lead be on guard and prepared to get fucked because she will move on at some point sex should be easy to obtain if it is not improve your life do not focus on chasing girls you are spot on here for the most part easy is a debatable term but sure your right if you have improved yourself enough women are basically very easy too bed but now i feel like it holds me back from accepting my inner thoughts and being at peace with the beliefs i hold not really sure what you are getting at here do you mean it too difficult to follow all the nuanced debate and questioning discussion of core redpill theory is it difficult for you to hold frame if the theory is being up for discussion i guess i get that or maybe it just a time waster at this point because you have the basics this i would also agree with certainly do other shit besides reddit it a real time sink you have also phrased this as a bit of a critique on the community it sounds like you all take this shit to serious just lift and have fun and girls will like you i am moving on because that all people really need to know i think this is a bit of an oversimplification there are lots of other men on redpill in different places then you ages divorced married mensrights etc the community is bigger then you if you do walk away and this knowledge makes your life better then you might want to come back when you do have free time and help others who use to be in your position it the right thing to do ,1,TheRedPill

JackGetsIt,can someone help me why does the right want government highly involved in regulating some things but not others they want way less government regulation of business and commerce and way more regulation of sex and marriage the other thing i am confused about is the mantra government does not do anything right make it smaller coupled with government needs to outlaw and police flag burning and homosexuality third question how does homosexuality destroy families homosexuality has been around for a long time and it always been a pretty consistently small portion of the populace i do not think there a danger that all men and women are going to go full homo and stop making babies families and baby making is declining in western society for a whole host of other reasons that are much much more relevant and critical to look at then homosexuality i have never seen a coherent argument that shows homosexual acceptance benefiting the greater american culture well that would be a nuanced argument either way but lets assume for debate it does not benefit the american culture are we now taking a position that everything that does not provenly benefit american culture needs outlawed that would not make our country a better place and i would argue it goes against the pursuit of happiness clause what if you could make a good argument that religion makes our country worse do we get rid of that what about guns i am just playing devils advocate i not against guns or religion finally i am mostly a libertarian i was raised a liberal but went away from that party when i saw the attacks on free speech and the destruction of the family that feminism has produced if liberal ideas like criminalizing people who do not use the right pronouns to describe a transgender person infringe on individual rights yes we should be against those but homosexuality does not infringe on your rights and homosexuality is not a liberal idea there are right wing homosexuals homosexuality and a spectrum of sexual expression is part of the human condition and no amount of legislation will get rid of it if you do not like it see russia ,6,theredpillright

JackGetsIt,i am really late to this thread and there are a lot of comments already and i have not read them all but i will throw in my two cents i think you have two problems 1 you are trapped in the 27 30 bubble this is a terrible place to be as a modern women in feminism 4 0 land you get tons of mixed signals feminist media blue pill men and most of your friends who will want to keep you happy will tell you a big lie and they will say something like you are in your prime and lot of women now a days are waiting for marriage and family till after 30 have fun girl and you are so much hotter then you were when you were 20 all of these lines are bold face lies that have become the norm in our culture to tell women the reality is that 27 30 is the back side of your 18 25 peak smv years if women were not constantly lied to they would lower there standards and get more serious about dating and meeting men but what happens to most 27 30 women yup you guessed it they up their standards and they retract a little because they know subconsciously that they are losing their game a little bit personally i stay as far away from this age group of women for the most part they are incredibly difficult to even have small talk with they are either totally rejecting of me or want to rush things or they are very skeptical of my intentions this age group of women forgets that dating is about fun and getting to know the other person if you are interviewing for a redpill man you are going to mess up the natural dynamics and put a lot a pressure on new relationships i personally exclusively go after the 22 26 set or the 31 36 set both age ranges are a lot more fun and lower pressure thus leading to better relationships 2 there a huge difference between using redpill women suggestions to find men and truly changing your perspective and trying to be a more subservient low maintenance women to prospective men you need to more deeply internalize the redpillwomen suggestion lot of men that seem like they want a fwb situation will do a 180 with the right women redpill talks a lot of how women shit test men but men also screen women and put them in categories really early on in the courtship process something you are doing is taking you out of consideration live the life of being a quality women and you will be surprised what turns up side note please stop using the la has to many beautiful people excuse that totally ridiculous you have a lot of options in a big city my guess is you are just not swallowing your pride and putting in the work to get out and meet more people you need to go on a lot more short coffee dates and happy hours and just engage with more men you are a women so there are plenty of men that will give you that opening and pay for it do not throw out the dating websites but meet men organically lot of quality men are not quite redpilled and are terrible at approach lot of men that have approach down are not looking for the one they are still hoping that comes up organically you do not have to force yourself on men but flirt more and show interest more to encourage men to take a risk on you finally take a risk and one of these guys you like that you think there a chance with but you are not quite sure give it all submit and do not hold anything back i call it the last 20 i had ltr that are seeing me a lot and giving it all sexually and relationship wise but they are holding back still because they do not want to get hurt well if you want to show that you are wife material you have to give it all you cannot do this with every guy or it will eventually kill your soul but if you never do it you will never know if he might have changed his mind and bought the cow good luck ,1,RedPillWomen

JackGetsIt,i think this is common for lots of women and it a bit like a food addiction the problem with food addiction is that we are always hungry and food is always around no matter how much will power you have if you have to pick up dunkin donuts for the staff monday morning you are going to be overwhelmed with temptation and you will soon get that little voice in your head that says just one donuts wo not kill me next thing you know you have eaten three and had a huge unhealthy dinner as well so what is the cure nbsp step 1 recognize that you have a true addiction it seems like you have done this most people wallow in this stage for years because they do not view it as a problem they use excuses and justify their shitty behavior to themselves and their shallow friends often lie to them for the sake group cohesion nbsp step 2 eliminate hunger the only diet that ever worked for me is a ketosis diet a ketosis diet is a strict under 30 carbs a day diet that switches your digestive system to run on ketones when i am deep in this diet i can go days with out eating and often have to force myself to eat i do not crave food nearly as much as i do on a regular diet the dating equivalent is to find a man that satisfies you sexually have lots of sex and practice gratitude towards your partner never do anything that would lower his image in your eyes defend him from female friends or eliminate those female friends if you take breaks from sex fantasize about him and how much fun the two of you will have with a new move or new kink make it about the two of you do not drift and start fantasizing about other men nbsp step 3 reduce distractions you cannot eliminate food and you cannot eliminate tempting men in your life but you can reduce them do not do a ladies night out do not have that extra drink do not flirt where appropriate clothing unless it for your boyfriend pick female friends that are in relationships or not especially flirty find hobbies to fill your time that do not give you access to men i find that often times women use ltrs as a way to force them to go on a crash course man diet and marriage a full on fast but if you cannot seriously do the temptation reduction thing before marriage you are really not going to do it after marriage will have lots of down time fights and falling out you wo not be able to just take a break from you partner and find comfort in other men you will need to be faithful 100 of the time lastly do not seek to much advice from men you are attracted too i find that this is the most deadly temptation route for women they go to ask strong powerful men advice or help on something and when that strong man solves their problem they grow a bit infatuated and then they seek more advice and then quickly they are out at a happy hour with him and then back to his place recognize how these things start and nip them in the bud nbsp step 4 do not project your own unique attractions and desires onto male thought processing one of the absolute biggest problems i see with women is that they think that if a man sleeps with them then he wants a relationship when women sleep with men there an emotional connection and they have considered him as a potential partner women mistakenly think men pick mates like this we do not we have sex all the time with people we have no desire to even see again this projection is a huge misstep for women it ups their partner counts and ruins quality relationships that might have fruited into something worthwhile countless women have thrown away a quality loving boyfriend or husband with a good job and good character because they thought that something better came along no matter how high of a male partner you have settled down with there will always be a guy out there that your guy 2 0 and he might really convince you he the real deal but just because he sleeps with you does not mean he wants to buy the cow especially if the cow is a cheater if you do not want to seriously go through these steps then you need to be honest with your partner and have an open relationship or go back to being single ,2,RedPillWomen
JackGetsIt, loving man that accepts and loves me the way he did despite my reputation this is hard to find because a lot of high quality men have options and when it comes down to it they pick lower partner count women with less baggage if you find a man that can cope with your past and you show through your actions that it truly your past then you still might have a chance since you are still relatively young and a female you are in high demand despite your n count you need to put yourself out there and not have sex with guys you are not interested in just because you have a high n count does not mean you need to give up and make it worse ,7,RedPillWomen
JackGetsIt,this comment is post worthy itself i would love to see it up on redpill for debate and discussion as well my only beef is this line i think the higher the body count n count wise the more carnage both sides have within them i think men more then women are able to have high n counts and then settle and be content and loyal granted men with high n counts often have more game and if the opportunity comes in a marriage they have the tools to cheat but i find men better at controlling their emotions and not putting themselves in a tempting situations if the marriage is rocky ,1,RedPillWomen

JackGetsIt,i give the same advice to women that do not think their hot enough as i give to lots of men there someone out there that buying what you are selling should you spend time cleaning up and maintaining your product sure but do not obsess that because you are not some top shelf liquor that nobody wants to consume your contents and enjoy it one mans trash to go a bit further you cheapen your product when you do not own what you have granted you should not walk around being a 300 pound land whale and act like you are a ten but if i am dating a fatty or an ugo and i had the choice between one that was confident and enjoyed the sexual experience over won that was constantly complaining that she ugly then i would take the confidence everyday of the week it annoying exhausting and surprisingly convincing to hear people complain that they are not attractive you would not believe how many very attractive women i have broken up with because i was initially wildly attracted to them but stopped seeing that side of them because they whined incessantly about every aspect of their looks it like fine ok your ugly i get it now get out of my life ,1,PurplePillDebate
JackGetsIt,while the quality of women is declining in 2017 there are still a lot of fish in the sea men have to make a calculation there are lots of women that string men along for cash and prizes so it a balance men are turning towards not marrying at all as well the institution of marriage is a legal trap for men so even when we do find the right redpill women we are quite hesistent as we look around at all our friends with dead bedrooms and divorce rape alimony payments imagine you are a busy guy great job lots of female options and you have given up 8 quality dates to a women and made a strong connection with her and she still does not want to move forward what would you do ,10,RedPillWomen
JackGetsIt,here a simple calculation from one guys perspective note for the vast majority of men i find the table below pretty accurate age and culture may change things a bit number of current plates has a lot to do with things as well guys that have a high number of plates hit a break point where they cannot really manage another one and start culling the herd and upping standards guys that are going through a dry time with no plates often lower their standards and may get into a relationship with someone they do not really want to marry in the long term women that want marriage need to watch out for this carefully nbsp wife material potential attractive personality similarities 4 weeks or 4 8 quality dates my ex wife made me hold off for about a month nbsp girlfriend material attractive no glaring issues 2 weeks or 2 4 quality dates nbsp plate potential 1 week or 1 2 quality dates hang outs nbsp ons potential 1 2 meetups hangouts ons are often times girls that you know through friends work bar scene that you do not find to be gf or plate attractive but become available and you have the time nbsp i think what is important to keep in mind is the highest quality most alpha guy will give you some time before he drops you if he finds you to be a quality female which is why rpw advice is spot on when they tell women to hold the milk back for a little while nearly all guys even players are willing to try out a relationship with the right quality female guys of all qualities that start to drift because you did not put out early on just are not that into you and only considered you as a plate or one night stand from the moment they met you i am so surprised when a women can resist having sex with me over a few dates that it makes me actually respect her a lot more but it hits a point that you feel like you are being taken advantage of for dates no guy wants that men are not women and we select mates and choose who to sleep with and date in very very different ways then women highly visually for starters it critical not to project your own thought process or standards onto how men pick mates so basically is it possible for certain men to become more interested and more emotionally involved once sex has been had or is this all manipulation from these same men just trying to sleep with you if you have been dating him for 3 weeks or less this is mostly a lie to speed up the timetable to plate land if it 3 6 weeks it might not be a lie and he into you and rightfully would like to connect more through sex but there no magic way to figure out which one it is if it beyond six weeks he already has plenty of quality plates and can slow play you at his leisure or he a beta blue pill with no other options most quality guys with spare time do not go 6 weeks without sex and at least from my perspective do not think we deserve that level of slow play from a female in 2017 my summary above of course leaves out the long term friendship that transitions into romance that a different beast and has it own rules advantages disadvantages timetables ,8,RedPillWomen

JackGetsIt,i second the leangains website there some good information there and i have had luck with his fasted training advice that being said i do not think op who was at 270 is going to benefit from bcaa or timing his carbs after workouts until he at a healthier weight in general in addition any hard work he puts in at the gym is not going to be seen if he 30 or even 20 percent body fat as mentioned in my post i would think he would see more sustainable results if he only lifted lightly for 2 or 3 days and focused completely on diet if he has the discipline and safe lifting procedures to go 5 or 6 days and cut calories more power too him but i do not see a lot of people that are successful with this plan especially with an intense routine like 5x5 ,1,askMRP
JackGetsIt,i am talking a bit more about the mental side of things what i am getting at is there a difference between drained and unsustainable with both diet and exercise the benefits come after months and even years of slow progress it took years to get to 270 and it not going to sustainably come off after a few weeks or even months if you think what your doing right now is sustainable and not going to cause injury then by all means keep it up most friends and family i have talked about dieting with go through a similar pattern they get a gym membership they go 5 or 6 days a week 1 2 hours a session and they cut calories severely in a week or three they find they are miserable that because when you increase your energy output your body gets very hungry regardless of how heavy you are it wants to increase calorie consumption to offset the new energy expenditure most people then either give up the workout or they just go back to overeating then they might keep it up in the gym for months or even years but never see actual weight loss weight loss is done in the kitchen for the most part not the gym unless your doing high school football practice for 4 hours a day or running marathons most people cannot do enough crunches bench presses or treadmill sessions to truly cut much weight so how do we beat this hunger again i am going to try to push this hard ketosis dieting ketosis diets force your body to relearn how to use fat efficiently almost all modern americans have an enormous amount of carbs in their diets and almost all of these carbs are high on the glycemic index this means that insulin is always high and shuttling glucose to the muscles and then to fat storage your body needs retrained on how to live on fibrous fatty foods devoid of added sugars and fast carb foods only after you do that will you be able to cut stubborn belly fat if you are interested in this stuff the keto faq has a lot of material and i would also recommend why we get fat by gary taubes if you want a lighter read the 4 hour body by tim ferris talks a bit about ketosis diets and has some other fun and useful fat cutting advice the chapter on cold exposure is really interesting even if you do not go full ketosis you simply need to eat better to lose weight you need fish fibrous vegetables and lots of water cut back severely or eliminate soda beer white bread corn and anything with added sugar like candy and fake health foods granola bar bullshit stuck together with high fructose corn sugar you need real food and lots of it ,3,askMRP
JackGetsIt,listen i will get downvoted for this but that just fine stop lifting yup i said it or severely cut back that routine you cannot cut to 2000 calories a day and go on a strong lifts 5x5 with lots of hit and not have issues i see this approach problem with dieters myself included all the time people try to go balls to the wall on a new diet and exercise and they eventually fail my advice to you is to walk a lot i mean a lot 2 times a day 60 plus minutes lots of water as well hit the gym lightly 2 or three times a week no more then 45 minutes with almost no goals and focus 100 on diet personally ketosis dieting is the only thing that got me to cut stubborn fat pick a goal weight and body fat percentage and read up on ketosis dieting be ready for extreme headaches and pain for 2 6 days as you adjust to the diet as well as energy loss but after that your body becomes a fat burning machine and energy comes back like gangbusters with all the carb and caloric heavy foods we eat today your body has probably never had to burn much fat yes i know we are always burning a certain ratio of fat to carbs at 230 you are lifting a ton of extra body weight as well in the gym this stresses your joints back connective tissues etc since you were 270 at one point you might have had full blown metabolic syndrome as well so you need to not over stress your body as you slowly cut weight if you were 19 it might not be as big of a deal to cut and lift but at middle age you need to go slower on this whole process after you have hit goal weight be prepared for 3 5 months until you are there then slowly start picking up a more intense workout routine and when you do you need to increase caloric intake responsibly read iifym not reduce it the bonus with all this is regardless of testosterone levels you will simply be a lot healthier after cutting the weight and since you have been walking a ton and still light lifting your heart will be healthier if you do want to go on testosterone at this point you will be in a lot healthier position to do it good luck also please do a follow up post if you have some success and let us know what worked for you sites that may help https www reddit com r keto https www reddit com r ketogains ,7,askMRP

JackGetsIt,i guess i will bite but i want to start out with the fact that this community has an abundance of knowledgeable writers and calling the community out in your title is a bit uncouth just downvote or allow others to downvote poor low quality responses you should also at least give cursory attention to all that post because they are trying to help you even if their advice is wrong or does not seem right lastly sometimes advice that seems wrong is really accurate because it represents a paradigm schema shift that you might not have been capable of entertaining you have to approach all learning from the perspective of an infant that knows nothing drop preconceived notions is not it ideal to not give a fuck what people think and not desire validation truly not giving a fuck about everything is sub human and psychopathic but yes the ideal male frame is to be almost completely unphased by most turn of events how can stoicsm work with validation seeking the term validation is a female term and it only recently come into vogue third wave feminism and the psychology community foisted this term upon the general public because women always need more and more from society they are already the most privileged creatures in the world and need more privilege at every turn so stoicism and validation seeking do not really have anything in common if anything stoicism is the polar opposite of validation seeking if validation is good why not seek it all humans need validation to a degree but those that can deal with less of it and accept it more abstractly i feel validated because i have the privilege every day to live in the us and go to my job i love being in my children lives and being able to provide for them that validates me people that need constant direct validation have a mental illness or are going through crisis in their life some articles on internet says you should stop seeking validation and approval of others you cannot really shut the need for approval and emotional interaction with others off those articles you are reading are probably geared towards narcissistic young females that are in a echo chamber of validation already and need more of it and yes that advice is solid seek less validation the more pertinent advice is to dig down deep and look at why you need to be validated so much it normally because you have not achieve enough or you are not working towards goals in you life and your focused on the cursory shallow things instead of rewarding concrete things excessive need for validation can also come from overexposure to a culture that tells you to consume more and that you are guaranteed a millionaire husband and model girlfriend our culture is toxic are there any scientific studies on this again validation use to be grouped in with a lot of other concepts self esteem social capital emotional iq the psychology community is constantly shifting its labeling of things daniel goleman emotional intelligence reads a bit like a text but but it chalk full of useful information about the topic you are asking about it might be a good starting point there an older psychologist named scott peck i like a lot as well he wrote a book series called the road less traveled that might interest you also the way of men by jack donovan talks about male stoicism a lot i would want more followers i would want more women in my life more sex more attention you might be confusing validation with hedonism the need to be famous and drowning is sex is a fantasy people in our history did not have this problem most just sought to survive and if they were luck provide for a family this new push to have your 15 min of fame or be famous is a result of very powerful marketing i strongly encourage you to do a journal on one week of how many advertisements you are exposed too it mind boggling even the more disciplined person will be effected by constant advertisements i live my life as far away from ads as possible no cable adblocker software books not magazines forcefully ignore billboards etc near zero social media presence my last bit of advice is to meditate and get away from it all hike backpack walk with a dog or friend and do not talk if you check my submission history i have also written a starter guide on mediation good luck ,1,asktrp

JackGetsIt,my theory on mansplaining is that women have very little working knowledge of most technical fields and even the ones they do have working knowledge in they are not confident enough to articulate it and claim it see studies on women being overqualified but refusing to ask for raises promotions therefore men are constantly forced to explain things often times repeatedly often at female request how many times have you had to re explain football rules or a political concept to a female it like you as a female choose not to inform yourself and learn about the world and you rely on men to do all the technical stuff and then you get upset as us for explaining the technical stuff we live in strange times ,15,MensRights
JackGetsIt, i also read a study about how men need shared activities to keep in touch i have read lots of similar studies books as well related to this men and women bond very differently as well women build friendships out of desire for social inclusion and climbing which means they might have nothing in common with their female friends which translates into zero loyalty always tread carefully when courting a women women see men as masculine women they cannot get outside of their own heads and conceive that men actually think abstractly and bond deeply and loyaly never tell a women you do not have friends if she asks about your friends and family just very subtly imply that she has not reached that status in the relationship yet men without friends are a huge red flag to women that value men that have a strong social iq a large network of friends and acquaintances shows a strong iq and strong smv ,2,asktrp

JackGetsIt,this gets talked about a lot on redpill and asktrp let me try to lay it out for you at least how i interpret it there nothing wrong with acknowledging that women have a strong effect on men you can make an argument that it deep in our psyche and genetic expression to protect and provide for females this is of course debatable a women smell touch shape mannerisms and movements are like kyptonite to a healthy man she will even help you genetically clone yourself into a new generation trp advice that says would o not improve for women is trying to prevent men from being crushed when women flake divorce cheat or take children away some women do even far worse many men are not a well positioned to bounce back from cheating and divorce women systematically leave relationships and use them to move up not down in society men tumble hard because our physical and emotional resources are often completely cleaned out by our ex partners women are able to do bad disloyal disrespectful things to men because they operate in a grey safe zone in society men and other women alike shelter women from accountability and responsibility this same desire to protect women also allows them space to manipulate and game the system redpill has 189k subscribers but the knowledge that women are not unique innocent snowflakes is lost on the bulk of people in the western world it use to be common knowledge that women have lots of potential for evil and can even destroy whole kingdoms men of course are too but women are capable of a particular type of evil that knowledge is lost right now in our culture on the flipside our society currently sees men as bumbling idiots that need women to dominate and direct them this narrative is so polar opposite of the day to day reality of male and female dynamics so to circle back to your question s it actually ok to have women as a big pushing drive you should not have one women as a pushing drive you never sell your fishing boat so to speak and you should have other drives power spirituality skill development self worth support of friends and family hedonic drives drives to help society etc etc women should factor in to your drives but not be the only factor this mindset also helps you to walk away from women when you do start getting laid more the power to walk away is the only power we have and if you have not developed some other strengths then you will be indebted to women this is an enormous turn off for women and ruins relationships no matter how well they might have started ,1,asktrp

JackGetsIt,men and women are both a mixture of logical mindset and emotional mindset men prefer and have natural inclination to spend most of their time in logical land and women emotional land if you ask women what they are looking for in a partner what turns them on so to speak whether they are talking to female friends male friends or a news reporter or themselves they almost universally say some variation of he makes me laugh now notice that she does not say he funny or he tells good jokes nope listen to her words he makes me laugh this means women are always looking for men who can get them away from their logical state and away from negative emotional states and into fun relaxed emotional states because women live in a mans world this is changing by the way that another post a logic world in logic world they spend all day working and taking care of people and providing for themselves they are desperate for any opportunity to get away from logic land look at female hobbies drinking socializing following their own emotional roller coasters and reading watching narratives about other people drinking socializing and going through emotional roller coasters what do men do when they get a break from logical work they logically play video games sports collecting and logically researching how to be better at said games sports and collecting so you are probably wondering how do i just switch a women i have never met cold fish from a logical to an emotional state in a mans mind this seems very difficult and for us men it is we want to stay in the logical state we resent others that try to make use emotional because we must project control and frame at all times but in a women mind it a whole different story they want to be pulled into the emotional state they are addicts and you are the dealer just do what every good dealer does offer the first hit for free there are lots of ways to do this with women but each is her own lock with her own unique key and you need to be observant to find what unlocks her emotional state so lets circle back to your scenario a girl has no idea you exist no eye contact walking towards a destination she in logic land and if she looks upset she in negative emotion land the right approach is anything that takes her out of that land anything that gets her to laugh about the absurdity of her situation anything that is a bit self deprecating or trivial or observational humorous is a golden first step this of course depends on the target she has her own unique triggers but will often covertly tell you what they are because again she an addict after you take that first step with her then she already hooked and she want more from you you are her exit ticket from logic land after a couple of witty exchanges back and forth get a number or plan to meet up with her again in a common routine and be done with it and she will be emotionally charged and excited to see you the next time you meet because you represent escape and fun any scripted line you bring any moroseness self centeredness that not comical or any whiff of reality will sink your ship now look back to those pickup lines you wrote are they getting this particular target to a fun emotional state or are they doing something else finally since i have your attention thus far let just finish up and talk about getting a women attention when she already in the fun emotional state you might observe this state in women at bars or restaurants you see this state in younger women that have been sheltered from logical man land this seems like it would be a harder nut to crack right nope all you need to do to unravel this last challenge is to offer her an ever so slightly better emotional fun state have you every had a hershey bar they are pretty damn good but something funny happens if you have traveled to switzerland and had real chocolate all of a sudden hershey bars are downright nasty is there really that big of a difference between the the two probably not but to a person who eats a lot of chocolate it a huge difference women physically eat a lot of chocolate and mentally eat a lot of men and this is another place men take a mental fart men think that women should be loyal to their hershey bars and they can be if they have not tasted anything else men value loyalty and project onto women that they should be the same but women are addicts they crave novelty and emotional stimulation preferably positive just be a little bit better option and watch her loyalty melt away ,3,asktrp

JackGetsIt,the first thing i need you to do is get out our your own head what attracts you to women does not attract women to men men and women live in vastly different planes of existence when it comes to exual attraction men have such a strong visual sexual drive that they believe women share it women do not have a strong visual drive when it comes to attraction women have a completely different paradigm schema that most men struggle to comprehend why girls wont text me first the smp has foundational rules that apply to almost everyone with a few exceptions one of those rules is men approach this is a rule because a huge component of a females attraction to a male is he has taken her a man who approaches signals he takes risks he sexual active he feels he would be a good mate he feels he will not have social fallout from the interaction if turned down etc etc from a male perspective imagine a girl with big tits that constantly hides them in a sweater or imagine a women that wears a head scarf and hides her face and hair men who refuse to approach are tabling a huge chance to show traits that women find attractive texting and approaching is basically a negotiation and the first person who speaks in a negotiation often loses so even a women who likes you is going to sit back and watch you work her texting you first or approaching you first is basically her showing you all her cards before there even been a first round of betting he pussy is valuable and only certain men can get at it women are solipsistic it all about them and their pussy and she did not reply on that the last text what to do in situation like this the second thing you need to learn about women is they have an enormous amount of male resource and sexual options available to them in a constant flood from age 17 33 give or take a few years this enormous abundance creates a cautious creature despite modern feminism and birth control women still take on a lot of risk when they have multiple partners so unless you have found great ways to show off all your value and she in a place to absorb process and act on that offer your going to get a ton of rejection even if you have a lot of value here a prescription 1 do not live and die on every approach and rejection get out assume she attracted to you move on when her actions do not match up with someone that into you 2 improve your smp as much as possible game money looks lifting status status symbols career 3 get good at communicating with women covertly have regular conversations with lots of women but have a subtext that you are into them the female world is a world of reading between the lines and saying one thing but meaning something totally different this if very different from man land 4 do not self evaluate every time you are rejected or texts are returned that will quickly depress you yes she might have turned you down or moved on or slow played you because she thinks your not good enough for her but most of the time it a million other reasons in a relationship emotional on period not in to blonde guys this week thinks she hot shit thinks she worthless and on and on and on you need to carry forward a positive self image in other reactions with women so ignore these crazy bitches that flake on you it there loss 5 follow a girls actions never her words women often lie to placate the feelings of a social setting but might really like you so close the deal ask her out ask her back to your place ask her to another part of the bar and see what she does 6 control the mood of the situation and you control her women will ruin a marriage or a good ltr and fuck you just because you showed her a good time and they will hate you even if you are jacked and good lucking if you are boring as fuck women want novelty fun and excitement be the source of that and you will fuck women every night for the rest of your life ,2,asktrp

JackGetsIt,what attracts people to each other is a desire to mate with them no matter how many layers of humanity and disney propaganda you want to throw on that it does not change the fact that we are fuck driven let start off by throwing out low quality men let talks about the top 20 30 of men in the dating market these are men the women are interested in that the rest of the male world is invisible to them the top 20 of men might act like normal men but the reality is many women want to lock that specimen away from the dating market and have his babies and posses his resources exclusively the exclusivity is desired by the female not the male she knows deep down that her sexual value will fade and that she needs a support network for her and her children from 28 78 locking down a high quality man with a relationship is an excellent way to do this although many women are opting out of this and using seed banks the government and lesbian relationships society itself will always have an impact on the sexual market place men do not have this same degree of worry of age limitation and resource limitations especially high quality men so technically your post is right when dealing with low quality men low quality men or men that do not know their value and do not take pride and market their value are stuck begging women for both sex and a relationship or worse they try to use relationships to get sex high quality men only want relationships when they have found the absolute highest quality women available and they believe her to be good ltr material this could happen after many sexual relationships so again to simplify the highest goal for a man is sexual access to a high quality female the highest goal for a female is a relationship with a high quality man it not difficult for a women to attain sex from men because men badly want sex and will have ons and short relationships with many women but a women runs a huge risk when she has ons and short relationships or long relationships with no ring she risks her precious time and she risks pregnancy with a male that does not want to provide support and social shame all of these factors are again being reduced by modern society but they are certainly still there ,1,PurplePillDebate

JackGetsIt,this thankfully is actually discussed on redpill quite a bit it just another reason you do not improve for women you improve for yourself ,83,TheRedPill
JackGetsIt, and does your fiance look at you differently probably but in a good way in an i cannot keep my hands off of that way this is basically what i came here to say as well i think a lot of the fear comes from a place that op will mess up the image of herself to her husband in reality it will only make him connect to her more men love when a women can flip a switch and be comfortable enthusiastic with being adventurous in the bedroom ,2,RedPillWomen
JackGetsIt,this gets brought up a lot and there really no solution the minute you create a teen redpill it ghost town because teens do not want advice from other teens and adult wo not spend time on the subreddit asktrp is the closest you will get to a teen subreddit the other problem with a teen redpill is that a lot of the advice boils down too bury your head in the books or a trade and get a good financial footing as early as possible then fuck women go monk mode and reap a better harvest in adulthood too many teens want short cuts and a little pussy and then bankrupt their future by not investing in their careers there are no shortcuts to consistent high smv ,1,TheRedPill
JackGetsIt,you just described like 80 percent of guys in relationships guys that get in ltr often lose a lot of drive because they have what they need food sex shelter and because they do not have a lot of redpill knowledge they take ltr for granted and do not manage their mates very well they lose the fight that kind of where we are in society right now that being said you need to leave sounds like you have already flipped a switch i promise you nothing you do will get the spark back and it highly unlikely he changes enough for you to get re attached if you are under 27 and keep up your looks you need to strongly consider getting back out there the only warning i would give you is that there are lots of men out there that will seem like a better catch and then will be the exact same computer dwelling guy after they get comfortable in a relationship this is very difficult to screen for ,1,RedPillWomen
JackGetsIt,many women do this but few produce any fruit from the process she doing this because she see you as her captain and she will continue to do it until she does not how do i support her to become stronger without letting her lose the beautiful part of her personality nothing you do will make her become tougher without your leadership she will only lose the beautiful part of her personality if you want her too she is only doing all of this because of your leadership so you support her by continuing to be a valuable man you lead by keeping her expectations low and always delivering what you promise the minute you fall and show weakness her facade of emotional toughness and resiliency will falter or completely collapse this is the feminine dynamic and if you do not see it collapse it probably because she is monkey branching if you want a better word for emotional toughness combined with feminine beauty i would recommend the word grace or poise and most women have this or they do not because it comes from having a good father ,1,asktrp
JackGetsIt,here a deeper problem with speed reading let assume that someone can increase speed and comprehension to say like 800 words per minute there a third level to consider internalization very few people in the world have a brain that can internalize information at the rate they read and comprehend it by internalize i mean comprehend something at such a level that i can use it in my life connect it to other experiences manipulate the information and teach it to others another way to say internalize is mastery over the information presented very very few people that read fast or slow internalize what they read and that really the issue at hand the modern world is very very much low on internalization internalization takes time reflection practice application and life experience ,1,TheRedPill

JackGetsIt,yes i am being serious i am not a blm advocate far from it i also do not think people should protest inside of libraries but modern america is pretty hostile towards protest americans wealthy or not have insulated themselves from protests and all forms of inconvenience in general we live in information and physical bubbles on the daily ,1,videos

JackGetsIt,well said both tests come from a place of insecurity women operate from a constant state of insecurity shit tests are an insecurity that you are not a strong enough man for her requirements comfort tests are a projection of insecurity that you are so strong she needs reassurance of commitment a good ltr is basically a series of occasional comfort tests and zero shit tests because it is always better to error on the side of strength ,4,TheRedPill

JackGetsIt, ure the world is not fair it does not owe you anything here is how you can exploit that this we are both in agreement about and redpill probably needs to not venture into mra issues at the risk of corrupting it core message however it will be redpill type men useful strong goal oriented men who will end up picking up the pieces of society that feminism has shredded it my hope that another branch that not quite redpill and not quite mra arises that seeks to form clear action oriented grassroots political activism to fix all this bullshit ,1,PurplePillDebate
JackGetsIt,but is not it masculine to shape build and mold the world is not it men that created society laws police forces and military in the first place we as men have allowed feminism to hijack these legal and societal instruments and institute expand feminist doctrine duluth model family court continued unfair alimony etc granted the mra movement in it current form is not very action oriented but that does not mean it cannot grow towards that i am not an mra myself because i still think there a lot of confusion about what the mra actually want to change but why is it considered weak to want to fight and change laws and vote for candidates that are against feminism ,1,PurplePillDebate
JackGetsIt,a lot of social meetings are focused around alcohol and if you avoid alcohol you also exclude a lot of opportunities to meet people so do what a lot of people do have one or two shitty low alcohol beers like michelob ultra your other alternative is to focus your friday and saturday nights around events going to sporting events participating in sporting events hobbies clubs art music etc there may be alcohol at these events but there will be less pressure because alcohol is not the focus when you go to a bar alcohol is the focus lastly go to bed early and get into early morning sat and sunday activities like bike rides or hiking clubs you will probably meet a whole group of people that do not drink or want to limit their drinking then you can hang out with these people alcohol free during other times of the week as well because you met them sober and alcohol is not at the heart of your friendship ,2,asktrp

JackGetsIt,stacey gets hit on less as well maybe not 2 times a month but men have collectively stopped hitting on women in general because of feminism and the hostility women have towards men in fact the only men left hitting on women are complete scumbags for the most part and this further biases women towards a very that men are complete assholes this attention deficit has made women turn to social media which is a huge fake validation train that messes with women signals stacey fucks chad because she puts herself around him that it chad is probably annoyed with her shitty personality i guarantee you chad would love to fuck you in your tight nerdy little butt good men do not value a superficial hot girl over a nerdy hot girl or a sporty hot girl or a musical hot girl unless the girl is delusional in her self evaluation of sexual appeal and many women are because men just like visual attraction if you as a nerdy girl want to get hit on more you need to spend less time around nerdy men that have higher rates of autism and were raised to not initiate and approach and more time around more dominate and bold men they are out there but many of them are working their ass off at school and career and side projects get your head out of your ass y all are just as horrible and subhuman as us women xd i find it interesting that you have labeled yourself subhuman here is this an omission that women can be really really shitty is this an omission that redpill is not wrong about everything i find this interesting because i do not see redpill as dehumanizing women at all it actually quite the opposite it humanizing them it saying they are not these perfect pure creatures that many blue pill men make them out to be they are people capable of being shitty and with very different sexual mating tactics they are also people with different brain chemistry structure they create different types of friendships they have different motivations and they have different types of empathy this does not make them ubhuman it just makes them different and it ok to acknowledge differences between the sexes some men and some women will cite these differences as superiority and inferiority but both are wrong imho your confusion is common and it comes from how redpill men speak to each other and the rhetoric used in girl land being direct is a no no when you read one article title that even hints at misogyny you immediately assume that there a huge underbelly of misogyny because the way you communicate says that people are always hiding a lot more under even the most subtle communication well you are wrong redpill is a male space with male communication norms when men communicate with eachother they are almost always blindingly and loudly direct and redpill seeks to be so direct to it flock that it often times uses harsh language and click bait type headlines to shock and awe and the core message is not really about mysogony or treating women as subhuman or hateful i hope i gave you something to chew on give redpill men and redpill women subreddits another glance and i bet you will be pleasantly surprised jackgetsit out peace ,1,PurplePillDebate
JackGetsIt,technically the signs were not there for a large portion of the country because people have very little civic education they are very much tuned out of the political process and only consume news from biased sources or completely fake sources it the triple threat of destruction of public education monetized media and regulatory capture crony capitalism this is the end point of democracy if not corrected ,2,politics

JackGetsIt,i am purple pill about mra redpill is pretty hostile to it and i think it phase two the current set of ideas and suggestions behind redpill tell you to just keep your head down and behave as others so that you can have a career and if you are already married to prevent divorce i feel eventually we will have an army of dyed in the wool redpill men i think we already do in the case of lot of conservative and military men that do not identify with redpill but identify with a lot of mra issues and the next phase will be to get the laws changed and to get the laws changed first you must win the culture war redpill men cannot win the culture war if they do not speak out gather hire each other etc men will again need to group up and go to war as brothers to correct a lot of problems that we have gotten ourselves into in modern society surprise surprise men will again be the ones fixing the problem ,2,asktrp

JackGetsIt,you have this fear because you trust and envy women shudders you trust that if a women rejects you you must not have value therefore every approach is a legitimate evaluation of your complete masculinity this mindset is a result of feminist blue pill indoctrination and it is absolutely toxic to healthy masculinity the fact is that women reject men as a default and they reject men in countless ways for countless reasons stop trying to gauge how attractive you are to the opposite sex at any given time and start thinking in terms of value the only foundational rule of thumb in attraction is how useful of a man you are to society if you are useful physically socially and financially your value is higher if you are less useful in those areas you are lower value i had this issue you bring up for a long time and it still lingers i was a slave blue pill mindset is a slave mindset how can i be the best slave i must be worthless because my master said so going redpill is a bit like braking the chains it can be scary if you have recently broke the chains and do not own your own farm immediately after going redpill can also be compared to kicking alcoholism everyday you have to reaffirm that you will not take a drink of the blue pill liquor you are a man and everything you want in this world you must take nothing will be handed to you women actively attempt to discourage men because they want a man that takes if you look like a high quality man they will resist less if you look low quality they will resist more but the default women have is to resist because any girl that gives herself freely to men is ripe for abuse women walked in a dangerous world for most of human history and they still mentally walk in that world on guard at every interaction men may never fully understand this female guard or solipsism let me help you out further there are three groups of men having success with women 1 quality men that have lots of success accomplishments getting things done with their life women find ways to get with these men at all costs regardless of the mans game or confidence this group of men may or may not have good genetics this group of men does not need to approach women or even have a lot of social iq to be successful with them this is also where a lot of bad relationship and pick up advice comes from 2 men that develop game and learn how to hi jack the process that women use to distinguish quality men these men are constantly playing the numbers and putting themselves out there 3 men that embrace their masculinity and the process of getting better at things they put themselves out there to meet women and continue to approach regardless of outcome they continue to better themselves despite success as well group two and group three have success with women regardless of visual and financial smv because they do not give up approach to simplify this guy one has success guy two fakes it accentuates it and guy three will have it be guy three ,2,asktrp

JackGetsIt,every girl is on a sliding scale of attention seeking personality type regardless of how badly they seek general attention women hide this when they are courting a man and leading up to marriage but struggle to hide it after marriage sounds like you have a women that high on the attention seeking side and she starting to drop the ruse because she know she has you trapped in marriage she getting bolder for a few reasons 1 she wants you to man up and posses her again she does not see you as a leader and flirting to other is a win win to her you either step up and act like a man or she find another one there no down side for women in 2017 to divorce a man they get the money kids family sympathy etc 2 she horny as fuck and probably needs some more dominate role playing if you do not satisfy this in her she will seek it somewhere else remember that if you maintain leadership in the relationship she will want your attention and your sex not someone else do not do anything that encourages her attention directed towards others she needs safe outlets taking care of kids dogs house and she needs that attention on you you need to do some light dread on this lady and fuck her good when she redirects her attention on you ,2,askMRP

JackGetsIt, similar educational levels and social class marrying this will always be secondary to attraction you cannot negotiate attraction attraction is always king if a man can find an attractive women that also fits his education and social class then that just a bonus the problem is coming from men not knowing their value men today are highly programmable and manipulated by women and media because modern society is a gynocentric playground i would love to read the piece i always argue debate in good faith frankly i think this phenomenon is mostly driven by the well intentioned social welfare provided to the lower classes a pregnant woman who remains single can qualify for a host of benefits from free obstetrical care to food while continuing to see or even shack up with her partner on the side we are in complete agreement on this point they generally lose nothing by marrying and so they do and their kids reap the benefits the women and children do not then men have everything to lose gain depending on the whims of the female ,1,asktrp
JackGetsIt,i think he wrote that when texting had not become so dominate but the core of the book is that if you project to women that you are a high value guy and they buy into it nothing else really matters good read but the book is mostly geared towards rich white guys not normal guys it geared this way because most western women have a strong bias towards rich white guys or young white guys that look like they are on the tract to be rich wealthy family in a good college etc that just the situation and every other guy out there has to deal with this reality there of course plenty of women to go around and you do not have to be a rich white guy to land hot women ,2,asktrp
JackGetsIt,lol you actually have a good problem on your hands the fact that you have access to women that agree to go on dates is head and shoulders above a lot on men in society and it sounds like these girls have some value and think they can do better then you that means you have access to high quality women that are in the market for men these are all huge green flags and you just need to get better at game keep going on dates keep improving yourself workout my guess is that you are not picking up on a lot of covert language and the women you are going on dates with are getting the feeling that you are not really a high status man you need need to spend more time with women and learn how to communicate with them covertly and if it helps get out there and bang a few ugly girls and get comfortable in your own skin you might just be a bit stiff on dates and too outcome dependent good luck try reading corey wayne 3 man one thing that helped me a lot that he mentions in the book is that first dates should always be short and mid week never take a girl for a first date on a friday or saturday unless it a group thing she instantly starts thinking to herself wow this guy does not have any better options then me a high value guy that my pussy deserves is out on multiple events on the weekend and should not have that time off right away until he knows me i know it sounds weird but that how the hamster operates ,2,asktrp

JackGetsIt,you have got to understand something feminism got going because attractive women and married men that had access to lots of men and therefore disagreed with feminism would not actively oppose feminism women rarely actively do anything they sit on the fence unless forced to choose men did not oppose feminism because their wives and girlfriends seemed to support it and they did not want to fight it men want to get laid and the betaness that arisen in modern culture has created a world where men are afraid to stand up for their beliefs they just go with the flow and fear offending the men rights movement has none of these things going for it women will fight it men will fight it hell even the conservatives http thefederalist com 2015 07 06 why i am not a mens rights activist who desperately want us to go back to a time where women married as virgins and stayed at home refuse to support the men rights movement what does that tell you about how this movement is being marketed my take is that conservatives just see mra as an extension of sjw movement and therefore liberal and bad being brutally logical and picking your battles carefully is the only route that will help this movement continue to grow ,1,MensRights

JackGetsIt,the fact that you have to ask this question is the result of feminist indoctrination and propaganda it a wild world out there with a lots and i mean lots of bullshit information having aversion to high n count women is completely natural throughout history if the mate you took was a verifiable virgin you were guaranteed that the offspring would be yours of course medically not all women have hymens or have partially hymens or lose them naturally or accidentally before first intercourse before medicine caught up and made this common knowledge this probably really hurt a lot of women in strict cultures as men could accuse them promiscuity before marriage which was a big no no in most societies men want women that will bear their biological children and only theirs when birth control became a thing in the 60 and more women were also in the working world society had a problem women could use their vagina more effectively their privates became even more weaponized before birth control most women took a huge risk in having multiple partners because they could be shamed and saddled with a child without a man to care for it the two sexual mating strategies were equalized but after the birth control revolution marriage got decoupled from taking possession of a virgin i think it important to note that men through history have married high n count women fathered out of wedlock children married women that could not have children and those men and society were find with it but everyone admitted it was not ideal youthful virgin is just the ideal and feminism has attempted to shame men that want the ideal because it natural for women to attempt to manipulate men it basically their only tool in general women do not build things in society they have children and manipulate men if feminism can successfully get you to go against your natural urges and attractions then it raises the value on women that have slept around and aged passed their prime this is very important the two sexual strategies oppose one another please read the side bar in the future before posting devlin sexual utopia in power does a much better job of describing this entire issue ,5,asktrp
JackGetsIt,i think it important to distinguish that a college education and it higher earning power has been pushed by almost everyone the two income family also became a thing after wwii well before 2nd and third wave feminism the war changed the economic landscape girls here it from mothers fathers and teachers that the modern family is dual income and going to college will earn you a higher income i think a lot of the rise of radical feminism is also coming from women that get on career track delay childbirth and then get angry because they are competing with women that are younger they do not want to lower their standards for what they could have pulled down at their peak feminism is a convenient way for them to blame men and the patriarchy for not choosing a 35 year old account manager over a 20 year old college student or server women cannot really crawl around inside a mans body and realize the attraction difference between a 20 year old and a 35 year old it does not compute because they can only see the world through their own lens ,1,asktrp

JackGetsIt, i would be the loser in that case because all i have are my looks in comparison luckily for you in 2016 your looks alone can take you pretty damn far with women i think it really a blessing that women evaluate men more completely can you imagine if both sexes judged each other solely on superficial looks we would have a very unproductive society ,5,PurplePillDebate
JackGetsIt, unfortunately people judge based on presentation most people will not take the time to actually understand it agreed the mods are also very hard on tone policing posts because they believe that just another form of censorship cue sjw crowd that uses victimhood and language control as a form of power and i tend to agree with them the rp mods ,2,PurplePillDebate
JackGetsIt, lookism this is a philosophy that you cannot argue with because it based on evolution creatures want to mate with creatures that have healthy features being realistic about this is step one men actually have a lot more leeway then women do in this area because we can offset poor genetics with a lot of other factors confidence money status skills etc women are stuck with looks for a lot of their attraction currency ,5,PurplePillDebate

JackGetsIt,i think a lot of modern women do not realize how disrespectful this is because of the current feminism and all the beta males that put up with this shit almost all women know why they keep up the contact they are keeping their options and access to resources open that the female imperative my advice is to instantly plate her or soft next her but if you are a glutton for punishment you can try to tell her you find it disrespectful and it must stop immediately if she protests at all or gets resentful or you catch her in any way contacting him then instant plate or instant ghost her there a small chance she will actually become more attracted to your leadership and then you might actually have an ltr possibility on your hands but do not get your hopes up at all ,3,asktrp
JackGetsIt,if this was posted in redpill it would promptly be pulled down because redpill does not deal with gay relationship dynamics you would be directed to this very small https www reddit com r alttrp sub now i am sure most gay men leave the subreddit at that point and say to themselves what a bunch of homophobes and i am sure there are some homophobes on redpill but that dismissal misses a larger point redpill is primarily about a male female dynamic and the majority of the posters do not have experience with the gay male sexual dynamics you need to get advice from experienced gay men that are not feminists or blue pill i myself am not against homosexuality unless it seeks extra privileges like the feminist movement has evolved too i am also against gay culture that adopts a victim mentality complex so if the lgbt community can separate itself from the sjw community we would all be better off but i do not think that going to happen to get to your question i think you can pretty much read all of the philosophy stuff that recommended on redpill you might even be able to read some of the pua stuff because there a lot of self help advice that would apply to all people not just hetro people i think it important to understand that even if you do not fuck women you are forced to live in a society that become dominated by their games and manipulations of the legal system so the redpill sidebar is still essential reading finally i would specifically recommend the following texts the way of men by jack donovan you can still be masculine be solutions oriented and understand male bonding and be gay 10 happier by dan harris wonderful text on mediation the practicing mind by thomas sterner mediation applied in life no more mr nice guy already recommended in this thread i second this edit 1 this post https www reddit com r alttrp comments 2ixf8p a gay mans guide to taking the red pill 10 might go into the nuance and details you are looking for a bit more ,2,asktrp

JackGetsIt,in her head she not cheating also this whole situation has nothing to do with feminism feminism is just an extension of female solipsism that we as men have allowed to infect society as a whole in the past men have fought and died to keep it contained you might have met a southern girl that posts anti feminism shit all day on her facebook and acts all submissive around you and she would have done the same damn thing women cheat that what they do but when they do the narrative is they were forced or the relationship was already over or i never really loved him etc etc and again this does not really have anything to to with feminism in a way relationships are all about controlling the narrative and women are very good at it it just the female sexual dynamic and sexual strategy in action remember not to look for scapegoats like feminism kill your blue pill you are only ever are nting a women you never own her women by their nature are not loyal if you need a redpill refresher i would recommend checking my submission history and looking up redpill greatest hits or rereading the sidebar i also have a post about the 6 stages of break up my guess is she gave you multiple signs she was going to cheat but you missed them all good luck on your break up the pain will go away and you will be fine just be prepared to ignore her reaching out to contact you and feel you out ghost ,3,MensRights

JackGetsIt,but then technically you would never have a clean test environment because it all the patriarchy would constantly be shouted which is unsurprisingly what is happening in feminist academics modern feminism itself is really just a branch of post modernism which is a unique field of historical study it does not really seek to find more history it re interprets previous texts with a different lens and often cherry picks the texts to fit a narrative i am not necessarily against post modernist historical analysis because some history needs to be reinterpreted but it certainly not traditional historical study and feminism itself is a perversion of history with selfish narratives women who were able to attain stay in power had to act even more extreme than a man to be taken seriously or taken another way they simply had to be competitive within nature it not a patriarchy it nature it only comes off as a patriarchy because before technology and especially before modern nation states men simply ruled by brute force unless they lived in a culture they created that put women or oft power priest into power nature does not care if it a man or a women who takes power or how they do it hitting someone with a rock or being the queen of a country and commanding an army ,30,MensRights

JackGetsIt,i hope you noticed that i held back on giving you direct advice in my comment that because i do not know your relationship you do you are saying i should keep trying to improve my emotional reaction yes but more important you need to look into why you are reacting so emotionally is it fall out from past relationships is if fear and insecurity in your current bf insecurity in yourself is it hormonal is it that you have poor tools for dealing with anger is it entitlement is it misguided expectations you want more then he can offer you are you hoping to build the right man instead of find him my experience is women that get upset about petty uber arguments are really crying out about something else when we are deeply in love with someone nothing about them bothers us and when we want out we find that even the smallest things enrage us now sometimes that core thing is legitimate and some times it inflated that what you need to explore you have to understand that when you were a young women you could toss men under the bus when you found the slightest flaw because you were at peak value there were men lined up around the block to interview and fill the new opening you are now at a different phase in your life granted i would be giving the same advice to a 20 year old that was going to marry because she is going to be married past 30 as well and the time is now to create a foundation of respect now that you are older and trying to settle in on a ltr or marriage you need to start compromising and laying a foundation of respect and reverence towards your captain even if he does not deserve it all the time he will notice this and he might even say to himself wow i blew up on her and she did not deserve it she showing me now and has always shown me respect and grace i want to be the best man possible for her men have an ego and if you force him to change he will probably just become more entrenched in his positions strong dominant men only change when they see respect and loyalty from their partners men do not build defend and spend quality time in a home with a shrew in it another piece to this puzzle is to seriously dig down and ask yourself do you want him to change old school women and some of the vets on this sub know very deeply and intimately that men are not women and they are fine with that and actually prefer their men to be men most women that break men or train men quickly find a huge loss of love affection and attraction in that same man men are not raised or nurtured to validate others emotions and that a good thing men are raised to be solution oriented and direct so living with a man means occasional outbursts it means not respecting or validating your emotions all the time it means him doing stupid things sometimes on the other hand it means someone who can help you see through your emotions someone who will protect you in old age someone who will give your kids support and values and most importantly someone who will wrap you in a blanket of masculine safety resources and support let him know that it a problem yes you should let him know it a problem but be prepared for him to be confused i would frame it something like this john remember last week when you got upset at the uber and snapped at me as part of the venting process i am still upset about it i logically know that you did not mean to hurt me i also want you to know that me illogically holding onto it is something i am working on and it not your fault it just that logic does not always match up with my emotions i know that things frustrate you but i am so connected to you that i soak up your emotions up and down i am not asking you to change i love you for you but it would mean the world to me if you at least became more aware that you have this affect on me i love you lead and i will follow make sure you look deeply in his eyes when you say that last line do not expect him to validate you after this discussion when women present problems to men they go into fix it mode so let him process and help you fix it is there anything further i should do to let him know absolutely not after you have made the above speech then you need to drop it and if a similar situation arises you need to act the opposite of how you are feeling be the perfect girlfriend after the incident he will be grateful that you let him save face and he will make an internal note at your grace and respect towards him respect builds respect and closeness nagging builds resentment and distance the great thing about all this is if you work on it now and you end up getting married nothing should change from dating life to married life that a huge positive sign you are on a sustainable path one that few walk in our modern world keep reading the sub and if you need a rpw speed course and you like classic movies you might enjoy the quiet man and mcclintock ,0,RedPillWomen

JackGetsIt,i do not even know where to begin let start with this my male friend says that since he does not have as much experience i have to train him you should not be looking for advice from male friends about your relationship relationship problems should stay private for the most part there a post on rpw about this topic that i would recommend searching up seeking advice from other males about relationships is always a dangerous prospect it easy to get attached to the guy giving you advice because he a avior figure and even if you do not get attached to him often times guys and gals will tell you whatever you want to hear and the ones that give you the correct advice you will probably dismiss if it does not fit your emotional narrative i have more relationship experience than my boyfriend this really does not matter he your captain and you are on his ship or you are not i have no idea if your bf is captain material but understand this nothing you do will magically make him a captain you can only focus your energies on being a quality first mate which it sounds like you are not doing at all sometimes you do not know if you truly have a good captain until you have sailed rough seas and exercised some faith and submission i am very sensitive i have a history of abuse and neglect and overreact to displays of temper by taking it personal blaming myself fearing abandonment and crying there is no man in the world alpha enough strong enough dominate enough or captain enough to fix this in you you are the only one that can fix it or at the very least temper it if you care about this relationship or any future relationships you will work on this first and foremost in reality he was not upset with me he was internally frustrated at the uber and did not communicate the frustration i later learned that this outburst was due to him being frustrated about not having his schedule under control and getting to bed early enough so not because of me i am noticing a pattern in your post you know that he not logically angry directly at you or trying to hurt you but you are still unable to control your emotional reaction and you are still unfairly generating resentment towards him for inadvertently creating it listen life is tough even the highest quality men will have shitty days and when you are once a week girlfriend you do not have to see how the sausage is made as much when you are a live in wife or girlfriend your gonna see your knight in shinning armor get frustrated show weakness get stressed he might even have a break down or two that because men are human we have emotions and we are not perfect you are starting to see his imperfections that all men have if this high level need for comfort and emotional protection is not fixed where do you think this will lead you yup towards more completely undeserving resentment towards him and since you are not communicating to him that it a problem he has no hope of addressing it wow sorry about the text wall i have more analysis but i will go ahead a let you digest those pieces a little feel free to let me know if you have any clarifying questions ,12,RedPillWomen

JackGetsIt,if it any consolation there are many high iq women on the dating market the fact that you are are attracted to a women with a high iq and this turn you on is a good thing because most men are attracted to tits ass and a pretty face iq personality family these are all just a bonus my guess is you developed this fetish for high iq women because you do not have access to more attractive women and you probably have a high iq mother your oneitis has nothing to do wither her iq that just what you latched onto if she was dumb as a rock but had a great rack you would be saying something like i will never have another rack as good as that one again this attitude that you will never find a women with good traits is pure low confidence and low self esteem on your part you need to go monk mode and get some success in your life apart from women men that do not have a lot of success in life and then get in relationship cling to those relationships and eventually destroy them with their clinginess therefore if you do not fix the root problem you might meet an actually ivy league graduate next week with better tits and ass and then piss this relationship away as well get too improving yourself after you have developed some confidence and success and you return to women remember that you do not own them and no matter what you do they can walk at anytime you are always just renting a women it only your turn good luck ,2,asktrp

JackGetsIt, tried reading getting things done finished it but did not really understand it little too complicated totally understandable i had to re read and start and stop with his program several times but it really is helpful the reason i reccomend him is often times people quit or go on two week breaks from their goals because their ystems get too complicated and it just easier to quit it all modern life is a complicated mess that the human mind was not really programmed to keep all together which is what allen is trying to get at it also easier to use his system when you find a way to implement it some people like bullet journals https www youtube com watch v fm15cmyu0im others like evernote http www thesecretweapon org others have their own unique systems using paper or whiteboards etc etc instead of rereading his book try this https www youtube com watch v qo7vudktlhk i have been lifting now for about 5 6 years on and off muscle mass is there and i am still look slightly better than the average joe shirtless i look like i lift with a t shirt on maybe another problem is you are living and dying on female judgement i have been there the simple fact is that you could put 20 pounds on and lose 20 off your bench and go to the bar and have a great night with the ladies because it was just that kind of night women are fickle as fuck there so many other things going on in their head that you are unaware of she might be on a weird part in her cycle she might be bad at a friend she might be hating how she looking all can have an effect on if she into you or not women are solipsistic first and foremost an ugly as 5 might reject you even though you are looking great that day then the next day a 8 give you attention and you are wearing sweat pants you cannot allow every success or failure to be a motivator detractor in your lifting and personal looks development sounds like your using monk mode as an excuse to not get out there and just get rejected men that look much better then you get rejected all the time get very very comfortable with rejection in order to do better with women one thing that helped me get better at approaching women is to just know that know matter how you look there a girl out there that into what you are selling girls have lot of preferences and somewhere out there is a girl that really into what you are finally do not leave out the other aspects of game do not over focus on lifting there also money status conversation etc do not neglect those areas ,2,asktrp

JackGetsIt,i do not think i will articulate this as well as the female veterans in this sub but the female redpill is the exact same as the male redpill it the responses and strategies to that harsh pill that are different amongst males and females the pill is this nature and therefore society does not care about men men are seeds one seed can fertilize a whole tribe therefore men must provide value to fill out their public worth more value more respect and status females have value the minute they are born and society will create a protective bubble around women whether they like it or not the catch is that value has a shelf life 8 10 years not 20 eggs are more valuable because they are more rare women need to maximize their shelf life and choose not only the right seed but the right provider and she must do it at peak value all while vetting and avoiding men that feign value relationships and confidence abusing peak value and being promiscuous lowers long term chances at emotional and material stability women abuse peak fertility in two ways they stay too long with a provider that is not a good seed option or they stay too long with a eed alpha that is not a good long term provider instead they need to compromise and be a good first mate in the relationship longterm relationships work when men provide consistent resources and protection and women show thankfulness and humbleness they found a good blend if you want me to summarize the differences between male and female responses to this pill i can but it would probably be a long response maybe i will make it into a redpill post and link it to you later ,1,RedPillWomen

JackGetsIt,it like this for men age and looks is 90 of the equation and the other 10 is personality confidence submisive dominant traits for men that 10 varies quite a bit because everyone has their preferences a man will date and even marry a girl that does not fit his preferences if she fills out in the looks and age department on the other hand women have 4 big areas looks confidence status resources and if you are low in one area as a man you can overcompensate in others and women will be into you women will also forgo their preferences but based on their own perceived value a women with higher perceived value gets more selective about her mates ,3,PurplePillDebate
JackGetsIt,again i am in agreement here and just playing devils advocate socratic is the goal to have more subscribers or to stay faithful to a core message and avoid mission creep i would think that a name change might also bring in women that have no desire to embrace the sexual market place dynamics or the submission and first mate mentality taught here ,1,RedPillWomen
JackGetsIt, but i have trouble accepting that he should lead because he is better more principled moral mature wise capable if this true then you have not swallowed the female redpill or you have reservations about the man you are with think about it this way you are not really going to reap all the rewards of a submissive female by only acting the part if it helps he certainly not always going to be better or more moral on every issue but a ship functions much more productively with a captain and a responsive crew even if the captain makes a few bad calls you are still going to arrive at your destination a lot quicker if the rowers are not acting like they need to row i promise you that if you do not deeply internalize the submissive role you will balk and question when the seas turn choppy that when your captain will need you most if you want to ask similar questions to redpill men feel free to post on my nearly virginal subreddit r womenasktrp it might take a few months before you get a response though ,2,RedPillWomen

JackGetsIt,possibly but it may also cause more confusion the heart of the term are dpill is that most of society refuses to believe the true dynamics behind male and female mating strategies and biological imperatives this applies to both sexes the redpill is the choice to accept harsh truths and this applies to females as well ,3,RedPillWomen

JackGetsIt,that frisky article is terrible basically a feminist attempt to control the message because the real message is unfathomable to feminist all women are straight or gay women are water they fit whatever container they are forced into female sexuality is completely manipulable my take on why women like gay porn is because it fits their solipsism better men are exploratory in their porn habits and women are selfish in all habits and especialy porn watching two women please eachother means that they might turn to please the viewer watching two masculine men please each other means they do not have a female and they might turn and ravage the viewer or fight over her women deep down think that their pussy is the holy grail and that gay men would fuck them if given the chance therefore women seek out porn that places their pussy as the holy grail this also flows into what type of sex and partners women want they want men that do not put their pussy as the holy grail because this means that the man is inferior women want seed from men that are superior to them in all ways and resources from as many men and women as possible ,0,PurplePillDebate

JackGetsIt, so i want to go all the way in remember that nature is immoral but society itself is an attempted morality we exist in both nature immorality is always in the background but the morality of society that humans have created is also a very real threat and reward system to contend with nature does not care if you murder someone and steal the apples they are picking now you have more apples but society very much cares and because we live in a connected society you are not going to get away with murder very easily even without societies rules humans have evolved a sense of sharing of chores labor hardships and community redpill can circle jerk all they want about independence but we are tribal creatures and unless you are a sociopathic mutant you realize that we must coexist and you might be a human that was born the opposite of sociopathic perhaps you were born with a very strong desire to bond to the tribe i find that people like this often go into religion socialwork education women do not want sociopaths but they are attracted to men who will take bold actions to give them resources and defend them at all costs which is why they lust after but do not always marry sociopathic dark triad personalities if you want to do better with women you can signal hard worker and fighter without being a full blown sociopath another idea to contend with is that men being logical we actually need to be prepared for societal collapse and returned to natures hardships at anytime women do not think these thoughts women exclusively think about their positions within societies current relationship hierarchy this is why men dominate the fields of philosophy science math history theology and the military men are more aware of nature presence and impending wrath and societies ability to be manipulated and directed by strong men that knowledge is a burden you must carry as a man but you are also gifted broader shoulders ,7,asktrp

JackGetsIt,start with some meditation routines you sound like you have a very active and creative mind this is often a bad thing for basic routines because you can over analyze and then paralyze yourself with analysis most of life is boring routines punctuated by occasional complicated planning and execution sounds like you are struggling setting up and following through on the boring routine side i also have this problem here an example i should go to the gym and do 5 different workouts for 60 minutes and get deadlift in once a week five minutes of thinking about all the details of your workout week month year fuck it that sounds exhausting i need a burger and some video game time instead you should write up a very very simple routine on a piece of paper set up when you are going to go to your first session and make your schedule fit around that then ignore thinking about the session and just think about lacing up your shoes then getting in your car then walking through the door of the gym after you have put a few of these steps together you will be done with your workout before you know it do not put a lot of impediments to getting into that car either you do not need to load the ipod you do not need to pack a bunch of shit into bag etc the second piece of advice i would give you is to start your day with very small tasks make your bed walk for 5 minutes meditate for five minutes microwave a health meal and eat it stringing together small healthy routines in the morning sets up a more productive day do not try to start your day every day with a 10 mile run and a 100 pages of reading you wo not keep it up third piece of advice you need get in school or get into a job men need large missions it sounds like you took your year off without missions planned in even if the mission is go to europe and party and socialize that still a mission and it will sharpen your focus and motivate you an archer must have a target or he will always miss you are an archer you are built to shoot so find things to aim at lastly remember that everything is a bit of a spiral and you never really feel like doing anything motivation itself is really a bit of a myth zig zigler once said action precedes the thought which means we often feel like doing something after we are already doing it so if you skip your gym or walk the next day you will want to skip it more if you get out force a walk or force gym the next day you will want to do it a little more you can spiral down into more and more procrastination or you can spiral up into more and more work ethic this means that after you get out of this funk this year do not play year long breaks always have the next thing ready to go and keep leveling up good luck good sir authors you might like tim ferris malcolm gladwell books i would recommend getting things done 10 happier the practicing mind ,2,asktrp

JackGetsIt,i can kind of see the logic behind the early divorce laws my understanding is that these laws were originally put in place to prevent men from leaving women and children poor and destitute and wards of the state it in the states interest to not have children raised in poverty it expensive as hell on tax payers most marriages in the past happened before men had careers and wealth and most women would not work and would help the guy get through his early career by staying home and taking care of the home and family thus she is ripe for getting screwed if he walks she has no career to support herself or children if he walks but this is not the case at all in 2016 marriages that look like the one above are maybe 5 of all marriages most couples are now dual income and many many women are having kids out of wedlock women and governments are not even trying to hide the fact anymore that they have created a system of male servitude ,26,MensRights
JackGetsIt,the ketosis diet is a pain in the ass because everywhere you go you will have to fucking explain yourself to everyone what you do not eat bread one treat will throw you off is not red meat bad for you after you start to explain the diet to people they want to pin you as a conspiracy theorist because the keto wisdom goes directly against the bullshit big agribusiness government partnership pyramid with grains as the foundation then when you get home the keto diet is difficult because most women do not know shit about nutrition and even the ones that do squirrel away chocolate and candy all over their living spaces all that being said ketosis is the only way i have personally ever been able to lose weight and keep it off it also the only diet that kept my ravenous food cravings at bay every girlfriend i have ever had and my ex wife all eventually started keto dieting because they saw how effective it was my only word of warning is just an echo of what others have said in this thread lead by example do not ask your significant other to do it with you she will eventually come along for the ride on her own when she see you executing with consistency and not giving in to her or friends and family high carb eating habits the only girlfriend that i successfully keto dieted with was after i was deep in the diet and could have like 50 high fiber carbs a day she would still cook her traditional meals but substitute some higher fiber carb options and cook and serve a lot less of them to this day i still only on and off keto diet because of my biggest nemesis beer fancy fancy beer beer and keto do not go well together and i cannot bring myself to completely cut it right now i am doing 6 keto days and one carb up day with beer in the mix it working out ok i am about 10 15 pounds above goal weight but it much better then giving up and being 60 pounds overweight all the time ,2,askMRP

JackGetsIt,the redpill only dissuades men from marriage because of the current condition of female entitlement combined with terrible divorce laws even then i would not say rp is 100 against ltr or private marriages there just a tone that they are a trap in the current climate i think you have created a bit of a straw man it not one body of writing with one clear message it a collection of tools that men are welcome to take or leave there are also a portion of trp users that advocate for more active mra approach that less nihilist men did not create the situation we are seeing today a combination of factors created it men are just forced to live in it and survive it my personal take on the future is that things are going to need to get much worse before people actually do anything about the core broken relationship between the genders i think you need to post your thesis to purplepill debate and you also need to come up with solutions as well to the redpill narrative if your going to get a healthy debate going ,3,TheRedPill

JackGetsIt,financial well being is a marathon it has two sides raise your income and reduce your expenses it sounds like you really need to work on both for starters do not take on debts unless they are well thought out educational debts from vocational schools or colleges that you have researched as a good deal there are lots of online articles about universities and colleges that are a bargain i would highly recommending dropping everything you are doing and reading dave ramsey books most of his books are under written and should be an easy read next you need to self analyze what are are your true strengths do you need a physical job with constant change and distractions do you have the patience and competency to own a business are you bookish can you hang in the academic scene it all about you you really need to figure out your strengths and weaknesses and then set in a long term plan with lots of little goals in between the start and finish here a good recommendation pick three possible career fields and then go interview two people in each of those fields when you have narrowed it down re interview your favorite person and ask them to help you design a general path towards getting to you goal then you might need to switch paths as you grow in your career be ready for that another good start is to google some threads about what people would do differently if they could start their life over the title is normally something like hey 30 and 40 year old redpill men what would you have done differently with your life if you were 18 i have contributed to those threads as well but my comment history is a mess to search through to find them for you sorry good luck and please let me know if you have anymore detailed questions about career and finance i can try to point you in the right direction my final note is that most people you see that are happy in their 30 and 40 were absolute slaves towards a profession in their teens and 20 and they budgeted religiously and ignore female and entertainment distractions you might or might not be that type of person but it is what it is our economy highly rewards specialized work that takes decades to get good and profitable at most careers that use to pay well in 2 4 years now take 10 15 years to get to comfortable income levels a pilot is one example of this that comes to mine that does not mean you should pursue a profitable career it means you need to look closely at what going to be in demand in 3 8 years and start right now ,3,asktrp

JackGetsIt, midway upon the journey of our life i found myself within a forest dark for the straightforward pathway had been lost ah me how hard a thing it is to say what was this forest savage rough and stern which in the very thought renews the fear so bitter is it death is little more but of the good to treat which there i found speak will i of the other things i saw there i read your post yesterday but held off on commenting because i wanted to process i could be wrong of course but here my take on your empty feeling when you grow up as a male if you live in a middle class stable family you are given a secret middle class set of rules to live your life but with those rules you are also given a cript or narrative it taught to you by movies parents teachers friends and a multitude of other media inputs the script goes something like elementary school middle school high school and college trade school will be tough but if you work hard you will be rewarded with a happy wife family and career and when you receive those things life will still be tough but you will have a magical place to go home and recharge your batteries everyday furthermore your wife will be your soul mate and will not only be loyal but will be your best friend this golden aura of completeness and adultness will wash over you and you will be a self actualized adult finally people that are lazy and do not follow the script will be punished and will not be rewarded if you work hard all of this will happen in a neat timeline college done by 22 married by 25 kids and house by 30 work hobbies kids in your thirties work hobbies family events in your forties work hobbies bigger house more toys successful young adult children in your fifties happy well financed retirement dreamy morphine death with loving family around you fade to black not everyone buys into this script completely but i have never met someone that did not have it hanging over their head in some way or another this narrative is a nasty nasty lie good people that do everything according to plan get fucked over all the time in our society and bad people that do not follow the script get rewarded all the time there also just randomness good or bad hardworking or lazy people get sick they get cheated on their kids hate them or die in an accident they get outsourced or their field of study changes and they are irrelevant in the their narrow job field the list goes on and on the multitude of ways the world can fuck you over is astounding on top of all the random ways the world fucks you the most obvious and common way it fucks you is the lie you are told about women women are not special pure snowflakes that fall on your nose one day and madly fall in love with you and support you flawlessly through 60 years until you are buried together women are following their own sexual mating strategy which oftentimes is completely at odds and hostile with your own women are even more attached to their own elaborate scripts as well my take on your emptiness is that your eyes are just opening up to the lie and the whole thing does not really feel worth it to you the whole thing seems a bit fixed you see the narrative motivates us the narrative drives us and when the narrative turns out to be bullshit we lose our core animus our engine to function some people become depressed the deep depression where you can t feel at all some become complacent some abuse drugs games women lash out some double down on the narrative and run faster on their current hamster wheel some try to break free from the narrative with more hard work and a survivor mentality most don t do anything and simply live with incredible tension and quiet desperation the poet and professor john berryman wrote a poem titled the ball poem https www poetryfoundation org poems and poets poems detail 57083 which i think reflects this emptiness it was published posthumously he ended his life by jumping off a bridge so what s the reality the game is tilted folks the game is rigged https www youtube com watch v hyic0ezyeti says george carlin the best proof of this is who attractive women gravitate too women gravitate to men who have power and resources and they don t really care what shtick the guy put on to get those things we as men know it as our identity but women see it as a shtick because they themselves are chameleons and project that schema on men they don t care if he s a tech nerd or a grizzled duck dynasty owner women are professional talent scouts for men that game the rules and get what they want out of life every subculture of society in america has a little cluster of females who lust after that guy that mastered that environment and has become the mini king of that society and those same females will move on from that guy if they find a new subculture they like better and has more comfort and resources for their offspring people are slaves to their tribal and evolutionary imperatives but stuck in this massively complicated world with numbers and systems we can never universally comprehend when transportation technology expanded humans were quickly forced to deal with such a wide variety of languages and rules and ideas that we are all at a loss to focus and process all of it we are still dealing with this focus and processing problem in 2016 and the mass confusion is being seized upon by those in power so to circle back to your original emptiness you are probably thinking deep down something like what happen what am i not the king of my castle where my rewards where s the pot of gold i ve done everything right this can t be what life really means why is it so fucking hard why do others seem to have life on easy mode well the dirty little secret is that life is only imbued with the meaning you give it and nature and the entire human population could care less what you decide to make your passion about this is also why you probably received zero upvotes for this question people are living for themselves and when they meet you their impression of you becomes who you are to them so i have no direct advice for you because there are other sources for that but that is my take on your lack of animus passion and your resulting emptiness you ve failed to shift and find a new schema and purpose that drives you as hard as the ones implanted in you by society and you most likely still pine and bemoan the loss of the old script you are wasting precious time listen it is the burden of men to be labored with this logic and knowledge it is the burden of men to self drive and survive and shelter the weak if he so chooses ask not for a lighter load but for broader shoulders most men are still living plugged in welcome to the life outside of the cave ,1,asktrp
JackGetsIt,i think you are having some trouble stepping away from viewing the world without a female lens and that ok it a common female disability women have an enormous difficulty with cognitive empathy let look at empathy there are three kinds from psychology today cognitive empathy being able to know how the other person sees things emotional empathy feeling what the other person feels and emphatic concern or sympathy being ready to help someone in need women do not sympathize and understand others points of view until they can emotionally empathize which is quite inefficient this results in men being better at managing distressing emotions and women carefully guarding themselves from distressing emotions through self deception aka a personal narrative women will do whatever it takes to maintain a personal narrative that makes them righteous and even though you are personally blinded by chemical bonding at this point in your happy little relationship you are capable at any time of a light switch on your significant other where all you do is focus on all the terrible shit he done through the years up to this moment this allows you to shift directions and cheat but in your head it not really cheating at that point it survival against a would ifferent evil person how many times have you heard these statements from yourself or other female friends he changed something was just off i cannot believe he hid that side of himself so well i feel tricked if this has not happen to you yet in a relationship it probably will at some point because a better man is always around the corner waiting to trigger this deep need and desire inside of you it an evolutionary adaption that you and most high functioning women have i would recommend reading rollo tomassi war brides post for more on this fascinating phenomena women have consistently been forced through evolutionary history to embrace and rationalize whatever alpha male had captured bought encroached them so from a male perspective i can certainly tell you that men cheat all the time without rationalizing it or seeking validation to do it men who stay successfully loyal do so by never putting themselves in the position to make that mistake in the first place they make a logical choice to be loyal and from the logic stems true loyalty i find that the third form of empathy ympathetic empathy is equal in men and women but society actively teaches men to hide sympathetic tendencies and actively encourages women to exhibit them both sexes are capable of being incredibility sympathetic or devoid of sympathy i want you to know that excepting my premise that you can flip a switch and cheat on the partner you so intimately love and connect too does not make you a bad partner and it does not make you more likely to cheat on him in fact women can be loyal but it takes enormous practice guidance well chosen female friends and male stewardship feel free to hit up the redpillwomen sub reddit if you feel you need that nice gals over there ,1,PurplePillDebate

JackGetsIt,i am glad someone on this thread spoke to the cultural and intellectual intelligence in the middle east but your also painting too rosey of a picture the crude meme only deals with the invention of the car through the modern era which is as you state a short period of time but the middle east was not some universal bastion of education and intellectual freedom either before the modern era yes imperialism sought to pilfer a lot of natural resources by playing factions against each other and elevating certain sympathetic families but india was also under imperialism and has slowly started to turn itself around to capitalism and tech advancement the development of algebra and the sciences was normally funded and or protected by strong military or religious leaders and much like europe was not distributed to the masses in public education the difference though between the two which i think the meme correctly points out is that religion in the west actually took a side seat and women minorities and those in poverty actually started to gain access to education and despite the us and europe rep for often being nationalist they have been far more inclusive with outsiders living and working and contributing to society the american dream might be suffering in 2016 but there no islamic dream where a kurd can move to a different part of iraq and pull himself up by the bootstraps with a new business idea or invention there little if any of that in the middle east which is why they lag behind asia and the west in tech advancement smart people in all stem fields will continue to flee the middle east until religious sect rivalries and the brutish bloody conquer thine enemy side of religion is eliminated or changes ,1,ImGoingToHellForThis

JackGetsIt,there a lot of debate in this thread and good discussion i think the redpill answer is simple women need to respect envy admire and in general look up to their men it helps in the chemical bonding process it makes for better orgasm in women which also helps the bonding process it creates a sense of security women desperately need and above all if a man is too close to a women in her real or perceived smv she will be tempted to cheat or end the relationship for greener pastures which will conveniently appear to be all around as a result of the mismatch men do not need to marry would own per say but they need to marry a women who they have resoundingly vetted as loyal and this is normally someone a bit lower in smv then he is capable of superficially or short term attracting a man smv may shift due to job loss or illness and a women needs a strong initial bond and a feeling that he is above her for her to ride out these emotional waves of course if he too high in value she will live a life full of anxiety and fear so of course there needs to be careful considerations made by both partners during courtship interestingly several of my own ltr have ended because i have done too good of a job of raising my partners smv helping her lose weight dress better deal with stress in life counseling etc i am not going to stop doing this but i have always wondered if this is the motivation behind why some guys mistreat their wives ltr they secretly do not want them to realize that they have value and can do better young men are often taught to treat em like dirt and they stick like mud and unfortunately it works on many many women ,1,RedPillWomen

JackGetsIt,women in general like men fighting over them physical or not because it sweet sweet validation of their value little do they know men fight over stupid trivial shit all the time in your case this is a test of the new emotional narrative in her head as well as a chance for validation pure female solipsism it all about her if he won the fight it would endear her even more to her new boyfriend and help her double down on the narrative they she left a weak male that was not worthy of her pussy she would also know her new boyfriend is very much attached to her because he would risk injury and jail for her if you win the fight you are a brute and it was a good thing she left you for a more sophisticated modern man you should be locked up for assaulting her new boyfriend as well again all in her mind it a lose lose stay as far away as possible from the whole situation ,1,asktrp

JackGetsIt, if by spinning plates you mean sex with other girls i am not willing to cheat on her that fine but you need to get out there and build more social connections with women especially so she see you as the prize when we chatted about things she would only talk about what i can do it sounds like you are a lot more emotionally invested then she is this is almost always bad in male and female relationships my guess is she on some stage of a break of with you already check my post history for the stages of break up post ,1,asktrp

JackGetsIt,i think a lot of women are completely unaware of the differences between 2nd and third wave feminism ,1,MensRights
JackGetsIt, and my theory is that the biggest cause of divorce is someone somewhere along the way stops doing what they used to do you are conflating two very different things thing 1 a wife that has stopped doing everything because she is checked out of a marriage and wants to make her husband pay yes this scenario sometimes leads to divorce but statistically women are filing for more divorce so this probably is not the most common reason thing 2 a newly engaged young women that wants a perfect start to a marriage and cannot quite understand why she not superwomen listen he know that if you take on more tasks and responsibilities other areas like housework might suffer need to be restructured do not do the mind racing thing that he will divorce you because you left a sock on the middle of the floor of the bedroom one day you might enjoy this book it helped in times in my life when i have needed to take on a busier schedule https www amazon com practicing mind developing discipline challenge dp 1608680908 if anything do not try to change too much too fast as you transition from dating life to married life it more important then ever during this transition to keep up some consistency and fun in how you were living with each other before marriage i think married couples try to do everything at once finances childbirth plans home buying furnishing all in such a short period of time that it stresses both partners out relax pace yourselves it a marathon not a sprint ,2,RedPillWomen
JackGetsIt,i think it has to do with the legal system in the states vs russia feminist never had a chance to get their talons on the lawmakers and court system in russia because it was always corrupted by powerful men men that laughed at any type of feminism movement granted this corruption has also created an oligarchy and terribly unhealthy country with a shitty economy but that a different issue ,2,asktrp

JackGetsIt,so a couple things a she already formulating and implementing an exit plan women are good at seeing relationships die down and starting to look elsewhere just mentally deal with that part first women have no agency they do not think hey this relationship is going down hill maybe it my fault and i need to take concrete actions to fix it women find ways to see faults in you and they will just fixate on those faults until that have the emotional narrative script to start fucking other guys so everything is on you right now b you are not married start spinning plates and getting out socially more the jujitsu is a fantastic start just that will probably make her wake up the problem is she can go two ways get more proactive lose weight increase interest in you or get depressed gain more weight shut down emotionally or get over emotional all the time there no fix for this really so hopefully the dread game will make her proactive ,4,asktrp
JackGetsIt,if you read any of the posts about spinning plates it normally recommended to let plates subtly know that there might be probably are other plates so plating is something you do when you are not married you are married you should not have tried to spin plates in a western country while married if your wife chooses to divorce you she will probably fuck you over hold frame and follow to a t u itsthehomewrecker advice but also be prepared for a hardcore divorce rape never get married if in some bizzaro world i got married and i needed some strange i would hire a professional remember you do not pay em to fuck you you pay them to shut up and leave or have an out of state fling on a trip but i would not try to spin a plate your wife is always eventually going to figure it out and then you are at her mercy and the courts mercy that a shit place to be ,5,asktrp

JackGetsIt,i agree with most of your comments i have met women that have personalities disconnected from their boyfriends but they are few and far between and they are often unattractive it seems like the more attractive you are as a female the less pressure you have to provide personality and character in interactions you are less incentivized to improve yourself when everything is handed to you that why beautiful women with very strong father figures are the best women you can find if you are lucky some of his leadership and early character building has rubbed off on her before she hopped on the carousel with the rise of the single parent household father figures are rare as well ,6,TheRedPill

JackGetsIt,online dating is great for women but i think it also plays tricks with their psyche it inflates their perceived value because they get inundated with attention from guys that often times have zero interest in ltr men have been very well trained to dangle ltr and court women only to plate them remember that women hold the key to sex and men hold the keys to relationships that being said you should still use online dating but do not fall into the trap of using it as a validation machine and never actually meeting any of the the guys that message you if you do try the bar scene and you are afraid to go alone keep your female social group size way down 1 or 2 girls and let the girls know that you are there to meet men and they do not have to give every guy that approaches the stonewall personally i think the best way for women to meet men is to be very clear at the start of online or in person courtship say i really actually like you but i am a bit more traditional and i want to go out a few times and get to know each other what are you motivations right now where are you at in your life you would be really surprised what most men will tell you after you state that to them most men are desperate to be honest to a women who decides to be at least a little direct men love direct communication ,7,RedPillWomen
JackGetsIt,you are not going to find much because women do not feel the need to have to run game they run game by simply going to places that have eligible men and making themselves available that the only game they know beyond that making themselves look better through make up and clothes is their game you have to understand that if a women actively has to got talk to a guy with the intent to pick him up then in her mind he not dominent not aggressive and too shy to be an attractive man to her so women are very much in a catch 22 through public feminism and in general social interaction women have shamed men that approach and attempt to pick up women in reality they are desperately waiting on an approach from a high smv guy that they actually want this is also why you need to plant seeds with women and show smv value before approaching most women i actually think this is why female happiness scale scores are so low in society women ar not finding men that want ltr and men are not finding women with ltr traits it getting ugly out there ,6,asktrp

JackGetsIt,no it not safe spaces in their current iteration on college campuses are places where people can hide from logic and criticism logic and criticism will always be welcome here safe spaces were originally places for students or employees to go where they would not be physically abused or legitimately harassed for their sexual orientation in the late 80s early 90 there might have been some need for these spaces what they have morphed into is bizarre journalist conor friedersdorf criticized the use of outdoor safe spaces to block press coverage of student protests according to friedersdorf such uses reverse the intent of safe spaces this behavior is a kind of safe baiting using intimidation or initiating physical aggression to violate someone s rights then acting like your target is making you unsafe ,3,TheRedPill
JackGetsIt,thanks for the post that video also sums up my views pretty accurately i would enjoy hearing what your economic thoughts are i would hope that redpillers and mra alike would realize that you are not going to get men rights or legal reform of any type if we have a complete fiscal collapse it ok to think one candidate is better on men issues and not vote for him based on other issues you find more pertinent actually i take that back in a post apocalyptic scenario men rights would most certainly be re established men would be a lot more valued as they would be immediately needed to run the farm guard the perimeter and basically get everything done they do this now but their contributions would be a lot more visual and impossible to degenerate and subjugate we are needed now more then ever but we have been convinced by the societal narrative that we are marginal at best which is laughable imagine if all men went on strike in society for even one day it would be a lot easier for us as men to just form a narrow issues voting block and get the false rape and divorce rape laws changed and fight legislation that allows our hard work to flow to women illegal immigrants and the poor unless of course it agreed upon and administered correctly which it rarely is i for one am not excited about shaving myself with a ka bar that i just pulled out of the warm guts of an enemy in some wasteland type scenario it probably not as glamorous as it seems maybe i will just keep the beard ,6,TheRedPill

JackGetsIt,i am going a touch off topic from the post here but bare with me this is also why the dems lost the election they have refused to listen to legitimate suffering from rust belt white conservatives just slap a label on them and be done there not one legitimate component of the dnc platform or talking points that addresses the white males of the south and midwest no divorce rape reform no trade protections no serious infrastructure investment no immigration reform no small business development nothing will trump deliver the goods that white males thinks he will i seriously doubt it he always seemed like a man out for himself and only himself and this was just another power grab he would have run as a democrat and switch his views on everything if he saw a power vacuum in that party lot of families in this country look at two things above all else how they think their children are doing compared to themselves and how safe they think their family is and the reaction when the perception of both is getting worse is fear fear is what drove this election ,10,MensRights

JackGetsIt,men are more aware of a females smv then she is and women are more aware of a male smv then he is men get a bit oblivious or deflated inflated to their own value and the same for women so the key to happiness from both sides is to find a partner that does not realize their value and to hide that you are really into them at the courtship phase the graphic shows women funneling to the top 30 percent of men and more funneling towards the top 10 percent so i do not think that graphic opposes the notion you posit at all i think what you could add to that graphic is how women will treat the top 30 percent guys according to their self perceived attraction which can change depending on the day and the environment the 9 and 10 will shit test hard because they want genuine top tier men not fakers which any women past the age of 20 or so is very familiar with the 6 8 will alternate shit test comfort test the 3 5 will comfort test the 1 3 will just flat out reject or just be completely satisfied with a ons if ever approached by top 30 guys this is why pua like to neg girls it temporarily makes a girl second guess her value and if you do it right she lowers her own value this sounds ridiculous but women are very social creatures and are constantly micro adjusting to social cues thus allowing the guy to be perceived as higher on the smv scale relatively to her at that moment in the medium and long term this leads to flaking and buyers remorse however so negging is not a good strategy beyond hunting for ons ,7,PurplePillDebate

JackGetsIt,i have kind of had this same problem and some of my smaller wrestling and military friends have this as well there are a lot of military men that could fuck shit up but they do not look the part one tip is to remember that you do not necessarily have to project your bad ass fighting prowess to women but men do pick up on it if other men pick up on it women will too men will place you in a more elevated status in the group because they know you can hold your own women might not know why you are being placed in that status but they will certainly see and be forced to respond to it men are actually trained from a young age to pick up on signals from other men that they might be able to fight and win women do not detect these subtleties because they do not really need too remember that all that bullshit you are told about men not having emotional intelligence is completely false this myth got circulated because women are emotional empathizers and men are cognitive empathizers in a nut shell women recognize another emotional state and then their minds work on mirroring it men recognize an emotional state and then their minds work on systematizing and correcting the emotional state so women cannot really recognize your prowess unless you show it to them hopefully in a safe way like athletic events or others confirm that you are indeed rough and tough let me give you an little example one of my favorite things to do to women i am courting is to chop wood in front of them no joke i would have a house party or invite them over for drinks and say looks like were out of wood let me chop a few pieces for the fire pit i would then go chop wood which is very visual and requires skill and some degree of coordination directly in front of them and they were instantly high quality plates after that how your posture you could be lifting a lot practicing martial arts and still mentally shifting into a beta nice guy shoulders forward and slumped posture when you are meeting people there a lot of great body posture books and video about posture cues that might help you project your strength i would also recommend the right fitting clothing you do not have to wear tap out shirts but well chosen well fitted clothes combined with posture will communicate to the right women that you are capable of defending yourself and her last make sure your not projecting this fear of not projecting onto others you need to always carry an amused master dgaf attitude and being worried that women do not realize how bad ass you are will show up in how you interact with women here a video with a cue that always helped me https www youtube com watch v tqqgf8kb6r8 i was also watching a joe rogan podcast recently that was talking about the benefits of morning pull up hangs to help with shoulder health and posture might be worth looking into ,3,TheRedPill

JackGetsIt,it really important to note that men and women rate the opposite sex in such drastically different ways because of differently evolved mating strategies as you rightfully point out on the female side you could have a traditionally ugly looking guy be a 10 or 11 on the female scale it would be impossible on the male side conversely you cannot have a traditionally poor and or low status male on the high side of female scale it also incredibly hard for a women to take the risk and meet men from online because women have a natural fear instinct and need to have conformation that he is not a danger i think this is why only the best looking guys do well on tinder if a girl is going to take a risk and meet a stranger it going to be for a big pot of gold we see this play out when people lie to themselves when women delude themselves about their partners they imagine he is stronger wealthier or more popular then he really is when men delude themselves they imagine their partner is more attractive and youthful then she really is i think it really difficult if not impossible to build rating systems that women would use faithfully because women practice plausible deniability and when they do want something they are not direct or assertive about it they do not want to be seen as aggressive the internet is a poor medium for women to meet men because pictures and profiles cannot really show dominance status wealth interest game if you can find a way for a guy to communicate those things to a women online and women can buy in and remain anonymous at first you have a gold mine on your hands the western dating scene is a bizarre place right now because the internet video games pintrest technology steroids bling instagram celebrity culture have all amplified or mitigated traditional dating signals to top it all off people are working more and staying indoors more and they are less recreationally social in general ,3,PurplePillDebate

JackGetsIt, guitar or reading tarot cards i think these things work on women because they show devotion to something and they give women a chance to bond to a guy without him knowing that are bonding to him they are a bit of a screen for rapport building to occur both of these kills and many others that women are attractive to are coincidentally things that men will do in front of other women women collectively fall for men women group up and validate and confirm each others crushes so as a man any activity you can do where women will be forced to passively watch and idolize you is a great first step to doing well in the smp ,5,PurplePillDebate
