IIceWeasellzz,i guess if you get banned it is because you do not share the same beliefs of gender equality let me stress we celebrate equality at a certain point in a person life they should realize regardless of your gender if you put your hands on another individual be prepared for them to strike back this has very little to do with gender and almost everything with right and wrong men should not hit women i agree however if a woman is hitting you with ill intentions as demonstrated in the video then i firmly believe you are allowed to hit back i do not care if i hit 2x as hard as you if some scrawny white dude started a fight with a burly black guy and called him names you think the black guy wo not destroy him because he can hit him 2x as hard ofc not that fucking silly i am glad i had the opportunity to educate you friend if after thorough thought you still cannot understand then i am afraid well have to wave goodbye ,1,pussypassdenied

IIceWeasellzz,i feel like this could lead to poor spending habits down the line sure he does not have a bunch of disposable income but i think it more the philosophy of and self control aspect that important to practice in the long run buying 200 headphones and a 20 phone case wo not make too much of a difference another way of thinking about it is 220 is about 70 of his weekly earnings assuming 8 hr and 40 hour weeks this is bad because if he were to triple his income this spending may still be proportionately similar where he still spends 70 of his income on fun things and that almost 700 again i am not against treating yourself once in a while or rewarding hard work by buying some luxury fun items but too much of anything is a bad thing ,2,personalfinance

IIceWeasellzz,what kind of entertainment ,2,dungeondefenders
IIceWeasellzz,everything is either buggy broken or imbalanced my gripe after you hit chaos is that its very repetitive very little variation in the game builds unless youre over geared for the content the grind does take its toll on you another thing is transitioning thru chaos tiers are quite difficult for some people there many bugs with the defense rate shards and other tower shards atm not functioning correctly and you need to take them out and re add them back to the relic in order for them to work every wave or map or something overall the game is a mess right now give them a few weeks and trendy will sort it out i have faith that they listen to the community changes dont always come fast and changes are not always good or in the right direction but it atleast shows trendy is trying trendy is working hard but right now it kinda looks like theyre hardly working ,1,dungeondefenders
IIceWeasellzz,maybe the baby is just amazed at the size of her forehead you could probably see it from the iss or at least park 3 747 on there ,-6,aww
IIceWeasellzz,there is a reason to conclude an arbitrary set will tend towards normally distributed if the n sample size of the set is large enough more often than not from my personal experience especially when you can quantify the thing easily things will tend towards that familiar bell shape i also remember readying some paper whilst in my stats class in the year before about the n becoming larger and the population histogram tending towards gaussian ,2,RoastMe
IIceWeasellzz,i stand corrected however given the human populations very large the plot would more or less be gaussian this is not skewed either way and given our large over 7 billion sample size the mean median ,4,RoastMe
IIceWeasellzz,how can their kids be average and be outshined by the majority of their peers that a contradiction very basic statistics ,43,RoastMe
IIceWeasellzz,trading awards players with the choice to skip or not skip content although i havent played the games you listed i have played games such as tf2 and csgo and etc where trading is a very integral part of the game i also understand that the in game items in the games i listed have no effect on gameplay however they more often than not carry monetary value this in turn has caused some botting namely tf2 where you could afk farm free in game items which can be exchanged or converted into currency refined metal in the case of tf2 now going back to trading in loot based games if i want to skip chaos 1 to 6 and just get some dudes janky chaos 7 items then i really think there should be a way to satisfy those peoples wants in trendy eyes im sure they want as many people playing the game as possible just from a pure business standpoint this increases the chance that someone will purchase something in their game now if we were to make an assumption that these people that would like to skip chaos 1 to 6 and just get straight onto the hardest content possible are impatient then that leads to perhaps they would spend money on shard packs using gems they may not want to grind out the shards they missed by skipping all the chaos tiers and just plop down 20 on blue swirly gems and buy a load of shard packs from 1 6 i dont have enough firsthand experience about trading in loot games to say anything conclusively wrong or advocate it without hesitation but there are definitely pros and cons to anything that gets implemented more often than not the crowd mentality to a past bad experience or perhaps even poor integration of trading will persist thus hindering development and progress ,1,dungeondefenders

IIceWeasellzz,i am not saying he wrong i am saying he could word a lot of his posts much better and still get the same message across although tone can be hard to convey over text it very apparent he a toxic person in general and just likes to blame and complain about everything rarely does he have something constructive to say again i actually do agree with some of his other posts he not just spewing nonsense but he is spewing negativity ,5,dungeondefenders
IIceWeasellzz,everything you post on here is always complaints and pure negativity i do not think this tower is as absurd as you think it is especially at lower levels it nice cc but get disabled by cyborks in c5 and stuff so it not incredibly useful all the time it also does not scale randomly it follows the same or at least similar rules to other towers and traps looks like you have not read the patch notes closely enough is that trendys fault too many other traps that cc also do insane burst an example is the huntress water trap or even the weapon manu for the sake of everyone and yourself stop bashing everything in every post it makes you look like a child ,6,dungeondefenders
IIceWeasellzz,you are just one big negative nancy ,2,dungeondefenders
IIceWeasellzz,i fucking hate unnecessary slow fucking motion ,4,aww
IIceWeasellzz,once again i think you hit the nail on the head shard drops are incredibly random and that is frustrating i have been doing c5 runs for 4 days straight easily over 10 15 runs a day and have not gotten the explosive poison shard however i have also noticed another thing during this last week i have broken into c5 from c4 went through the progression in c5 and am now able to basically afk the maps this has led me to the discovery that shards are important there no doubt but they are also a luxury you simply do not need a lot of the fancy shards to go through the progression phases it tougher the grind is longer all those things may be true but it does not stop you from going forward i think we all have a little defeatist mentality we do not like to lose maps we do not want to equip ourselves with green gear stuff like this is what ultimately limits people to think i have yet to get shard and therefore trendy is bad and the game is bad xd change up your builds what once worked will not always work test stuff out use the dummies in the tavern and if all this seems too much maybe you should join the little hay stuffed sacks in the tavern and be a dummy too this was written on my phone so the formatting may be quite awful not everything i have said was directed at you personally a lot of the concepts were to address issues that you hinted at and my personal take on them ,1,dungeondefenders
IIceWeasellzz,no worries man glad i could help out although to me it seems the game is actually quite versatile in which you can use many things and they would still work it does lack guidance this issue has led to more or less confusion across the board for newer players it sucks not knowing what you are doing wrong so it brings great joy knowing not only did many of you take the time to read what i wrote but trusted to follow through if you or anybody reading this have any more questions please feel free to pm me or add me on steam www steamcommunity com id iiceweasellzz ,1,dungeondefenders

IIceWeasellzz,i hope you guys know the fps issue is not really trendys fault it the fact that you are playing on a ps4 and not a pc i am not gonna argue which is better even thought the answer i obvious on the other hand the lag issue probably can be resolved most consoles have pretty good connectivity hardware so i am going to likely attribute the lag to bad ps4 trendy servers or bad networking of the game ,1,dungeondefenders

IIceWeasellzz,all the other towers operate on the same basis of cone aoe targetting i like the nimbus because it chases mobs down and it has like 3500 range so it can cover huge areas of the map this is good as it minimizes the amount of work i have to do and it also melts assassins after you get em stunned ,1,dungeondefenders
IIceWeasellzz,i disagree i hope they implement more towers i can afk with the nimbus is pretty decent with def rate and a mark it does very good damage even for the du hopefully they rework something else into these tracking traps so i dont really have to chase down stragglers,1,dungeondefenders
IIceWeasellzz,because it would be better for everyone to have the decent worthwhile towers out first so we can all learn a hung or 2 more about them instead of wasting a day on a thing we all know belongs in the dumpster ,-1,dungeondefenders
IIceWeasellzz,usable maybe the slime aoe could be gigantic i suppose that would atleast put it in the same category as the snaking sands what i mean is that when the balloons blow up they either do a ridiculous amount of damage or they blow up in a huge radius causing everything to atleast take some damage that would make it worth considering the 40 du assuming the coverage is good enough you could probably share 2 3 lanes for 1 of these and that wouldnt be too bad honestly ,1,dungeondefenders

IIceWeasellzz,largely it has to do wih electron shell energies small elements produce massive amounts of energy when they are fused together to form a heavier element because those are often more stable an example of this would be hydrogen fusing together to make helium as we know helium is very very stable because the s shell of the helium is filled similarly true for all the noble gasses however when the element gets heavier the difference in stability between say carbon and the nearest noble gas neon is smaller than hydrogen with respect to helium i am not a chemist nor an astrophysicist so iight be crazy wrong ,1,askscience

IIceWeasellzz,as a further response to the no reason theyre loved or hated there are reasons pretty good reasons one could argue this sounds really lazy and a poor argument on my part but i am not going to do the research for you there are many good analyses of both anime pointing out their flaws and strengths from a statistical stand point its very very unlikely for a show to be more or less unanimously loved and for that show to be objectively bad or poorly produced there a reason something like fmab is rated 1 on mal for a long time ,1,anime
IIceWeasellzz,what i was trying to do was make most of what you said sound ridiculous since this sub obviously has its own preferences and tastes and i guess to some extent a circle jerk when it comes to certain shows and when you go against the societal norm you will get a backlash ,2,anime
IIceWeasellzz, what the hell are you talking about what is this sleep you speak of in all seriousness not as much as i would like but most of my free time is largely taken up by school or hanging out with friends once or twice a week maybe i get a few hours a week to watch anime or play video games but that about it ,2,anime
IIceWeasellzz,i cannot really comment in the accuracies of your statements but they make sense to me from a bystander point of view i guess you are right to say the stress caused from classes are more or less self caused as i would like to get good marks and learn the material ,1,anime

IIceWeasellzz,depending on if you want finished anime only i would recommend spice and wolf but there only 2 seasons and you will probably end up reading the lns after fate zero and fate ubw looks like it might be right up your alley more romancey id recommend your lie in april fma b is one everyone needs to see it not rated 1 on mal for no reason shinsekai yori is a good action thriller it pacing is kinda like s g so be patient with it there going to be about 2 episodes where you are going to think wtf and you will know when you get there it really adds nothing to the plot sooooo just kinda ignore it ,1,anime

IIceWeasellzz,ngnl made me have a civil war in my head i wanted to like it really bad but in the end it fell really flat for me the whole show was eyecandy the beautiful colors and pretty artstyle was really good to look at however with only 12 episodes you cant really make much of anything happen develop if there was a s2 or just more episodes in general i would place it higher for sure ,1,anime
IIceWeasellzz,i think i only have 4 10 10 steins gate just fucking fantastic fma b really made the child part of me relive what a watching a great shounen for the first time feels like shinsekai yori i just really liked the ending spice and wolf holo is perfection an honorable mentions go to shigatsu wa kimi no uso and nichijou ,1,anime

IIceWeasellzz,i am going to nominate shin sekai yori from my 10 10 i was and did originally give it a 9 10 after finishing it it firmly held a 6 10 before the last few episodes i sat grumbling to myself incoherently in an unpleasant tone through most of the show and cursing the person who recommended me this waste of time the ending really did it for me and i realize that this ending may not satisfy every person who watched it the main issue ssy suffers from is pacing this anime got a bad case of steins gate syndrome as s g is another one i really like to recommend to people but some lose interest because they proclaim the first half is too boring of course all of our ratings are based on personal preference but this is probably my weakest 10 10 as it secured the spot simply because i thought the ending was redeeming enough ,2,anime

IIceWeasellzz,usually short 12 episode series feel really rushed in my head as i follow the plot there are good ones out there that really hit the nail on the head but generally speaking 12 episodes is too short to get anything done supremely well that aside my recommendation for my best unknown unpopular aniume is oda nobuna no yabou http myanimelist net anime 11933 oda nobuna no yabou q oda 20nobun this anime has really held a spot for underdog anime can be good too for a while ,0,anime

IIceWeasellzz,i honestly do not know wtf you are talking about this is exactly what the community needs na servers for english speakers would make dota way more enjoyable it a fucking team game so of course you need to communicate and not to mention sa players are on average way fucking worse because they are less educated ,6,DotA2

IIceWeasellzz,we need you to continue these until we get a satisfying ending so far you have done god work ,7,Nisekoi
IIceWeasellzz,the ending we need but not the ending we deserve ,1,Nisekoi
IIceWeasellzz,i fell into the same boat you are in right now i ended up reading the mange and really enjoyed it there are some parts especially 229 like wtf komi that i did not like very much or was not the way i wished but in the end this series was one of my favorites to follow ,3,Nisekoi
IIceWeasellzz,pretty sure this is unanimously amazing ,12,Nisekoi
IIceWeasellzz,what big strong shoulders reminiscent of a strong alpha gorilla ,2,Nisekoi
IIceWeasellzz,sometimes these stronger themes may and in my opinion should be repeated to solidify the author message i think we can all tell komi was a bit actually a fucking lot rushed to make an ending since his time budget was a little on the short side i think using this repetition to tell the readers kosaki has moved on proved at least effective people will of course get salty lost and whatever but the point is to not let her feelings linger for raku while maintaining good relations at the same time ,1,Nisekoi
IIceWeasellzz,tbh this series was a sol series as well i didnt think too much of the promised girl plot to each their own but i would get antsy even for their sol shenanigans ,1,Nisekoi
IIceWeasellzz,ok so shit gets lit fast awesome ,2,Nisekoi
IIceWeasellzz,i think the fact the page on 228 where kosaki walks past raku and stopped herself from knocking on the glass signalled she has moved on from him perhaps she still has feelings for him she obviously is still friends with raku however kosaki has come to accept come to terms with the results raku choosing chitoge ,3,Nisekoi
IIceWeasellzz,mystery solved i would have gotten away with it if it were not for you meddling kids ,2,Nisekoi
IIceWeasellzz,ive read up to 150 and it enjoyable for me there not too many actual confession interruptions but there is thoughts of committing to confess ,2,Nisekoi
IIceWeasellzz,i have said this before but i will say it again raku has a fitting name because hes as dense as a rock so to answer your question no not really he pretty much stays the same old oblivious harem mc ,8,Nisekoi
IIceWeasellzz,i got to get me one of those folders filled with gorilla gifs ,6,Nisekoi

IIceWeasellzz,when a woman period is delayed there is a possibility of pregnancy so using this information we can extrapolate that raku must have slept with not one individual but both chitoge and kosaki aka rock kun rocked the bed on both of these ladies ,37,Nisekoi
IIceWeasellzz,pretty sure it comes out on aug 11th and its a double chapter as it was previously stated ,-2,Nisekoi

IIceWeasellzz,ok back with more today guys hopefully i can finish the rest edit season 1 is now complete season 2 work in progress ovas are done edit 2 everything is done uploading now imgur seems to have lost 6 10 images along the way due to shotty internet server load i am not going to look for those images since that would be a bit too much even for me i think you guys get the point so enjoy the reactions and have fun making some memes since the series is coming to a close ,2,Nisekoi
IIceWeasellzz, modern art ,1,Nisekoi
IIceWeasellzz,you monster i wont fall for your trap ,6,Nisekoi
IIceWeasellzz,ok no more uploading for today ill be back tomorrow with more total image count for the series is over 5000 ,5,Nisekoi
IIceWeasellzz,good point due to raku circumstances he couldnt have really commited to kosaki ,1,Nisekoi
IIceWeasellzz,i think human nature has a little bit of chase the hard to get girl if you know what i mean depends on your personality but i do agree kosaki would have been the one to pick but die to his situation he couldnt have dated her since the fake lover thing as op brought up and also yes theres no way they meet 10 years later but that would make a boring story ,2,Nisekoi
IIceWeasellzz,i agree but most people are fortunately less dense than a rock no pun intended edit what i meant was the real relationship with chitoge or any of the other girls for that matter would be less vague reading body language and having decent enough ability to socialize you can pick up queues here and there about their feelings and motives sure real life relationships will have a lot more depth than the one portrayed in nisekoi but i still think that any of the nisekoi girls could have a viable relationship when their personality is brought into the real world ,1,Nisekoi
IIceWeasellzz,i have not read the manga to completion but i do know that chitoge is definitely best girl material although as you said she is a classic tsundere that is where a lot of her quirky moments and character development happen we see the conflicting feelings and her inner thoughts which do change and progress as time goes on atleast within the first half of the manga komi chose chitoge to win for a reason and that because he gave her the most development and screentime we can see some proof of this concept through onodera development or lack thereof tsugumi has always been a more supporting character to chitoge she lives her life almost in the shadow of her mistress what makes chitoge happy will make her happy in a sense but tsugumi does have the tsundere side of her as well nice since they both have the tsu prefix personally i like chitoge better as raku can be himself with her you can almost reach out and grab the air the atmosphere is so tense when raku is with one of the other girls and seems unnatural even though it should not ,3,Nisekoi
IIceWeasellzz,i didnt like her cutting her ponytail but i guess thats symbolism for ya good writing but im a long hair kind of guy maybe i remembered wrong but i think the details were something liek she moved away to do her va job in another town ,1,Nisekoi
IIceWeasellzz,pretty sure in the ln she moved away after they got together maybe i remembered wrong but i think thats one of the reasons i didnt like the ln but i did like the anime a lot more ,1,Nisekoi
IIceWeasellzz,i mean i guess she wasnt the primary love interest but still after sorata and mashiro get together the author makes her leave s i think what i should have said was no toradora ending s ,2,Nisekoi
IIceWeasellzz,we just want the kiss and a happily ever after dammit komi if you pull a sakurasou where nanami disappears how can you make a major character disappear chitoge better not leave to america s ,10,Nisekoi
IIceWeasellzz,i share many of the feelings you are going through i recently started watching the anime and now have finished and moved onto reading the manga but gotten hooked and has become an integral part of my life for the past week i too feel sad for kosaki but rooted for chitoge to begin with these bittersweet moments have become so iconic for nisekoi this series for me has truly been the embodiment of the phrase it not about the destination but rather the journey i would like to thank the sub the regulars the flamers the toxic people the fans the shippers all of you came together to form the nisekoi community and as the series is coming to a close we stand united i salute you nisekoi i salute you komi ,2,Nisekoi
IIceWeasellzz,i watched spice and wolf for holidays since this sub was and still is pretty crazy on it also watched nisekoi for choice and was pretty happy reading the manga to almost finish the story after and now waiting for the ending few chapters ,1,anime
IIceWeasellzz,at this rate with all the spoilers i do not think anyone going to be happy with the results ,2,Nisekoi
IIceWeasellzz,that would be such bad writing even though komi did not develop kosaki i would doubt he would pull a silly gimmick like that although i would have a good laugh at it im sure the masses wouldnt be as pleased ,2,Nisekoi

IIceWeasellzz,i personally run huntress for the poison dart towers liek most people however i do not use them like many people by that i mean the popular build is get the toxic shock bow and get lots of dp and it does great damage at level 1 and drop some on the map and forget about em i use them as substitute walls that do crazy damage since towering poison still drops on all armor pieces at a max of 130 i have gotten mine to about 300k hp level 1 and about 70k dps on a single target this eliminates he du needed for walls as these pdts are plenty tank enough they usually scale pretty poorly with upgrades but since i went max def hp mine scale pretty well basically gear for the pdts and use em for damage or use em like walls which also do crazy damage ,3,dungeondefenders

IIceWeasellzz,because if you know how to do dps calculations which i will tell you in case you do not is critical dmg critical attack dmg attack rate now if you use this formula and mess around with your gear you will soon realize def power which increases the attack damage gives very very minimal dps increase while the def hp makes it so you can use em in onslaught and they last for easily over 10 to 15 rounds without needing a repair ,1,dungeondefenders
IIceWeasellzz,get def hp and def crit when upgrading put all points into def crit damage focus on getting 3 frosty nodes on weapon and relic totalling 6 and make sure you get the passive def crit as close to 30 as possible ,2,dungeondefenders

IIceWeasellzz,i have gotten an absurd amount from ramparts and all ove which above 300 i currently use a 397 with dp pe is very useful since blowing up small guys 15k damage and theres often 10 20 small guys in a short wave so if 2 or 3 die they all die ,1,dungeondefenders
IIceWeasellzz,ev2 by far easily 5 10x better than dps huntress ,1,dungeondefenders
IIceWeasellzz,idk i got super lucky and finished a full set in 3 days im sitting at 748 atm with 5 frosty nodes and 40 k crit and 28 6 def crit the only thing is i wish my perfect medallion was a perfect totem instead but i guess i cant really ask for much else ,2,dungeondefenders
IIceWeasellzz,you bring a fair point i have overlooked that fact that much of my gear actually has def crit naturally so this wouldnt be an issue for me either im trying to gauge what the general public is at and that is to say they dont have almost perfect gear like you or myself many people struggle to find that perfect totem and or weapon with 3 frosty nodes many struggle with simply realizing that stacking def power increases the damage minimally in the face of def crit and the def speed thing is quite strange i cant really come up with anything to combat the loss of panic fire nor come up with a viable scaling in the sas ,1,dungeondefenders

IIceWeasellzz,you seem to have forgotten to page u riasismywaifu,2,anime
IIceWeasellzz,although nothing wrong with the post i felt like you not noticing that the weapon will always have hero damage on it is quite an oversight this basically means that you cannot roll a weapon with defence power and def crit one stat is always hero damage your example was not the best but anyways i do think tripwire and such should be brought up to 5 10 like archers as well because atm the huntress is utterly useless dps is outclassed by ev2 and traps are easily outclassed by archers ,1,dungeondefenders
IIceWeasellzz,no but since i usually afk maps for gear i might as well do one that is both quick and gives a decent amount so far from experimentation it has been dragonfall gates for speed but the gear drops are not always the best i understand its random but my luck on dfall gates hsa really been scrrewin me lately ,1,dungeondefenders
IIceWeasellzz,lmao this guys something else ,3,dungeondefenders
IIceWeasellzz,ill def give the blingking map a try thanks,1,dungeondefenders
IIceWeasellzz,i do nm4 inc dragonfall gates and that gives 69 as well and its faster for me since its a small map and the buiild is faster ,1,dungeondefenders
IIceWeasellzz,thats about 3 medals only i think you would have to run the map something like 23 times to get a nm4 run equivalent in medals assuming you run the map in about 2 mins each thats still 46 minutes its slower sorry to inform you ,1,dungeondefenders
IIceWeasellzz,let hope this means they are too busy to gut the ev2 traps for a bit we can only pray ,1,dungeondefenders
IIceWeasellzz,this is really sad for people like me who enjoyed the builder ev2 compared to the much more popular dps ev2 i suppose it back to archer spam a lot of people still have not figured out how to use the traps and spammed defence power and not def critical and def hp but does not really matter at this point since what used to be good for the du is now almost worthless since if you wanted a slow the frost tower would be better granted it not huntress useless but it never going to be returned as a rival against the al archers ,1,dungeondefenders
IIceWeasellzz,i cannot either that why i said at max and i do not have dragolich so i cannot be too sure what the dps would be with one and 500k is a lot for huntress but cannot even compare to a ev2,1,dungeondefenders

IIceWeasellzz,for me it was honestly buying a mouse with side buttons this helped me get into the habit of using items quickly in my first couple months of dota i am pretty weird in general and do not like hotkeys for my items and i try to keep spells and items seperate but i think in general most people would get a lot out of a 25 dollar mouse with 2 side buttons especially if you are new or in a lower mmr bracket ,1,DotA2

IIceWeasellzz,rewatched sakurasou nopet na kanojo mashiro is the best,2,anime
IIceWeasellzz,hello friend may the odds be ever i n my favour,1,DotA2
IIceWeasellzz,my point is exactly that assuming the same amount of time and effort goes into making one set for some arbitrary hero it should and most likely is spent on highly played heroes for example pudge or invoker this would make it so valve sells the most sets and earns the most amount of money thus furthering them making more sets perhaps for he same popular heroes or for anothe batch of other popular heroes extending this logic this would mean a set for elder titan although he has a few sets already or a set for visage or troll would sell muchuch worse than a set for pudge or some sexy lina set and since money talks this tells valve we should not make sets for these lowly played or lowly appreciate d heroes in the future since they do not rack in as much cash ,1,DotA2
IIceWeasellzz,yeah no valve is a company and they wan t to maximize their profits so using basic stats and logic you conclude that the most played female heroes would be optimal to make sets for since sex sells this is also why heroes like sven and axe which used to have a high pick rate has gotten many sets and items compared to visage who rarely sees play regardless of the meta ,1,DotA2

IIceWeasellzz,some title gore right there,1,DotA2
IIceWeasellzz,lmao obviously you do not know how ench does her damage the max range to damage ratio for impetus was almost halved meaning at max range the damage is almost half as much as it used to be doom is still good with a good lineup and vokers laning is harder bc forge scales are reversed so exort gives mana not hp and like 90 lower mana at early levels bc 8 int got replaced or something so i think voker and doom are still good wih good lineup ench is balanced i guess and od is rip but then again no one liked playing vs or as the hero so he kinda in a ok place by community standards viper is pretty dogshit too but he so annoying to play against and not fun playing g as that the community does not rely care for him like od should stay this way honestly but i guess you are still salty about the invokers ,2,DotA2
IIceWeasellzz,everyone got good nerfs and fuck is as well invoker got his cold snap needed and as well as starting int dooms 3rd skill got needed as well impetus max damage almost got halved ,0,DotA2

IIceWeasellzz,antarctica is larger in area than canada i think it only seems that way on the picture and it not factually larger in area on the face of the planet edit seems i am wrong my bad i always associated the fact that many people correct people believed antarctica was larger than canada due to the limitations of a flat map ,-3,DotA2

IIceWeasellzz,please as good as this set looks do not bring attention to tinker fuck that hero and the shit he does really do not want tinker to be meta or anywhere near it ever again ,1,DotA2
IIceWeasellzz,honestly i thought this would be about cheap items that people rarely use in game not stuff that is not in the game and probably wo not get in so there no use trying to hype it ,1,DotA2
IIceWeasellzz,i am not obsessively muting people in my defense only intentional feeders and exclusive spanish speakers that refuse to cooperate however the issue or i guess it really more of a non issue is that people can change their names and the notepad full of names do not become foolproof another point is that i do not actually think being able to tell who muted is in anyway a good idea this might put people on tilt before the draft even begins ,1,DotA2
IIceWeasellzz,not to my knowledge there no way to tell who you have muted during loading phase ,1,DotA2
IIceWeasellzz,this is awesome if they implement this i can dodge games during the loading phase ,1,DotA2
IIceWeasellzz,honestly the change is so insignificant that it wo not make a difference for 99 99 of players it not even innovative or useful you just flipped the portraits and the colors for no reason ,-6,DotA2
IIceWeasellzz,stop getting mad at toxic players use the fucking mute button we lol now ,15,DotA2
IIceWeasellzz,well this question is very open ended as it can depend on a lot of things such as hero damage hero attack speed base attack time basically hero dependent but for the most part i think it 1 7 situation free hits on a dummy or you are chasing a hero how many attacks do you get in time interval you are considering and maybe movement speed but this is kinda part of the how many attacks you get in part percentage increase will vary fom situation to situation and it really hard to judge on average how much you are damage will increase by i am on mobile so the math will be quite difficult to format but i am sure someone will get to the topic later ,3,DotA2

IIceWeasellzz,to all the people that seem to have a stigma on ranked ap it very simple just do not play it no one is forcing you to play ap however arguing for the opposite and removing ap for this and that reason is not a good argument what to know why because with ap no one is forcing you to only play ap but the opposite where they remove ranked ap the people who like to play ap are forced to play rd or cm not everyone likes to in fact i dont like rd or cm and therefore i do not play it the shitty counter argument to my point is but my queue takes 9 million centuries well fair enough but wanna hear a tip would you rather wait an extra 10 min per game and have what you believe to be a better ranked experience since so many of you are pointing out i have 80 wr without ranked ap blah blah blah or would you rather sit throught a 25 40 min game where you lose because of shitt picks no one picks support but i dont mind playing support but im also the guy that first picks mid notmyfaultguis think about what you really want and dont want ,-2,DotA2

IIceWeasellzz,i feel like through my almost 3k games that i have maybe encountered a handful of these types of people sure theres the ones that will whine and give up when one thing doesnt go their way but in most of my cases even with peruvians they will try their best even though their best may not be very good and give a solid effort in actually tring to win regardless of what they say in chat the gg team noob i afk no def doesnt actually mean much most of the time and i feel like thats just most people way to vent their anger or frustration at some individual since you seem to be rather shocked at the fact the community uses words like nigger and derogatory terms alike either strikes me as innocence or a plead for pity either way the only thing constant in all of your games is you you are the only thing that remains the same in every single on of your games so if this misdirected flaming at you seems to occur a lot perhaps its time to look in the mirror and take a good long look and try and improve yourself before expecting something else from others and if doing that is simply too hard then thats ok the community can do without 1 player its no big deal really ,1,DotA2

IIceWeasellzz,im not saying people are purposefully making it difficult for new people out of spite but rather hat was the nature of the game in dota 1 and similarly in dota 2 the game is difficult to get into abd thats that there really isnt much to argue about there however i dont think changing a gew names here or there will make the games skill floor any lower my point was professional players should have the freedom to change how hey are represented jsut as much as any other player or user its unreasonable for ee to forever to be known as ee if he isnt pleased with his nickname another example is xi changing his name to xi from luo but casters often still refer to him as luo hus predominant old name ,1,DotA2
IIceWeasellzz,nice fucking joke you monkey,-1,DotA2
IIceWeasellzz,although i agree with u noxqz i think he worded it extremely poorly you should be able to change your official game info whenever you like there are no rules to forbid a person to change how they would like to be represented if ee wants to be called let it all out and a few touney matches later he wants to be called hachiman or whatever thats his choice sure it might make it hard for new viewers but then again this is dota 2 and its not particularly friendly towards new people anyways the pro scene is catered towards more or less veterans of dota 2 regardless of your overall skill its for people who has invested large amounts of time into the game and they know who is on team secret or eg at any tournament anyways the will be able to guess and piece it together if youre new its not going to matter who sumail or aui2000 is anyways you wont recognize them generally and you wont know much about what they do or how they play this argument to compromise something that works perfectly fine for the vast minority of the general public is unreasonable that would be like saying all books need to have braille along with normal text for the minority that is blind people ,-25,DotA2
