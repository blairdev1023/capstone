WcJessen, capitalists force their ideals on the rest of society when they know what it has done and will continue to do it will be the death of us all corruption and greed will be the death of us not capitalism i personally believe competition is healthy for society also we are not at the point where we can automate most everything i do think there will have to be a change in society once we reach that point but i do not think that is communism thinking one dimensionally that is without considering all angles will only impede progress as an aside i have come across freire in my own studies like many communists he does a great job at firing at a person emotions when communist ideas are put into action however human corruption and greed always win out with or without outside influence anyway i will respond to you tomorrow i appreciate your engagement on these issues feel free to pm me your response if you would prefer ,1,NationalSocialism
WcJessen,i am sorry you lost your grandparents in the war i think the war was unfortunate for everyone who died i will read your thing and respond tomorrow as it late here but a pamphlet is not exactly an ideology in action now is it communism has been tried not true communism many would say well communists need to get together and set up their own societies right wingers do it so why does not the left i do not hate a communist for being a communist i do not like that the left forces their ideals onto the rest of society when they know what it has done throughout history by all means create your communist societies ,1,NationalSocialism
WcJessen,both of my grandfathers fought in the war as well that card will get you nowhere i think both the allies and the axis fought bravely i cannot really argue with you about my personal details you can believe what you wish about me and it makes no difference could you tell me where communism has worked i am sure you have been asked that a million times but you know it has not worked in the past it difficult to believe it will work in the future ,1,NationalSocialism
WcJessen,we murder you if you have not noticed most people on this sub do not believe in the death camp lies put out by your media after the war i am sure some relish the idea of jewish people dying but many of us me included do not believe in that left ideas are actually based on objective facts and information you can easily tell yourself that your beliefs are based on facts hardcore bible believers would have you believe the same thing about their views i could say it about my own ideologies as well but i prefer to say that i am open to information as it comes out in fact i grew up a leftist until i started studying history i would not even say i am a complete right winger i am simply an independent that happens to have an interest in preserving my people culture and rejects cultural marxism it kind of strange you would come in here assuming we have not read mein kampf it would be strange if i went into a communist sub and accused them of not reading marx would it not ,1,NationalSocialism

WcJessen,personally i am fairly new to the sub i do not have any particular hate against any group but perhaps it was a coincidence because of the schools i attended i began to find the constant hounding of wwii history in literally every grade and nearly every class to be somewhat odd mind you my grandfathers both fought in the war so i had no reason to question our side of things wwii was a time ripe with and for propaganda the more i study the topic the more lies i discover granted there was propaganda on both sides the germans were utterly crushed and lost as a people after the war perhaps there were national socialist holdouts who continued to push their ideas after the war but on a whole it was the allied countries and israel who pushed the propaganda i do not expect you to go down this rabbit hole but i do want you to at least recognize that we are not all jack booted cross burning hitler worshipping assholes some of us simply question the official narrative and are interested in national socialism outside the context of german national socialism from 70 years ago ,17,NationalSocialism
