vanBeethovenLudwig,well you are not wrong i could probably give myself more credit for it but i am just not an aggressive type of woman who needs to fight for attention i know those types and i am just not like that ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, i never saw it as a lack of success i have always been so proud of his drive initiative entrepreneurial spirit beautiful point ,5,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,while you are right on some level remember that we are not trying to attract rp men who only want to sleep with women if that the case then yes only looks and age matters maybe the guys that op is trying to attract do not just want to sleep with a girl maybe they are actually looking for a relationship so in that case yes her personality and charisma matters ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i know i am more valuable and attractive than i make it out to be i am just not aggressive or entitled or superior about it i have pretty much achieved all my goals when other women think they are hot shit they flaunt it but i have got a more quiet confidence thanks for your reply anyway ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, stupid shit means just voicing my opinions and what i think in a nutshell yes basically just showing who you are instead of being closed off and nervous it not odd behavior it just who you are some guys tend to notice a girl for a while before making a move just depends some are more forward and will go for it after chatting a few times and some might just need to be in the right mindset and looking for a girlfriend i have also noticed some guys do not ask out a girl he interested in because he might have other pressing matters on his mind such as his job just depends but bottom line is you need to attract him first not chase after him ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,try being more open and friendly and interested in the people you are interacting with take the attention off of yourself and show your interest ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i would not take these definitions too inside the box mannerisms and charismatic personality also filter into a woman smv if a woman is stone cold or a bitch no matter how hot she is a lot of men would not sleep with her ,4,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,a year of steady dating is enough to know someone well and get engaged but probably two is safer i have sort of noticed i have never gotten past two years of an ltr because if it never got to the marriage stage by then i called it quits usually because we realized we were not right for each other in the end ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i do hold myself to a high moral standard infj but a fleeting minuscule part of me does wish i was high value enough to get away with cheating i just see it so often women cheat and run off a new man but the new boyfriend does not seem to bat an eye that she cheated to be with him they just so badly want to know they are desired and also the new man works hard to keep her happy not saying big things but those boyfriends that really aim to please her in every tiny way i am not as high maintenance and perhaps too forgiving and supportive to my boyfriends but i wish i were more of a bitch sometimes ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, 2 the goal of dating is to marry if you are not ready for marriage yet i am not going on the first date with you 3 the purpose of dating is to determine whether this person is suitable for me to marry or not this needs to be understood more for women who are looking to marry you cannot just date around and find a fun guy unless your goal is just to have a fun boyfriend that fine but if your goal is to marry then you have to look for marriage material men i am also from a culture that dates solely for the goal of marriage so people tend to marry quickly and without any drama because the intentions were clear at the start when you enter the relationship that means you are investing in it for this goal of marriage i do realize some cultures are not like this though most people especially if early 20 tend to date whoever they get along with at the time then date a few years and might as well get married or break up because they did not realize what they wanted and just wasted time sometimes it works but i have seen a lot of relationships drawn out too long this way because there was no goal or intention in mind ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, your league is mainly about physical charisma not exactly your looks alone but the sum of your appearance mannerisms your general vibe and your personality social skills and intellect agreed op are you shy do you have good social skills and can showcase who you are i used to blend into the wall until i started talking and being more approachable and just saying stupid shit and showing who i was inside then i started attracting these quiet intelligent guys that you describe note that men in general will scope out their options before going on the hunt you have to hunted make yourself noticeable does not mean you have to be loud but your mannerisms have show ,8,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,he actually also fell into my life at the right time i was living in a small town then where everyone knew each other and somehow he found me and we started talking he can read people pretty well and i think he has a hobby of talking to random people and getting a sense of what their problems would be i did not look him up on a website or anything ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,he given really wonderful advice to me based on the female role not only has he given good guidance but he helped to solve some inner problems of mine that i have not able to solve with multiple therapists of this controlling and analyzing methodology i thought it was interesting he also advises this childlike nature of women similar to fascinating womanhood and in general being forgiving and receiving and flowing he fantastic teaches you from all around you growing up to take control prove yourself you wo not be pushed around etc etc i think there are still ways to prove yourself because it still necessary in a way but it does not have to be done so aggressively for sure ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, there is the stereotype of men complaining that their wives frivolously spend all their hard earned money this is true ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,for me no i have never thought about cheating and never acted on it why because i am actually afraid of the consequences 1 him not forgiving me yes men do forgive women for cheating 2 moral character reputation i believe things do come back around to you in life if it gossip or loss of reputation and 3 the simple fact that i do not want to ever be cheated on so i will never hurt my partner like that i really feel like if i cheated then that stains my character for future relationships and my future husband trust in me finally i do not really want to cheat it does not cross my mind i do not look at another man and think how awesome he would be in bed i want my boyfriend i want him only i want his attention i do not care for other men have i ever been in a rough patch and looked around me to see if there is something better yes i have have i ever acted on it no if that means sleeping with someone or trying to get to know someone more never have i had a flirty conversation with another man when things were going badly with my partner yes i have i do not know i am someone that needs to work through a relationship and finish it before even attempting to make something happen with someone else i also take relationships seriously all of my ltrs have discussed marriage before i do not jump into another relationship just for the hell of it my relationships are well thought out and vetted before i invest i never understood cheating maybe i have low self esteem or something but i never felt entitled to a man chasing after my princess complex when girlfriends would tell me oh your boyfriend is not here if he really cared and did not want you to cheat then he would work harder for you i never understood that maybe i am not that beautiful or not that great of a girl not wonderful enough to think i could get away with cheating i do not know but i could never do that to a man i loved and committed to and these girls these girls that cheat and expect their boyfriends to chase after them and work hard for them they still get married somehow so i do not know maybe i am just not good enough to cheat on someone because to me my life is completely over if i do note i am not really religious in any way ,14,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i hate when snobby europeans say this because i know plenty of europeans who do not know the world i had a dutch boyfriend briefly from rotterdam and he could not point out anything in africa south america east asia or middle east he was dumb an boring as shit and got in fights at the bar this british girl i knew did not know where japan was a group of italians thought there were 500 countries in the world i could go on and on about how dumb the europeans i met were stop lying to yourself there are plenty of dumb europeans dutch included and yes i did just group you all into europeans because you even do the same but then you get mad and say you are all different yet you say us europeans all the time ,1,worldnews
vanBeethovenLudwig,no but i am saying girl game only goes so far and apparently is not the basis of a lasting ltr even though everyone says to keep sparks going ,2,PurplePillDebate
vanBeethovenLudwig,my boyfriend is awful on the phone he is active only when there something to talk about a problem news with his job or my job otherwise he has that mindset of why do we need to talk if there nothing wrong we are better at texting pictures to each other he is much more affectionate in person your boyfriend might be like that too ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,my boyfriends have always said they wished they could get to know the real me meaning dressed down comfortable me instead if this fake flirty girl which i thought was interesting i can put out pretty good girl game if i want to witty banter teasing but they are always like i am way too tired for this just hug me whenever i would send my boyfriend sexy pics he seemed to acknowledge it but not really flirt back he seemed to want to actually talk to me ,2,PurplePillDebate
vanBeethovenLudwig,to be fair i have tried really hard to keep the flirtiness but my boyfriend and previous ones seem to think ltr means comfortable they also stopped putting effort and or tell me they love me how i am no matter what ,6,PurplePillDebate
vanBeethovenLudwig, quite a lot of times i see the husband having done a mba and in some tough job while the woman majored in something like english and is now sitting at home looking after her kids so basically men have to sacrifice themselves so that women can do what they wish to it sad to think that women have the choice to choose useless majors history literature etc because they do not need to worry about providing not that they cannot choose high paying fields like business or finance but they do not have to men on the other hand have to choose lucrative jobs do you know of many man that chose to major in liberal arts field most do not because they know it difficult to get a high paying job to provide for a family ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,also a man can impregnate a woman and pass away shortly after yet his seed still lives on if a woman is impregnated and dies the child dies too ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, women used to understand this before they stopped trusting men to do their job and decided they needed their own careers imagine if a woman could invest as much time in her husband and family as she did in a career are women as bitter about doing their paid job as they are about doing the laundry for their husbands i am in the second year of a few full time salaried job working for corporate and before i was pretty much freelancing i did not make much money at the time but i had an easy stress free life once i started working 40 hours a week with more pressure and stress to get results and keep our organization successful i stopped understanding why women want a stressful full time job that makes them tired and grumpy at the end of the day and no fun to be around it a lot of work a lot of work plus add to that running errands and appointments and spending most of my free time sleeping and just trying to destress i do not understand women who think they can do these high stress jobs better even if you are intelligent it takes a serious toll on you i see a lot of career women who are high strung and unpleasant and have aged quickly and lost their radiance i just do not understand that being said i do feel grateful for the opportunity to work so i cannot complain so much since many women do not have the education or culture with this right but i just wish women would be more appreciative of having a husband that takes the bulk of the financial strain because he feels it his duty and stop complaining about not being able to work but they are for sure relaxing the hell out of their days and pretty much doing anything they want gym relax hobbies shopping in addition to simple chores groceries cooking cleaning appointments filing seriously a lot of men want to give us an easier life so we do not take on stress so we stay happy and free we do not have to work if we do not want to but men have to work he does not have a choice ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, i just do not hear men complaining about having to support their stay at home wife as much as i hear women complaining about having to cleanup after their husbands this is so true so so true my father never complained about providing for my mother and mind you he gave her a cushy life nice house nice furniture car and in return my mother complains about cooking for him which takes one hour a day for dinner and he out there grinding it out 40 hours a week plus overtime as needed i swear to god i will never complain if i end up in the same situation and it pisses me off so many of these women who complain when everything is provided for got married in the first place how did that even happen ,4,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, alphas want to leave an effect on the world and change society women come to them as a side effect yes and this is exactly what drew me to my boyfriend because he so ambitious and wants to make an impact on society i feel like i could not be attracted to a man who did not want to make a contribution i felt she was being disrespectful and ungrateful she also made it seem like it easy for women to do the same kinds of jobs perhaps a handful but certainly not all i am talking about academic jobs where women might excel vs business construction politics finances or tech which are predominantly male for a reason because women do not want to put in those long hours and grind out the job women want to be pampered it was a bit annoying because she is a mother who loves laying out in the sun but then says she can do just a good of a job as her husband and criticizes him for choosing to have a high stress life that allows her to lay out in the sun ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,2 yes actually that might be it i am loading my glutes when i am on the down motion hips back so when i thrust forward i really feel them during the hip thrusts i do not really feel my glutes at all except at the top of the motion also because it difficult to load the glutes when you have a weight on top of you is there any way to get around that i do find that i can feel my glutes well when i do glute bridges with my feet on top of an exercise ball but of course it very difficult to balance a weight and feet on a ball ,1,xxfitness
vanBeethovenLudwig,not any scientific measurement simply that i feel like i can load squeeze my glutes better at the height of the motion ,1,xxfitness
vanBeethovenLudwig,we discussed this before in another thread the so called dating culture and in american culture during the college years and shortly post grad this is how most of my friends have hooked up with their partners through mutual friends similar to what you are saying in romania for me that how i met my first boyfriend while this can be a good thing mutual friends and social circles mean you are around people of the same economic status and mindset and lifestyle i found it especially difficult if i did not want to be around these types of people does that make sense for instance my college friends smoked a lot of weed and drank a lot they were also all artists i did not want to marry or date another artist they are very unstable people and i yearned for a rational engineer type guy that when i started dating online and going on dates similarly to my boyfriend who comes from a poor part of a mediterranean country is sick of being around other poor people who do not have any ambitions besides hanging out he strove to find a woman who was more educated and had work ethic in any case people do see marriages and relationships differently i suppose i do not see mine as a predominantly a friendship i see mine as a partnership where i take care of him and he takes care of me of course we are friends in addition to lovers but we are not stuck at the hip and it would drive me crazy if we were i do have a romanian colleague and he and his british girlfriend seem to have a very egalitarian relationship where they split everything and do most things together so many it part of their culture mindset i am east asian as well ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,for my boyfriend respect his need for space and rest after he had a long day do not talk his ear off about my problems or bombard him with more tasks respect him for working so hard and building his career encourage him when he stressed or feeling down believe in him respect him for taking care of me say thank you after he takes me out pays for me does something for me tell him i love having him around because i feel safe respect his decision making do not second guess him or tell him i think he making the wrong choice let him make his mistakes if necessary respect him for who he is take notice of all the things he good at compliment him on them make sure he knows i am aware of what he doing ,8,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i am looking for a product that mildly exfoliating bha for daily use currently using cosrx bha but it too strong for every day and i think i need daily light exfoliation any suggestions ,1,AsianBeauty
vanBeethovenLudwig,i was never obese but only 20lbs overweight then i lost 15lbs and started getting so much attention from men and i got very anxious i never had to deal with that much attention before i also got attention but it was much less and i became very critical about my looks and personality because i became a hot girl before those 15lbs were gone i was a depressed girl who laid in bed and ate chocolate and cried a lot it was a very strange transition because my personality did not match my body ,6,xxfitness
vanBeethovenLudwig,for me i just do not like talking about myself i do not like to go through details of my life because i do not like people making judgments about me and my life decisions i also do not like to be around people who complain so i tend to avoid those friends sometimes too because so many if time spent with a lot of friends is just listening to them complaining i feel like when i spend time with these people then they taint my mind with bad things so i tend to just keep my mind more pure by staying alone ,1,AskReddit
vanBeethovenLudwig,yes yes yes yes yes to this whole comment needs more upvotes divorced men remarry more easily than divorced women because their youth and beauty is gone ,5,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,as for buying new things start looking at your purchases in terms of investment and versatility i do not know what your style is but i find investing in good quality classic pieces are more important than what is new and trendy adding to the other comment look at what you have and do not purchase anything unless you really need it save fun purchases for occasions only thirdly be disciplined and stick with your spending habits ,3,FeminineNotFeminist
vanBeethovenLudwig,i think emptying the dishwasher and washing the sheets is fine too i also do the same i guess i was thinking cleaning like mopping the whole apartment and scrubbing the shower and toilet and dusting every single corner type of cleaning i make my boyfriend bed whenever i sleep over and fold his clothes and push in the dining chairs and fluff the couch pillows to tidy things up ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, by wifey mode do you mean cooking for him cleaning his home when you visit doing his laundry etc somehow i find cooking a very natural part of dating and i would probably already do it on the 3rd date or something wifey mode as a girlfriend i would never clean his home for him if i was not his wife the only cleaning i would do is clean up the kitchen if i cooked for him doing his laundry if he was too busy and iron his clothes which he cannot do regardless of being busy or not but no i would never clean his home as a girlfriend ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,for me i do slip into wifey mode maybe towards the end of one year of dating but my boundary is not cohabiting for me the adage why buy the cow if you are getting the milk for free is a big one things like caring for him when he sick occasionally doing his laundry when he too busy cooking for him all happen after the honeymoon period has worn off ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, if a man is truly into a woman it will be some time before he notices if she can even boil water i think the main caveat is not to use wife qualities as an attempt to keep a man interest because it never works these are really interesting points and i find them true over at rp they emphasize proving your rmv through domestic duties but i have observed a lot of men staying with women who are not the best cooks or may be a little messy i definitely do not think being or not being the perfect snow white housewife is a deal breaker i find that personality flexibility and approach to life are very important characteristics in a man being enamored with a woman while being a domestic goddess may be the icing on your relationship cake it certainly is not what draws men to you otherwise they would just hire a maid and get takeout what would be a unreasonable though is if the woman was not a great cook but refused to learn either because men can cook themselves or because she lazy the opposite would be a woman who is not a great cook but is willing to learn because she knows that once married she needs to be able to cook because maybe one day they need to look at their finances and eat on a budget and she needs to be able to pull her own weight in the relationship regardless if she is not the next gordon ramsey ,12,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, when i hang around with 30 year old who are still dating that kind of stay at home date is way more typical and common early in the relationship that true and i have noticed men in their 30 who are looking to settle are looking for more of the domestic aspect of a woman they are usually well into their careers and working more and may just want that soft spot not an adventure partner liberal men in their 20 tend to look for adventure partners ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i see what you mean and i have also observed this phenomenon i think it comes with being a millennial as well especially oones who earn high salaries and have liberal tendencies then people tend to want partners who are also best friends and can bring intellect to the relationship because they are not worried about surviving i see it outside the us too i live abroad nowadays young couples like doing things together going out together to events with other friends having their own friends circle of course we are much wealthier as millennials and do not need to worry so much about surviving like our parents did which may have had the traditional setup of husband provider and wife domestic goddess as for your boring friend i think the problem is she never showed who she is as a person all feminine or submissive women still have interests or hobbies or passions your friend mistake was that she was a doormat nurturing does not mean doormat i think this is also the problem with being single in a liberal city like la or nyc people look for adventure partners and since there so many people around you and a depth of city life it hard to settle unless you are specifically looking for someone to start a family with otherwise people just date for activity partners i have many liberal and high earning friends like this who are consistently frustrated and confused as to what they want and as someone who used to run with this circle i have discovered there a lot of maximizing and hypergamy and displeasure with your fortune because there so much around you it a little bit like the ice cream flavor phenomenon where if you choose from a menu of 12 flavors you are less satisfied than if you chose chocolate over vanilla because that all they had as another user said u shaela90 it the age of marriage 2 0 where you have to merge these liberal white collar adaptations to the traditional aspects ,7,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, we talk about cohabitation as a relationship stage but that not all it is it a commitment in itself especially financially if you are on a lease with another person you are legally bound if you live with someone breaking up is a much bigger ordeal and i feel like someone would be more likely to ignore red flags to avoid that hardship it so tricky to tell too i know plenty of ltrs where they cohabited to try it out then sealed the deal but also plenty of ltrs where they cohabited woman expected marriage and realized it was never in his plan and needed to choose to leave it so so very tricky i think if two people are pretty honest with each other about their expectations and cohabit before marriage it could work and end up in marriage but i think the ones that do not work out are the couples who only do it just because it the obvious next step of the relationship i feel like these couples do not really know what they want and are blindly taking that step which then does not succeed in the end ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, will often backfire especially if you are a yuppie can you explain this more just curious ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i feel like we need to discuss more about rpw strategies and when to implement them in which phases of the relationship definitely i agree with you do not be so eager at the beginning of the relationship i made this mistake not to the same degree as him breaking it off completely but i realized i was giving him too much and had to back off i do not really like relationship games but i do believe there needs to be some sort of strategy along the way where you show what you can offer but without offering it right from the beginning and judging his genuine interest in you and willingness to work for you as a side note i can say that my boyfriend was not truly interested in me until i spoke my mind about certain issues i believe in spoke my mind about how i would like to live life and showed him my interests before then i let him lead and whatnot as well but there was a definite change in the way he viewed me when i in some ways challenged him in a good way ,18,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig,i have been using a double cleanser method but i think oil cleanser might be clogging my pores i mainly use it to wash off my sunscreen though which also clogs pores do i absolutely need oil cleanser to break down sunscreen is there something else i can use i know mineral oil might be clogging to some can i try any other oils ,2,SkincareAddiction
vanBeethovenLudwig, as to marriage i do not know really i think we live in the age of marriage 2 0 where the point is not about what which practical benefits can one provide for the other but more of the commitment to a lifelong partnership with someone who shares your long term goals interests passions that could also be a cultural difference in taiwan at least in my parents generation women were pretty dumb it was a chauvinist culture they needed men to show them things about the world and the wife would in turn take care of the husbands wellbeing and health i am pretty sure my boyfriend still prefers it this way to some degree he still gets off on showing me things and i could not respect him if he was not intelligent since i grew up like this it the only way i understand how a marriage works because growing up in the us it still a bit similar to what you described in romania denmark where we all just hang out with each other and relationships slowly form but then i found there was no point to staying with each other we would have 1 2 years of ltr then once our life trajectory changed we would break up no one was willing to sacrifice for anyone anymore things like quitting a job or moving to another city etc we did not need each other anymore as for my current relationship we do have the privilege of sharing life goals and interests so we are stimulating to each other but i still have at the back of my mind the man needs to be the provider and more successful or else i do not respect him this respect is very important to me otherwise it does not make me want to stay i start seeing him as just some fun guy to talk to i think italy is a little similar to this where the men really feel the pressures of providing as for the legal benefits for us i work as a freelance artist and in the us that translates to no health insurance if we married i could get health care in italy on the other side if my boyfriend ever decided to look for a job in the us i have that american passport but i come from a rich family whereas he comes from a poor family it all very strange to me i am used to the woman marrying into a rich family i do think friendship and intellectual stimulation makes a more sustainable relationship for sure it keeps things going life is not just about provision housework and sex i saw how because my mom was not stimulating she grew depressed after the kids grew up however my father is committed to his vows and he still stays with her even though she not really offering so many benefits anymore i still have a romantic part of me that hopes a marriage lasts a lifetime but i feel like most wo not people change and want different things it takes a certain match to be compassionate and flexible in moving along in life at the same time i think it good to not let yourself go people let themselves go and expect their spouses to still stay it is good to have some pressure but at the same time you have to be forgiving ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,as a side note regarding the social circles at least with him i have noticed he has a lot of friends that are girls and he really has no interest in sleeping with them they are just for intellectual stimulation or business ventures but i actually grew up with a more separated social circle my father did not have any female friends my mother did not have any male friends so that what i mean by that he actually laughed at me when i said i do not make friends with men unless we are colleagues because to me if i willingly go out with a man alone then that a date also in my experience it has always been like this for me i can never seem to befriend an adult man long term after a certain point if we have not started being romantic then the friendship is over that does not mean i do not talk to men as friends i have plenty of side conversations with them in passing but the point is i would never actively seek them to go out on the weekend for example if there was a concert i would not ask a male friend to go i would ask my boyfriend during work hours i do go out one on one with a male colleague occasionally though and that just brings me back to the question why get married nowadays to me marriage was to provide benefits for each other typically man supports the woman and the woman does domestic duties but also the woman a companion to the man and the man protector of the woman but if now we are all expected to be independent and have our own friends and lives what is the point lastly i find it difficult to make female friends because most of the single women in their late 20 or early 30 are independent career women who do not care to have a family or a partnership it a slippery slope they go out to ladies night together and scope out the prospects and have group dinners where they complain i live abroad so these are mixes of european women i am successful but i am not at that level where i need ladies night so it seems like i cannot make any female friends men always want to befriend me but then it a fine line to tread ,1,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig, the issues you mention are i think all too common in developing countries especially if the individual experienced the development and transition during their lifetime my boyfriend is sicilian so he grew up quite poor because all the money is in the industrial north i think you hit it right on the head about development and transition he worked in milano previously and saw how the girls there were very independent and cultured but at the same time he could not get along with them because they were too modern individualistic and feminist but i do observe how he likes me because i am independent hardworking and cultured and because sicily is poor part of the problem is people do not care to work for more and are lazy so i think he stuck in between this modern type girl who is interesting and ambitious and can bring some money but also wanting a traditional setup where he feels useful by providing for me because he grew up like that as do i because i am taiwanese but also with the american upbringing i have more of a sense of purpose with my career and my interests but my family upbringing influences me to be a submissive wife you made another insightful comment a few weeks ago to my post about men settling i am that first woman the one who stimulates him but wants more and is hypergamous and the problem is what you also mentioned i wanted a better provider i was the one who left all of my ex boyfriend and moved on quickly i think i was trying to be easier to handle so i started being more submissive but as i mentioned i am slowly observing he wants that stimulation but again i am afraid of coming off as competitive or dominating with my career success my mother and his mother were both housewives that were provided for by their husbands but i saw how both sides lacked stimulation i see it things become calm and boring but the wives were dutiful to their husbands that why it so hard to be dutiful to him when i am independent i start caring less about him but i know this does not help for a sustainable relationship and i want to be submissive i get off on it it how i can respect him when i feel like i need to stimulate him i feel like he lower ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,where in europe are you from i am american but asian so some of our values are different too my boyfriend is southern european there are some things i am learning like the man and the woman have their own social circles and seem to not really hang out with each other unless it at home whereas i grew up that the man and the woman basically do everything together except work it was something strange for me to grasp because he comes from a traditional culture that why we got along and he said he wanted a submissive girlfriend because apparently all the modern girls are feminists but i am slowly learning what that means i think for him it means he wants an independent woman who is cultured and intelligent but who will still do the domestic duties and see him as head of the family but then again for an asian family head of the family means the woman basically relies on the man for most things like taking her out to events and taking her traveling i feel like this is not the case for his culture i think the woman is expected to have her own social life and not rely on the man for that but to me it meant a man is needed for his intellect and to show the woman the world it was quite confusing i am still debating if these cultural differences are big enough that it might be a problem long term and he would say confusing things like i do not have to work i do not need the stress of a job his mom was sahm sahw but then again he likes me for my ambitions and independence and culture it all very confusing also he comes from the poor part of a european country if that makes any difference ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,first off thank you for your comment it was very helpful overall why does he have to be the prize and not you not saying you should display an entitled attitude but appreciate yourself more for your efforts i thought about this and i think i read too much of the do not compete with your man let him win theory and i am afraid i have gone the whole other way i used to be very independent and successful actually i would say i am more successful than my boyfriend because i have a higher salary i think in order to dumb myself down i started saying things like no you are better or i am scared is he ever afraid you will find someone else yeah he is but here the thing he says if i want to find someone else i should the inner bitch says i will show him i can find someone better but the rpw side says well being disloyal and hypergamous is not going to make him want to marry you but all in all i feel like i want him to work for me but i have not been able to show it instead i am too submissive thus i have not been able to tell him my boundaries and thus he says he afraid i am not able to call him out that why i ended up yelling at him about his faults i know not good but that was my way to overcompensate for being walked all over i know i should not yell but i need to figure out a way to establish boundaries and call him out on his shit while still being compassionate does that make sense right now i am being too compassionate do not ever try to compensate a lack of self esteem or love for yourself and your body by being sweet nice submissive because that is a sure way to abuse i think i am treading these waters now and i realized i am relying way too much on him for validation tonight i decided i really need to be more independent and work on my self esteem but i do know that at this moment i am wondering why he has not dumped me yet because i have been difficult lately that just tells you something about my self esteem i cannot even tell you what i bring to the relationship anymore also i do not want to insult rpw but i think the very qualities that drew my boyfriend to me in the first place are a bit anti rpw when we first started dating he was attracted because i was independent adventurous intelligent curious artistic he likes these qualities in me because a lot of his friends are lazy asses who do not want anything more than just survive then i read rpw and things like he does not care about your success or intelligent men do not like independent women so i tried to dumb down but now i have low self esteem because now i am relying on him for validation and not me as an awesome woman i love him i know i need to work on myself i am really afraid of ruining this relationship because of me and here the catch 22 when i work on myself and act less submissive i feel less loving towards him when i am submissive and clingy it because i like him so much when i am independent and have high self esteem i look down on him and he seems to want to chase me more but then i do not feel for him when he chasing me i seem to swing from extremes and i cannot figure out how i feel love for him without being too needy and validating ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, what are you doing to manage the stress that you know makes you act in a way that is unlike yourself i manage by exercising and eating right not eating too many sweets i know the past two weeks i have not made it to the gym and i will been eating way too much chocolate for my own good so have been more unable to control my moods it all in the delivery this is a complete guess but do you tend to bottle things up inside of you for a while only to explode later yes this is exactly me i am always so scared of being told no or worried what will happen if i ask or call out something i am afraid of coming off as rude so instead i am super sweet but then i cannot take it anymore and explode i know i need to work on this at work i usually have enough boundaries but i am trying to figure it out in my relationship i am being too submissive but i do not know how to make my boundaries clear without exploding in rage or maybe i should just let it go instead of having too many boundaries which makes me too uptight again in the past i am very easygoing and readily able to go with the flow but then i was called out for not being aggressive enough be careful of assigning everything to feminine or masculine traits doing this creates an easy absolution of behavior and ultimately responsibility this is a really true comment i think i am so caught up that i am not feminine and graceful enough and being too masculine but you are right it should not be one or the other ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,question about cosrx bha power liquid gel it seems to work pretty well for me but there one issue i get a bit red after applying it it goes away the next morning and there no adverse reaction on my skin no burn but definitely is red for the rest of the night i also use the cosrx aha which does not give me any redness i compared the two products ingredients and there nothing different except the aha bha and the type of water and arginine in the bha is it ok to keep using it even though i get red is it just a bit strong and maybe i need to use a less concentrated formula or maybe i should wait longer after i used aha i have been using aha then waiting two rest days before the bha ,1,AsianBeauty
vanBeethovenLudwig,and that funny because i could not respect a man who could not show me the world i would think he was too weak or feeble i guess we all get off on different traits i also grew up with a strong father figure who was a saint and we all entrusted him to make decisions for us i think women who grew up with an absent or weak father would prefer the beta dynamic something about not trusting a man would make a woman want to be in more control i think but to each her own ,5,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,just wanted to say this was a really enlightening comment because i just called my boyfriend out on some serious things i have a hard time not being a doormat and my problem is being a doormat and not saying when i have an issue usually major things i do not fuss about trivial things this really helped me see the fact that honesty is appreciated sometimes because it means we have standards ,5,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig,in this specific case the single mother makes an upper middle class income the child is spoiled if anything the mother has fancy things they are also european if that makes any difference yes it is a case of bad parenting but perhaps if there was a father figure in the family the mother feels secure in the relationship does not have to work full time and can be more invested in the child the single mother working full time and also putting her free time into dating her boyfriend who does not really care about the child neglects her child of course it difficult to say and it easier said than done maybe the father was abusive and left the family and the mother is left to fend for herself or maybe she wanted to be a career woman and left to not be a housewife again she makes an upper middle class income so the case is different than the typical uneducated single mother who then has to work 3 low paying jobs ,3,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig, i am already in a relationship with someone who is always on the same page with me some time before i came across rp stuff i find a lot of rp advice to be great advice for making the best of less than ideal relationships like the ones i had with my ex es can you explain how rp advice helped your relationships if i am reading correctly you followed the lead of your ex boyfriends but then those relationships did not turn out successful is not rp advice to follow the lead ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,what would be an ideal dynamic for you then ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i see what you are saying now i do believe that there is still a relationship game but it only works if you vet the right men what i have learned from my experience and from other people is knowing each other intentions early on and also seeing where the guy is in his life does he seem like he partying a lot or having a lot of fun even while working then he might not be interested in marriage and just wants a companion is he really focused on his job and making money he probably is thinking about financial stability and starting a family soon also things like their background and what kind of friends they have if he has a lot of married friends he more likely to be thinking about marriage eventually you are right about the grey area and it the most precarious situation for a woman these days not to be strung along men have options too they do not have to get a job and settle down quickly some men will have a ltr during their first entry level job because they know they want to eventually work up from that first job and they know they want to be in a better status before marrying the dangerous part is men not telling you they might be wasting your time but you can also tell things like meeting family and observing their cultural background my two ex boyfriends were american and they tend to be more casual about taking girlfriends to meet parents for my family i would not take someone home to meet my family unless it quite serious same for my current boyfriend who is not american so when he did take me to meet his mother i knew it was serious there also things like following your instinct during the first vetting phases there could be some men who look good on paper but you cannot really see through them does that make sense if you do not have a good feeling about him the first few meetings be careful if the guy does not have the same intentions from the beginning no amount of tactics will do anything then after you learn about these things i agree not to be too available at the very beginning but i would say in month 3 6 to be contributing a little bit but not more than he contributes i have also heard that if you have talked about marriage and he in the right place but still not making any moves to still let him chase you i think generally even if you are too available even during the marriage causes resentment the only chores i do for my ltr is cooking and his laundry we do not live together i definitely do not offer to clean his apartment and i do not offer to pay for our dates but i give him really good sex and support of his ambitions in return it keeps him coming back but i am not giving him my all ,4,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig, i would just like to gently insert here though that a stay at home mom can raise bratty children and a working mom can raise wonderful children just because someone seems to have a bratty child does not mean that them staying at home is the answer i can attest to this i have seen a lot of bratty children because their mom does not do any work since she married a rich guy meaning when the mother is not cooking she shopping or hanging around it really interesting good mothers still have to be active and set a good example for the children if you take your kids to the mall on a weeknight instead of staying home and doing their homework you are going to raise lazy kids ,1,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig, you do not have to be head over heels for a man but you have to want to be with him and specifically him forever and it sounds like she not that keen except that one of the reasons she was unsure was because he short she 5 5 5 6 and he 5 8 5 9 so how picky can she be really at 34 especially about something like height if he serious about her and not just stringing her along i feel like she has to settle he not a bad guy otherwise besides the height issue ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, even post brexit i thought there was a good chance that it would get much more restrictive my eu friends living and working in london do not prove otherwise at least at the moment and yes you are right about italian spanish etc men and going fast and talking big except when it comes to meeting mama that why i am concerned for her and i know that latin men are also the type to cohabit without any intention of marrying if it very serious they usually marry before living together and the men will usually try to have their own apartment not sharing with other flatmates and also meeting the mother i think she has a feeling about this she did say he very mediterranean but i feel like she caught up in everything to really make a decision but most important of all i think her instinct is telling her no and she not listening to it maybe i should tell her that if she does not meet the mother over the summer do not move in together she was planning on moving september ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,eu members can still live and work in the uk easily i have a feeling this does not have anything to do with the passport i feel like he being a womanizer he spanish and latin men can be overly romantic without being serious she feels like there might be a cultural misunderstanding too that why it so complicated and she unsure he 31 and has been professing his love for her and urge for marriage and they have only dated four months i have heard some things about spanish italian men going really fast if it not serious and when they do consider a serious relationship then they are much more careful with their actions but i think bringing home a girlfriend means something more serious however he has not made any implications of meeting his parents just going to his home country ,1,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig,yeah same here i did not have any crazy international sex the majority of my travelling was with my parents actually and some with my boyfriend at the time i am really not a solo traveler and i am really careful when single women ask me to travel with them i know of friends who have had euro threesomes or whatever because i know it can be more provocative as two young women traveling although i did meet my current boyfriend abroad everybody has reasons for travelling there are people whose home countries are in the shit so they need to leave to find better work i also went because of a better job package it not all fun and adventure sometimes but it funny when people tell me i am so adventurous because i do not feel like it i live abroad but i have a regular 40 hours week job and i go home every night no partying i guess i do jet off somewhere when i have holiday but sometimes i do not really feel like i am living a crazy life new places become home after a while ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,that pretty interesting i can definitely understand because i knew a lot of young expats that basically just jumped from country to country every few years or so they also tended to stay single into their late 30 and 40 these types of people also did party and sleep around too sampling the international flavor both men and women so it is true to an extent on the other side i also saw a lot of expat families that either settled into another country for instance there were tons of european expat families living in east africa and their children were raised there or parents that loved seeing the world and jumped from country to country taking their children with them so sure you could say these families were discontent with everyday life or maybe fascinated with what the world could offer i met some families with interesting stories of how they basically were pioneers and not to mention they tend to be much wealthier living outside their country ,5,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig, nearly every link on the first page besides someone personal blog evan marc katz mentions that married women are less happy than married men and less happy than single women while numbers and statistics do not lie i would imagine many of those unhappily married women have brought it upon themselves being ungrateful nagging not taking happiness into their own hands ,1,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig, also remember that for men their partner is often their main source of deep emotional support yes this i think men can chit chat easily with other men but i was surprised how much my boyfriend friends did not know about his ambitions he will talk about surface subjects and joke around with his friends but i am the one that knows his deep feelings and urge for validation as a self made man ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i am an artist creative live by my own rules and teacher nurturing patient my boyfriend is an engineer practical problem solving and entrepreneur risk taking sociable we pair well because i am interesting but soft not super aggressive and he not as manipulative as businessmen tend to be i find engineers to have good hearts because they are so rational ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i just read the article and tried to think back on my high schools alpha girls i think the article is correct in that the alpha girls are not necessarily sweet and well liked people did fear them both girls and boys boys would become betas around them and girls would fear lack of approval the alpha girls i remember were not really polite either they kind of just did what they wanted said what they wanted to say two in particular that i can think of it about ten years since i graduated high school one of them got pregnant our last year in high school then had a second child out of wedlock same father and i think eventually married has three kids now funny enough the guy who knocked her up was this bad boy looking latino guy the second one actually turned out to be pretty successful she chinese american and i was friends with her and is studying an mba she traveled the world leaving her beta boyfriend in the dust and he the biggest beta i have seen stays quiet around her because she dominating the conversation all the time she also mentions how the sex is incredibly lackluster i always found her bossy snarky a bit rude she does not really know social behaviors such as not interrupting or keeping her voice down but extremely intelligent her personality is dominant aggressive and alpha i remember in high school i do not think boys really found her all that physically attractive to me she a 5 5 her features are not elegant but since she had pretty high status and could talk her way in any situation guys felt a mix of fear and respect for her she really into the corporate rat race culture ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, the work one is a difficult balance my mother made that mindset very clear in how it works dad is working hard jobs but not making much money and we are having a hard time living she says he needs to get a better job or go back to college he goes to college and keeps working to pay the bills she says he is not home enough she she takes me and the siblings away without telling him he comes home after a hard day of kicking ass to an empty home with no note at all the thoughts that man must have had if the family just left if the family was kidnapped etc are you serious is this really what happened that awful for your father my boyfriend is a workaholic i had to be compassionate and understanding when he could not spend time with me or when he was in a bad mood because of work stress and wanted to be alone it definitely a difference between genders when i am upset i want to be near him and cuddle with him when he stressed he wants to be alone what worked for us was when he would tell me occasionally he stressed so i understand his need for space otherwise i thought he was pulling away from me and i would desperately try to win him back by cooking his favorite things and dressing up for him hoping for attention ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,this is a really quality comment something to add because it sounds like op is looking for a cool guy your standards might change when you want to settle i had some cool alpha guys before when i was younger guess what happened i was just a toy for them they were alphas that just wanted to mess around and have fun when i got older i realized i did not want this type of guy anymore i could not trust them and it was exhausting to be around them because i constantly had to be cool and hot i had to wear clothes that my parents would disapprove of it not as glamorous as you think ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,well no but just be aware of the possibility and the risks i know for a fact that nearly all intelligent and successful women i know are very manipulative and lie on some level even if they do not directly lie to you they will find a way around it to be truthful but evade the truth at the same time ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,if you are talking about the ex girlfriend from another comment regarding your ideal woman to take on the world with who was a bit more aggressive to complement you i think behaviors like cheating lying smoking comes with the same personality traits that allow a woman to be intelligent and successful and fearless my ex boyfriend was aggressive and proactive and ambitious but on the other hand he was incredibly unforgiving when i was not picture perfect i think we need to be forgiving on a certain level on certain things perhaps cheating and lying are not one of them though ,1,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig, cute face i will take over mainstream sexy face that has a bunch of flats and sharp edges i like a warm and soft look life is rough and i am a guy that fears nothing and does a lot of stressful things so having a soft and warm woman is a good complimentary that i enjoy that nice to hear i always felt uglier even though i am not ugly just because i have that cute face not a sexy sharp smoldering face and society says that look is more attractive than a cherubic face ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i will wear feminine but baggy pants to cover up any parts ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,he sounds like he adores you but maybe he also does not want the pressure of entertaining you by himself i know my boyfriend is a little like this he a workaholic he lets loose mostly with his friends but he loves having me around sometimes when we are alone we are pretty quiet because i am not one if the guys so he will take me out to eat or hang around when i am shopping this does not mean that we do not ever talk he confides in me but if every time we spent time together he was confiding in me then i would feel more like a mother or one of the boys i do understand this type of relationship dynamic i prefer it he not one of my girlfriends and i am not one of his guy friends again that being said we do spend time alone though mostly just being in the same room together but doing our own thing however your situation sounds like he eager to leave alone time to go be with his friends ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,from what you have said it sounds like enough of an incompatibility to be worried especially if you value more alone time i would not get engaged unless you are ok with this lifestyle because it wo not change i think he just wants me to be an addition to his already existing life style he does not want to change anything about it exactly has he visited you do you have your own life ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, sadly she had a few traits that made the relationship unsustainable like what ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,do you think he spending a lot of time with his friends because it keeps things new and not stuck in a comfort zone or he taking you to join his friends travels because he thinks that will be a better time to have more people every relationship is different i had a ltr that we did literally everything together grocery shopping breakfast same friends etc then i got sick of him i started getting annoyed at him because we were around each other all the time if he not willing to eat dinner with you just the two of you alone ever then yes that strange but with a lot of relationships it normal to include friends and family because then the pressure is off both of you to entertain each other if you are being insecure because you think he not valuing you think about the other way he may value you as a companion and sidekick not the sole entertainment of his life i personally do not want to have to entertain my boyfriend all the time i am pretty quiet as well ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,maybe if you are 22 a few hookups are ok and natural but we are talking about women who continue to do this until 30 and hoping they can lock down one of those hookups those are the women who typically are unsuccessful in ltrs or marriage i know plenty of women like this be careful ,4,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,invest in yourself you are absolutely right that it rare for first relationships to turn into marriage so do not put all your eggs in one basket continue with your life path that you want for yourself regardless of your current boyfriend enjoy the relationship investigate a few domestic skills discover your passions learn a lot about yourself while you are dating who knows maybe you will end up being an amazing woman in a few years and he will want to lock you down ,9,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig,not for me silly dear just out of curiosity ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, if i were to think of an alpha equivalent for rpw it would be a young attractive woman with feminine hobbies and skills and a demure personality who is able to lock down any high value male she wished this makes sense like a woman that many men would want to make her his wife and make him settle ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i agree i like online dating for this reason there so many people out there that you would not meet otherwise i never met anyone creepy or weird all the guys were sort of workaholics had hobbies that did not involve girls and were not heavy drinkers so not involved in the bar scene i also know i do well with engineer personality types so that sometimes i look for when i was dating my boyfriend likes artistic women it also something he looks for for him he was so busy working that he also could not waste so much time and money courting a ton of women anyway ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,there also the type of man who does eventually want to get married but will stay in a relationship for the time being because he getting benefits but he not really wanting to marry that specific girl then it up the the girl to make the move to leave happened to my roommate she dated a guy she really wanted to marry but he was just enjoying his life he was late 20 after four years she realized he was perfectly happy to continue to date her but she was not the one for him he had apparently talked about marriage but he never specified it would be with her it sad how a lot of women will fall into this trap men can waste more time but women cannot ,11,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,while i agree with you i am also confused because in healthy relationships should not both people be willing to help each other out i feel like there should not be any neediness games in stable relationships or maybe this guy is truly an asshole ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,the closest i could say is a mix of taoism confucianism buddhism but for me it more of a culture than an actual religion i do not go to church rather it simply a value system and a lifestyle in confucianism there is a lot of emphasis on the family and patriarchy however i am not chinese just to clarify my boyfriend was raised catholic ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,beats by dr alpha f cks only 500 550 with negging for a limited time only ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,adding to this op i think you are romanticizing being with an alpha and i also get a sense that even though you may be attractive and feminine and pleasant you still have a superiority complex you think you are better than these betas you are looking for that rush of adrenaline when a man teases you if you really feel so entitled to be the prize then be a completely outstanding hb11 otherwise eat a slice of humble pie i have also noticed a lot of dominant men do prefer a woman who can hold her own in a conversation they like stimulating conversations and witty banter there differing levels of dominance anyways my boyfriend is much more dominant than a lot of men i know but he not as dominant as my friend husband i could never keep up with him but my friend matches well with him because she also pretty dominant her husband would not pair well with a submissive quiet woman ,11,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig,i will be curious to see what happens with the relationship she been talking about wanting to get married for so long to not success now here a guy who is smitten with her and talking about marriage and she unsure she definitely does not seem so excited but i also think she running out of options she not terribly attractive either not overweight but simply average ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,there some discrepancy in your post i had 2 other boyfriends who were quite beta but they were very attracted it not that i am not attracted to beta guys it that they do not seem so attracted to me i am not sure i understand your post in general tbh you are saying your current boyfriend loves that way you look and is very sexually attracted to you yet you are also asking for advice on how to overcome some sort of whore complex ,11,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i do not think she does too but not sure if him being overly beta also ruined it it too bad because she 34 and i do not think she can be so picky ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, there should not have to be the game of not looking desperate with someone you would ltr marry that true i think in most of the marriages i know both people had the feeling of being a team together it was not really a surprise that he proposed they had been talking about it for a while wonder if he is genuinely crazy about her for who she is tho and not just having a relationship with a woman does he ee her that common for men not to and mistake things for love which are not love i understand what you are saying i think men who have not been in a lot of ltrs will mistaken this same with women actually remember how fun and oogly you were in your first relationship i do not know if he genuinely crazy about her or just lonely ,3,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig,being a single man after the age of 35 40 is typically a bad sign he has not gotten his life together financially or general responsibility or proven he worth it to be a husband father family leader provider i would say the same for women probably it not cool after a certain age to continue living the same life you did in your 20 and not grow in life ,1,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig,thanks for the post sadie i think some users might get confused because there no one size fits all hobbies or interests or careers for rpw anyway sadie likes sports i like the arts you do not have to flit around in transparent lululemon pants if you are an outdoorsy eddie bauer type chick here another way if looking at it outside a rpw context you are pissed off all the time you do not say thank you do not say please you expect people to do things for you people are afraid to come to you at your office for a question because you think they are stupid for asking you a question your best friend stopped calling you because you are so negative are you really a contributing and productive member of society by acting this way is this really you ,14,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, yeah my friend is 26 going on 27 and her boyfriend is 87 they have been together since she was 16 are you serious are they from a different culture or background i only know of one other couple with major age gap she 28 and he 56 he was this french guy who traveled the world and finally picked an african wife he could be her father but 27 and 87 that grandfather territory right there ,1,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig, work environment and work related situations no reason to bring up irrelevant things like personal views values only to cause conflict with people who feel strongly against it exactly i learned this the hard way there probably only one colleague that i feel close to personally at work but we also do not work closely together the ones i work closely together i keep my distance personally it just does not work imho ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, nope what matters most is the man and your compatibility the man personality and sense of responsibility is dependent on his character not his age wealth etc you can always tell a man by his actions this so much i have also seen single men in their mid 30 who are still manchildren i have seen men in their mid 20 who are responsible and working on their career i generally go from character not age although i am probably not going to date a guy younger than me but he does not need to be 10 years older than me ,6,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig, i am just a random interloper so it presumptuous for me to offer judgments advice but i wonder if rpw would benefit from distancing itself more from the red pill brand sure it might be interesting to rename ourselves because there seems to be a lot of confusion eg new users coming in posting about how to get an rp man or telling us they do not want to work because it unattractive we cannot really call ourselves traditional women group or the like because there too many different types of women ones who work ones who do not ones who do not want children ones who are full time sahm conservative liberal but the most important thing to take away from rpw imho is to understand female male nature and also understand how you can change things there too many stories about wives becoming fat and nagging and do not understand why their husbands are not loving anymore and continue to blame the husband when they do not realize the problem might be themselves if we can all become better girlfriends wives long term maybe men wo not think they are being tied down when they marry and instead see the benefits of marriage and having a wife ,6,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,oh for sure and i understand it easy to get confused between the rp and rpw we definitely use some of the terminology here because it easy to understand but we also tell users not to go over to rp because it basically a men locker room it can be frightening to read no matter how anti feminist or feminist you are what is nice about rpw is we can see the reality of female and male natures and try to have healthy relationships based on what we observe ,4,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig,first of all you mentioned you brought up a topic that upset him and then he retaliated with a comment on your weight this seems strange to me it like he could not stand to be upset around you so he attacked you instead what exactly did you say to him to warrant this response does he also have low self esteem secondly you are aware that you need to lose weight yes it hurts yes it feels bad for someone you love to tell you this bluntly but this is reality and you are in your power to lose that weight if you choose ,27,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig,yeah true i am sure there were loads other reasons anyway but there a rp saying that a man marries you because he still sees you as his sexy girlfriend and he hopes that you will never change into frumpy soccer mom so perhaps she was already too high in her game to realistically keep up who she was before she married ,5,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,investment banker friend story time she was woman 1 she was higher status and richer than her husband before she married she had all the benefits from her swanky job she always got vip tickets and lounge benefits and rich people circles anyways after 15 years of marriage and 10 years of sahm life the husband cheats and apparently one of the reasons was he complained she did not have her benefits like she did before so cue her desperately trying to win him back by networking with rich people again and getting free event tickets following what you said she always had to keep working to get him hooked except she was not the one to leave him ,7,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,are you familiar with dr toni grants four facets of female personality they go like this 1 courtesan lover 2 mother nurturer 3 madonna counselor 4 amazon warrior she says the most ideal relationship is being mostly a courtesan but also switching to mother and madonna for sustainability i would imagine alpha females would be mostly courtesan and amazon while beta females are mother and madonna ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,he said i like what i see even if it not the same level yeahhhhhh nope ,5,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,the wikipedia article said japanese men are more resistant to the corporate world thus without stable jobs the women are less wanting to marry these men i see this trend happening in the us too ,3,PurplePillDebate
vanBeethovenLudwig, she knew how to talk to me she used flattery in a way that i knew what she was doing but she disarmed me with it that interesting i had an ex boyfriend that came from a culture where women dress pretty sexy but somehow he said he was never attracted i did not understand why until he told me he was attracted to my brain something about being able to have fantasies together and have that connection sexual or nonsexual but to him that mental excitement was more stimulating than the visual ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i actually went on one date with a man late 30 who was divorced his ex wife was a model and a professor but she did not want children and apparently she lied to him that she did so while they were trying for a baby she was secretly taking bc pills anyways they divorced over this because he really wanted a family even though the guy told me he thought i was attractive even though i was not on the same level as his ex wife something just made me feel like he was settling i was the 7 that he settled for because he wanted a family not the 9 that he originally wanted to have the children with something about that made me feel pretty bad i did not care if he chose me in the end to have his babies but just knowing he would not have chosen me in the first place had not his model ex wife lied to him made me not pursue that relationship ,5,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,which qualities did you never consider until meeting her ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,thanks sadie for this comment sometimes i put so much pressure on myself to be the best i can be and still feel like it not good enough but somehow the way you worded it never stop working hard for your so made it sound more comforting than my frantic thinking ehehe ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, high quality guys appreciate independence and a bit of a hard to get attitude in a woman taste culture education the right hobbies and an enriched mind really matter a lot a multidimensional wife who committed to improving and never truly gets old and matronly does any other rpw feel like we are also wgtow in the same way that rp men feel like they have to hold frame never stop improving keep lifting like we also have to keep improving ourselves physically and mentally or else we become too boring for our men does not this go both ways we can never feel too comfortable in ourselves even as inherently invaluable women because of the above reasons am i just being cynical ,7,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, femininity means a sensually alive body a compassionate and loving heart and a peaceful mind when you are truly powerful and feminine you naturally encourage others to be big bold and beautiful in a way that makes them feel comfortable rather than intimidated from a rpw book cannot remember which one at the top of my head ,5,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, men sometimes do not realize what may cause a woman to feel insecure because we tend to have other types of insecurities like what insecurities tell me if this is right or wrong but this seems like it goes along with men showing they love you by providing or taking care of the whereas women think men love them if they are checking her out or flirting with her i had a similar issue with my boyfriend it just did not even occur to him that it would be something i could be insecure about in his mind all women are beautiful and secure with their looks and he acknowledges we come in different shapes sizes ethnicities so he did not understand that i wanted so badly to please him visually to me i thought he had a one size fits all and if i did not fit that then i was never good enough for him ,4,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,attraction and ltrs are a different category too my boyfriend can spend a few minutes entertaining some attractive girl at a party but he sure as hell does not want to deal with her long term it says a lot when he wants you part of his life not just a fleeting moment similarly you could say the same for porn it 10 20 minutes of fantasy then he back to reality and building a life with you not just staring at you for a few minutes of his life ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i definitely agree with the other girls about guys having a variety of tastes and being weird in general haha i had an ex boyfriend who loooooved me because i was the delicate sweet and innocent type of sexy that he just wanted to corrupt but he also admitted he loved redheads because they are aggressive passionate and a fiery kind of sexy but he does not want to corrupt them in the same way also my current boyfriend has a thing for african girls i was so insecure because i am not black but he also mentioned he prefers me for a different reason because i am not black i thought it was so strange at first i was frantically wondering why he was with me if he liked black girls so much but then i realized guys just like to look they appreciate different types of beauty and if he a genuinely good guy he knows the difference between wife material and girls he will check out he will still look but just know that you do satisfy a huge part of his sexual desires by just being you it just masculine nature to appreciate variety ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,adding to this if you really want to have finesse in social situations you can work on the following deflecting awkward situations witty lighthearted comebacks or knowing when to change the subject adding to the flow if conversation is dying down either ask questions or tell a story to pick it back up or know when to politely excuse yourself know when to stay on one subject eg someone is talking about their new puppy continue to ask about their puppy instead of talking about your own dog or something that related to you consequently know when to take the spotlight off someone if you are just grilling them questions similar to your 4 ,4,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,my boyfriend does something really funny sometimes he will buy groceries for dinner that night plop it down on the kitchen and give me a look it makes me laugh like a caveman bringing back a goat for dinner and i have to skin it ,5,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,go to a hairdresser sit down and talk about what kind of style you want ask about styling tips and purchase some products join a gym or fitness classes figure out what you want to improve about your body lose fat build muscle and get into a routine browse r xxfitness for some tips get a makeover at sephora or some other cosmetics counter learn some tips on how to do natural looks and night looks go on pinterest or browse some websites of major clothing brands figure out what kind of style you like and purchase essentials for your wardrobe also look at what outfits other women are wearing fun fact this is why women are jealous and compete with each other we check each other out and try to be better than the other appearance wise go to a dermatologist or browse r skincareaddiction for tips on how to get better skin purchase products and experiment with a routine i was frumpy from age 23 25 do not worry you have plenty of time to figure it out if you are working and out of school this is also the best time because you have money to spend ,16,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,yessssss this is what i am looking for sergeant anti exfoliation ,1,AsianBeauty
vanBeethovenLudwig,my boyfriend calls me a cute kind of sexy but even if i did try to dress hot or whatever i still could not look hot my facial features are too neotenous and delicate i do not have that sultry look at all think jessica alba in that one movie scene where she a stripper cannot remember the movie title dressed in grungy clothes she did look hot but since she got big pixie eyes there still something innocent and pure about her face i am totally not jessica alba but just an example ,3,PurplePillDebate
vanBeethovenLudwig,i am in the process of repairing my moisture barrier it day 10 and my skin is already looking more plump and even although still have some rough texture and cc i am trying really hard not to reach for any aha retinol i know i sshould wait the full month before exfoliating again can someone pleeease talk me out of it and reassure me it worth it to not exfoliate for a full month ,1,AsianBeauty
vanBeethovenLudwig,these are really wonderful points i would agree with all of them another one being low maintenance i was actually interested in this one because high smv correlates to physical appearance which then translates to being high maintenance always being fashionable wearing makeup doing your nails wearing heels but sometimes being too high maintenance can decrease your rmv high heels at formal events feminine but wearing stilettos during the day when your boyfriend takes you walking around the city high maintenance natural makeup feminine but wearing a full face of makeup plus fake eyelashes blush lipstick contouring daily high maintenance painting your nails feminine but wearing fake long nails that make you unable to cook or do anything useful high maintenance staying in shape attractive but if you are fussing because you do not have your organic protein bar when you are on a trip together high maintenance i have found most men like a girl who can relax and have fun and do things with instead of worrying about her makeup or nails every waking second of course you should not let go of yourself but there are times where you do not have to look like a perfect instagram model all the time and i have actually noticed the single women who go out in groups tend to be the high maintenance women who sit there with excessive makeup and crazy fashionable clothes sipping their drinks not talking to anybody while the girls who have boyfriends are more classically dressed and actually enjoying their time talking and having fun ,48,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig,thank you i for sure enjoy my job and would not trade it for any other career i am happy if all of my students go on to live fulfilling lives success does not always equate to achieving big things to me ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i am open to a pm conversation ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,it a cool job i am not professor level but i specialize in my subject you would be surprised the amount of people who are impressed with your knowledge and are really open to learning parents included it also just rewarding to see your students become good citizens contributing to society and enjoying life ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,thanks i get presents and cute cards with kid handwriting from my students every year anyway my smart career friends never get any presents and it the greatest joy when parents see me as a role model for their children or when my students look up to me ,4,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,it just a different kind of intelligence but my friends do not think i do anything in the scheme of the world because my work is pretty small scale and not corporate whereas they are trying to gain profits in their companies i am talking about how little johnny does not do his homework because he he on the internet and i need to figure out a way to get him to take his exams seriously ,5,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,this is true i also witnessed it i am late 20 in a ltr and i hear nothing but complaining about men from my single working female friends i go to the gym at my apartment and i see a lot of the regular guys talk to each other and go out together they definitely have a good social network women are always looking to date guys are interested too but generally i see them being perfectly content hanging out with their friends even when women hang out together conversation always shifts to men past and present my boyfriend says he never talks about women with his friends they just talk about regular things like life and hobbies and politics women are always talking about how to get a man or why her man is pissing her off etc also i noticed that whenever there is an all female apartment the roommates often do not socialize together they usually go about their lives and just share the space men who have male roommates will hang out together in the living room cook together go grocery shopping together women do not really do this i remember having to stay away from the kitchen because my roommate was bringing a guy over and we had to leave them alone so she could work her magic on him without us interfering it pretty interesting ,7,PurplePillDebate
vanBeethovenLudwig,i have a lot of career woman friends meaning ones in stem or business or medicine and i am just an artist teacher i was not smart or interested enough in other fields felt bad for the longest time because my friends are off saving the world and here i am working with children families and enjoying being domestic and being girly but being shamed for it whenever i would meet up with my smart career friends they would always be talking about their work and never ask me about my job because i work at a school and it not the same level funny thing is i am more cultured than them because i socialize with more international people and have traveled more and know more languages i became more secure in myself and my choices i never had to change anything rpw just supported me that it ok to not be a woman in those higher status fields ,17,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,awwwwwww cute ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,aw those are kind words yes the cross cultural makes it interesting does not it i do not think we will ever get bored of each other ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,that what i think when people say oh he wants a submissive girl to make him feel better but actually it more work for the man to really take the lead in egalitarian relationships the man can sometimes sit and go for the ride because the wife wants to make the decisions ,2,PurplePillDebate
vanBeethovenLudwig,really interesting english is my boyfriend second language he never been to the us did you meet him in your country ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,ok i understand now i actually think it kind of fun when men call you terms of endearment it makes me feel cute ,6,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,it goes for men pitying women too think about overweight women who cry and moan about not being able to lose weight because they are sitting on the couch and unable to get off or a depressed woman who cannot handle her emotions and feels offended and anxious at everything both men and women admire discipline in each other i do believe in status for women too no high value man wants a woman who cannot control her weight no matter how nice and pleasant she is ,7,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i would not get so offended over it i say sweetie to my students or dear to my friends some cultures call girls babe even though they are strangers and it perfectly ok ,13,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,they say men are shallow about women looks but short men have the most difficult time imho no matter how much money or status a short man has women still like the physical feeling of protection ,9,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i believe truly secure men rely on themselves for motivation discipline for example some men want to accomplish something because it will make them more attractive to women but i believe the truly motivated men are doing it for themselves not to get babes or to receive praise that for little boys i teach boys of all ages and i can tell a difference between ones doing it to please mothers and ones doing it on their own accord ,7,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,if you have never dated before it good to go on casual dates not hanging out when someone actually takes you out and just have fun with it especially at 18 have fun dressing up have fun meeting new guys discover what qualities you might like and what you might not like in a boyfriend college boys are not all that bad there are plenty of ltrs that happen in college for 1 3 years and then part ways after graduation i do not think it a bad thing because you can have a ltr experience which is important when you are really trying to find someone to settle down with it just a matter of figuring out whether the guy might see you as a plate or might see you as temporary ltr material dating is fun you learn a lot about yourself and about life ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i think it telling about the man when it the other way too for example if a man struggles with discipline and work ethic he might want a girlfriend with those qualities and it might show his true insecurity this happened to me once had ex boyfriend who dated me because i exercised regularly until i went through a bout of depression and gained 3kg he got very angry at me and i could not understand why because i knew i would eventually lose them then i found out he was angry because he was insecure about his weight everyone in his family is overweight and he was putting me on a pedestal because i was fit i think truly secure men are more forgiving because they are not using you as some sort of motivation or putting you on a pedestal ,8,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,yes i could believe that i think women think whatever makes them their smv level is not enough if it the same in a man eg if a woman goes to the gym has a master degree has a full time job and reads literature the the exact same is not good enough in a man she dating she will want a man who goes the gym just as much or is more fit has a master degree in a field better than hers has a full time job that pays more than hers reads literature but has read more books and is more knowledgeable in the subject for me it holds true i take pride in my life habits and accomplishments but i would not want to date someone with the same degree or same job or same travel experiences i have had i do want someone who has a smarter job and someone who has traveled more than me i share my department with a man we pretty much do the exact same job he older than me by four years but i have a difficult time seeing him as higher status than me because we are doing the same job especially when he does not understand how to do something and i have to explain to him how i could never date someone like that ,20,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,this is wonderful thanks for the post perfect timing for me actually i have a question if anyone can answer it how come generally women are hypergamous but men are not what is the theory behind this ,4,RedPillWives
vanBeethovenLudwig,ok i see that sounds like a real handicap my mom just sounds like a shrew haha ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i am sorry to hear about your situation it actually sounds like my father and my mother marriage so i think i can see how severe the problem can be my mother refuses to clean anymore because my father enslaved her to the house actually he pays for everything and she gets to work a flexible part time schedule and keep all her money for herself so my father does all the cleaning she still cooks dinner but she will sometimes randomly refuse to cook my father will offer to get takeout and ask her what she wants to eat and she will just be really bitchy and imagine her doing this when my dad comes home from a full day work of making six figures and providing her in his house is that similar it drives me nuts i would kill for a husband like my dad not trying to sound creepy and here is my mother just totally not appreciating what she has and insulting him and calling him evil he just sits there and takes the insult i resent her a lot for it ,6,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,may i ask how severe the illness has to be for a man to really feel like he cannot deal with it anymore everyone deals with anxiety and depression at some point in their lives ,4,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,do you think these people are complimenting you because they can sense you are insecure and want to make you feel better loosen up ,5,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,op read this comment carefully i was like you at one point totally perfectionist then when i started opening up going out with a huge zit on my face instead of hiding at home saying dumb things showing my hidden temper wearing an ugly mismatched outfit i found guys had more interest in building a long lasting relationship with me instead of just asking me out for dates we could grow together because we both had flaws and problems ,7,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i am for this i am pretty curious now ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,you are either a troll or you have some serious mental health issues you have been dealing with the same problems for six or seven years however long you have been single for with the severity of your problems and the fact that you have not been able to solve it for that long you need to seek professional help please get off the internet and running around on a hamster wheel asking the same things and receiving the same answers for over a year ,12,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,mmv rmv is your value to the other person that keeps them around long term usually you cannot get it from friends that includes qualities like loyalty support when things are not going well willingness to grow together life goals an intimate comfort together seeing each other flaws and bad moods good sex respect and admiration for each other friends can be pleasant and fun to be with hobbies are done with friends you can cook with friends and have sex with other people easily what keeps them around is knowing they will always be there for you and think the world of you no matter what happens ,13,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,is this about the guy you met on tinder who had a problem with your weight and was texting girls right in front of you you will find a more secure love if you love yourself first ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,this is really wonderful thank you i think i know how better to encourage my boyfriend now ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, her unwavering belief in him i think you are onto something my boyfriend has been struggling for a while but i noticed when i compliment him he does not really absorb it because to him his worth does not come from other people opinions it comes from what he actually accomplishes i noticed that he seems to fare better when i simply stay by his side ,5,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,ahahahaha i laughed at this i know op has a throwaway account for this dating problem but browsing through her posts she repeats the same thing over and over again exact wording in her posts and comments for a whole year she could be attractive and sweet but she running on a hamster wheel ,9,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,journaling helps me i do not do it as often anymore because too much introspection gets to my head but i like to quietly reflect on goals how to achieve them then apply the discipline to make a real change even if it something like stop journaling and go out and have a fun conversation with a real person habitbull app for checking off my exercise days wunderlist for things i would like to try out exhibitions recipes restaurants it really comes down to discipline ,6,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i understand it frustrating and i would be resentful too but the reality is the situation wo not change would you feel more comfortable with him after everything paid off or would you still have resentment that he wasted part of his money towards the ex ,4,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,if you cannot accept or learn not to resent his past choice his alimony payments you may be better off finding someone new i know it not ideal but the situation is not going to change i do not actually know much about alimony is he tied to this for the rest of his life or is there a cut off after a certain amount of years ,12,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig, even the outliers who channel their sexual energy into great academic artistic works i mean there a lot of literary examples of men in love with women fascinating womanhood talks about hugo toilets of the sea where he fascinated by two embodiments of femininity one is more childlike and fresh and the other one is more peaceful and serene it was the best book i read regarding femininity in my opinion i know my boyfriend melts when i cuddle up to him feeling small or tell him it going to be ok when he screwed something up the book is great because it does not really talk about femininity as only sex objects there spiritual and moral qualities to us too ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,just wanted to let you know my face shed like crazy this morning when i oil cleansed it was so disgusting feels great haha yesterday my face was tight and oily today i have tightness but no oil i am starting to journal about it i remember a derm in the past told me to hold off on the retinol for a month but i could not get past the flaky dry stage so i went back to retinol did not follow directions basically crossing my fingers that if i do avoid exfoliation for a month at least something more dramatic will happen to my skin ,1,AsianBeauty

vanBeethovenLudwig,ok so let say the problem might be you are too attractive but did not you mention in another comment that californian men look for a woman with a 10 in looks and a good career so they know they are not just gold diggers it does seem weird to me i am genuinely sorry you are experiencing this i do know a few voluptuous sexy women with careers that are married so it certainly possible did not michael phelps wife used to be miss california you also mentioned you are not dating men who are super handsome or wealthy maybe you should try dating a higher level status man maybe the ones you are dating already know you are out of their league so they wo not take your seriously i know la is an expensive city but do the men you are dating also make six figures like you ,4,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, sometimes it does not pay to be a quality woman unfortunately that makes no sense that does not correlate with what you wrote maybe i should have said independent woman does that make sense because that the best situation when you want to have children because i want companionship ok well that good i am sorry i cannot help more maybe it just california my friends who live in milan have a similar problem to you fashion centric lots of beautiful intelligent pleasant women who can cook everyone single ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,it not mean i am just trying to help it just seems like it a california problem then so maybe i cannot really advise maybe best bet is to talk to your married californian friends and see how they got there ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, for one thing why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free why would a guy want to propose if he already getting all the benefits of marriage guys need to chase you make yourself less desirable imo if you live with him before marriage and certainly if you do so before becoming engaged completely agree there nothing to earn or to look forward to all the benefits of marriage have fallen into his lap without him doing anything he also not given a chance to really reflect and think if this woman is marriage worthy it all just very casual in my opinion ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, i know a lot of quality women here who are single just like myself however i do know a lot of women of equal or less quality who are never ever single and also live in la here the thing if you are a quality woman you are beautiful have a great career pleasant domestic have interests and you are independent why would a man choose to be with you other than simple companionship what makes him want to take care of you restating the common issue about feminism from my other comment a lot of women just do not need men anymore even if they are a great catch i can tell you that i attract men who want to take care of me financially because i work in an industry that mostly freelance i cannot pay for a house car bills and going out expenses all by myself i simply do not make enough money in my industry i also attract men who like to show me things because all i know how to do is work errands and go back home i am not stupid but i noticed when i am with my intelligent independent girlfriends they are always the ones recommending things i have never heard of i am mostly a book worm redditor gym rat i hate going out not because i do not like to but because i do not know what to do or where to go my boyfriend enjoys taking me out because he the one with more experience he also the one recommending books and tv shows and movies and restaurants because he always out and about sometimes it does not pay to be a quality woman unfortunately ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i think this is also a common problem that rpw tries to address it not enough to just be a pleasant and attractive companion who you can share hobbies with because sure those relationships exist but who to say that he can just replace you with another woman whose pleasant and attractive and fun to be around this is why we also complain about feminism even if women are pleasant and attractive the bottom line is they can still fend for themselves and it really not necessary to have a husband anymore other than just simple companionship it difficult for both genders to find a reason to have a ltr or to be married anymore do you want children a lot of women i have met who do not want children and enjoy the single life are perfectly accepting that they just want a boyfriend and not a husband to build a family with ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, another issue could be that men only see me as a sex object since i have an exaggerated hourglass shape and a very sensual face i have modeled this could be it combined with being in la it sort of funny because men always say they want a beautiful wife but sometimes if you are too beautiful you become only a trophy wife sex object and i think la tends to have these types of hot women and for the most part those women like to be plates hence the plethora of independent lifestyles especially if men are approaching you everywhere obviously you are attractive but i find men do separate marriage worthy girls and plates even based on their looks but still i am wondering why you have not had a relationship even at the age of 29 this to me is a red flag were you career or party focused during your early mid 20 did you spend your whole life in california i do not know maybe it really is just la i have got a old high school classmate who is making his riches there and it looks like all he does is hang around the beach with really hot women do you have any friends who are married how did they meet their husbands are you vulnerable in your dating or are you only fun to be with ,4,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, men may like the idea of an extra income but end of the day they like a supportive wife ready with dinner when they come home not a wife that is working late and is tired and frustrated when she comes home i agree i do not think men have a problem with women working i think the problem is that women get stressed more easily if they have to balance full time work and a household and they tend to become bitchy and nagging i mean that why men do not like to do household work after coming home from a full day work they are tired and worn out women are the same my mother was for sure more peaceful and pleasant when she was only part time and took care of the house when she became full time and took care of the house we all avoided her because she was always in a bad mood ,12,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,well my skin looks better with the cosrx snail 92 aio cream that has cetearyl alcohol though my clogs lessened with the cosrx snail cream i can for sure still try the cetearyl alcohol free moisturizer though but it does not seem to be affecting my skin in the cosrx cream could it maybe be plant based oils the birch sap moisturizer and the moistfull collagen emulsion look like they have plant based oils i think i have used clinique ddm gel before a few years ago and it did not work for me i cannot remember the exact reason though but maybe i could try it again because i did not know much about skincare then ,1,AsianBeauty
vanBeethovenLudwig,yeah i am trying to figure it out but it difficult i had a suspicion of either butylene glycol or cetearyl alcohol because those are common acne triggers the problem when i use emulsions is that it feels like my clogs look worse i do not think it actually clogging my skin but it does make it look worse though however right now i am using cosrx snail 92 aio cream has cetearyl alcohol and cosrx snail 96 mucin power essence and benton snail bee high content essence both of which have butylene glycol my clogs do not look worse on this routine they look like they are hidden better if that makes sense cosrx snail 92 aio cream makes my skin look smoother although i do not find it as hydrating as i would like could be my skin is pretty dehydrated though when i used cosrx birch sap oil free moisturizer and etude house moistfull collagen emulsion my clogs looked worse so not sure it the emulsions light lotions or perhaps an ingredient there butylene glycol and cetearyl alcohol in both those emulsions ,1,AsianBeauty
vanBeethovenLudwig, i mean i have never had a relationship though and i do not understand why hmmmmmm at 29 this is really interesting especially if the problem is not attractiveness or personality can you think of any reason why please be honest if you would like help i have a friend who is 30 and never had a relationship and the reason is because she entitled and also very immature she very attractive and sweet and feminine in every other way though and gets dates often ,7,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig,do you have any older female friends who are married could they introduce you to their husbands bachelor friends or colleagues have any of your dating prospects insinuate they would like to have a family one day assuming you want children have you shown what you can contribute to the relationship at the beginning stages of dating it not enough to just be sweet and pretty sometimes from my friends who live in la my impression is that there are a lot of men and women who prefer the single independent life ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i am trying to repair my moisture barrier i am on day 4 of not exfoliating on day 2 and 3 i noticed my skin was more plump and less oily and smoother although my face is still slightly tight during the day and after washing however today i ran into flakiness ad rough texture it feels like my skin is more dry when i have not exfoliated for four days is this normal to become dry again if you are trying to repair your moisture barrier is my skin just freaking out trying to figure out what to do do i just have to push through until my skin reaches an equilibrium i have had tightness oily skin for years if that helps i was one of those exfoliate happy people because not exfoliating gave me bumpy dry skin ,1,SkincareAddiction
vanBeethovenLudwig, there are very powerful people out there who do not want us making strong families with strong families the men would have something to protect meaning corporations could not get away with half the shit they do because strong families form strong communities which form strong cultures and governments are you talking about the bridgen something group cannot remember but it starts with b i think who allowed women to work because it would increase tax dollars for the government and also destroy the nuclear family edit easier to control ugh i know look the serpent corporations meaning media gov t could not convince adam to bite the apple blue pill it could convince eve though you can have it all adam ate the blue pill apple because eve told him to be soft and sensitive not because he wanted to give up his masculinity eden this is pretty interesting so the government society cannot control men but women can but women are more easily controlled in general i completely agree but it interesting to think about ,2,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig,do you live in a big city are the young people mostly liberal culture and background are vital for a ltr there are men who have successful careers but just want to be a bachelor with plates and keep their money for themselves and there are men who have successful careers who want to take care of a woman children with their money my two most serious ltrs including my current one were with men who grew up in a conservative traditional town city it really depends where they are from ,9,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,has he had a serious girlfriend in the past that he did introduce to his family edit just reread your post so my understanding is he had girlfriends in the past but none of them were introduced to his family i know a lot of men who do not talk about their private lives unless the relationship is heading towards marriage it could also be his culture are you both american americans tend to introduce their girlfriends boyfriends very casually in my family culture we only introduce partners that we are seriously considering marriage with does his family live close to you or are they long distance how old is he and how old are you ,14,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig,good point i do not really know maybe it respect issue maybe lucy does not realize the reality of her life depending on barrys hardworked income maybe if lucy respected barry for what he does to contribute to the relationship because he does financially he would have better self esteem and start taking the lead again i do not know this is also a common rp problem even if a guy is a beta provider he still needs to have alpha qualities to maintain her tingles lucy has lost her tingles even though she provided with everything she wants ,1,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig, i believe it worse for children especially the young ones to be left by their mother than their father i agree with you but i also hear a lot about broken women with daddy issues because the father was not present i wonder why that is ,4,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig, from a young age girls are diligent and conscientious in schools whereas boys tend to slack off and be undisciplined oh my gosh i have a story about this i live in a country where the schools sometimes segregate the girls and boys we did a workshop once for an all girl class they were perfect angels quiet attentive respectful the next day we did the workshop for the all boys class excitement was running rampant fidgeting calling out touching things without asking the boys had absolutely no boundaries the difference was insane both groups were of ages 6 9 girls have been outperforming boys academically for 100 years you know i briefly dated a guy who came from a small village in holland he was totally unacademic he could not keep up with me intellectually but he had this raw masculinity about him he was very practical hardworking manual labor intensive he knew how to solve real world problems but he hated to read books just an example of how masculinity can manifest without being book smart or organized in an office setting and at least in the us a lot of men drop out of uni because they know they can work in manual labor or prefer real world experiences rather than academic ones this caring organising relationship work is the kind of thing that all of us here are probably experts in and is probably the most major part of the rpw philosophy but it very difficult for the colleague wife mother in this situation to stop doing the nagging pushing and organising if she does not it does not get done and both she and the man will have negative consequences i remember reading strategies for getting a man to do what he needs to do and some of them are borderline passive aggressive but perhaps it better than nagging who knows ,4,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,good point agreed ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,and it a bit of a chicken or the egg question is not it is barry irresponsible because his mother was overbearing and he knew he could rely on her direction or was the mother overbearing because barry did not have the characteristics responsibility to take care of himself ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,thank you for sharing this story it an interesting concept because although they have a traditional setup man provides resources woman runs the household he not actually leading the family being a good provider does not mean you have an assertive personality i have been curious about men and responsibility lately at my school a lot of the men are very disorganized forgetting meetings waiting for the female colleagues to tell them what to do same with my students my girls are very organized and get their work done on time my boy students need their mothers to tell them what to do and nag them into doing the work i do not see too many examples of men being disciplined on their own accord instead of waiting for a woman whether it a mother or a colleague to get their asses going keep in mind i live in an international city with nationalities from east west and everything in between so this is not culture specific i see it in all men i sort of wonder if this problem is our fault actually the trend of being too overbearing as mothers and girlfriends and wives that we have led our men to expect us to organize their lives for them my first ltr was babied by his mother and during our relationship i started noticing he could not take responsibility it made me exasperated because i did not want to be his mother and my attraction waned i did not respect him anymore my father grew up with a nurturing mother who kept the household running but in no way was she ever overbearing to my father my father is pretty responsible and takes care of his deadlines on his own whether it work or household i wonder if this is due to mothering style or perhaps my father own personality i mean sure there are absent minded women out there too ,12,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,yes i suppose that true i guess another common problem is lazy fat men cannot find a high value woman usually disciplined fit men look for disciplined fit women i do not see a disciplined fit man enjoying a fat lazy woman as a girlfriend i broke up with my first ltr because he was lazy and complained too much about failing instead of actually addressing the problem and refused to get in shape while i was going to the gym regularly ,3,PurplePillDebate
vanBeethovenLudwig,haha well sure there are certainly fat emotional lazy men but it seems like i know more women with these problems than men ,1,PurplePillDebate

vanBeethovenLudwig, you are falling into dick sand this made me lol haha if he made it a point to bring up sex on a date and then emphasized it is important to him than he is shallow it feels a little strange that a guy would want to talk about how sex is important to him usually men show by actions some of the things op wrote that the guy said on the dates sounds chadlike like just saying what she wants to hear ,5,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig,are there any moisturizers with ceramides that do not have butylene glycol or cetearyl alcohol ,1,AsianBeauty
vanBeethovenLudwig,actually this is very true masculine and feminine traits also come in different ways too for instance i have a girlfriend who was a very successful investment banker obviously you need masculine traits to achieve this level she ended marrying a man who was also a top level manager of some level both of them are pretty money and status obsessed she very physically attractive but she can be too masculine too dominant too bossy not nurturing enough not happy enough i have a single girlfriend very masculine in a lot of ways she good at solving problems she assertive she witty she also has negative masculine traits too bossy and control freak with other people but her feminine traits are the negative ones unable to control her emotions depressed unstable lack of self control with food her only positive feminine trait is she pretty nurturing and maternal she will probably never get married because of her looks i think the ideal woman has the positive traits of both sides she has self control over common female problems like food and emotions and laziness she capable but not a control freak she soft and sweet and delicate but not helpless she in tune with her emotions and appreciates sensuality but she knows when to not complain or overreact ,1,PurplePillDebate
vanBeethovenLudwig,what about honey could i do honey masks or add honey to my moisturizers ,1,AsianBeauty
vanBeethovenLudwig,can skin successfully repair its moisture barrier without the use of ceramides or hyaluronic acid i know that my skin is stripped but i also suspect my acne cc might be triggered by an ingredient to be safe my routine is just oil cleansing low ph cleanser and moisturizer for a month i am using cosrx snail 92 aio cream on half of my face no butylene glycol and cosrx snail 96 mucin power essence on the other half no cetearyl alcohol even with a simple routine my face is still slightly tight i am only on day 2 though but i just want to figure out whether my cc acne are from disrupted moisture barrier or from an ingredient however i am afraid with such a simple routine my skin wo not fully repair it moisture barrier ,2,AsianBeauty
vanBeethovenLudwig,i am with you on relationship b and i have had relationship a and c before i prefer b you actually have more independence because he not there all the time babying you or dominating you or whatever the horror of having a dominant man i feel like i have a better sense of self identity and can contribute in my own way in the relationship plus not being with him all the time does not lead to stagnation we keep things passionate this way we do not gab all the time but when we do have conversation it intense and meaningful thinking of it this is also the relationship i have with my parents i have my independent life and identity but i am still part of the family they are my retreat not my stress i could never do business projects together with my boyfriend he can do his job in the relationship and i can do mine and if i do suck at my job he can come save me like a damsel in distress because he super intelligent and experienced ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,ugh you have no idea i was too quiet and boring or at least did not like talking out loud plenty of opinions though then noticed guys were always with girls who talked their ears off thought that was what i should do so i started studying trivial topics and became a walking encyclopedia correcting people and spewing out facts then that became too condescending and serious then i started cracking jokes and being goofy and lighthearted because i am a bit goofy and noticed guys were always with girls who did not talk all the time and were just sweet and docile and totally inoffensive realized that was unattractive to be funny then i became boring and agreeable and quiet then that was too boring so i started complaining too much and becoming too opinionated my personality has changed every year sometimes i think i might be schizophrenic or multiple personalities but of course if i say this to anyone people think i am unladylike so then i stfu nowadays i cannot preach rpw to anyone even though that what i am thinking most of the time during the day applying it to daily life because then people will think i am crazy i would probably make a great jihadist not trying to offend anyone but yeah this is what happens when you are hyper self aware ,2,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig, i feel that a woman loses in sex only if she feels spiritually depleted as a result of the experience and it is in her power to control that by not only being fiercely selective with the types of men she lets touch her but also with the sexual encounter itself yes absolutely we are not in the victorian era anymore most everyone is going to have sexual experience before marriage and it a good distinguishing factor for men when they are vetting women does this woman have enough self respect and impulse control to not sleep around even though it easy for her ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i actually think it more beneficial for a woman to start looking for a partner in her mid 20 or whenever she started working people change a lot between college and the working world it the time when everything is confusing you are questioning yourself in your role as an functioning member of society we are generally too ignorant in our early 20 still for most vet vet vet go on tons of dates to see what is out there do not jump into the first relationship that might work or stay in a relationship just because you are lonely this is part of rpw taking responsibility for yourself if you are letting a a man take advantage of you whereas you might not be receiving anything in return then leave it your responsibility not to stay with a boyfriend that you are not sure about but just want to get married most importantly develop yourself as a woman hold a strong sense of self respect and security in yourself it will be much easier to weed out chads or low value men that way for me one year is a good mark of how the relationship is progressing and how i perceive my boyfriend value anything longer than that i am out ,8,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,this is true actually there a lot of men i know who would be totally happy just mulling around but when there are dependents in the picture they take their jobs role pretty seriously because most men do not want to put the financial burden on their wives ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, and now i am questioning my reaction to that statement here because rpw obviously has a very high opinion of femininity but and this is where my doubt in the previous posts springs from it associated with trp which has a very very low opinion it hard to reconcile the idea that these subs can be associated and yet have completely different stances if you see what i mean especially as there is a crossover in userbase i guess that something i will understand more over time yes i completely understand where you are getting this that why we do not advocate reading too much trp we get a lot of women in existential crises here what do you mean i cannot work i have to stay home all day and do the dishes i guess that the beauty of this sub we can be more positive and apply rpw to a modern context plus i do not think trp is as hateful of femininity as you think i think they are angry sure at the reality of sexual strategy on their end where they end up delighting in insulting women as a whole for self validation but they would not be angry if they did not like women so much there actually quite a lot of trp posts on how much they love women and specifically look for female traits such as her softness warmth happiness beauty patience nurturing domestic skills etc and plating women who are too masculine ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, what i meant was as i said if someone said he is intelligent in his own american way that would probably be considered offensive you see what i mean so it really just disagreeing about the wording again rather than us disagreeing on ideas i understand your point now but why is it offensive if someone told me i was intelligent in an american way i would take it to mean a diligent work ethic and business prowess if someone told me i was feminine in an asian way i would take it to mean a delicate grace why is this insulting why is being feminine insulting it another philosophy here that femininity is not weak or inferior to masculinity it a complement as you said so why is it insulting to be in a feminine way i am a teacher there only one other teacher in the same department a man and parents have told me we are both excellent at what we do but we have different styles i am more nurturing patient encouraging he more disciplined strict straightforward we actually have parents requesting one or the other because they would prefer a female teacher or prefer a male teacher neither of us find this insulting now i am really curious where you are from because europeans never hesitate to be politically incorrect we are generally more known to be easily offended in the states is english your first language maybe your semantics is not transferring across the ocean although i am technically living on your side of the atlantic at the moment anyways i apologize if i have been nasty welcome to rpw ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,well to each her own i suppose enjoy rpw ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, i guess what i am talking about though is more of a complementary yin and yang rather than a hierarchy i guess this is a resistance i have here i am skilled and intelligent full stop i do not need the qualifier in a feminine way likewise my partner is skilled and intelligent he does not need the qualifier in a masculine way we have different skills inside the home which i think is what you mean but i am sure you understand why this sort of phrasing can seem a little demeaning to either men or women your comments are at times contradictory you say you want a yin yang complement yet when i suggest yin yang as a feminine masculine complement because that what it is i am of an asian culture it insulting and there in itself makes me feel like you are the one demeaning woman if someone told me i was very feminine i would be proud but it seems like you are insulted if someone calls you feminine i have a very difficult time understanding what your points really are is this intended to be an insult swedish girls tend to be very intelligent and independent and from another comment you mentioned women where you live are generally pleasant and slim swedes usually have a good working knowledge of english because of early language education so perhaps i am misinterpreting your comments because english may not be your first language take it what you will i really feel like you are not giving me any benefit of the doubt here can you try to approach what i say with an open mind and assume neutrality and good intentions rather than thinking i am trying to get under your skin for the most part i just do not think your comments make sense or are in line with each other such as the example above that you want a yin yang complement but it insulting or demeaning to you to be called feminine i think this is what confuses me the most again this is a sub for women who generally believe in certain philosophies mindsets lifestyles and to advise and support each other in that same mindset what you are doing belongs in r purplepilldebate and you will definitely get more discussions from both sides here is will be more one sided for a reason maybe it validation maybe it brainwashing maybe it not healthy but the bottom line is to understand what this sub is for and direct yourself to the correct one if you would like to debate hence the name purplepilldebate and plenty of men women who start to question rp rpw start turning to r bluepill you will probably enjoy it there as well ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, i do not want a man who makes my decisions for me i can do that for myself i do not want a man who thinks i am too emotionally driven to make rational decisions or who thinks he knows better than i do or that he is more intelligent and competent than i am again i do not know where you are getting this idea from reading this sub are you reading trp a lot of what you are saying seems more male centric rp instead of actual rpw and of course it depends on what decisions obviously i do not think you are saying you do not want a man to tell you to wipe your butt or how to do your job at the office men generally do not like helpless women and we say that often here we preach that we as women need to contribute to the relationship in a feminine manner in no way does that mean we ignorantly nod yes or no to our men we have to be responsible for ourselves as women and take care of our feminine duties in the household relationship i do not think any of us is sitting on the couch waiting for our partners to tell us what to do and it often said here that quality men want a quality woman one who is skilled and intelligent in her own feminine way this sub has not had quality content in the last few weeks but you will find posts in the past regarding how to contribute as a woman i do politely think you are misunderstanding the concept of a captain i think you are thinking of it as a dominant submissive bdsm type dynamic where you just have to obey that not what it is we are capable of taking care of ourselves but big decisions need to be made together and look if your husband is relocating for a job where you wo not your own job someone is going to have to sacrifice that part of rpw is the teamwork of a marriage you are building a life together sometimes you have to give up something sometimes he has to give up something if you are not willing to drop your job to move with your husband and stick together as a team because you want to stay together however then perhaps you are not rpw we are generally family oriented here as well i am not intending to criticise any women here and i apologise if it came across that way yes we have women of left and right here old and young east and west we all have different backgrounds but it just seemed like you were criticizing women who chose to be more traditional who respect their husbands and might be sahws we are a sub that openly welcomes this lifestyle because the majority of the world frowns upon it and women come here to feel more comfortable discussing their choice that why i was rubbed the wrong way when you were questioning other people traditional choices i think if you had lurked longer you would have sensed that but we also encourage women to work and many of us do we just do not ostracize women for being traditional conservative here that the most important part yin and yang that a subject often discussed here too but yang being more strong and bright yin being more weak and dark thats why we always say men should be more dominant and strong it a yang quality leading the way as a captain does not mean he telling you to sit down and shut up and i am pretty sure you would find it sexy if you did have a problem and he helped you solve it because he more intelligent than you in a masculine way but again captain does not mean he always telling you what to do and making every single decision for you surely it okay to question and discuss our views on ideas here though r purplepilldebate are you from sweden by any chance ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,again i think you are taking all this power dynamics to an extreme and i do not quite understand why a lot of us are independent women who work and have had an education have our own bank accounts we also emphasize taking care of ourselves in rpw having your own friends interests job and not going out with your boyfriend to hang with his guy friends when you do not want to we just prefer there is a hierarchy in our relationship but that does not mean our worlds revolve around our men again to quote yourself we prefer to let men take the lead your comments are full of critiques without really understanding this sub and with an account that only four days old i recommend you get a sense of our community and our diversity of women before constantly criticizing us saying we are not healthy there plenty of traditional women here some for religious reasons and you do not see the more liberal rpw harassing them for being religious or whatever we have also got 24 7 bdsm women who submit to their partners for sexual play pleasure we welcome all different types of rpw you are in rpw feel free to take it or leave it the rest of us are here to support each other ,5,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,femininity comes in different ways whether its a demeanor spirituality physical appearance or role in the family again if it works for you to be a feminine career woman that fine we are just saying it a little more rare for this dynamic because the majority of men prefer to be the leader or the woman stops being attracted to the man because she too much in control it definitely not impossible though i have seen it happen but for the most part i will say that the husbands or boyfriends of these feminine career women tend to be a bit juvenile in some ways does not take responsibility does not have a stable job and they tend to be more like boy toys but again to each her own ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,who says our worlds are revolving around our men there a lot of rpw that work and study here and have their own friends and hobbies i do not really understand where you are getting this there a major difference between having your world revolve around a man and having your man lead which from an earlier comment you also admitted to preferring and if i remember you do not want a captain but want a man to lead you do not want to take charge but do not want a captain etc so you could at least clarify what your preference is before criticizing others and leave the rest we are a rpw sub to support each other not to criticize each other you seem to have a concept that we are all uneducated and jobless doormats in this sub ,5,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig,we always say take what you will from rpw and leave the rest this sub tends to attract more traditional women because of the man being head of the family mindset which may be more agreeable to some religious rpw or rpw of different cultures but if it not for you then ignore the rest of us i definitely believe you can be a very feminine career woman and be married it possible but perhaps more rare my boss is actually a career woman she slim attractive poised graceful intelligent and her husband is a musician that floats around she the breadwinner and he an artist it works for them but i personally could never respect a man like that i would feel like i am mothering him too much but to each her own ,7,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig,i am 28 teaching artist sounds strange but the only way i can describe it without giving away my job specifics i grew up rpw and with traditional values but spending my childhood in a liberal town in the us skewed my perspective i keep up with rpw because it the only way i can remember how to really act like a feminine woman because there nothing around me that inspiring me i also had difficulty having ltrs when i was younger because i did not know what i was supposed to be i went from being too shy too outgoing too boring too interesting too plain too intelligent too high maintenance i just did not understand relationships now i do and it helps to not be around bp men ,10,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig,here the thing regardless of getting married what if you had children would you so selfishly be unwilling to give up your independence to mother your children or build a family with a man it a lot of team work both people have to sacrifice and give up their independence when there two people in the picture especially if there offspring the man usually gives up his financial independence no living in cheap accommodation or eating shit foods his money goes to the children and the wife to an extent ,1,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig, picture this i assume you would not be impressed by a man ability to do his nails or an ability to do ballet or his ability to wear girly dresses sure they may be quirky funny etc but they def do not make you hot and bothered about him this is exactly why a lot of women who think they want a best friend as a boyfriend eventually have bad sex they think they want a boyfriend who is attached to the hip they like the same tv shows have the same hobbies they can gossip together about people then everyone surprised when the woman finds a new man who makes her impassioned i had a college girlfriend whose boyfriend would paint her nails give her massages cook for her then she could not bear to have sex with him she lost all attraction ,2,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig,there plenty of men who are not rp i would not worry so much about it but understanding some basic knowledge about rpw sexual strategy does not hurt ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,in reference to the older man younger woman i mean there different age gaps as well if i am reading correctly its seems like you are talking about a significant age gap like 8 years i agree this can be tricky i actually know a couple that a 28yo woman and a 56yo man although he kind of a crazy guy he travelled the world but i definitely observe that he does not really act his age he acts like a frat boy and i think it to keep the interest of his wife this scenario i think is an extreme example and has a lot of difficulty they are talking about having children but can you imagine being a father when you are late 50 he will be almost 80 when the child is a legal adult again age gaps vary i think 2 5 years of a man being older can reap the good benefits of him having more experience and leading without him being a stuffy old man how can anyone possibly answer those questions it all depends entirely on the people involved and does not all of rpw depend entirely on the people involved that why we have a take what you will mindset here we have women of all different nationalities and political views and cultures and ages there no one rpw philosophy for everyone here it fine if you do not want a captain first mate dynamic no one is criticizing you for it but it works for some of us and hopefully the women who choose this dynamic also understand what comes with it ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,where do you live i do not think so i think we are talking about two different things i do not want some kind of boss and secretary dynamic could you clarify then what exactly of a dynamic are you looking for if you do not want a captain but you are looking for a man to take the lead and be assertive you do not want a captain but you do not want to defer to anyone yet you do not want to make decisions it sounds confusing to me women can advise and have a soft power that does not necessarily mean they are a secretary i think you are the one demoting women more than you think do they i know very few women like this maybe this personality is more common in the states most of the women i know are slim pleasant easygoing whether they are outgoing or quiet it certainly more common in the states but i live abroad and i have seen women from uk france ireland sweden hungary belgium spain australia lebanon italy germany china malaysia like this too ,3,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig,i am sure she will mature when she gets older ,6,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, i do not want to be in charge of my partner and making the decisions i prefer a partner who is more assertive than me and i prefer him to take the lead but the idea of putting my life in his lap and deferring to him for everything yikes this to me is captain first mate dynamic it not about a man always telling you what to do big decisions involve two people a good captain will listen to his first mate consider her thoughts then take the lead using your language i do not think you really understand rpw or at least are taking it to an 18th century understanding plus with the amount of aggression and independence modern women have being submissive basically just means being pleasant it does not mean a low level of doormat nodding i make tons of jokes around my boyfriend but i am also pleasant and not ball busting this is the important difference a lot of what we refer to as feminists are also extreme examples angry women obese women ,4,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,that why i do not understand why women go there read trp and then proceed to panic about everything trp is an extreme place while there may be some truth to trp things like modern females are too entitled women expect you to love them even if they are fat but will dump you if you lose your job slutty women who ride the cc then want a beta provider last minute before they hit 35 there are people who are not like this both men and women just stop reading trp it not for you ,4,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,people who want conflicting views are welcome to go over to bluepill or purplepill that the purpose of those subs ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,well that why we turned to 3rd wave feminism right so women could make their own choices and be financially independent and not be tied down to a marriage i know it both ways i know long standing marriages where the woman is very happy she has the support of her husband but she has her own interests and independence either through part time work or business to keep her interesting and not a doormat i also know a few women married and unhappy because hey do not know what to do with themselves and they do not have any sense of independence that why i do not think it the marriage or the husband fault unless he was abusive because the wife could learn what to do with themselves that rpw right there making your own choices i do not think you can blame marriage itself or husbands themselves solely on the problems of married women a lot of the problems come from themselves ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,what would be out of your personal best interests i am just curious let just say a woman has all that she wants good career does not have to clean the house stays attractive with her own money has her independence has a man who is intelligent and provides for her and does part of the housework is that what you are referring to and how the level of respect from the woman to the man in this scenario how the sex does the man truly appreciate the woman being in his life if she has all the she wants and he just giving her his money and time this to me seems like a bp scenario ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, its just crazy to me the extent that trp relies on broad generalizations this is extreme trp to reduce everything evolutionary biology we do not condone having a job or career as a rpw woman in this sub it 2017 and we are not living on the prairie plenty of rpw reap the benefits of feminism voting working financial independence education but we are just saying not to take it to the extreme level of feminism male bashing female entitlement i think you should stop reading trp it a men space and for most women it will just heighten their anxiety ,2,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig,i think you are right about rpw being more about self awareness rather than our worlds revolving around men we do have career working women here or women with more liberal tendencies i mean i used to smoke a lot of weed my last year of college but most of it is just taking responsibility and understanding the consequences of your actions ,11,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig,i laughed because just two minutes before your comment i said the exact opposite that i get along with married women with children haha ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,ok yes i see what you are saying putting bribery aside i will do things like not talk about a certain subject or only talk about a certain subject around a girlfriend if i know she interested about those things i do know many of the men i know do not really know when something is offensive to say around other people whereas i think women are more cunning in this sense or with the example of my wrathful colleague although she quite humorous most of the time i stay away from her because i know she can get wrathful and i prefer not to be in the vicinity of women like that characteristics often rub off ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,yes i would agree to this i mean that why women wear low cut tops right to show off cleavage because they know men like it but in your comment it seemed like you were insinuating women keep mental file on other women not men for manipulation purposes ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, at least i do not have to go home after an 8 hour workday and do homework i could lay on my ass all evening if i really wanted to when i started working i understood why people would just party or watch tv or do nothing after work because they do not need to do anything else school was intensely tiring because you could always be studying or doing homework in your free time but work just get it done then you are free ,1,AskReddit
vanBeethovenLudwig,can you give an example of how a woman would use her mental file of another person for manipulation purposes ,3,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig,if you are talking about serious relationship as in one that would lead to marriage your chances are slim unless you are at a more conservative college the first two years are experimenting and the last two years are figuring out what you want to do after college most guys are not looking to settle with a serious girl at this point again unless they are more conservative that does not mean you cannot have a casual ltr and experience dating though i did not have a boyfriend until i was in grad school at 21 but even after two years of dating we could not move on to being more serious because bp ,10,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig,my goals are aesthetics and not really strength so yes it not a power lifting program ,1,xxfitness
vanBeethovenLudwig,i am doing the 6 week booty building workout by nikki blacketter i had to purchase it but it well worth it ,1,xxfitness
vanBeethovenLudwig,i am doing a 5 day lifting regimen there two days of hard glute work and supplemental glute exercises on the other days so pretty much 5 days week ,2,xxfitness
vanBeethovenLudwig,both building glute muscle has made an enormous difference as well as the hip hinging motions it takes a really long time i had a bad lower back when i was 21 because i was unathletic i went to through going to a chiropractor tons of yoga tons of long distance running but it was not until i started building glute muscle that i felt a difference i am 28 now ,2,xxfitness
vanBeethovenLudwig,see my comment above and i also read a lot of t nation regarding the posterior chain ,4,xxfitness
vanBeethovenLudwig,trust me there is i read a lot of t nation and watch youtube videos to check up on my form and glute activation just keep chipping at those cheeks and watch them transform michelangelo did not finish sculpting david in one day ,4,xxfitness
vanBeethovenLudwig,i found dumbbell romanian deadlifts regular and single leg really helped me feel the glutes hip hinge and fixing anterior pelvic tilt just practicing the hinging motion without any weights is useful as well single leg squat not bulgarian where you place the foot behind you but just placing your hands on your hips one leg bent and slowly squatting down on the other leg feeling the glute the whole time down and up i would say this is the exercise that best helped me with single glute activation kickbacks took a while to start feeling on the glutes i cannot really tell you more than that other than just doing them constantly and trying to achieve the mind muscle connection i can activate my glutes better by kicking back slightly out to the side rather than right behind me i also do them with a 2 3kg dumbbell clamped between my thigh and calves hip thrusts i started feeling easier using plates on my thighs then i went onto using the leg extension perfectly burns my glutes bulgarian split squats took some time to feel the glutes but i noticed trying to aim the glute downward and getting that side hip out basically lunging deeper activates the glutes better jump squats i found helps with the booty lift as well goblet squats with a resistance band above the knees lateral band walk hits the sides of the glutes very well remember to stay down low to feel them and think about keeping your knees out when my knees were inwards i could not feel my glutes i am currently doing a glute workout purchased from nikki blacketters website and it bomb so far my beginning program was bony to bombshell for building a foundation and i finished all four phases before starting nikki blacketters program my tips are building a general foundation first before starting to really target muscles sometimes i was even dialing down my weights just to continuing correct my muscle activation sometimes going too heavy does not let me feel my glutes also thinking that there a side glute helped me feel my whole glute ,34,xxfitness

vanBeethovenLudwig,really that pretty interesting my brother a doctor and he married a dentist she makes good money but they were together before he became a doctor i guess doctors work such crazy schedules and they tend to be cutthroat alpha people so it makes sense if they want to marry someone who makes a similar income so they do not have to entertain their wives ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,just things like having a female role in the house taking care of domestic duties him making the big decisions and me being in a supportive role again when i live with a man i am not looking for a roommate we are fulfilling husband and wife duties ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i think your thinking is like mine to me living with a man means fulfilling the role of a wife and my family also does not like me living with a man until marriage i do not want to live with a man as his roommate i want to live with him and build a family there no way of explaining this to my friends though because they think i am strange for feeling like i am disobedient to my family if i cohabited unmarried also the idea of moving in with a guy breaking up and then moving in with someone else eventually just never sat right with me i think this also inhibits the ability to pair bond as well if you are just going from boyfriend to boyfriend living together well it just the same is not it ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,same a lot of my girlfriends are blue pilled and or career women i complain about it to my boyfriend but he says i should listen and learn from them ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i am also a lone wolfette i have a few friends but i do not belong to one social group my values are reinforced by family values i think generally any young woman who does not keep up with her family is not very rpw unless the family has serious problems i have also noticed a lot of rpw do not have huge girlfriend circles most stay at home by themselves or with their boyfriend husband it a crazy world put there to face as a lone woman ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i have never lived with a boyfriend currently on my third ltr at age 28 the first two i did not have an urge to live together but my current relationship is more serious however i cannot live with him before marriage for family reasons it against my family rules my brother and his wife did not live together before marriage however they had taken several vacations together and also was long distance for a few years so stayed at each other places but they never officially shared a house together until marriage for me i am slightly nervous because virtually every one of my friends lived with their boyfriends unmarried some ended up in marriage and some ended up breaking up some ended up just continuing to live together with no plans of marriage but for me it extremely strange and borderline offensive to live with a man without him being my husband i think i have an idea of how a home life should be with a man and if he not my husband i am unable to fulfill that ,6,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig,but were these men generally middle aged i think smv is all relative a 25yo man is going to look for 18 22 a 35yo man will look for 25 30 a 45yo man will look for 30 35 etc,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,my boyfriend actually said the other day that his friend girlfriend 34yo looked old she actually kept herself up but he said it was mostly because she cakes on makeup and dresses too young so she just looks like a clown i think too much makeup when you are middle aged makes you look older even though women wear it to look younger ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,oh for sure a 40yo may never be able to meet a man to start a family but my point is that if a woman marries when she young and ages gracefully and elegantly her husband has no need to find a younger woman to have an affair with if he not fulfilled in the marriage ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i feel like it takes a very dominant and masculine man to lead the way if you notice in couples that have the women wearing the pants the man does not have to do much just follow along and provide for her but with very feminine or submissive women the man actually has to step up and take initiative so when feminists say that men want submissive women to make them feel better i do not believe that it takes more work to be with a submissive woman it more tiring for the man it much easier to be with a dominant woman ,2,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig,all women are like this that that there no such thing as a perfect woman because we all have inherent female nature including entitlement which comes with complaining or whining ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,yes that exactly how i treat my boyfriend lots of kisses and being sweet and it sooooooo sexy to me when i see my boyfriend putting out even more authority because of it a lot of it transfers to the bedroom for us it a perfect dynamic and i am very fortunate to meet someone like him i require a man to accept this kind of behavior for my relationship to be successful and i remember a lot of bp men i dated thought it was strange i would act this way they wanted a woman who was more prissy polite and high and mighty but i love being cute to men it my favorite i dislike whining and complaining to train my wife and daughter to never do that whenever either did that i simple walked away or tuned out explained gently why funny enough my boyfriend does the same thing i do not whine so much but awalt and when it happens he does not take my shit and i am glad he does not ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,there actually a phrase in my home country that literally translates to act coquettish like a spoiled child and many of the girls use it to get what they want usually small things like wanting him to take you out or begging for a kiss or just some attention i do it to my father and my boyfriend and it just a cuter way of acting rather than being overly polite and or monotonous my boyfriend loves it and he knows i am being a bit sassy and playful on purpose ,5,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i have seen some 40yo women who are more attractive than 25yo not just because they have taken care of their beauty but they have this extremely attractive maturity about them imagine a woman that can joke and laugh with you is responsible not whining is supportive secure in herself maternal happy and healthy i am only 28 but i have noticed there a lot of insecurity and entitlement in young women in their 20 i have been a culprit as well because they are competitive and bitchy it really decreases their attractiveness even if they are firm and nubile and a lot of women who are starting to work actually try harder to act more grown up and prissy and i have seen older women actually act more uninhibited and childlike plus when you are mid 30 or early 40 you have money and finer tastes to dress more elegant as well not the trashy stuff 20 year olds wear ,10,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,the only aspect that really spoke to me was how he talked about men having focus how biological this focus is and how it applies to men working i do not regret being educated but when i was in college i did feel an unnecessary amount of pressure to find a good paying job when i am not intelligent in any good paying industries i wished that i had not been so depressed about my career in my early 20 and just enjoyed my life instead i do not know about other women that may be more intelligent perhaps in stem or business or finance but i personally feel my intellect only goes so high i cannot read a textbook or an academic article for too long before i start zoning out my skills are in the social nurturing and artistic areas you do not need focus for this you just need to be a nice person ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i always took rpw to be first personal growth before relationships personal growth including maximizing your own attractiveness developing a worthy character and pleasant personality developing skills that allow you to deal with the world in a feminine way instead of a masculine way i find all of these to be first and foremost being a lady before addressing relationships and i strongly believe that a relationship will not be successful unless a woman has done some self improvement and self exploration ,6,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig, i think part of the issue here is that men do not know what these things cost exactly my boyfriend spends bare bones minimum on his toiletries generic brand shampoo etc i spend more on good quality skincare because the cheap brands are horrible and skin is important to me but he does not really understand my routine and the cost of these items i do not buy high end but if you have several products that are mid range price 15 25 a bottle that adds up or my bobbi brown eyebrow pencil sure it lasts me a year so i am getting good roi but it still 40 but he does not understand the cheap pencils do not stay put or barely draw a line on my skin ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,not married yet but this was my parent set up my father is an engineer and was the breadwinner the house cars bills health insurance college tuition all came from him my mother is a freelance arts teacher her job allowed flexible hours but was hourly pay my mother used her money to buy groceries clothes for the children and any additional school fees activities etc she also used her money to purchase clothes and makeup for herself so she did not have to ask my father for money if she wanted to go shopping my father also used his own money for personal purchases although he does not spend that much but usually his purchases mean a nicer tv a nicer fridge renovating the bathroom etc so things that everybody could use i personally think it a pretty good set up because my mother basically just earned the extra cash while my father provided the base living standard that way she was able to take care of the children and domestic duties as well my father salary is about 4x my mother they have separate bank accounts ,11,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig,here my take on incorporating rpw in the workplace work is work you have to get a job done and you need to address problems you cannot be helpless and rely on other people you need to make decisions you need to be able to discuss problems with your boss as a good employee your boss values your opinion however you can be feminine in your demeanor you can disagree politely and gracefully with a colleague during a meeting you can be cheerful when you chat with colleagues at the water cooler you can dress attractively when you go home take down work mode and enjoy laugh live be a little baby girl or nurturer for your boyfriend it all about switching personas ,4,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig,what is your career just out of curiosity ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,you are absolutely right and the fact that my friend was able to reach up to the level she did as an investment banker just tells you something about her personality i mean she not just a career woman but she was the top of an extremely cutthroat industry even sometimes i cannot follow her because all she talks about is her rich people circle and financial projects it totally beyond me and just by talking to her you can tell immediately she of another class level not just the 100k year level but the 500k year perhaps even more with their combined incomes again i cannot keep up with her sometimes she so cold and calculating that i cannot ask her about relationship problems because the way she analyzes it is so pessimistic and negative i just found i am much happier being an average woman and not one of high intelligence and prowess men if trained right are your natural born killers so when we have to deal with the very real harshness that comes with having a career we deal with it we shut up put our eyes to the ground and our nose to grind stone that sorta just how we are built you know cold calculating machine types lol yeah totally this it puts it in perspective the type of jobs men have though most women who have jobs have safe jobs they are not out there basically manipulating the world as a global playing field you know ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,she amazing and she uses the money very wisely too she splurged before and traveled herself around the world and also she paid for part of my brother med school tuition it just funny to see her eat at dingy dive restaurants because she claims just because a restaurant is expensive and fancy does not mean it actually good food if you think about it how many expensive things can you own it does not make a difference after a certain amount her spiel is that having money does not mean you need to spend it recklessly it just means you do not have to worry about it ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,my father family had this old money value my grandmother is rich but if you went to her apartment you could not tell she still covers the blender with aluminum foil because the lid is broken but she could just buy a new one anyways the philosophy is that you should spend money for comfort and quality but in reality you do not need that much quantity she has good quality clothes but she does not have an overflowing closet i did remember my friend saying her husband family disliked her because she was always showing off her wealth when they went back to his parents house not just clothes but she would talk about all her swanky business trips and vacations i mean what else could she talk about though that was her life ,5,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, the reality is that i am not interested in a life like that because it comes at far too high a cost beyond dollars and cents i have a girlfriend who is extremely rich she worked in investment banking and her husband is the general manager of a major hotel chain he drives a porsche and she has luxury italian clothes and a private chauffeur their family goes to the four seasons for brunch after church every weekend anyways it just interesting to observe their lifestyle because they have crazy money but then her husband had an affair and she left feeling incredibly depressed and worthless she feels like it part of her self worth to be posh and swanky because she was an extremely successful businesswoman before she decided to be a sahm so she left chasing this high status life for herself and she considered divorce with her husband because of affair but she admitted she probably could not remarry because she too rich and she would only marry a man who was just as rich it gets high maintenance when you live that kind of fast lifestyle i am grew up with money but my parents emphasized humility and gratitude and thinking about other people i feel like my friend lacks so much gratitude she just never satisfied it a slippery slope to be rich ,10,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,a reason women are materialistic is because materials make us look more attractive if men are looking at women wearing sexy clothing then we also feel compelled to go out and purchase sexy clothing to keep him interested fashion and beauty costs money if men expect women to be attractive they should expect it to come with a cost ,28,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,ok so my understanding is he asked you to choose between purchasing a new ring gold digger and the family heirloom frugal that just seems strange like he setting you up if he wanted to test you he would have just given you the free family heirloom and let you either accept it or reject it it definitely is tricky though i will save up for something for myself but it different to ask someone else to save up for you right now whenever my boyfriend takes me out in which he pays he chooses where we go because he spending the money but he never bought anything for me such as clothing or makeup i think it important to accept what he offers you and definitely do not ask for more or an upgrade just graciously accept it that why i think it strange the ex boyfriend asked you to choose usually when men ask you to choose he prepared to give you either choice not use it for a shit test good for you for not marrying him ,5,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,yeah i mean definitely not all women will turn into catty bitches just by staying home but it certainly more easy to if you are already predisposed to that type of attitude imagine being able to rant all the time because you are always with family and you can always be honest around them then you are just used to treating people that way ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,hmmmm interesting discussion topic i think it good to discuss this especially now that women work they have their own money to spend and thus can make their own preferences on purchases i am curious why did he peg you as a shallow materialist because he asked you to choose from two engagement rings ,5,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, perhaps the causation is women confining themselves to female company this could be it i mean think about your closest girlfriends if you are comfortable with each other you can let go of yourself and rant about anything without being judged because you trust each other i do not really spend that much time catching up with girlfriends anymore because when we talk it just updating our lives gossip and ranting and i do not really feel like gossiping or ranting most of the time but then there is not really much to talk about when we meet otherwise i mean i can talk about the books i am reading or my exercise regimen but you can only talk so much about your hobbies talking is tiring haha ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,there was a comment in a past thread where someone said sahms tend to be drama queens because without being in the workplace and only staying at home they are not truly dealing with the real world home is a safe haven where they can be nasty or entitled to their family but it acceptable because they are running the household when women have jobs they learn accountability courtesy and how to deal with work politics i noticed this in my mother she worked part time at home and part time at a private school she got fired from the private school job so now she just works from home she starting to be a lot less polite and respectful to other people and more self absorbed she also does not have a friend circle so she pretty much only around family ,4,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig, i am awed by your awareness and ability to act on it thanks this awareness did not happen until i was late 20 though because early 20 i just wanted to be validated by guys i think the more sense of self worth you have and the stronger your moral code the easier it is to turn away men who are just trying to get into your pants ,3,RedPillWives
vanBeethovenLudwig,my 34yo roommate also had bad luck dating because she does not know how to cook and sleeps with them early until she saw me cooking for my boyfriend and observed how i treated him guess what for her next boyfriend she decided to start cooking for him although she stopped already 2 months in and they are still dating instead her being pumped and dumped she could always see how i had a good relationship and would ask me little things about mine and i would give her subtle hints in a cheerful chirpy voice like what are you doing for his birthday i am making his favorite cake you are so good at cooking for your boyfriend aww thanks i like to take care of my loved ones you are so lucky to find such a great guy yeah we are both pretty family oriented so we are a good match he just does not understand i want to advance my career wow i am happy you feel so empowered and independent most of the time i just feel sorry for how ignorant they are and unable to make good decisions or at least are unable to see outside themselves ,16,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, you cannot treat kids like mini adults the authority of parents has been so undermined and everything is child abuse i hear a lot of complaints from mothers that say children are increasingly younger and trying to negotiate at least in my generation negotiating might happen around teenage years but she has a daughter that 8 and already starting to negotiate and apparently her peers also do the same it a bit frightening actually i also wonder if it due to parents trying to befriend their own children i struggled with this with my mother she wanted to be like sisters and talk about shopping and makeup but then i would dispose of her authority often because i did not see her as an authority figure anymore ,2,RedPillWives
vanBeethovenLudwig, i could not stand the crudeness and rudeness of men of my generation i just have a really funny story about men our generation i am late 20 i went on a date with someone a year older and i put my best girl game flirted made him feel like a man looked hot because i also wanted to test him and his morals anyways after the date he asked if i wanted to go back to his place which i politely declined then after dropping me off he asked if he should come upstairs which i also politely declined so i leave him hanging and he texts me saying he crazy about me and how i cannot do this to him blahblahblah why do not i want to see him then i start texting him about going to church and family values and how i do not feel the right intentions with him and so cue him trying to court me properly but i have totally lost interest in him because he shown me he not a family man in the first place or at least did not consider me seriously if he wanted to bed me the first date if you are a woman with any sense of morals or conservative family upbringing it so easy to scoff at how men court women nowadays ,5,RedPillWives
vanBeethovenLudwig,a healthy relationship is two way both parties should be attracted to each other if you were unattracted to your man but chose to be with him for money and power you are a gold digger and i guarantee you without that attraction you wo not want to continue the bedroom activities he does not have to be brad pitt but you should be attracted to him overall ,31,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, if my girlfriend gets that retardo gooey mode where she giggly and singing goofy songs and sorta drooling on me you just described my relationship with my boyfriend as well haha i just realized all the loquacious women i know who are married have these beta husbands that just nod yes dear and stay quiet i feel a bit bad for them ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i just thought about this some more women with rbf absolutely require a dominant man to lead the conversation or activities i am just thinking about the number of women who talk and jabber and moan about things non stop more often than not they are the ones dominating the dynamic the man has to just sit there and let her words go through one ear and out the other or the man has to obey her wishes or complaints rbf women who are more controlled in their speech or manner need someone else to do the prodding or initiating ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,same here the single women i know they have either stopped dating completely or are feebly dating making friends or having casual sex translation it just seems more and more difficult to get married if you are older not because of looks but because these women have already built up a whole life for themselves social gatherings weekend trips etc it would be very difficult to give that up especially if you are mid 30 and have been used to that single lifestyle for probably almost a decade they would have to find a pretty high smv man to give up that independent lifestyle where you are free to spend the money that you have and do not have to answer to anyone ,4,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig,it seems tricky to date when you are a single woman who financially stable and uninterested in marriage most relationships go through the stages of courtship then commitment then building a life together but if marriage is not in the works is not dating just friendship sex i just feel like it easy to date and have companionship and sex but how long would this last before both people get bored long term commitments happen because both parties care about each other dating is just surface level ,5,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i have never heard of kate what is she famous for a major journalist ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, she was not sure why anyone would get married unless they were poor or intended to raise children i agree with this but i think it for extremely independent women who can make their own decisions i am financially stable but i still like someone to teach me about life because i am a little wary of doing certain things by myself i think it for the dynamic i prefer to submit to someone and it a spirituality for me growing up i always did everything with family but if someone is not family oriented then i can understand they are fine with just friends and parents siblings marriage is just a contract it just insurance of course you can have that same companionship without the contract but for us old souls i think it beautiful to call someone my husband and to be someone wife ,3,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig,are there other products similar to cosrx bha except it with mandelic acid i seem to only find mandelic acid in cleansers or toners ,1,AsianBeauty
vanBeethovenLudwig,hmmmm i do wonder if i might be sensitive to bha itself not the potency it always stings my face becomes red and i am extra extra oily the next day sounds dumb but i thought i just had to use it less so i went to once a week what percentage bha is the cosrx could i try a less potent bha to rule out if it the ingredient or the potency aha works for me well no side effects but i am just concerned because i am looking for something to keep my pores clean deep underneath instead of just sloughing off surface cells ,1,AsianBeauty
vanBeethovenLudwig,cosrx bha gives me some stinging when i apply it i only use 1x week it gets my pores really clean so it would be a shame to discontinue is there anyway to dilute it should i mix it with a moisturizer ,1,AsianBeauty

vanBeethovenLudwig,that very fascinating to know and understand i am glad to hear it because i have rbf and i feel like sometimes it off putting but just like you mentioned i generally have higher esteem and tend to think before i speak and i feel fake if i am trying to put on a crazy face or jabber nonsense if i am genuinely thinking about something the 1000 cock stare i still do not understand what this exactly is care to explain my job as a man in a relationship is to give such a woman respite from decisions and responsibilities when she with me so the woman who earned her rbf tends to become the goofy teenager when she dating a guy like me i think i just fell in love with you for a quick second i am like this with my boyfriend i can just let go and be his little baby girl when i am with him instead of trying to act poised or solve the problem or discipline people i am a teacher ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i forget which book it was but one of the rpw books talked about masculine and feminine energy and how as a woman we do not necessarily have to be the feminine energy but if we choose to be the masculine energy then we need to find a feminine energy man to complement which does not necessarily sound as horrible because feminine energy men typically are artists or musicians or academics or low key men i once knew a high powered businesswoman whose boyfriend was definitely the feminine energy he could relax and make jokes and enjoy life where she was the one who was ball busting daily and they were both fine with their roles anyway most of us do not prefer to be the masculine energy but it happens and it could work ,3,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig,sure definitely pm me i politely disagree that i have problems being submissive actually i grew up too submissive and american culture told me i should not be as an asian female so i think the trouble lay in not understanding there a difference between being confident and being aggressive does that make sense my problem was i was too shy and quiet and too unsure of myself which leads to low self esteem so i spent a few years trying to be independent and aggressive because all the white feminists told me i should be this way i have reverted back to my original asian culture and i do not befriend white women anymore i only spend time with asian females that grew up in asia or spend my time alone and because i have native english it very easy to be sucked into white female sjw culture i have to actively distance myself always even being around my boyfriend family his younger brother girlfriend is extremely talkative and also has slight sjw tendencies i feel insecure because then i feel like i am supposed to gab and complain about everything just like she does but compared to most women i do not complain because i am so complacent and accepting so then i am insecure that i am not complaining about things but i think you are absolutely correct there a difference between whining and talking though and i have been doing more whining when i am in a bad mood again i am not usually like this but because of moodiness i can be difficult sometimes i have been a lot better the last few days with my boyfriend which lifts my mood that i am able control my emotions hamstering ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, what my so imagined when he was ready for a relationship nothing really he just wanted to find the other half of his two person team to create a team that was so unstoppable that they could handle anything that was thrown at them my gosh you just opened my eyes to a whole new perspective my boyfriend is a very logical thinker and this makes sense why he chose me as a girlfriend not just personalities and roles but for example he had a girlfriend that came from an extremely poor family and they came running to him for money to provide for her five other siblings he said it was a problem because he could not make enough money to provide for her and her parents and her siblings he never mentioned this but i am pretty sure he logically thinks a relationship with me fits because my parents are well off and do not need to rely on my boyfriend if we got married basically i would just go to him as a wife and i am also educated enough to make some extra cash part time if needed it just a good match logistically as well he also often mentioned having a good match in all relationship areas some people are good for sex but not good for relationships some people are good companions but there no chemistry or lack of adaptability or reception ,5,RedPillWives
vanBeethovenLudwig, battering yourself wo not help it just get you even more tired on top of how you already feel you need to understand that your brain has a reason to do that it screams in your face that there is an issue yeah i think this is the underlying issue i realize i can act this way and whenever i do i am apologetic to my boyfriend i think i am being rpw by being modest and realizing my mistakes but i think it getting to a point where it becoming self deprecating and that where my boyfriend is starting to have issues he will say things like i do not like it when you put yourself down when i argue with him then apologize for being a spoiled princess look there is probably some stuff in your past that just fires up and makes you feel that way no matter what happens it can be fixed and it will change your life and his life too btw this thing is there taking your life time and energy yeah it comes from my childhood and having a perfectionist mother and being an artist we tend to have self hatred which eventually manifests in success because we have worked so hard to become better haha plus it might be remnants leftover from the rpw anger phase eg if i get fat if i dress plainly if i argue etc it puts me in a risky position to be dumped i feel pressure to be perfect or else i am unattractive a lot of it is perfectionist pressure so the moral of the story is improve yourself but stfu about it and look on the positive side i suppose but i think i naturally act this way apologetic and self critical because i feel more vulnerable and protected it very strange i have been through very confident phases of my life and guess what the result was i felt like i could take on the world and not need a man it a double edged sword i am less submissive when i am confident and secure in myself and he does not seem so dominant anymore ,1,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig,i used to be a little overweight but i have gotten in pretty good shape the past year so i think that why i am extra self conscious because for the first time i actually feel attractive i also have a good paying job for the first time and have money to spend on clothes again now i am extra self conscious of how i dress because i can actually afford things and make good style decisions i think that where the pressure comes from also he comes from a culture where a lot of women are very dressed up more pressure he used to looking at pretty women and they are everywhere where he lives i think these three reasons made me really critical of myself lately although the interesting thing is that he not friends with any of those so called dressed up pretty women like his friends circle has a sporty and hipster style not posh with stilettos ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,actually i have read that book it been a while though so maybe i should re read it regarding being silent with my boyfriend i know he loves me for my tranquility and serenity i think i am just insecure because whenever he with friends male or female he very talkative and he just seems to enjoy their extroversion like i stayed at his family home for a few days and his brother girlfriend is a very talkative girl and she basically leads the conversation at the whole table but i am not like that so then when we were eating by ourselves it seemed so quiet especially after being with the brother and the girlfriend for a few days so then i felt like i was boring does that make sense anyways i think i just have to remember why he likes me for me he always tells me i am his battery charger and how i am so easygoing and pleasant so i know i should not feel pressure to be entertaining ,1,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig,i am really happy to hear this because i was also someone who was a bit emotionally troubled in my teens and early 20 i practice mindfulness to keep my thoughts and feelings in check and most importantly i keep from feeling sorry for myself when things are not going well and do not burden my husband with my very occasional dour moods and anxieties unless something is truly wrong it almost never is i also practice mindfulness and being rational and objective but still sometimes my emotions can be so strong they trump my logic and i can blow up suddenly have you ever struggled with this how do you deal with it my husband is fully aware of my past mental health struggles a family member most helpfully warned him when we started dating i had already discussed it with him so it was not news and finds it hard to imagine me in that frame because i am in his words the most emotionally balanced woman he ever met that really great my boyfriend also knows i used to be severely depressed but he tells me i am very stable now i do not feel stable sometimes though when i am being a little crazy but the good thing is i acknowledge it and apologize and my boyfriend just does not let it go on if i start bickering with him he will just stop answering ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, could there be a lack of connections nobody likes people complaining sadly because by complaining they do not solve anything but still keep doing that what about you working in this issue maybe if you get a better connection you will help him and then when you have more confidence in a relationship breasts will stop matter the more i think about it the more i think it my own problem insecurity moodiness because he shows me he cares in virtually every way i think i am just being a princess and i want someone to worship me like even more than he does currently but if i think carefully if he worships me to a disgusting degree i know i will be turned off because then he will be a beta i know this because i have dated some betas worshippers before i think it just my lack of maturity and lack of control on emotions he never complains to me about me and always tells me i am the best ever ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,for me i view weed the same way as alcohol it a recreational substance that can be used moderately without any problem it when it becomes a dependence or addiction then it a huge red flag i say this because i used to smoke some occasional weed so i realize it not as horrible as some people may think however i have also seen some people become total potheads and that a problem same goes for alcohol plenty people have a drink at dinner or just on the weekends it not a red flag unless they get black out drunk ,5,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,the reality is that most attractive young women that were raised in good households do not sleep around because they do not realize their own attractiveness at that age at least that was how it was with my friends and i i felt extremely awkward and prude in college when i went to parties i did not really know how to talk to boys but i got asked out on dates often which would fizzle out after one or two dates so apparently i was attractive to some standard i think sleeping around for some girls is not as common as it sounds although i am not denying i do have some slutty friends ,9,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig,thank you i am getting better at controlling my moods and anxieties you are so wonderful and supportive lucky to have you here xx,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,yeah but also this does not happen that often so that why i think it just me overreacting most of the time he just glances at someone else for one second but it rare if he gushing his opinion to me ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,listening to music is a good idea i should do more of that i always listen to music at the gym and it lifts my mood up thanks for the reminder it also been difficult socially for me i have a few girlfriends but there difficulty with some of them one of them is going through her husband affair so she always just wants to talk about it another friend is kind of a sjw feminist so i do not like to spend that much time with her another friend is jealous of me because i have a boyfriend and she does not and she always trying to one up me i do have a few friends who are just good to hang out with read not talk about problems and just enjoy so i will try to hang out more with them ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i would also like to hear some other thoughts too maybe from some of the men i have a feeling that he thinks that i am so beautiful that it would not hurt my feelings if he looks at another woman does that make sense if you were jessica alba boyfriend and she caught him looking at some girl on the street would that make her feel bad probably not because she jessica alba and her boyfriend is damn lucky to take her home with him i think that my boyfriend logic ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i think it a combination of me picking up on what he talks about and also my own self confidence for example we were watching some silly tv show the other day there was a colombian women prancing around in a bikini and she had the firmest body and perfect breasts anyways my boyfriend perked up and was staring at the screen saying gosh what a crazy body and looking at me and laughing it obviously made me really insecure because i feel like he does not gawk at me the way he gawks at supermodels and i would like him to so here i am trying to impress him or get his attention but on the other hand i do realize that all men look and looking does not mean he wants to have a relationship with them looking at other women is very superficial it occurs for a few seconds and then it over he not trying to ask for their number he not taking them home i am the one he chooses to take home and no one can hide from beautiful women they are everywhere i also know that there a superficial beauty physical and an inner beauty peaceful and for him he puts more emphasis on inner beauty because he dated some very beautiful women before but told me there was no chemistry with them so i do know he not just a phallus centric buffoon but i just cannot help feeling bad when he gawks at other women because he not doing it to me i feel like if he gave me the same amount of attention i would not feel so low about myself also he pretty physically perfect he tall muscular but lean has good skin handsome face he definitely a lot better looking than me so then sometimes i am also insecure why he dating me i am not ugly but i can honestly say i am 2 3 points lower than him on the scale i guess i just wish he would pedestalize my physical beauty too but i think i am asking for too much ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,actually i live in a sunny country but i do not go out into the sun very often i have been trying to take more walks during the day during work i think it helping i might take some vitamin d as well i think part of the problem is i do not socialize so much outside of work because i am a teacher so my job is very social and that when i start getting into my head i have been making pretty good efforts to go to the gym though so that good and trying to read a book i notice if i cannot sit down and read a book my head is not in the right place thank you again for your caring thoughts xx,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,thanks it helpful to know i am not alone i think i need to stop looking in the mirror so much especially in bad lighting ugh haha and i am really glad i can talk to women who wo not tell me my boyfriend being mean or lame i do realize i should try to be more trusting and innocent so i am trying to get out of my head more i think sometimes i feel bombarded with too much stimulation that i enjoy being alone and quiet but then i am anxious that i am coming off as aloof just an example of another anxiety the good thing is i know this is not the real me it just a cloud of depression hovering over me i know i am a better woman than this it just a funk i need to get out of ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,aaaah ok i understand now that makes a lot more sense in terms of my natural beauty i know he thinks i am beautiful but then i am also insecure about clothing he comes from a culture of fashion and sophistication and he pretty judgmental on women dress ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,hmm yes that interesting i have not asked my boyfriend specifically about it but i have a feeling if i did ask him to make decisions for me he would tell me i am being insecure for me i would not mind if he did but knowing him i do not think he would like it which might sound strange ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,hmmmm that a good idea i think i did lose sight of my mission i think the only long term mission i have is to have a family of my own someday also my boyfriend and i have talked about building an orphanage in africa where we both used to live that one is very long term of course i have got some short term missions though a new project regarding arab music living in an arab country right now and trying to apply for an opera festival in southern europe and weightlifting working on a booty building routine i think part of the problem is i live in a utopia where the culture is built on consumerism and hedonism and i have really lost sight of reality and it strange because i have everything and can literally do anything i want but i cannot put myself to it it a common problem in my country depression and laziness i think that did help a bit perhaps i should write a goal list tonight thank you dear xx,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i do not know i feel like i am great at self improvement but it gets to the point where i can be too perfectionist lately i have been picking at my appearance not just controllable factors like weight but even my eye shape and nose shape and skin etc i know my boyfriend thinks i am beautiful and he tells me that but i feel really ugly all the time i keep telling myself ok so what happens if i do have the beauty that i want what changes not really anything because i already have an amazing boyfriend who likes me for me and a good job with a good salary and little responsibilities and lots of freedom nothing would change if i suddenly woke up looking like eva mendes i have everything already i think i am just going through some depression i am trying really hard to snap out of it but it seems to be really difficult and i have had a long history of depression as well ,4,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,have you ever considered moving to the netherlands everyone is extremely tall there all jokes aside it perfectly possible to have a relationship as a tall woman i know a very tall and voluptuous woman who had a short boyfriend but he 15 years older and makes her feel like a little girl because of his maturity and his frame it not impossible ,5,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i find bubbly talkative men a huge turnoff my guy is one of those unless i have something meaningful to say i do not say anything i have also noticed american men trying to be more talkative like women because men are bp and conditioned to be more effeminate because of feminism i really hate it when guys have a valley sorority girl accent or if i say something really emotionally and they imitate a feminine way of speaking because they do not know how to be men it the worst ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i woke up a bit depressed and after reading this i laughed so hard thanks for the smiles ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, give me the mysterious introvert any and every day of the week i find they come across much more naturally alpha which i am unashamedly attracted to my boyfriend is like this i am extremely attracted to this type they do not talk often but they are always full of surprises because they are off developing themselves while all the extroverts are trying to be fun loving ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i for sure have a type my current boyfriend is the combination of my first two ltrs first ltr was a musician loved to socialize hang out relax enjoyed life however he was lazy and entitled and unwilling to take what life could offer he was totally fine just playing music and hanging out he was very extroverted but to the point of being a frat bro like trying to drink too much etc second ltr was an engineer very intelligent logical and practical hardworking honest fit ambitious however he was anti social and overly critical and pessimistic and also did not like music his favorite artist was weird al he was quiet and introverted my only critique of the first two was that neither wanted to travel outside the us they had this american arrogance that the us was the best country in the world and i strongly disagreed with them and in turn i felt they lacked intelligence current boyfriend has all the positive traits of both ltrs and he loves to travel he quiet and introverted but he likes to socialize he just not the one doing all the talking but he enjoys being with people i would say i lucked out with him never want to let him go i have also never been attracted to blonde men light brown or dark brown or black hair for me ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,there is definitely merit to them i hear you loud and clear if the issue is enough that you cannot see past it and you start to question him or stop respecting trust him then yes i think you should end it but i also think part of the issue is due to age and life experience it sounds like you and your boyfriend are the same age neither of you have experienced much of life if you are about to graduate college it just depends on you my instinct is you really do want someone different you are young so i would not worry too much about it but dating after college can be a real hassle ,3,RedPillWives
vanBeethovenLudwig,and that perfectly understandable for almost all rpw we also prefer someone more intelligent than us but the fact that you are unsure about his decision to invest his money in the family business along with the fact that you grew up with a father that provided well tells me you think you can make better decisions than him does that make sense if you are questioning his decisions it a respect issue either learn to respect his decision making or leave because it does not feel like you are putting your trust in him ,5,RedPillWives
vanBeethovenLudwig, if i am working as an engineer and he is taking the easy way out i would resent him i want someone who will work towards something look at it this way a lot of people want to find an easy way to make money so that the bills can be taken care of and then he can do whatever he wants with the rest of his life if you realized how many people are slaves to their job but stay purely for money you will understand why they do not have time to do what they want to do hobbies ambitions traveling etc this sounds like a smart man to me actually however it different if he invests his money so he does not have to work and ends up relaxing by the pool everyday if he still does try to do something productive with his life without having to worry about money that tells me he thinking long term also you keep mentioning that you are very smart do you really think you are that much better than your boyfriend perhaps he smarter in a different way i used to feel superior to my boyfriend sometimes because i make more money than him right now but he got something i do not have he knows how to live life i make my money and then go home and go to the gym then read and or reddit but he knows so much about the world and he always learning new things and striving for more and he is smart as hell whereas i cannot really solve problems i may have a higher salary than him but i respect the hell out of him ,3,RedPillWives
vanBeethovenLudwig, but he seems lazy when it comes to finding something to do with his life so maybe that has more to do with ambition than laziness if you are just finishing college it could be that he just unsure of what to do a lot of post grads go through indecisivenes regarding careers it not necessarily a bad thing when you are just starting out you have no idea what the world is like ,1,RedPillWives
vanBeethovenLudwig,people change a lot after college that the time when you are really becoming a real world adult you will change when you start working and most likely your world view will broaden and you might become different people if he not satisfying you i say let it fizzle out or end it that why i broke up with my first two ltrs besides the fact that they thought they could do better haha but then i met a man who is pretty much perfect for me we met when i was 27 i am glad i waited until i did because now i know i would not have been satisfied with my ex boyfriend now that i met my current boyfriend three criteria is not a lot to be truly picky if you were critiquing him on 20 different things then that would be different if it important enough to you enough that you would keep wondering for the rest of your life end it i definitely am glad i left my first ltr he led a very unhealthy lifestyle was entitled and narrow minded and my second ltr was narrow minded anti social and overly critical ,2,RedPillWives
vanBeethovenLudwig, if the only reason you want to break up is to see if you can do better you will be very disappointed i was the first serious girlfriend for my first two ltrs both of which were not good with women in general both wanted to have an open relationship because they wanted to date other women but still keep me around because i was wife material anyways long story short i ended up breaking up with them and the first guy did not have another girlfriend until 4 5 years after me now he dating a chubby sjw with blue pixie hair and my second ltr is still single broke up almost two years ago apparently he casually dated a few girls after but kept comparing them to me because they could not match up not saying that op is like this but there a lot of disappointment when you hold your own worth too high ,10,RedPillWives
vanBeethovenLudwig, so get in the kitchen and bring him a sandwich no seriously if you are bothered about this find an interesting recipe and start cooking i think you misunderstood i am very good at cooking but he also knows how to cook so for example i am going to pan fry a fish with salt and pepper and he says no that wo not be good for this type of fish it better to bake it and add lemon then i feel dumb because i have not done it the right way does that make sense anyways it sort of petty in the long run i do my job and he dies his ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, that what love sounds like when it coming from a man jesus christ you just changed my world this just made so much sense why my boyfriend was saying certain things to me and i was being stubborn we do not have a problem with respect or treating each other badly but lately he been giving a lot of suggestions to me on how i should handle situations now i understand why here the thing though i feel like i need to contribute to the relationship and it makes me feel like i am not useful when he always giving me suggestions i do not mind his suggestions because he a smart man and i agree with him in the end but for example i feel like a woman is supposed to know more about cooking than a man so when he suggests me to change a cooking method i definitely accept it because he a good cook but at the same time i feel stupid because i did not contribute well enough does that make sense ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i read cosmo on the rare occasion during college just to be cool i never took any of the advice seriously but my god almost 10 years later i am just cringing at how that shit actually sells and consistently ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i actually have a story about soft power and smoking my first ltr smoked cigarettes bad addiction i never nagged at him but i would excuse myself when he was smoking and not be in his presence or be hesitant to kiss him when he came home to meet my parents for week we met in another state i told him he had to smoke at the side of our house so my parents would not see him because they are extremely anti smoking he eventually felt ashamed and quit his parents were so surprised because they had been trying to get him to quit after 10 years ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,yeah that also interesting the way you put it for my boyfriend and i we got each other in terms of romantic friendship and sex but he mentioned it really difficult to find someone he wants the specific sex with but also have a good match in other areas we are lucky to find each other sometimes i wish he would be rougher with me also he good because he will sense if i feel hurt or abused after the session and hold me but if you did find a girl who loved your perversion and was a good person to talk to would you be willing to enter a marriage with her because even if you have the friendship and sex factor taking it to the next level of marriage and being parents together assuming you want children i personally do that a lot of actual work together being a good woman to talk to and having good sex that the girlfriend experience but marriage is much more than that meeting parents discussing finances i mean you pay for the sex you want now but that an expensive ho that you are marrying and for the sex and the companionship you know ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, meanwhile with a hoe its all about me when i pee on her i think this crazy bitch will do anything for me and leave me the fuck alone i understand this but does this make for a healthy relationship with a real girlfriend i thought men would want to treat their girlfriend well as well like pay for her take her out be the father of their children if married i ask because i know i give a very good girlfriend experience to my boyfriend i can be a good companion and stay out of his way and fuck like a dirty whore but it gets tricky because if we want a real relationship like marriage and being parents together then some of the sexy girlfriend experience is difficult maybe when finances get in the way it could deteriorate as well i do not complain about our sex because his fantasy actually makes me very aroused however i do not cum from it i usually take care of it on my own but he keeps my sex drive very high ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,thanks for this reminder i actually sometimes am on the line of laziness or immaturity i do not mean to but it good to learn how to deal with life in a feminine way instead of avoiding challenges does that make sense ,2,RedPillWives
vanBeethovenLudwig,this is really interesting to me because my boyfriend also has a specific fantasy that is so important to him that he wo not stay with a girl who does not accept it no matter how big her boobs are or whatever his is not so crazy extreme that he has to pay someone for it but it enough that some average women really do not like it but thankfully i also prefer this sex it just goes to show how important sex is to a man but also for me it very important now that i realize i prefer this if i went back to normal sex i do not think i could be satisfied either if we ever broke up i would probably be actively seeking this kind of sex ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i have dated probably 30 40 guys in my life and never slept with any of them except for the ones that turned out to be ltr it good for social skills and vetting so that you do not fall in love with the first guy who gives you attention i was juggling 7 8 guys in a time span of three months then suddenly it went quiet and my current boyfriend popped up funny how that works ,7,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,this is very interesting because i have a traditionally feminine job teaching young children and i still feel masculine even simple tasks like organizing files and making photocopies makes me feel masculine because i have to focus i am not a babbler that can gab and multi task even cooking i feel masculine because i am concentrating on doing things right the only time i feel truly feminine is when i literally do not do anything or have any responsibilities such as sitting as a passenger lounging around at the beach taking a stroll am i the only one like this or am i just sooooo helpless haha ,6,RedPillWives
vanBeethovenLudwig,i have done both dating around never seemed to work for me all my ltrs have developed when there was no one else in the picture i feel like it more difficult to bond to one man if there many in the mix ,16,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,thank you that made me really happy ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,just goes to show trying to help him be a better person means domineering mother which means he does not feel sexy i actually really hate it when people advise me without me asking so i do not do it to other people thank goodness ,5,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,thanks that made me feel better i am pretty sure my boyfriend is not shallow because he had some pretty gorgeous girls but did not stay with them he actually ended up dating an extremely overweight girl who was very intelligent and artistic they broke up for other reasons though not due to her looks or status and there was an article circulating about billionaires and their wives many of whom had average looking wives so not all rich successful men will look to upgrade or only marry supermodels for sure ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,that true i also know of a few female breadwinners i guess it just her ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i think this is my biggest fear that the more high status my husband becomes he will also want a better woman my boyfriend right now is a struggling engineer entrepreneur but what if he becomes extremely rich and successful will he want a supermodel girlfriend instead of a lowly teacher me ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, i am having a hard time with a woman who agrees to be a sahm just because her husband wants her to she was post wall 36 when they married i have a feeling she would have done anything to be married including agree to be a sahm because she was running out of time no she finds the lowly general manager wow what what snob and works on molding him that why it disadvantageous for a female to have a high status career hypergamy this just proves it i even bugged my eyes out when she said can you imagine me marrying a general manager i would never do that while i am sitting next to her happily dating a struggling engineer entrepreneur she sounds like one of those people who can never be happy yeah this she just wo not settle for less she built her own status so high that she used to private chauffeur posh european vacations vip tickets luxury clothes elite social circles it just puts in perspective the fast posh rich life does not necessarily lead to happiness i am perfectly happy walking around with my boyfriend eating 1 samosas and cooking at home ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,apparently her husband told her to choose if she married him she would have to quit her job and stay home so she chose to quit her job rather than keep climbing the ladder whether or not she preferred to stay home or let him be the successful one i am not sure but i feel like that was her way of being submissive again can you imagine a female career woman being submissive but i understand where you are coming from either she let her husband have the success stress so she could live the quiet life or if she was just trying to contribute to her husband so he would marry her because she was post wall at 36 when they married i have a feeling she quit just so she could be married because she still an alpha female that thrives on success ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,actually she had a higher status career than him at the time they met she was assistant vice president of some big financial investment company while he was just some lowly general manager she claims she taught him long term investment because that was her field supported him financially while he studied his mba offered him networking and other swanky benefits because she was in a higher position that why she claims she molded his success just to make the story more clear i agree with you in general though she got exactly what she bargained for she invested in his education and the return on that investment is she gets to stay home with her kids this would have been wonderland except the fact that the husband had an affair because he claims she boring because she lacks the high status when she was a career woman and he was the one to ask her to stay home with the kids so how is she able to maintain her high status which was the attraction point for her husband while being a sahm again because of her husband wishes again maybe there was some shrew thrown in the works can you imagine being married to a female assistant vice president of financial investment i mean that just tells you the type of personality right there the only thing that certain is the fact that her putting him through school in no way increased his sexual desire for her regardless of her own career success this is probably the deeper reason maybe there was no sexual desire in the first place maybe the intentions were wrong on both ends ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, be of high character and constantly filter out bad character spend the time to get to know someone before you commit to them regarding my friend example she married this guy pretty quickly i think from the first meeting to marriage was 1 5 years she also ran in a elite business circle finance investment and i think those people tend to be greedy heartless money oriented people know what i mean she was wearing all the luxury italian clothing and had a private chauffeur that drove a porsche and she gained 6 or 7 kg after having children and her husband nagged her all the time he would compare her to his ex girlfriend the one he had eventually had an affair with she did lose the weight but my god can you imagine being treated like that he also complained she stopped having swanky benefits like she had when she was assistant vp but how can he expect her to be the same status if he himself asked her to be a sahm just examples like this make me depressed i feel like a wgtow because it feels like my man could divorce have an affair if i got fat became boring became a shrew got wrinkles became depressed etc i feel like i cannot trust anyone but my own parents knowing that marriage is just a contract between two non blood related people that can be broken at any time it feels like i am really on my own just like mgtow my friend is 46 and she knows she an old woman she actually still very slim and physically attractive but she got too much life experience under her belt nothing phases her anymore her previous assistant vice president career blows 95 of men careers on this planet and the swanky life she lives with her husband she considered divorce but she told me where would she go she has not been working in a decade and she has two children in elementary school her parents are not going to help her she feels stuck i know men feel disposable but when women are middle aged and unattractive we are left completely alone when i hear her talk like this i feel so sad for her she trying really hard to get some sort of benefits even though she not working at all she was able to get vip tickets to a tennis open and free concert tickets by networking at the golf course but she working her ass off to win her husband approval again i just feel like crying for her obviously i do not know what the relationship was like maybe she was a shrew that drove her husband to have an affair maybe they married for the wrong reasons maybe her husband is a serious asshole and she did not see through him maybe her swanky posh lifestyle led to too much arrogance and unhappiness in the end but i just hope to god i do not end up like her most likely not because i am not that successful but her story is always at the back of my mind ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, i doubt i will be swayed by the sjw rhetoric because i am pretty set in my ways and my way of upbringing taught me to work for what i wanted quietly and silently not throw a tantrum like a toddler that great and good to know you have developed that already at your age another thing to think about is you cannot avoid sjw feminists forever it character building to know how to deal with different people in a graceful manner i am not saying you would start arguing with her if she started talking about feminism but take the opposite learn how to deal with them in a feminine way rather than just avoiding them avoiding them is the easiest way and i also do this but you will run into people you do not like throughout your life ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,exactly and this just proves how difficult it is for a high status career woman she has to sacrifice either her career or her family when she married she was the height of her career assistant vice president with benefits coming out of your ears her private chauffeur drove a porsche she always had box concert tickets with the royal family luxury italian clothing if the husband was attracted to her when she was high status he will always wish for her to have that high status and for her she claimed she would never have married a manager she would have only settled for a ceo type man that made her life difficult because women always want to marry up and her husband may have chosen her for the wrong reasons as well they live a swanky life and she wo not settle for less and she very unhappy sometimes i think it just better to be a average middle class joe 1 type people will never be satisfied because they always want more now my friend feels stuck because the husband is complaining she not as high status anymore because she a sahm but he was the one who asked her to be a sahm he also seems like he has unforgiving standards and she cannot go back to work because she cannot settle for a clerical or secretary job how could she after being assistant vp that type of job requires sacrifice of family anyways again it none of my business but just good to be aware and try to prevent this from happening to any of us and a good reminder that having a high status career makes our lives more difficult even if we find a partner ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,whenever i was in a situation where the only people around me were sjw or feminists i still socialized with them but i was careful to limit my precious time when i first moved to my current country it was difficult making friends and the only girls i knew were career women in their 30 i did go out to dinner with them occasionally but i made sure to not participate in every activity they tended to stick together shopping spa movies concerts and be validated by each other i just saw them maybe once a week or every other week because i spent my other free time developing myself staying fit and going on dates it kind of made me feel triumphant when i eventually secured a ltr because all they did was work and eat and rant about horrible men i would just advise to be careful and know your own boundaries moral code so that you wo not become swayed by sjw feminist agenda if they are interesting girls then it not bad to talk to them it helps build your own experiences but just do not let yourself get sucked in it can even be a helpful reminder of what you do not want to end up as friends will come and go anyway just because you have a friend now does not mean you have to continue being friends with her forever ,10,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,awwww what a compliment thank you dear x,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,yes this is a better way of putting it thanks for the input ,6,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,that true these situations just make me nervous because rpw is all about what do you contribute to the relationship instead of being entitled and taking his resources but my friends contributed a lot to the relationship and then look what happened but perhaps was the wrong kind of contribution it was a domineering masculine contribution and directly related to his career instead of a soft feminine contribution that helped his personal life ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,hmm that true she kept saying he would not have understood long term investment if it were not for me because i was the one to teach him it makes me glad i am not actually a super smart woman haha she too smart and very calculative in her thinking ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, or he s a selfish advantage taker who used her to advance his career i think it was more this my friend mentioned that because she was assistant vp in some swanky job she frequently got vip invitations and she had private chauffeurs she basically had a higher status life and she offered her benefits to her husband and i believe he took advantage maybe he did not understand what kind of relationship he wanted either because now that she a sahm he tells her she become unattractive because she not so high status of course this is due to the man character too maybe he was not searching for a soft woman he used her to become high status and expected her to stay the same even when she became a sahm the other two men are also business oriented socialite men anyways obviously it none of my business but i wanted to understand to prevent this from happening to myself especially since it seems to be a common problem women molding contributing to men and then they cheat in return ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i have a feeling she did not nag him into owing her though she may have nagged but he definitely still chose to marry her that why i find it so strange i feel like maybe she gave way too much on her end thinking that what he wanted but it did not lead to relationship harmony ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,my understanding was that dating multiple people simultaneously is dating around ,8,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,the thing is he enjoyed her career advice i feel like he took advantage of that maybe it was a vetting issue she did not understand her feminine role and instead the relationship was very businesslike instead of comforting they both allowed it to happen though because he asked her to marry him ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,knowing those three friends they are not very sympathetic or soft women they hate children and have talkative domineering personalities so perhaps it was their attitudes however the husbands boyfriends willing took their advice though and it did help them in their success ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,yes you never know exactly what happened maybe it was the character of the man no one really knows i just wonder if it could have been prevented on the women end either through vetting or relationship skills ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,yes relationships are complicated obviously but it felt to me like she did a lot of active molding instead of feminine support like she offered to support him financially while he studied his mba then she quit her job so he could be the successful one it a horrible feeling for her for sure but i think maybe she should not have given so much in the first place and perhaps there was nagging in the works ,1,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig,what comes out of a man mouth is incredibly important i am not terribly talkative on first dates so men usually try to impress me with their conversation skills brains wits and i am the one listening to them talk it perfect for vetting if they talk about their work their travels politics family etc or are they talking about stupid trivial things i want my man intelligent what he says to me tells me how intelligent he is ,2,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig,i have oily skin and struggle with acne and closed comedones i have been using aha which has been revealing some clogs underneath my skin i have experimenting with bha lately too and i have an interesting reaction my skin is a bit red but not itchy afterwards then it gone in the morning however i am extra oily the next day like disgustingly oily i thought bha was supposed to cut down on oil i know that ymmv but i am curious why i would have this reaction to bha ,1,AsianBeauty
vanBeethovenLudwig,this is what makes me sad about rp that men just give up on finding a women or they make women to be a game should not a couple be working together instead of trying to game one another i mean of course i game my boyfriend for sexy time but the big picture is we need to work together to build a life together i do not know perhaps i just do not understand from a female perspective ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,it interesting how respect from a woman girlfriend wife can increase a man status as well as self esteem my boyfriend is still dealing with some work shit from last year but he pushing through it better and making more progress since we have met than when he was single and by himself it makes me wonder if mgtow are truly happy if they do not have women giving them stable and long term respect ,4,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,thanks ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, i am sure you love him a lot yes i do and i am fierce about it ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,first of all everyone is taking the word babbling way too seriously and blowing it out of proportion perhaps i should have said confiding or something more diplomatic so sorry if that made people think i do not respect my boyfriend because i respect him out of this world it not like i am on my phone and saying mhm yes dear ok that great honey bumpkin while his words are going in and out the other ear i am very intently listening to him when he talks and it crucial for me to hear him talk because it shows me who he is as a man if this is the man who i want to lead our family i am listening to every word he says whenever he opens his mouth to analyze his character anyways i could not tell if you are agreeing with my empty answers or thinking i am being patronizing like the other guy i do not need to prove my respect for my boyfriend to strangers on the internet he knows i do and that the only thing that matters ,7,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, so you view his observations and thoughts as babbling and you just give him patronizing responses yet you also say he super smart and you respect him a lot interesting excuse me i am sorry if it came off as condescending i simply meant babbling as in he likes to confide in me i sincerely enjoy listening to him talk because i like what he has to say i am not purposely giving him patronizing responses i simply meant that i realized i do not have to solve his problems when he tells me about his problems i am just validating him and he does the same when i babble he not telling me his thoughts because he wants me to do something about it he just wants me to listen to him and i am appreciating him by doing so i am not quite sure why you are taking my response negatively because i love my boyfriend very much he does not see my responsiveness as patronizing he sees me as a loving and supporting girlfriend because i am so i believe perhaps you are the one with some sort of insecurity or resentment ,11,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,this is great it also coincides with responsiveness my boyfriend likes to babble his observations about the world to me and i noticed i do not have to be a therapist or anything all i have to do is say oh wow yes that true oh that not good i agree that makes sense that amazing baby etc he just wants to be listened to it easy for me to listen to him though because i think he the smartest man i know and i respect his opinions all the more to be careful vetting you are going to have to listen to your man thoughts for a long time ,11,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i vet my men on everything lifestyle does he binge drink eat healthily exercise family what do his parents do are his parents divorced or still together what kind of parenting style did they have what do his siblings do hobbies what books does he read tv shows movies friends what do his friends do for jobs what do they do when they go out clothing hairstyle everything along with the major vetting like his dreams ambitions the way he deals with life the way he deals with people the way he deals with me also vetting in terms of what he does in bed when he being too rough and i am giving signals i cannot handle it does he back off he has to have a keen sense of emotional and social intelligence to grasp if i am feeling bad but i am not saying anything ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,my boyfriend and i are not hardcore bdsm nor do we identify with any community but we do follow a lot of the master slave practices in bed he makes all the decisions which positions and what we are doing and when i am giving him oral sex he basically dictates every move this is the first time i have had this type of sex and i realized how free i feel i do not have to work to seduce him i have everything planned out for me as long as i am looking nice and pretty for him but in terms of what do i do do i use my tongue should i lick his neck should i switch positions i do not have to worry about this because he the one telling me what to do i feel like i know what it like to surrender to someone and i have never been so turned on before like my sex drive is at its highest and i do not have to work to make myself aroused when he ordering me around i become incredibly aroused this translates to real life although we are not as serious about our roleplay i do not have to call him master or anything but i definitely go with the flow and let him make the decisions i do tell him when i do not prefer something it can be simple like i prefer to stay home while he goes to the store instead of going together but the biggest aspect that i enjoy is that i feel safe in this dynamic i feel like i am protected i feel free i am not anxious whether it in bed or in real life i put my trust in him and i enjoy his lead that being said i vetted him very carefully i observed his decisions and choices and who he is as a man and now i reap the benefits of being under his protection ,6,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, there are of course other d s types you can do like daddy babygirl which has nothing to do with incest or age play but refers to the dom being more gentle guiding and more tolerant of antics rather than more strict or the daddy dom bg which is kinda in between the daddy bg and the dom sub i ve done d s daddy dom bg and m s i much prefer m s but it takes a very special man to be a master interesting i do not consider myself full on bdsm but the subtypes are interesting to me could you explain more the differences in return he is intensely protective and caring of me for all that i give him and serve him he returns in being my rock and taking care of me he gives me the guidance boundaries and safety so that i can focus on him and the freedom of that submission i get to put down so much control and give it to him which destresses me and allows me to relax and focus on what i love best i identify with this so much ,3,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig,it possible for a man do get past it i have a girlfriend whose n count is 20 and her boyfriend is still with her after 5 years granted she cheated on him and he cheated back but now they are thinking of marriage so yes wtf relationships do happen with high quality men not so sure ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, you are overthinking this thanks i needed to hear this ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, also try to put yourself in his situation and how he feeling after losing his job not being able to get back in the country to visit the woman he loves having financial difficulties etc can you imagine the pressure he must be under perhaps he cannot even begin to contemplate marriage when things are so unstable yes and this is why i am being very compassionate about his situation because i understand his pressure and i am not getting good advice from my some girlfriends they keep saying oh he should fight for you or he can still bring you to his parents even if he jobless i do not see what the problem is i feel like i cannot even discuss my situation with anyone because they do not understand the severity of his situation and they do not understand why i am being so nice and forgiving about him they are looking at me like why bother with someone who got himself and you into this situation you will never know if this relationship can work unless you try and things are so unstable right now that it hard to tell yes this is the problem and why i am so anxious it sounds like you are way overthinking this you are worried and in your head do you love him how would your life be if you split up with him is this someone you want to be with and build a life together yeah i am definitely way over thinking this even he telling me to relax and basically allow him to control the situation i guess that part of surrendering i do love him when i am with him in person or talk to him on the phone i realize how much i love him the distance is not easy because my hamster is running a marathon that why i decided to go and visit him again instead of taking other women advice which is make him visit you and work for you even though he broke as hell i do not have any questions about his ability to handle situations because i have seen him fight for himself it not a question of if he capable or not i am just anxious he just stringing me along and or settling for me instead of chasing courting the woman of his dreams and had his eyes on as a wife ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,he does come from a culture of honor to the family as do i we both take duty to our families very seriously so making a next step would be very meaningful it true marriages will go through hardships and it good for me to see how he deals with his situation as well ,4,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,you mean what we would like for our future ideally if his job goes well i would visit him and see how it is then considering all goes well we would get married and i would move there i would freelance for a bit under his provision until we can start a family together ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, also if he does not introduce you to his parents during this next visit i would see it as a major red flag this is what i am feeling too i just do not know how to deal with the situation if it turned out that he still does not take me to meet his parents i obviously do not want to whine or scream about it i was thinking of just telling him it feels like you are not serious about me because i have not met your parents still and i feel very hurt i do not think that an ultimatum just telling him how i feel ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, has he given you any indication he wants to date other women no i am 100 sure he only interested in me and he also mentioned that i am out of the game meaning i do not need to worry about trying to find another man he sounds like he very concerned about behaving honorably towards you and keeping his word to provide frankly reading your story about him was very heart warming just a comment on what it looks like from the outside thank you this is something lovely to hear especially coming from an outsider pov sometimes your head and heart is so deep that i cannot really evaluate the situation that also something i respect him for he wants to do a good job and do it right ,4,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig,aaaah thanks for that what are some true vitamin c serums ,1,AsianBeauty

vanBeethovenLudwig,i would like to introduce vitamin c to my routine i tried it yesterday morning and had no reactions do i need to introduce it slowly 1x week 2x week like aha bha is it better to use vitamin c in the mornings or can i alternate my aha and vitamin c on different nights ,5,AsianBeauty
vanBeethovenLudwig,gosh seriously i was a grassroots freelance artist for a few years and hated it i do not care about making my personal brand and using my own seed money for everything and struggling to pay for health insurance now i am working for the government and getting benefits out of my ears bring on the evil corporations ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,my first instinct is that it not possible because the very premise of a woman molding a nice guy into an alpha is already contradictory his drive should come from within not because of a woman but then a lot of men will go the extra mile just to impress women just to keep a beautiful graceful lady by his side so then in a sense i do think a woman can inspire a man to keep improving himself a man may be so enthralled by a woman that he will break his back just to provide for her so she can be by his side one example is my brother and his wife he also a nice guy but was a mama boy beta he puts his wife on a pedestal and he working really hard to impress her and be better than her especially because she already a poised elegant woman that also has a high paying job dentist i do think he was inspired to do better so now he a doctor she also stuck by his side when he failed to get into medical school the first time and he tried to improve his faults since then he very smart but anti social he still plays video games occasionally but he really stepped up his responsibilities also his wife dresses well and now i noticed he dressing a lot more professionally and grown up he 31 they have been married for 3 years edit i also think it comes with age i am 28 and now noticing a lot of men between 28 32 are still quite immature my boyfriend is turning 35 soon and he matured a lot in the past year he dresses better he takes more responsibility personally and in his work he getting more sleep being more careful in work politics etc when we first met he was staying out late with his boys and dressing like a college student in his early 30 and floundering in his career there nothing more motivating than a pretty and nice woman who respects you and expects the best from you ,16,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i feel like i am a little different if my boyfriend asked me to join crossfit because it more athletic and explosive and high energy whereas i am a soft energy spiritual yoga girl i actually would feel a little offended and think well why did not you choose a girl who already likes crossfit these are major preference changes though if my boyfriend told me he likes me wearing a certain color that i chose for myself then i would make an effort to wear more of that color and if i gained a few pounds and he asked me to lose back to my original weight i would certainly comply but if i am already an artsy girl and he wants me to go skiing and rock climbing with him i feel like that getting into controlling territory he should have chosen a girl who already likes skiing and rock climbing or just do it with his guy friends if i am naturally quiet and he complains about it i feel like he should have chosen a girl who is more outgoing maybe i am stubborn though so that why i wanted to see what others thought ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i always snuggle up to him when he comes to bed and rub his chest he loves this says it makes him feel like king i will make him coffee or tea if he busy working perhaps a fruit plate blowjobs lots of blowjobs that it really plus i always listen to him when he complains about work or when he advises me on my problems ,10,RedPillWives
vanBeethovenLudwig,i like this explanation the best europeans who come from heavily social subsidized countries do not understand this different kind of freedom to europeans especially countries who have good school system and good health care think that they are free because they do not have to worry about getting a good education or not getting medical help which i definitely agree has its advantages and i actually prefer this system better but the american freedom is you can make your own decisions if you do not like the school your kids are at then it your responsibility to relocate to get your kids attending a different school if you do not like your doctor you have the liberty to choose a different doctor you trust not stay with the same one just because the government only allows you to have this doctor freedom is responsibility governments that give you social benefits are the responsible ones governments that do not give you social benefits force you to be the responsible one whether or not you can handle it is up to you but in practice the usa has for the most part forgone that ideal and it just like all the other western countries but instead sniffs its own farts with rhetoric it has abandoned yeah this is also very true ,3,explainlikeimfive
vanBeethovenLudwig,i am a performing artist and teacher full time teacher but i still perform occasionally i teach at a government sponsored specialized arts school i struggled a lot in my early mid 20 because there not a lot of jobs for what i do mainly freelance and i knew i had to marry into money to live a middle class life it put a lot of pressure on me to find a boyfriend with a stable job actually but then i found out that there are full time jobs for me that provide health insurance outside of the us so that why i moved i felt like i was vetting for health insurance among other traits while living in the us haha but i feel my job is very rpw in the way that i work with children and families and i have that aesthetic artistic side from performing plus i do not have to take my work home ever if i had children my job would still be doable ,6,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,if layering bha and aha at the same time is too harsh for my skin would it be just as good to alternate aha and bha on different nights ,1,AsianBeauty
vanBeethovenLudwig,my go to no makeup look is moisturized skin sunscreen bb cream concealer neutral eyeshadows eyeliner mascara brow pencil clear lip balm if i want to add some fun either contour cheek stain bright lip gloss lipstick winged eyeliner or darker eyeshadows usually makeup to me is for fun and i am very careful not to be one of those crazy makeup girls like heavy handed application or too many colors my so likes glam looks but not hooker glam haha ,2,FeminineNotFeminist

vanBeethovenLudwig,as an asian american girl i can confirm that many idealize white american girls and try to be like them to assimilate i do not live in the us anymore and i have found my natural femininity and traditional values are easier to live by when i did live in the us it was so difficult to stand by my own around my loud aggressive liberal friends who talk very fast and over you i have a taiwanese friend who grew up in taiwan but went to boarding school in england and she a bit more aggressive and career oriented like british girls now it totally environment she also has a lot of italian friends and she tries to act like them talkative passionate emotional it the fact that you are different in a foreign country so you try to fit in by acting like what you see this is what happens to asian american girls because we are not raised like this in the home ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, women feel they are dove they are not an alternative hipster who like lush or a snotty woman who buys products at sephora or a crunchy granola girl who likes burt bees or a middle american woman who likes bath amp bodyworks haha this is great but it very true i used to buy from sephora occasionally but i remember i had a friend who refused to go into sephora with me because she was more of a no makeup non girly crunchy granola girl and i also do not buy from bath and bodyworks because it reminds me of my ex boyfriend mother who had every bathroom stocked with their handsoap ,6,FeminineNotFeminist
vanBeethovenLudwig,i have a specific arts job where you are either lower class or upper class either people feel sorry for you or they respect you it quite strange i still get people pitying me when i tell them what i do because of the stigma but i just keep my mouth shut i simply got lucky in my job and it happened to be in an arts sponsored country instead of freelancing like most struggling artists i do acknowledge i have privilege though i cannot really complain about much ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,yes the arts is a very broad industry my field is actually male dominated but i am lucky to be getting paid well for the level i am at ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,actually it a male dominated field on a collegiate level but i am in an extremely rare situation where i live in a country that sponsors the arts and so i have a cushy job doing what i do teaching young children not university level if i had my job in the us however i would be dirt poor and when i did live in the us i was struggling to make ends meet ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,he tells me i am the source of light in his life because i contribute a lot already i cook for him and take care his needs as much as i can and give him tons of blowjobs and i listen to him when he advises me in fact i give him so many blowjobs he actually declines because his dick is tired haha i can definitely complain less about my own life though the main point of the post is even though i try my best to give as much as i can i will never truly understand the shit in life that he has to deal with that i never will ,8,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, i may be post wall but i get told i look in my mid 20s because i jog my a off lift and take care of my skin truer words have never been spoken i know a blonde american girl who looks 28 but is actually 37 because she obsessive about the gym and has good skin it seriously does wonders she still single though for other reasons that are not physically related ,6,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig,tip for curling your hair if your curls become static instead of flowy cool your curls 5 minutes rub some hair oil on your fingers and run them through to relax them or else you have that unnatural prissy curl look bra straps teenage girls seem to think showing bra straps is cool but as an adult it quite unelegant wear strapless also choose smooth bra textures so you do not have bumpy textured boobs when wearing a thin blouse or t shirt ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
vanBeethovenLudwig, sometimes women lose sight of their purpose as a companion to men i cannot upvote this enough i too scrambled to make fancy dinners and house chores for my boyfriend only to realize all he wanted to do was snuggle with me and talk to me after a day of difficult work a few times he came over and i kept asking him if he wanted dinner or a back rub and he was just like no just come here held me for an hour then he left to get dinner on his own even when we discussed our future and he mentioned providing for me if we moved to another country i said i do not know what to do if i move with you and he simply said you do not have to do anything just be with me i will take care of you companionship is spot on as a lover nurturer cheerleader friend ,3,RedPillWives
vanBeethovenLudwig,yes i noticed this in my boyfriend he a traditional man at heart but he been bp conditioned however he has noticed that women have female privilege and men suffer and are easily disposable i think after dating me he realizes he does not have to kiss the feet of an entitled feminist and receive no appreciation or respect in return but the people around us have not woken up so he still falls into the bp trap occasionally ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,it certainly is an interesting evolution but i am actually glad for it to occur even as a woman i just feel sad and actually a bit resentful of the women who have a faithful and or successful husband and yet they treat him like shit i work very hard to respect and please my boyfriend and yet i am still unmarried i also feel unappreciated that i am working so hard to be good woman because i see these entitled shrews just stomp all over their men and yet they still get what they want and their men kissing their feet it feels unfair to me it makes me feel like i need to be a shrew to compete with bossy women although i wo not become one because i have more self worth than that ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,that interesting the way you put if a man chooses to divorce then he made the wrong choice in a wife if the wife chooses to divorce the man failed at keeping the marriage together now that i think of it most men i know try pretty hard at keeping the marriage successful ,7,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig,i wear heels half the time even if it just a low heel it still adds some shape i only wear wedges if it espadrilles i do not wear platforms because i think they are trashy i love stiletto or cone shaped heels because they are more feminine but for some walking heels i prefer flat one inch heels i am bottom heavy with a nice butt but since i am 5 3 i can look stocky so heels help me elongate a bit ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
vanBeethovenLudwig,i think the important thing is to make sure when you do talk it of substance on my first date my boyfriend talked about how he traveled to china and some crazy things he did there and some history of his home country that i did not know about and some of the music he liked during his childhood but note that he did not gab on and on about himself he quite good at holding frame and he will even ignore my texts if he thinks i am texting too much i appreciate this about him i do think my boyfriend is pretty charismatic in a quietly confident way so that why i am not always expecting him to impress me i know he got his wheels turning he just does not feel the need to loudly announce it to the world i also respect him a lot already though my boyfriend is in construction and there was one date where after dinner he just started driving somewhere i kept asking him where we were going and he just told me to wait then he pulls up to a construction site and showed me what he was working on that just an example of how he shows me he interesting but he does not talk about it or a few days ago he texted me a picture of this incredible view of a home in cairo that faces the pyramids and all he said was my friend home in cairo we can go there any time we want then i was texting him back how amazing and beautiful the view was and he just did not reply haha ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,that the thing i do not call my boyfriend just to talk we bond through activities gabbing on the phone or in person is a female activity i have never talked to my boyfriend like a real conversation usually i will say something here and there and he listening to me but he either does not respond or he will make a joke if he takes me out he might comment on some things that we see for instance we went to a museum and he will tell me some side history that he knows or last week he took me to a new restaurant and he told me a story about how he found the restaurant sometimes he complains about work at the dinner table but usually he just says a few things and leaves it at that i do not need to console him like a girlfriend if i go to him with a problem though he definitely talks through it with me and he quite good at that however i prefer stoic men i am very unattracted to men who talk too much it could just be me ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i am a bit on the fence i love form fitting pencil skirts but i have a huge butt so when i do wear pencil skirt i am looking very sexy which is not necessarily a bad thing but i just have to be careful where i wear them i do love a line skirts that hit right above the knee paired with boots high heels or fashion sneakers i also love tunics over leggings cinched with a waist belt that are skirt like i would say i wear a skirt tunic 2 3x a week i do believe jeans can look feminine as long as you wear form fitting ones that highlight your hips waist especially because men would not wear tight jeans haha for a day look i like tight trousers with 1 2 1 inch heels and a pretty blouse or i might tuck in a form fitting shirt and add a belt that matches my shoes of course ,7,FeminineNotFeminist
vanBeethovenLudwig,in that case i agree with you i think there the best match for the path that you chose for instance if i had never left my home country definitely i would have ended with someone else and not my current boyfriend ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i do for myself but also i do not want to believe in soulmates though because i think it ridiculous but there are some things about my boyfriend that make me think we are a perfect match in every way in terms of our needs also the way we met was a bit uncanny i had a bit of a drawn out unofficial long distance relationship that was on the rocks with no end in sight and the very night that the ex boyfriend told me he was dating another girl i met my boyfriend also they are from the same city and i found out my boyfriend had also lived in a developing country like i did which is rare it was like someone knew the old relationship was not going to work out and put a better version of my ex boyfriend in front of me again i do believe hard work and trust is the key to a successful relationship and of course i am going to put my all into making my relationship successful but for my own situation i feel like there was some sort of fate in meeting a good match i am also a bit of an artistic and spiritual person and live in my dreams so to me it makes it all the more fun ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,maybe he does not want a bubble butt plus i think women can have bigger booties because we are naturally more disposed to have fat there as well ,3,StrongCurves
vanBeethovenLudwig,yeah you can definitely look womanly in form fitting trousers that show off your feminine hips paired with high heels and a pretty blouse ,8,RedPillWives
vanBeethovenLudwig,yes sometimes even when a man meets a high value wife material woman if he not in that phase of his life he wo not seriously pursue her i have met plenty of men who said i loved her and she was perfect for me but i just was not ready to settle down ,4,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig,haha not at all i finally realized that my boyfriend even checks out fat girls and ugly girls they just like looking ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
vanBeethovenLudwig,makes sense i just find it so fascinating because i have had some guy friends check out slim women but then choose the girl with the booty like they acknowledge that the slim girl is attractive but it is not the type they want i guess it good for women who do have sexy curves though ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
vanBeethovenLudwig,i think it does help a bit with longevity but i always keep mascara for reapplication during the summer when it humid humidity is definitely not our friend to keep looking pretty ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
vanBeethovenLudwig,a tip is to use a damp beauty blender sponge and blot your face after applying bb cream it will help you get that dewy fresh look instead of a too matte finish kate lash maximizer is amazing for plumping up lashes before applying real mascara it will keep you from looking clumpy ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
vanBeethovenLudwig,i used a japanese brand called kate but i also liked boscia or smashbox brands olay or garnier is good for drugstore level ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
vanBeethovenLudwig,i do not understand this why would advertising target women to look too thin when they know men like a bit of meat figure is not this counterproductive or do they just want to create a whole industry of weight loss for women or maybe they think women might let themselves go if they always show models with meat and instead show thin ones so women will always be aware of their body image ,1,FeminineNotFeminist

vanBeethovenLudwig,thank you so much for this article it been a contended topic on rpw for me i am quite selective about my close girlfriends usually my girlfriends are similarly rpw in one way or another and we tend to bond through activities such as cooking shopping spa concerts running errands personality is very important i do not make close friends with women who complain all the time obviously we need a friend to complain to once in a while but if it constant negativity then i do not pursue the friendship i like women i can joke around with and discuss some problems with but not overanalyze this is so important to me because i notice if i start over analyzing with a girlfriend i turn into a shrew and am overly anxious and this takes away from my radiant happiness i have found this is a huge in keeping a good friendship i also believe it dangerous to continue befriending single women who are single for a reason career unattractive negative bar hopping and in that case i would rather be alone than be sucked into a self perpetuating circle of singledom i do not like girlfriends who try to make me over because they believe their way of life is correct for instance i do not typically go out drinking for varying reasons but i had a girlfriend who told me i was being prude and wanted to corrupt me and i ended up going through a three month phase of bar nights she also comes from a european culture where women drink a lot and it normal but it not normal for my culture i believe a good girlfriend accepts you the way you are and does not judge you ,6,RedPillWives
vanBeethovenLudwig,very cute and totally true about men seeming like they do not notice they do but do not say anything my boyfriend is definitely like this ,7,RedPillWives
vanBeethovenLudwig,i also prefer a partner who has never been married but i do remember an incident a few years ago a group of male musicians in their 40 were performing for our students only one of them was married and i found him a lot more attractive than the bachelors because he was articulate confident responsible he basically was directing the group and polite the other guys were just lounging around waiting for someone to do all the work i was not interested in him because he married and way too old for me but i can still find him attractive ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,me too i have learned that when he does not say much to me or does not text me as much i need to just chill out and let him be he always comes running back again ,5,RedPillWives
vanBeethovenLudwig,haha well i am asian so maybe that why those are my strengths i once got bangs and my boyfriend said i looked like an anime girl haha ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,1 i am pretty docile by nature i do not like to be confrontational and generally am quiet 2 i have an elegant taste in fashion music books food coming from an artistic upbringing and education 3 i am polite and courteous 4 i am always working on myself whenever i make a mistake i try my best to do better next time i am very idealistic which can be good for self improvement but bad for reality perfection 5 i know how to take care of a man incredibly well it just natural for me to be nurturing and loving and sensual with men ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i was a group leader in grad school for an arts project that involved undergrads 22 at the time at the end of the year there was a freshman girl that came up to me and said i was basically her role model because i was nice confident dressed well had a boyfriend and did my job really well it was really cute how she looked up to me so much ,1,AskReddit
vanBeethovenLudwig,pedicures massages shoe shopping applying my makeup creating that perfect outfit i try to have an efficient wardrobe where i can mix and match a lot cooking and setting up a candlelit table even just eating by myself sheet masks my skincare routine curling my hair dancing by myself omg i have so many i am very good at indulging myself ,9,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, the rise of individualism and over hype of the speciality of everyone has contributed to a generation who cannot take responsibility for their own actions well said it not even a problem in the us one of the individualist countries in the world but i see it in younger generations in traditionally community oriented countries in kenya tanzania ghana italy china the young generations strive to be different and special and achieve their own goals and they are not contributing to their community anymore in my opinion the biggest problem today is not freedom but the failure to recognize that freedom is responsibility this is why feminism declined society women are given freedom but we were never taught true responsibility because we have been protected and raised not to have the huge burdens i think this also contributes to lack of appreciation for the good men out there because women do not truly realize how much the man is doing for them because we have never truly understood the responsibilities there was a saying on an rp blog that women are teenagers forever i really do believe this ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, i think a lot of women do this to protect themselves emotionally because they know that this man is not going to commit to them even if they really want it and are hoping he does yeah that makes total sense i think that exactly what my flatmate is doing she desperately wants to be married she 34 but it does not feel conducive to dating if she keeps calling them friends i just want to say honey if you want to have a husband you actually need to start dating but keeping my mouth shut ,2,RedPillWives
vanBeethovenLudwig,it will take time for sure i am the same way but even if you feel like you are putting up a facade stfu is the most important do not let them know what you are really thinking ,2,RedPillWives
vanBeethovenLudwig,ahahahaha yeah it really fascinating is not it it just shows you that even if you are pretty and thin and nice if you are still a bro then you will never be a girlfriend i have another friend who also has trouble dating because she just does not get the tingles with any guy she meets as i get to know her i start noticing she keeps bringing guys out with us for dinner guy friends she has a lot of guy friends but they are always just hanging out she also travels with a group of guys just as friends i think that why she has difficulty feeling passion with anyone ,2,RedPillWives
vanBeethovenLudwig, does anyone else struggle with keeping a dignified mentality without the detestable sense of superiority yes i am going through this right now especially with single female friends who cannot understand why they are still single i think one thing that is helping me is realizing other women are choosing to live their lives differently and that ok even when they complain about being single when they are fat and obsessed with their career let them complain also learning to stfu and not preach when you see a blatant mistake in how another woman is ruining her relationship or her femininity it not your place to judge or teach keep your dignity to yourself and be compassionate to others ,5,RedPillWives
vanBeethovenLudwig,please no one hate me for saying this i do like michelle in general but the one thing i did not like was her masculine way of speaking she speaks like a man ,3,RedPillWives
vanBeethovenLudwig,yes i agree with 3 especially i do not talk about his situations he going through a serious job situation right now and i am quite vague about it even with the closest of friends they know something is going on but i even flatly said out loud i cannot tell you any more because it his life this also ties into 4 i truly feel like people cannot understand the situation we are going through because they do not understand how we view our relationship but the good thing is the few girlfriends that do know a bit are not judgmental about my decisions ,2,RedPillWives
vanBeethovenLudwig,i notice that my female friends that have guy friends even if they did not have any sexual history tend to be single for the reason that they have a more difficult time feeling any romance with men i have a feeling seeing men in general as friends or equals instead of a leader leads to unsuccessful dating another example is my flatmate who always has some sort of casual relationship going on with a variety of men she always refers to them as friends even when i call him your boyfriend she always counters with oh he just a friend i found it strange because if i were bringing a man back to my apartment we are either dating courting or he my boyfriend she never seems to want to use the word dating or seeing each other it just makes me think that the way you view these relationships has an effect on the outcome if you still see the man as a friend and cannot admit to dating him it going to stay that way ,2,RedPillWives
vanBeethovenLudwig,i do not agree with female circumcision or honor killings and i am aware of the violent aspect of islam i just mentioned some parts of islam that coincide with rpw philosophy i do not want to open up an unnecessary can of worms ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,you are taking this to a whole other level and arguing for something i never said while i do not advocate for sharia law all i simply said was there were some parts of islam that coincide with rpw regarding the relationship between a man and a woman i never said i agreed with anything about rape or murder or pedophilia also as with any religion there are people who follow it to different degree i have a problem with people who say all muslims are here same because every muslim agrees with the extreme philosophies of islam that like saying every christian is an evangelical ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,do you have the article that this article is responding to the i am not a disgrace to women because i did not march article ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,my ltrs have always been with the eldest of the family i am the youngest out of two and my brother always took care of me growing up i have noticed i subconsciously look for this in men and usually the eldest child has this level of responsibility i am easygoing adventurous and vascillating i do not like making decisions but i like to follow my boyfriend is the decision maker and always takes care of the big responsibilities ,1,RedPillWives
vanBeethovenLudwig,yes dear i would be happy to sharia law is taking the ideas in the quran and instead of letting it be a moral book for people to choose to follow it the basis of the government all arab countries are widely differing on their laws mine is officially under sharia law 1 they emphasize protecting women one major reason for abayas and hijabs although in my country you are not required to wear one as a westerner is for the women to keep her body sacred for her husband and believe me i know plenty of arab women that dress like a whore under that abaya they just only show it to their husbands at home also contrary to popular belief women make a choice to cover themselves for the reason stated above many women are proud to only shows themselves to their husbands saudi arabia is a whole other story though that a bit extreme sharia government where you are forced to cover but where i live it a choice but you still have to dress conservatively i think a common misconception is muslim women are oppressed by the quran to cover but the ones i know are very proud to stay protected for themselves 2 adding to 1 women are not allowed in bikinis or western swimwear in public beaches you have to go to a private beach or a fancy hotel pool beach this is part of the protection and also modesty of women bodies because sharia law knows that women are seen as sexual objects so they do not desire it to be shown in public 3 not exactly sharia law but muslim women dress very feminine they do their makeup nicely and the ones who do not choose to cover themselves wear conservative but very sensual clothing beautiful colors prints jewelry high heels matching color schemes this was the first time i ever saw women dressing so beautifully and elegant but also showing no skin except their faces not just arab women but indonesian women whom a majority are muslim also dress like this 4 they are anti infidelity a woman loyalty should be to her husband as a woman it illegal to live with a man if you are not married although many western couples do so in secret and if you have a baby out if wedlock you are deported sharia law does not like single mothers this forces women to make good choices so they are not having sex with random men and not living with a man before marriage leaves you pure basically imagine having no access to contraception i bet less women would be riding the cc do not you think however drugstores do sell condoms here as for birth control pills i am not really sure 5 discrimination sharia law is discriminatory against women and men single men are not allowed to enter many premises unless they are with a woman otherwise known as family the government punishes men who do not choose to have a family as well also there are many women only events where they do not allow male employees i have gotten so many gigs here as a woman because my male colleagues are not allowed to go in some government run areas women are allowed to go in a separate line and basically cut the line because you are a woman men have to actually wait in a line unless they are a family man 6 a woman cannot be the boss of her husband at work it illegal to let the wife work in a higher position than her husband in the same company if different companies then it does not matter sharia law prefers the man to lead in the family however at work a woman can be the boss of men she just cannot be the boss of her husband that being said i am not advocating for sharia law i am simply just stating the actual experience of living under it than someone who never has an had this horrible conception that women are stoned all the time and beat and rapes because it not true as for benefits there really only one major benefit here and it that people acknowledge you are a woman and make excuses for it so in the us no one cares if you are a woman because equal rights and anti discriminatory policies if you are acting like a woman at work then you would better man up or get out but here you can get away with a lot as a woman do not want to lift heavy things there always a man willing to help you wearing high heels and your feet are tired men are understanding instead of telling you you are being impractical because they know as a woman you should look beautiful cannot handle a high powered position do not worry just take a less stressful job and live an easy life men wo not judge you because women should not be so hardened in their work anyway however if you are a feminist and want to be treated like a man then usa or other western country is better for you i prefer living in an arab country where they treat me like a woman also as a single woman with a job here your job package far outweighs a single male because single men can live under precarious conditions but single women need to be put in safe spaces because she does not have a man to protect her you can also be very successful as a business woman if you just work the woman angle dress nicely be feminine and businessmen will worship you and enjoy your company you can get what you want just by being a feminine woman if you do not work as a woman as a wife you are not forced to stay home you are encouraged to go to the spa and the shopping mall and enjoy life luxuries while your husband works people do not think it strange if you do not work as a woman i hope this helps ,4,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,my european boyfriend is actually into asian and african women not african american for this reason because we also tend to have baby faces in our facial structure that keep us looking radiant as we age while european women have a more sexy fierce look when they are young but does not age well do you think this is why some men choose a more neotonous face on a wife and only look at women with sexy faces eg porn stars have sexy faces not cute i am also remembering how my brother loves how his wife has a cute and round face ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,this is a perfect post because it shows that to be a good woman you will need to have different facets if you are too mothering too eager too slutty etc then the man is not fulfilled it important to be able to switch faces to adapt to the situation of course this is part of being a woman having the feminine instinct to do what is right for your man in that specific time ,8,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, they need to stop blaming the patriarchy for womens issues i am definitely all for the right for women to choose i think women should choose to be career women or single and childless forever if they want this life but as you said just because women can choose does not mean they can still blame the patriarchy compared to most of the world american women have so much freedom and privilege and i just feel like they are so ungrateful take them to live in saudi arabia or nigeria for a month and see if they would rather go back to the us ,10,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,hmm i have not seen the antimuslim rhetoric on rpw but i actually live under sharia law right now i find it strange if rpw is completely against sharia law because i have noticed it coincides with a lot of rpw philosophy and i have noticed in my country women actually get a lot of benefits i do not think sharia law is as anti woman as westerners think especially if they have never lived directly under it ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, in my mind i am always thinking it would be better if i were more beautiful yes me too not saying that i am going to let myself go but i wo not feel as stressed if i am out in flats and some girl in short skirt and high heels walks by my boyfriend ,5,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,thank you so much for this i was actually having this exact insecurity lately and reading your post has calmed my fears i feel more confident in my strengths and what i have to offer to my boyfriend because he dated a supermodel before and i felt like i just could not compare in any way thanks again for clearing out the man brain regarding beauty in their eyes edit just watched the video and it amazing i had the same problem with my boyfriend for a phase him looking at other women in daily life but then i realized he also looked at ugly and fat women and i also realized we would not see them again ever he was not going to go up and try to get their number and that he probably forgot about them as well however i do find it fascinating how women seem to remember which girls he looked at because i certainly can tell you the exact moments and which girls i caught him looking at but men do not remember at all why is that ,10,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,if slutty girls are usually less freaky but often act freaky with men to please them then are they freaky or not sounds like a millennial version of how much wood would a woodchuck chuck but it does not make sense to me just out of curiosity ahaha ,0,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i love it when men surprise you it means they are actually thinking of how to make you happy ,3,RedPillWives

vanBeethovenLudwig,my boyfriend pushes through all difficulties by himself yet still treats me like gold and still strives to be a better man he always checks up on me to make sure i am ok and he always there to console me on my worries he my protector and not to mention he sexy as hell physically and he just makes me melt whenever he looks at me even when he just laying in bed on his phone he so sexy i am getting turned on just writing this haha i cannot believe such an amazing man chose to be with me edit just had a memory when my boyfriend obnoxious 34yo career woman business partner invited us to a club she paid for a 1000 private table for a group of friends because she super rich she dressed obnoxiously fancy in luxury italian brands she and my boyfriend are italian and was trying to be funny and loud at the table and rousing everyone to dance basically acting like a frat boy and her boyfriend was not paying any attention to her he literally just sat on the couch while she danced by herself and there was no effort from him to be a couple with her however my boyfriend was the perfect gentleman to me he poured me my drink and led me dancing the whole night beat that career woman ,4,RedPillWives
vanBeethovenLudwig,interesting analogy nonetheless understandable ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i noticed this habit in the uk and italy as well more female smokers my family is from asia and smoking is so frowned upon that if a woman chooses to smoke a cigarette it the equivalent of basically screaming she is not wife material it seems like in certain european countries the men do not care if the woman smokes they will still marry them ,0,AskReddit
vanBeethovenLudwig,all of my close female friends speak well of their husbands most of them are a little older mid 30 and up and they do not gossip when we spend time together we usually do activities like go see a movie bake together go to the mall go to food festivals try new restaurants go to concerts i am 27 and i am hardly socializing with women my age anymore i do not know if it the age range my friends are in or perhaps their cultures they are not american but i do not maintain or pursue friendships with the types of women you speak of ,16,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,yeah i understand it also goes for women marrying betas worshippers though does not it however does having an ugly but easy wife really better than having an attractive wife that makes the man look like a baller eg trump and melania ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,yay here to forming more whiteheads in the future haha ,2,AsianBeauty
vanBeethovenLudwig,i have always had problems with hormonal breakouts the cystic acne would form then go back down verrrrrry slowly and leave pih however i started using aha the past few weeks and i noticed a normal cystic acne forming then after applying aha for a few days it turned into a whitehead eventually popped by itself in the shower and went down with the cyst forming into a whitehead instead of maintaining a cyst does that mean it actually purging out of my skin it seemed like in the past the cysts just went back into my skin only to later resurface again ,1,AsianBeauty
vanBeethovenLudwig,the voice is crucial to being feminine it can make or break your allure however the good thing is you do not necessarily need a high pitched and dainty voice to be feminine you can have a low and breathy voice too which is more seductive also this is where the fun starts you can have a low and dainty voice a high and breathy voice as well the only rule i would caution whether or not you have a high or low voice is to avoid sounding monotone monotone is not sensual at all neither is being harsh and booming try watching some old movies to hear samples of feminine voices for example reese witherspoon in legally blonde has a chirpy dainty high pitched voice audrey hepburn in breakfast at tiffany has a breathy dainty low pitched voice see how it works in your favor my voice is naturally lower so i play up the breathy dainty sensual qualities when i speak edit also wanted to add you can have moments of a higher pitched voice even if your voice is naturally low for instance if you are excited about something and you let out a squeal it most likely a bit higher pitched but if you are discussing setting up a coffee date with a girlfriend you are probably using your naturally lower voice take into consideration your moods and emotions and how your voice changes accordingly ,10,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i have been using cosrx aha power liquid for almost three weeks and seeing good results in making some of my acne come to a head it just now i noticed some small ice pick scars from the past how long should i wait until i try vitamin a ,2,AsianBeauty
vanBeethovenLudwig,great so maybe would a good example starting regimen be aha once a week vitamin a twice a week rest other days i have a few pigment spots could i just dab some vitamin c on them would i have to put the vitamin c on another day or can i layer the vitamin c with the aha and vitamin a ,2,AsianBeauty
vanBeethovenLudwig,beautiful second question can i effectively pair aha with retinol or vitamin c with retinol right now i am experimenting with aha bha to get rid of cc and acne but i have also got some acne scars not pigmentation ones i thought aha would help with them but it seems like retinol is better ,1,AsianBeauty
vanBeethovenLudwig,what is the difference between using aha vitamin c and retinol for wrinkles ,2,AsianBeauty
vanBeethovenLudwig, fat girls are good in bed but they are not attractive while attractive girls are bad but attractive this is always so fascinating to me because it seems like it goes for personality too my boyfriend has been on dates with a lot of 9 and claims there no personality or chemistry with them my theory is obsessing about your looks too much leads to a doormat woman and rpw is smart enough to know smv looks is not everything and we should develop our rmv through personality smart men also realize that pretty women are just for visual appreciation and there needs to be something more under there to develop love even though men like to be dominant sometimes if they pull all the strings at work with kids friends family they have the need to let go and be taken care of yes this so much my boyfriend was so stressed for a few months he was basically coming to me for comfort and nurturing we did not go out for two months and just stayed home feminine way of letting your man lose control is taking on the motherly approach not nagging or being aggressive i recommend home cooked meal quiet time at the dinner table and oral sex ,7,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig, note that cuckold was an insult in italy the man was viewed as responsible for not being a proper husband and in effect making the spouse cheat this is correct my boyfriend is italian and it a huge problem in the infidelity of the country italian men tend to be portrayed as cheating scum but actually a lot of cheating comes from the woman because in rp translation he did not maintain her tingles a lot of italian men who are sick of being under appreciated are looking to wed foreigners currently russians africans and asians are popular feminism is rampant in italy similar to us where the women are entitled and expect the man to be a beta and worship them but are confused when they are not attracted anymore the only difference in italy is both the man and woman are out for themselves if there a sign of a problem they run there no sense of solving a problem together ,2,RedPillWives

vanBeethovenLudwig,this is good the gradual submission i feel like a man still needs to know how well a woman would be a proper wife before getting married and if you are going from only a girlfriend straight to wife with no extra vetting steps in between on both sides that sounds like a recipe for disaster ,3,RedPillWives

vanBeethovenLudwig,yes sunscreen is life cultural norms like tanning binge drinking and smoking make certain ethnicities age easier i have seen some pretty attractive women in their 40 that are still slim and dress well but it the wrinkles that make a huge difference my 56 yo mother gets mistaken for my older sister all the time we are asian and i am not 30 yet she obsessive about maintaining appearance though plus we have oily skin in our family so wrinkles do not form as easily hydrate and protect your skin ,6,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig,sad story and that awful to hear about yourself but what about the same for men would not men also want their first choice girl i certainly do not want to be a wife just because he thinks he cannot do better it definitely better to date a man that older and has significant dating experience because now he knows what he wants in a woman i had issues with both my first two ltrs whom i was their first serious girlfriend and the exact same thing happened they both told me i think you are amazing and i do not want to lose you but i want to see what else is out there could we still stay friends but i would like to have sex with other girls how do you think that makes me feel if i was good enough i do not think they would have told me this yeah then i broke up with both of them for varying reasons and a year later they came crawling back begging to be together again and how they could not find a girl as good as me do you really think i am going to get back together with you just because you were too stupid to realize you had a good thing in front of you this whole time and then you made me feel inadequate my boyfriend is seven years older and he had plenty of women he tells me he likes being with me because we are a good match in varying ways sex companionship relationship dynamic life goals he dated liberal girls and now knows he wants a traditional relationship he dated supermodels and now knows he wants a family oriented girl he dated poor girls and now knows he wants a girl who he does not also have to take care of her parents financially he dated posh girls and now knows he wants a girl that more down to earth he dated obese girls and now knows he wants a girl who values fitness he dated dumb pretty girls and now knows he would still like someone to have an intellectual conversation with in this case i trust him because i know he had a lot of women he seen what is out there and now he looking for a life partner ,1,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig,yeah i understand unfortunately this type of interaction is not going to get you anywhere in dating guys want to see who you are they are not looking for a therapist sharing yourself does not mean you have to gush about your inner feelings and try to analyze them or be loud and aggressive for example my friends invited me for a breakfast party today so i made a tiramis for them my friend tried it before and loved it so i thought it would be a nice gift i was excited because i remember i have a pretty blue and gold ribbon so i used it to make the tiramis box pretty then you can talk about how you met these friends etc does that sound like indulging on everything to you it sounds like someone having a conversation to me what sorts of things are you afraid of sharing to other people are they your problems and anxieties or are you just so private about yourself you are not able to talk about yourself hobbies or the weather ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,hmm it depends i was also afraid of coming off as boring but one thing i realized is sometimes it just ok to be the listener in the group relationship or adding that peaceful aura to the group cannot you think about some friends who are more quiet but you still invite them out though i do recommend to try to talk about yourself sometimes i usually share stories about my own life or i will share my opinion about something or give advice if they are asking i think you are thinking of the people who just seem to be the center of attention and get the crowd going and seem to always have a running stream of thoughts and i do not recommend trying to be this person if you are not you just have to learn how to use your strengths to contribute as long as you do interesting activities you are an interesting person it just up to you to share it my boyfriend knows i am an interesting person but i am quiet he does not mind and probably one of the reasons we are together is he understands this about me ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i went through a similar phase as you i am also pretty quiet and reserved then tried to be more outspoken which was not me here what i think helped me develop my confidence understand that it also attractive to be soft spoken do not feel pressure to be someone you are not learn to give a small smile to look less anxious if you are feeling nervous for not talking also learn to develop a calm but cheerful air about you that does not need talking learn to make some small but witty comments that you can interject into conversation i tend to not talk so much in a group of people because i am mostly listening but i will say a small joke and smile which helps me seem less shy try not to have a stoic face when you are listening observing conversation it fine to smile along but not say anything you do not owe it to anyone to be loud or outspoken ,8,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,thanks i do feel better about my decision now even when i know it the right thing to do and it just social pressure telling me i am being ridiculous plus i think it still leaves a nice romantic element of moving in together because you are now man and wife that being after you have done the practical thing of vetting each other carefully before you have decided to get married i have a friend about my age who has been living with her boyfriend for almost five years he makes good money but he has not asked her to marry him and now she starting to have hypergamous thoughts i just do not want this situation happening to me when i move in it for good ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i was raised that sharing a house is for marriage my brother and his wife abided by this rule but of course they had taken some vacations together and stayed at each other places prior to that i am 27 and never have lived with a boyfriend sometimes i feel insecure or stupid but the opportunity never came up i also do not feel the urge to live with a boyfriend though i am not clingy or desperate for company and i have got my finances under check there was never a reason to but we will see how it works in my favor my current boyfriend knows i cannot live together before marriage and he pretty accepting of it but like i said i do feel insecure when my friends who have cohabited ask me do not you think you should see how it goes before marrying but to me it not my decision to make i strongly feel it should be the man to ask me to live with him ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,why is it sad we chose to live this life just like you chose to be independent working unmarried and childfree i do not think it sad for women who chose to live your lifestyle if that what you really want and i am genuinely happy for my female friends who do not want family because now there less stigma to be unmarried the point of the post was saying it more difficult for a woman who chooses to live a traditional lifestyle now also if you are going crazy reading opinions from traditional women because this is what this sub is about why are you here you should know these are the kind of responses you would get ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,his english grammar is terrible and he omits a lot of words when texting because he lazy eg is bad i go what we do he do not do nothing he talks like this because he translates directly from his native language it actually pretty endearing and i love him for it also whenever he starving he eats with his eyes bugged out ,2,AskReddit
vanBeethovenLudwig, no you do not get both because you chose one skill set over the other and now you are no use to my household it like this type cannot accept reality this is the problem with feminists they expect it all they expect that they can have a high powered career independent life where they do whatever they want and a sexy husband that will help out with household chores and childrearing at least traditional women understand that if we choose to be more family oriented and more of a traditional wife we know that means we wo not be a rich businesswoman or a high powered lawyer we have accepted that but feminists have not accepted that having what they want for themselves comes with a disadvantage they just expect everything for themselves ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,yeah and i guess for people who do want that equality can have it i am just glad there are still men who want a cute younger wife to take care of and i am not forced to be equal if i do not want to ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, i now do my survival camping alone or with a family member it much more rewarding and does not scare the girlfriend when it time to gut and cook squirrels haha that great my boyfriend has a dream to go on a long motorcycle trip around africa and when i said i will stay home and you can whatsapp me pictures he looked surprised and said you are not coming and when i replied no i would just slow you down and probably be cranky on my period he just looked so relieved he kissed me on the forehead as you mentioned in another reply i would rather be his lover and baby girl than be his friend it keeps the relationship more romantic this way ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, but it might have to do with age the guys i meet are all in their 20 having similar hobbies seems to be super important to them i think this is part of it i am 27 but when i remember dating in my earlier 20 a lot of forming relationships were based on interests and similar hobbies now that i am late 20 and dating men in their 30 they have more expectations of having good wife qualities and some interests of my own so does not have to be the same interests i feel a lot less pressure dating now i feel like i can just be myself and not have to compete to be successful and interesting enough i also notice a lot of my friends who have significant others 2 years their age has the type of relationship as you stated equal my boyfriend seven years older than me and i feel more of this traditional dynamic with him ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,yes this is what i meant ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,tagging along into this conversation this was what i meant it not enough to be an attractive nurturing feminine woman to find a high smv man you need to have a job preferably an interesting one that is not minimum wage your own group of friends and hobbies like a man my ex boyfriend and i had issues because he been brainwashed into thinking females are equal to males we had a fight because we went on a 4 day trekking trip in the mountains and i could not hike as fast as him i am average shape not an athlete but exercise regularly and i am 5 4 he was 6 4 guess who had longer legs and bigger muscles and the testosterone to hike faster this was one of the breaking points in our relationship i did not want to be equal to him but he just expected me to because women can do it just as well as men ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i also agree and i do believe if the woman has the ability and works hard she deserves the money job i am just saying it more difficult for men to have good jobs now with the competition of women ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,you are not a doormat but your pleasantry is another issue ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,why are you in a rpw sub may i ask ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i am a teacher so i work with families and obviously they have a traditional sense of life otherwise they would not be raising kids and would be out in the world doing their own thing i cannot dress crazy punk rock grunge in front of children it sets a bad tone and i would get parents complaining it not my style anyway it just interesting that once children are in the picture a more conservative sense of style is automatically implemented ,3,RedPillWives
vanBeethovenLudwig,i think the us is more focused on family and community than most people think for example my taiwanese friend lived in nyc for a while now she married to a german man and has spent christmas in germany which definitely has a beautiful environment however she criticized americans from not having a family feel during the holidays but i have had two american boyfriends spent christmas with them and i can tell you that they emphasize the family a lot during christmas lots of relatives gift giving with some family traditions some are individual traditions and just overall a sense of joy and family so i was confused to why my friend thinks an american christmas is just two people sitting together at home by themselves volunteering is a big part of american culture so you will see children teenagers college students and adults volunteering i do enjoy this aspect i grew up in a small but very diverse city so i think there was more of a need for community for example at my high school there were ridiculous amounts of associations asian american association indian american association math club chess club skaters club thespians break dancing club so yes i suppose there is a sense of if you are interested in something then you are able to find your group usually americans are pretty willing to help others for example during the flint michigan water crisis a lot of people from my city rallied and donated bottled water but of course this does not get said on bbc or cnn only the fact that the white governor disadvantaged the black city angle was written people are pretty friendly and willing to help although it a little different in the big cities where people have a faster pace of life my high school was big on fundraising from the community so there were lots of events to raise money for trips or scholarships i do not know about others but our neighbors do look out for each other my family asian but our caucasian neighbors have helped us get the mail whenever we have been traveling and my dad helps the husband with his computer problems haha that being said there still a lot of things wrong with the country and some of the benefits also come with a slew of social and economic problems there a lot of things i hate about the us and sometimes wished i lived in europe but i always thought socialist countries would have more of a sense of community than the us because of a more coherent cultural identity and less individuality my boyfriend southern italian as mediterranean as you can get haha i visited sicily and it seems like there a general sense of sicilian identity and he always goes on about how great the public service is medical for instance the only thing he complains about italy is the lack of freedom to be an entrepreneur because rich italians already have a monopoly on their major brands he claims the italian government just wants their citizens to be employees and not try to advance the economy one thing i did notice was that in the us people seems more proactive about changing their situation whether it economic or personal whereas in italy they are just totally accepting of their life and what it offers them my boyfriend left italy for this reason how different is portugal from this so even with socialist policies you do not feel like you belong ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, i have also watched friends and aquaintances of mine change the way they dress and groom according to their political opinions in both directions it fascinating is not it my conservative friends have a classically sensual style while my liberal friends have either a hipster grunge or dumpy style ,3,RedPillWives
vanBeethovenLudwig, to be honest i admire the us on that matter you guys do seem to have a totally different spirit about the growth and well being of each community could you explain more on this my socialist mediterranean boyfriend seems to think american communities are horrible and do not think about the wellbeing of the community which i disagree plenty happens in helping the disadvantaged where i grew up in the us also my boyfriend has never been to the us he just making assumptions off of the news and documentaries i would think european countries in general think more about the wellbeing of a community because of its more socialist policies ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,yes but there are ways to go about learning about each other living habits before marriage such as taking vacations together where you have to spend time together not living together before marriage does not mean that you cannot stay overnight at your boyfriend girlfriends place as well you are just not paying rent together or sharing the space together long term also i just strongly believe that a couple who is committed and willing to work through problems should be able to solve most living habit problems little things like messiness or who does the chores etc should be discussed beforehand not cohabiting because it a romantic idea to live together and then realizing you hate the other person however smoking cigarettes in house extreme example is ridiculous to me you should know your future husband wife smokes cigarettes in the house before you marry them and live with them the fact that i am down voted for being pro save living together for marriage in a rp subreddit is just proof that people think the option is ridiculous now ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,there nothing wrong with what you stated above and i also enjoy some of the benefits mentioned however the point of the post is that now we have swung the other way feminism is so widely accepted that if you do not want to live a feminist life you are now shamed or thought of as stuck in the 18th century i work but i also chose to live a more traditional lifestyle but i am mocked by my friends often both male and female especially as i am not affiliated with any religious institution as you said i will continue with my choice but it comes with difficulties because of what i listed ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,coming from my own upbringing my conservative mother did train me well on grooming and appearance i always had to look put together not just because i was a girl but because it was respectful she taught me that showing up to a friend house or to a dinner party not groomed or stylish showed disregard for the other person i was teased for a while in college because i was always dressed up i refused to wear t shirts with my college name on it but i thought it was strange how my friends thought i was dressing up i just thought it was standard ,7,RedPillWives
vanBeethovenLudwig,that also another issue men expect women to have a career now so if the woman does not work she boring lazy uninteresting that why only extremist religions are ok with young women not working and anything secular does not accept it ,4,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, however we very intentionally take good care of ourselves and are constantly courting each other we never stop showing the other how much we love and admire each other i do acknowledge and appreciate this the fact that you have to work harder to stay attractive i definitely think the old generation has let themselves go more and then expect their partners to still be attracted if you do not mind me asking why is he your captain if you do not plan on ever living with him do you still consider each other a team even though you do not share a space ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, nothing can take the place of a woman in a man life with virtue and character this is a universal truth to all men of good heart and mind this is wonderful to hear and it makes me feel better as a traditional woman amongst a sea of attention seeking women thanks for your response ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, i do not think however that having a good income is something that should hurt the relationships i do not think the basis of the relationship should be that the woman is cornered it more like that both sides benefit more when they are together than they would when they were alone no it depends ideally it should be as you mentioned both people benefiting but when a man has a much lower income than the woman he less attractive in her eyes usually or if a man is still traditional thinking that he should provide at least the bulk of an income because maybe the woman has a job but only makes enough to cover smaller expenses then he in trouble ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, harming the family unit which is the foundation of a successful society i think this is what i am worried about mostly it not even about female independence anymore there just so many options out there for both men and women it accessible for everyone to move to another country to get social benefits through rideshare to network and make business connections through social media men have options too they do not have to stay in a 9 5 job and provide for a family anymore they can choose to jump from country to country sampling different jobs and cultures having temporary girlfriends perfect for any alpha type male people nowadays now equate success and purpose to accomplishments outside of raising a family no amount of technology will ever replace that soft femininity which is so warm and welcoming this is true and my own boyfriend is beginning to be aware of the benefit of a loyal feminine girlfriend he had a liberal circle of friends and lifestyle before but he actually told me how he appreciates a girl who is sweet nurturing respectful but also likes to travel and explore and i have not given him a reason to leave me because i am conscious of what i have to offer in the relationship ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,the men you are talking about might be beta men i have never had trouble with letting a man re initiate contact every time it shows they are proactive and wanting to earn your interest does not it make you feel comforted that he interested enough in you to actively contact you ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i am american but my boyfriend is european and some of the points i made refers to some problems i saw with his culture and also the modernization of his long standing traditional culture for instance he does complain that now that women work he does not feel needed to take care of the family even women in his culture do not feel like men should be the head of the family anymore even though all the parents generation was traditional like this this is coming from a socialist european country also many men and women are cohabiting in his country without being married either 1 simply they want companionship not marriage which makes sense but also 2 because the man cannot make enough money to provide a house by himself he needs to split the cost with the woman this goes back to how women entering the workforce leaves less money for men to make ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, 2 traditionally minded men have more difficulty marrying nowadays because their are very few women that are worth the 50 chance of divorce yes this is true even my own boyfriend is aware of this women initiating divorce so he has to be careful who he chooses as his wife 4 due to social media and the internet it easy for women to find friends hook ups or relationships that means there less incentive to stay with one man for the rest of your life when so many men are giving her attention online my boyfriend told me a story of how he had a friend who only married his wife for three months because then he found out she was cheating on him through whatsapp by sending nudes to another man ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, girls go to schools and chase carriers too but not because they are liberated but because their parents tell them you need to have a job so that you do not need to stay with a husband who abusive because you have nowhere to go this is true and my parents came from a patriarchal culture before immigrating to america so i do see some of this in my mother she was a freelance teacher so she made some money but she was also helpless in a lot of ways my father had to take care of her which makes him lose his freedom you are right there no one good option ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, to me it is just impractical i see your point and while i definitely agree that it useful to understand how the living situation would work before marriage i feel like this is a disadvantage for the woman she basically gives the man a lifestyle of having a wife assuming they are a traditional type couple without securing the commitment the man benefits from having a woman in the house without giving commitment how many couples do you know live together for years and years usually the woman hoping to lead to marriage then break up with the rise of relationship culture hook ups cohabitation without marriage transient situations i think it up to the woman to protect herself from unfortunate situations like the one listed above yes though i find temporary companionship very unfulfilling when its done that reassuring to know that there are still men who do not want a hookup ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, talk less about the men i am dating with my girlfriends girltalk can lead to overanalyzation my god this is so true now that i am working i stay alone a lot so i just do my own thing but then when i do have some girl time and we discuss my situation i always feel more unsettled afterwards instead of comforted i do not even talk to my roommates about my boyfriend anymore even when they pry i change the subject and am really vague it starts to bother me now when people invade my privacy ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i found it kind of difficult with my last boyfriend because he liked me for my ambition i am not really a career woman i am a teacher and artist so it slightly different because it made me interesting and other girls he dated were lazy and boring but at the same time he was really insecure about his own successes i never tried to compete with him but when i showed him what i was doing with no aggression he would still always one up me it was like he was with me to feel better about himself having a high status girlfriend but was insecure that he was not as successful as me ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, the reason ambition for women can be an issue is because it makes you attracted to less men because women want a man who is at a higher caliber in the things they care about otherwise they will lose whatever initial attraction was there over time this i know successful females that stay single because they cannot find a man that better than them usually high powered lawyers or business women ,4,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,no worries it totally normal it also helped me to be more self absorbed meaning playing up my confidence in myself it difficult to ignore the competition of other women but guys generally do not like it when a girl is insecure and compares herself to other women i was insecure because i have a cute and innocent face i dress well and sensual but i just do not have that sexy model face i have a girl next door face and my boyfriend comes from a latin culture where a lot of the women have that sexy look i show my legs sometimes but i just do not like my boobs hanging out like other girls also do not have a lot of boobs also another insecurity once i stopped voicing my jealousy and insecurity focused on myself my personal style interests and morality i noticed my boyfriend gravitating more towards me ,3,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig,i have had your exact concerns before with my boyfriend he 34 and i am 27 i wonder sometimes why he does not choose a 21 yo girlfriend who more physically beautiful i am not bad myself but i am not a supermodel i actually voiced my concern and he said young and beautiful are good for sex but life is not just about sex i have had young and beautiful girls and they are now my ex girlfriend i think you are overly concerned about rp theory even a supermodel who gets married to a man a few years older than her will age and lose her smv also even if a 50 year old man wanted to have a 21 yo wife most likely the 21 yo wo not marry him because the age difference is too much unless she is purely a gold digger smv will always be a worry but if your guy is a decent guy he will understand inevitable aging and the deeper meanings of relationships edit beware of your anxiety if you are unable to suppress it it could bring down your rmv work on having respect for yourself and being comfortable with your value and what you have to offer ,3,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig,yes and there a small spot where there were already small bumps before i started the bha that i am watching carefully i am hoping the bha will slowly get rid of them but the new bumps popping up purge i have also noticed some blackhead gunk the sebaceous stuff that comes out when you squeeze one mysteriously popping out on my face when i have not squeezed any out assuming the exfoliation is working ,1,AsianBeauty

vanBeethovenLudwig,i have never heard a rumor about myself actually does this mean i am boring or inoffensive ,1,AskReddit
vanBeethovenLudwig,well i think there was leftover cleanser that i was not getting off that became a breeding ground for bacteria and also the act of rinsing is a physical irritant to my skin waiting 15 min to lets it calm down ,5,AsianBeauty
vanBeethovenLudwig,what does cc stand for not color correcting cream the other one ,1,AsianBeauty
vanBeethovenLudwig,rinsing my cleanser off extremely well and also waiting 15 min after cleansing before beginning my essences serums this drastically cut down on irritation of my skin and acne as well ,13,AsianBeauty
vanBeethovenLudwig,thanks also another question does it make sense to add cortisone cream on top of the existing cystic acne after bha to reduce redness inflammation ,1,AsianBeauty
vanBeethovenLudwig,hmm that makes sense i guess i will try the bha on the jawline instead of doing half and half does aha work better on blackheads ,1,AsianBeauty
vanBeethovenLudwig,my jawline is worse in that i have a few cystic acne and little bumps i just have some blackheads on my nose and my forehead is pretty clear so i guess it will just take more time for the acids to break through my jawline bumps ,1,AsianBeauty
vanBeethovenLudwig,thanks for the reply however i do not feel like my question is fully answered why the acids are working faster on my t zone than on my jawline because i am using them on both areas again i am using aha on nose and left jawline bha on forehead and right jawline ,1,AsianBeauty

vanBeethovenLudwig,i also agree with you but who to say this when our own rpw reading list has a book that called marry him the case for settling for mr good enough sloppy seconds also implies that maybe the husband actually wanted to marry a trashy woman but could not so he settled for a classy one which in this case is different than just sleeping around with no intentions and marrying a woman who is worth it for example i know this russian man whose first wife was a beautiful korean pianist they had a child together but she ended up having an affair with his colleague so they divorced and the russian man found a second wife who was still beautiful but not to the same sexiness as the korean woman i feel like this situation is more of a sloppy seconds for the second wife ,2,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig, something i have noticed is that women who do not work or work very much sometimes treat their family members like shit this is interesting my mother is a part time teacher and she quite a domineering one at that i think it rolls into the household but i also am a teacher but i do not criticize my students for doing things wrong so i guess i do not understand why she gets so worked up about other people when it does not affect her she sort of brings unhappiness upon herself i was probably in my 20s before i started standing up to my mother i did it quietly i did not rage i just pointed out when she was being inappropriate actually this reminds me of one time when i did stand up to her i was trying to teach her how to make a tiramis and told her that we could start after she finished her coffee she told me we could start now so i began showing her and she got flustered and accused me of forcing her to finish her coffee i just told her i said we could start after you finished your coffee and you were the one who told me to start now do not blame me and i walked away she actually stfu and calmed down afterwards i guess i am just afraid my boyfriend will disapprove of me standing up to my mother because his mother is the opposite of mine very sweet docile nothing critical in his eyes if someone stands up to their mother it a bad thing but he does not know what it like to have a mother like mine i do not know if i should try to explain my mother to him i have already slipped it in conversation here and there like i mentioned my mother forced my dad to move down into the basement when i was 10 because she did not like his snoring ,4,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig,yes i am an expat it a long story but it was a life long dream of mine to go to africa and teach music which is what i did two years ago then a heartbreak left me alone in africa with no plan i did not want to go back to the us another reason is the nature of my job i can only be a freelancer and this amazing job popped up which i interviewed and got this is my second year living in the middle east my parents were immigrants so they crossed the pond first but to be honest i am glad i do not live in the us anymore although it helped my family a lot economically ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,are there even refining schools in the us anymore i did not even hear of any growing up at least in my state it pretty sad people are learning to be feminine masculine via magazines you can tell the difference in the girls who read cosmo in behavior and attitude ,2,RedPillWives
vanBeethovenLudwig,sicilians are actually quite genteel they are still fiery though it comes out but they are not jabbering all the time my boyfriend is stoic but fiery fiery does not mean loud it can mean an inner fire or passion i find it really sexy he does not bare all to the world but i know there always wheels turning in there for instance when we are chatting it usually me being all bright and chirpy and he just staring intently at me not saying anything then he will suddenly say some witty response that comes out of nowhere and i am either laughing at his joke or playful hitting him flare ups are part of life i am an artist so i am temperamental and actually he my rock he an engineer i definitely cry in front of him and sometimes argue but he does not mind because he knows i will listen to him in the end i think he enjoys solving my problems emotions and it makes our relationship more interesting than if i just agreed with everything take note that even though i am stubborn and argue sometimes i still respect him never have i ever criticized him or belittled him it a little different we are both pretty passionate people it makes for a more meaningful life but we are all different people who want or need different things i do not think i could be with someone who had no passion for life and what it can offer it all about the chemistry he sets me off and i set him off but we are still cooperative i do not know if you are thinking of sicilian americans like in nyc because my boyfriend was born and raised in sicily he never been to america sicilians are genteel because of the mediterranean island mentality and good weather but sicilian americans are a lot louder and aggressive because of being in a massive city and also being in america ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,actually you are right i have forgotten about that my mother went to an all girl school in asia and part of their education was how to become a good wife and be a proper lady in manners luckily she taught me what she knew when i was growing up big emphasis on husband being the leader i do find it a bit sad it not as common anymore i just saw a video of jennifer lawrence doing an interview on a talkshow and she was pretty crass in her speech and actions i actually felt a bit sad that both men and women like that nowadays ,3,RedPillWives

vanBeethovenLudwig, useless parliamentary processes that seem to grind the country to a halt my boyfriend is sicilian he just told me even though he graduated with an engineering degree almost ten years ago he still has to pay to take a refresher class to renew the credit so he can stay on a list of engineers i was shocked at this law because it so obviously just taking money from citizens the negative attitude towards almost everything my boyfriend also told me italians are all depressed people because of economy but italians are also pretty humorous and fun people i wonder if it like a facade to keep the situation from feeling less severe ,1,AskReddit
vanBeethovenLudwig,my boyfriend is sicilian and he hates this about italy as well from what i gather italians are quite intelligent and creative people but the government and mindset of people deter business either there too much government disinterest in people starting their own businesses people do not know how to do proper business or people do not want to pay for things ,3,AskReddit

vanBeethovenLudwig,he sicilian ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,a bit of both his culture and family environment growing up gave him the instincts but he also developed himself over the years ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i do not know it would have to depend on a lot of things for instance if i think my friend makes reckless decisions and does not take his life seriously then there no amount of attraction that would lure me into being in a serious relationship with him i might be attracted short term but i would not see him as ltr material the only time i started feeling attraction to a guy friend whom i was not attracted to before was when i had not seen him in a while then he came back looking lean and ripped with a life mission but also a idgaf attitude at the same time in an rp dynamic men and women are not supposed to be friends you have to think about protecting your woman treat her like you are her bodyguard i can cross the street myself but when my boyfriend takes my hand and pulls me to the side instead of the middle of the crosswalk to avoid the crowd i feel protected ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i do not really know how to explain it but i can give you an example with a guy friend girlfriend me hi how it going what is new him not much just really busy tell me about your life me blshblahblah update how about you him blahblahblah update are you seeing anyone me yeah have a boyfriend blahblah and you him actually we broke up a few months ago i am really heartbroken blahblah me sorry to hear do you need to talk about it him blahblahblah yeah so we should hang out soon me yeah definitely with my boyfriend me hi him how are you baby me goooood you him fine proceeds to ignore me for a bit because he has shit to do what did you do today me blahblahblah him we started a new project in a villa today they made the deposit to us me oh wow cool baby him does not answer for a bit me are you hungry him not yet i ate lunch late proceeds to ignore me because he has shit to do me are you hungry now him yes me ok baby i will go cook dinner him good to put it short when women talk to each other we like to analyze things and come up with different solutions and ideas together when i talk to my boyfriend he suggests something and i can take it or leave it it clear he the dominant one also when he talks more about himself it gives me a glimpse of how he thinks and how he handles things when a woman wants a captain to make the big decisions i need to make sure i can agree and trust his decision making but notice that when my boyfriend talks to me he not necessarily talking about his feelings he talking about the things he doing with his life and his vision for the future does that make sense when he was courting me he would show me random things like interesting videos and pictures of his travels and his architectural designs he showing me who he is and what is he interested in not gabbing about his feelings i think it also helps that english is not his first language so he probably seems more like a stoic caveman ahaha ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,blue pill ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,good ways the guy checks us out like we are attractive assuming we have dressed up for him pays for us even when we insist on splitting the bill does chivalrous things like open the door and walk on the outside or pick me up from my house basically if you are actively pursuing the girl we will feel desirable and attractive if you are making us chase you we think you do not care about us bad ways he talks to me like a he a girlfriend of mine it strange because a lot of girls say they wish the guy would ask more questions about her instead of only talking about himself but i find it really unattractive but i think these girls might be bp feminists i do not talk to my boyfriend like he a girlfriend and he does not talk to me like one of the guys i think it the worst turnoff for me all actions aside if your character does not seem masculine and dominant i can sense it that probably what does it for me ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,when i go on a first date i am vetting him as a future husband i am looking at his interests job conversation topics where he takes me pretty much him as a person and full package most of the time i do not continue on a second date is chemistry unfortunately it just a gut feeling he not the right person although he nice and smart and funny etc for me i am looking for the chemistry of feeling protected and led by him ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,ah ok this makes more sense actually yes i would dump him because it would make me feel like he does not desire me a guy should make it known he actually wants to pursue the girl or else we feel like we are not doing it for him usually if chemistry is going well kissing happens on the second or third date then after that is when it gets physical ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,it does not happen this way for me you should let him lead or else you risk looking like you only want a hookup ,1,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig,when i stated my lifting program i could not activate my glutes at all last night i did barbell hip thrusts at 25kg and feeling the deep burn finally ,13,xxfitness
vanBeethovenLudwig,ahahahaha this is pretty funny but quite accurate i had a redneck boyfriend that studied civil engineering and was into building houses and tools etc he was pretty uncultured which annoyed me at the time because i am a musician and really into traveling and culture history and grew up in a diverse city but he was a very honest and dominant man who puts his pride onto protecting his family he would never let me lift heavy things and had that serious protective instinct also even though i was knowledgeable in more worldly subjects than him he had this insane work ethic that made me fall hard for him my current boyfriend i suppose you could consider an italian redneck he grew up in the countryside so he has not traveled as much as me but he also very traditional and family oriented and has all the qualities i listed above too both of them had this raw masculine sexuality that you do not find in a lot of men who work in offices i find liberal men more bp nowadays ,5,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig,well it depends i like to let it be spontaneous usually kissing happens on the second and third dates fourth date is when we get more hands on but that could be anything basically i do not let him touch my body until the fourth date but like i said about 99 of my dates do not go past the second date i vet very carefully and i am aware if i agree to go on a third date i am also silently agreeing that i am willing to have sex with them eventually so i usually cut it off before then ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,for me it the fourth date if he does not hold out for me until then he was just looking for a hookup the majority of my dating does not go past the second date for this reason it not a bad thing he so into you you just have to make sure what kind of girl he sees you as ,10,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i agree with you to not talk about it until his career is more stable but here where it more complicated we met abroad he resigned his job and had to go back home because he cannot stay in the country without a work visa and the new job is in a different country that about 8 hour flight from my current working country gosh globalization makes romance difficult so we are long distance for about one month before i go visit him in his home country for christmas then he moves to a new country for his new job and then i do not know what happens next we talked about him going to see how the job is and if it secure then i will move there under his salary and freelance i am just afraid of when he moves in january we will lose touch long distance is difficult the next time i can take holiday is in april i am a teacher that 3 5 months before i can see him it a long time i am willing to wait for him i am just afraid that even if he finds his job secure there a chance he still does not see me in his life long term ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,here the thing i tend not to date men who have their careers settled i am not doing it on purpose but the chemistry happens i am in love but i find out they are insecure in their career which is fine by me because i am looking for someone to build a life with i am looking at their character and intelligence and how they deal with life the problem is my boyfriend does not feel this way he the most intelligent and hardworking man i know and i am proud of being a supportive girlfriend to him and i have made it clear i would support his career over mind i have a very unlucrative career i know i am a good girlfriend and he told me i am amazing he knows i would like to be have a family but because he had issues holding down a job he feels insecure and cannot even think about it at this moment he got fired from his last job then his current job had problems with his boss so he resigned but he just got offered a new job with a big company which he waiting to move to in one month before people start saying why are you with a guy who cannot hold down a job well we do not live in usa and the job prospects and economy are more unstable than you think outside of the us he learned english just so he could move out of his home country and make a better life for himself i know in my heart he is a disciplined and hardworking man who learns from his mistakes and tries to solve his problems yet still treats me like gold the problem is i think he been through so much uncertainty in his career that he just not in the right mindset right now but i cannot tell if it me or the job issues i have told him that couples can work together to build a life together and need support from each other but i fear he feels so lost there not much i can do but let him swim his way ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i grew up as a child of east asian parents my family is considered taoist confucist buddhist i grew up in america where the majority of my friends were christian catholic i have been to church before as a teenager and as an adult and i currently live in a muslim country i have realized that the three religions are quite similar in regards to 1 traditional gender roles 2 importance of family 3 importance of treating other people right and having a sense of moral ethics and 4 god plan whether it is god or allah or the tao all three religions believe you cannot 100 control your fate maybe 99 you can but not 100 before you get off on how muslims are terrible people let me just tell you the muslims i have made close friends with are all honest hardworking accepting people much more than my intolerant liberal american friends actually anyways i grew up in a fairly liberal american town where many of my christian catholic friends denounced their religion in middle school so i also turned into a hateful militant atheist for a few years until grad school but the biggest reason i turned back to having faith is because i feel like it gives me a sense of wonder a sense of peace a sense of excitement for what is in store for me in the future because i do not know what will happen i work my hardest to solve my problems but it seems so boring to assume that i will know exactly what i will do in 1 3 5 10 years because things change for instance i had moved abroad to africa thinking i would be there one year and move back the america with my then boyfriend but we broke up and now i found myself living in the middle east with an even more amazing boyfriend and there are some things that an atheist might say it purely coincidence like i was literally stranded in africa with nothing lined up next when this new job popped up at the right time that was absolutely perfect for me i have a very narrow job and i applied interviewed and got it but i like to think it part of a plan that set out for me and i can decide to take those opportunities or not it just makes life more fun so that why i have turned back to religion as far as buddhism over christianity islam mostly it because of familiarity of language i have read both the bible and the quran but there no deeper meaning to me in its language buddhism has roots in my family another reason why i have faith is when i questioned why sometimes freak accidents happen one example is i had a friend who got cancer had no history of cancer in her family she did not drink or smoke or do anything unhealthy but was suddenly diagnosed with stage 4 cancer with 2 months to live she was 27 sometimes i just do not believe you could have controlled a situation like that and my friend was simply unlucky but why was she unlucky and not me tldr i was raised buddhism until i was a militant atheist from age 14 22 now i am slowly converting back to faith spirituality but i am not a zealot i do not go to church i do think the reason so many people reject religion is because of the extremists but i believe there can still be faith without having to be obsessive about it ,1,philosophy

vanBeethovenLudwig,the gym takes precedence over all relaxing activities for me my gym is downstairs at my apartment though so it convenient if you are strapped for time you could buy a set of dumbbells and do some light lifting at home it would only take 15 20 minutes additionally see if you can try walking more during the day instead of driving or taking the bus ,12,xxfitness
vanBeethovenLudwig,the rule is pretty interesting to me because i guess when you date in university people tend to date for a few years before discussing marriage but post grad and seriously looking i do find it to be accurate i do strongly believe if a man does not actively pursue the relationship to become more serious then he is not serious about choosing you to be his wife he is just using you as a temporary companion usually when a man wants something then he will take action towards it instead of being passive i am actually reading getting to i do and the author also said one year is a good time to gauge assuming you have been through each 3 month phase that puts your relationship in a crisis to build to the next level perfect phase imperfect phase negotiating phase commitment usually it during the imperfect or negotiating phase when things do not work out 6 months or 9 months so using the author theory you did the right thing to be engaged after 9 months ,5,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig, there is a huge cultural divide and it not between the races it between the dreamy idealists intent on controlling everything including who can and cannot be a struggling victim and the rest of the country that tired of being constantly shat on and neglected because nowadays feminists tend to be privileged women who live in bubbles that why feminists do not see the struggle of men they are too self absorbed here is an excerpt from an article written by michael moore reason 2 why trump will win the last stand of the angry white man our male dominated 240 year run of the usa is coming to an end a woman is about to take over how did this happen on our watch there were warning signs but we ignored them nixon the gender traitor imposing title ix on us the rule that said girls in school should get an equal chance at playing sports then they let them fly commercial jets before we knew it beyonc stormed on the field at this year s super bowl our game with an army of black women fists raised declaring that our domination was hereby terminated oh the humanity that s a small peek into the mind of the endangered white male there is a sense that the power has slipped out of their hands that their way of doing things is no longer how things are done this monster the feminazi the thing that as trump says bleeds through her eyes or wherever she bleeds has conquered us and now after having had to endure eight years of a black man telling us what to do we re supposed to just sit back and take eight years of a woman bossing us around http michaelmoore com trumpwillwin the election was all about turning a blind eye to what is really going on in the country ,3,RedPillWives
vanBeethovenLudwig,i am definitely curious as to how the election affects gender political as well i do not feel i have a very in depth opinion but i do have some thoughts feminists will become the new trump supporters by that i mean rallying together and feeling passionate about hating on melania for being just a model and hating trump for choosing to have a beautiful wife men will secretly be relieved to have an embodiment of masculinity by that i mean a successful entrepreneur man with a feminine wife who is beautiful and supported him but they wo not admit it i also think the fashion industry will skyrocket because whether you voted blue or red melania knows her fashion ,9,RedPillWives

vanBeethovenLudwig, it easy to get insecure if you two do not get time to yourself there no time for intimacy and comfort and validation and similar things most of us need from our partners yes this so much i also realized it myself that why i really need sex and cuddle time because that my language of validation to be honest since we have met we only really do one day of this type of time together and i am pretty sure i need it more frequently than he needs it but he is consistent in giving this type of love he also 34 and i have a feeling he is not so horny as a guy in his 20 and he had his fair share of women so he not looking for just sex good for me my last two ltrs since with men that did not have previous girlfriends we had tons of sex and would even venture to say our relationship was based too much on sex i might be idealizing this type of relationship and not understanding that lasting relationships are built outside of romantic chivalrous times together i think i am idealizing both him and the relationship if i rationally look at it he cares about me but it my entitled fairytale thinking that well if i myself am a perfect 10 then he would run to offer me favors blshblahblah of course for most people they do not have this relationship but my brother treats his wife like this and also the couple weeks were with the one with the african girl her husband worships her granted they are a strange couple she 28 and he 56 i am sure he feels insecure about his seniority so probably hopes his worshipping would keep them married so yeah i am definitely comparing my relationship to others and that why i feel inadequate as well goes back to the if i were like her then maybe blshblahblah definitely keep giving advice you have a way of writing where it critical but also gentle it perfect feminine response ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig, develop the mindset of being a catch to your current so but him also being a catch to you sometimes i do feel this way the problem is then i start thinking ok if i am such a catch why has not he blshblahblah or why is he giving more attention to another woman and then i am entitled on the other hand when i do not think this way i feel completely inadequate and have to work to earn my worth it becomes an unhealthy mindset i do not exactly know how to have a middle ground self esteem second of all you are building up resentment and negative emotions towards them and treating them worse than you would if you opened up and got help sadly i am already observing this i just do not know where to get help i am not kidding you there is a lack of mental health care in my country third of all being vulnerable is not unattractive in women men like to see that you rely on them and trust them just as long as you are willing to accept their attempts to fix the problem and work on it yourself this is a good point i think i am fixated on being perfect because a lot of happy relationships that i have observed it seems like the woman is put on a pedestal because she so happy and bubbly and does not have a problem in the world i feel pressure to be perfect so that i can be put on this pedestal additionally my first ltr had problems because i had too many problems that why i started hiding them at least in that relationship i was unattractive because i had problems fourth of all if you share emotional struggles you will get to know each other better and bond over them and learn to cater to your specific individual needs like nobody else can yes there literally no downside to this except having to deal with the problem but the problem wo not go away if you do not share it it could just get even worse so if you are dealing with it anyway and he dealing with the consequences might as well get the benefits of being open with him yeah i have been thinking about it whenever we see each other it either 1 at night when he worked overtime and had a horrible day or 2 both out with friends and come home late he drops me off before driving to his place there seems to be no good time to talk and when i am upset or building up resentment he not there because i am self perpetuating in my head we have had some minor fights over text i know it not good but there is literally no good time to bring up issues hey you are a really wise woman to talk to are you really only 18 you are incredibly mature and i am sure your so is happy to have you ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,regarding the past two ltrs you know for me i never specifically targeted to date down both of the relationships happened because they were the only people in which the feelings were mutual so obviously we continued seeing each other but i can definitely say the past ltrs were with guys who never had girlfriends before so yes i was a catch for them i broke up with them because of hypergamy yes that definitely true about accepting things from friends that i could not accept from my boyfriend and or family i guess if i had to have it one way or another i would rather my boyfriend be more supportive than teasing i have thought about trying to dig deeper into this self esteem issue because it also ties into another fear of abandonment that i also cannot understand because i grew up in a loving family i am trying to seek some help but i live in a country with limited access to health care especially mental health and i am terrified of bringing this up to my boyfriend because i acknowledge it not attractive to have problems ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,ok just read through your response more carefully yes i should definitely work on myself and i am trying really hard to be the stronger person and stop being so anxious i think you are correct on the self esteem issue although i am not sure why i have low self esteem in other areas of my life i am very confident and i am very easily able to get dates when single but for some reason in this particular relationship i am have very low self esteem my past two ltrs adored me and i was the one to break up things i think my current guy has a higher smv although i do realize he not perfect and definitely has his faults he 34 and has not married because of financial reasons and tells me he feels like a loser sometimes but i think you are right about the self perpetuating mood i am trying hard to distract myself more and try not to be so clingy if i rationalize his actions he is loyal to me it just my insecure emotions that keeping me from accepting it ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i can give you a short answer now because on my phone the husband was fine with it and the wife treats him like a good friend brother there was nothing sexual about the teasing it pretty much all harmless but i was jealous because lately he has not treated me so flirtatiously my gut instinct is that it harmless and they are really just friends because i have had these sorts of guy girl friendships where the guy is like my brother so i do understand the friendship dynamic but still i got jealous because of stupid things he did she teased him too and he was obviously having fun but then i tried to tease him he did not respond at all it felt hurtful that he did not respond to my teasing but did to her does that make sense also granted she had just gotten fired from her job and they are moving out of the country so i suppose that why he was so friendly to her but i have never been with them before she had gotten fired so i do not understand the dynamic but i felt like a loser because i was obviously not the fun cute girl even though we are the same age even though generally i am pretty easy going and bubbly maybe i am being competitive i do not know my boyfriend does not usually like it when i do aggressive things like jump on him or playfully smack him he will actually look at me and say do not do that but last night the girl smacked him on the arm back a few times and he just teased her in return i found it really unfair why he would be so displeased when i do it but it fine if she does it perhaps because she just a friend he wo not be so disagreeable but with a girlfriend he sees often he has to actually manage me if that makes sense ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,the dissatisfaction came from recently hanging out with a friend of his he used to live in africa before we met and met this girl there who is married and was married when they met and my boyfriend is also friends with her husband all four of us hung out twice in the last few weeks and he was teasing the wife and giving her way more attention than me granted the wife works for a major airline company and gave him essentially free international plane tickets for almost one year so i realize he is trying to be a good friend and good company but i guess i was feeling a little jealous he was giving her so much attention right in front of me and her husband was there with us too so that where the insecurity comes from some of it is also a temporary self perpetuating mood for sure i have been trying to be better about it but after the incidents seeing him being so friendly to another woman in front of me then i started being even more insecure ,5,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,ahahahaha haha hahaha ,0,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,that good to know how you dealt with it i have to keep telling myself he cares in other ways it will be difficult especially as i see he pretty friendly to his friends that are girls who all have boyfriends husbands so i think that what hurt me sometimes was that i felt he was not as nice to me but if i think about it i am also more polite and friendly to acquaintances in general as well i think it a comfort issue ,1,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,that the thing though i do lead a pretty independent life outside of him i have got my own group of friends and i have hobbies and working on a project i am always texting him pictures of things i am doing without him and i went on a short weekend trip with a girlfriend a few weeks ago the problem is when we are actually together in person he totally supportive and interested in what i am doing with my life but i am someone that likes to go along for the ride and be a supporting figure so i am not exactly an entertaining person during my downtime plus i am a performing artist teacher so my work is full of being social engaging and interesting when i am not working i need to recharge and not talk to anyone basically i am an interesting person in my own life but when i am with him i want to relax and be quiet it quite strange but he seems to be the same in a way like he had a long day and wants me to sit with him while he eats and just listen to him talk last night i was trying to be fun and teasing him and he just did not seem in the mood for it like he really just does want me to be a soft place to land and not a going out buddy ,3,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,yeah i definitely understand for most guys the love language is a lot different actually i do not think his is touch because there were a few times i have really clung onto him for a cuddle and he actually told me he was uncomfortable i guess i am frustrated because he used to be so physically affectionate at the beginning so i thought he understood my language but turns out not he does show me he cares in other ways like he is a pretty strong provider figure right now we do not share housing but he always pays and he told me he has thoughts about taking care of me in the future meaning providing so i do not have to work plus he is consistent in communicating with me like always texting me good morning or if i have not texted him in a while he will call to make sure i am ok he always tells me if i want something i can ask we are just going through a relationship comfort stage where it not all fuzzy and new and i am a very touchy person who needs cuddles and hand holding and lots of sex he an engineer and from my father brother relatives and past ltr i do notice they tend to be provider figures who like their space i am afraid of pushing the relationship too much and invading his space so i am trying really hard to deal with this lack of affection and to be fair it not like he completely ignores me we cuddled pretty hard after amazing sex three nights ago and yesterday we cuddled on the beach for a bit but i think i just a needy person who needs more touch to feel secure ,4,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig,i think non traditional couples may need to live together because they do not know who job is what and need to set schedules for who cooks and cleans on which nights or whatever especially couples that feel the need to be attached at the hip and do everything together but if it a traditional type relationship i think it pretty obvious and straightforward what you would expect you know plus most men have their normal bodily functions and lay on the couch when they are not working why is it so necessary to get used to each other if he a traditional man he knows to give you some space to do your lady things and not gawk at you when you are doing your nails or tweezing your eyebrows yeah i had a ltr who was socially awkward and did not understand girl things so what more do you have to expect living together assuming he not a werewolf or a vampire or anything i think it fine not to live together before marriage ,2,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,i come from a similar background as you my parents would not want me to live with a man unless we are married my boyfriend has lived with his past girlfriends before but i have let him know i do not plan to live together unless we plan to get married and he respected that i think first thing is not to let other people bother you about the way you have chosen to handle the situation a lot of people choose to cohabit to see how it goes but you do not get married and see how it goes you are in it for life stick to your guns there still plenty of people who do not live together until marriage ,3,RedPillWomen

vanBeethovenLudwig,i think this is just a matter of misunderstanding between them a typical man thinks he showing love by working to provide when woman needs affection and words of love there nothing wrong with asserting her needs and feeling satisfied in the relationship however ok sure no need to nag cry or withhold sex op i suggest you muster up the courage to be strong and stop this behavior first before asserting your needs this is imperative no man will take you seriously if you are being a shrew work on yourself first get your emotions in check take some time for self care understand he may be going through tough situations at work and that why he withdrawing in addition to the shrew behavior give him space be strong for yourself try to uplift his mood instead of bringing it down when you sense he softening up to you then you can discuss with him your need for affection and words of love if he is working to provide for you in the future then you will have to remember that first and foremost ,10,RedPillWomen
vanBeethovenLudwig,if it something that important to you contact time then it is up to you to either deal with it and continue the relationship or decide to find another man who would spend more time with you because the unfortunate truth is if he like this early in the relationship he most likely will be the same with his job should you ever get married i also struggle with the anxiety of my boyfriend being busy or pulling away but men are pretty loyal to their women that they respect and if he really cares he will make an effort to contact you on a regular albeit infrequent basis it will then be up to you and your own self esteem that you know you are a worthy woman to be with i think that helped me i try my best to be a good woman and i know in my heart i am so there no reason he would pull away just try to keep busy be open to telling him you enjoy having him in your life without being resentful and think hard about if this is the type of man you would want someone who invests more time in his career than in you and does not tolerate berating behavior ,1,RedPillWomen
