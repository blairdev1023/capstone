camille11325,yep i get a message or call nearly every day when m is on his way home if it 30 mins or less he will specify otherwise i know it will be about an hour in that time i am expected to make sure that the both the house and i look great not that i confine my housekeeping makeup time to that hour but if i was putting anything off or forgot to do something this is when i would do it if i am having an off or sick day i would just do the bare minimum in this window i also like having the heads up in case i want to time dinner with his arrival or plan a tiny surprise if he is in a bad mood he may let me know in the same message phone call and i can prepare accordingly i really cannot think of a reason that a woman would not like this routine but i have not read the rest of the responses yet lol hope this helps ,2,RedPillWives
camille11325,lovely this part is especially key but since a man s primary emotional need is respect please understand that for your husband criticism isn t just frustrating it feels like a vicious attack on his most vulnerable emotion his fear that you see him as inadequate i really like framing the issue in terms of his primary emotional need and i think it so important to point out that men can be vulnerable this language is not often used when discussing masculinity but i feel like it will resonate with female readers ,6,RedPillWives
camille11325,ooh this is a great topic i agree that in the west mascara is definitely a must have i would also say that lipstick is considered extremely important for adult women and women under 35 are more likely to also rank eyebrow defining products as crucial as well i personally like to wear a full face anytime i wear makeup but if i had to only choose three products it would definitely be mascara brows and lipstick ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,omg do strong curves with me it works so well as a full body workout and also for glute development i have done it a few times but lost some progress due to celiacs related weight loss i am starting over from the beginning and super pumped it a really fun program that does not get boring or too complicated there even a nice app that someone else made i do not have my phone on me but i can give you the name if you are interested no pressure at all to do sc with me though we have been discussing as mods some sort of summer beauty challenge for inner and outer beauty related improvement i totally agree that it would be fun to check in with the community and stay motivated and inspired ,3,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325,haha humans are weird that great that your husband is open to cool sculpting and preventative measures m is all for cosmetic procedures he wants me to look my best but of course best is defined by him not whatever look is trendy or fad is sweeping the nation he also has a visceral reaction to things he does not like but it rooted in disgust or disdain not morality he has a very traditional view when it comes to female appearance ie there are wives and whores and each group is judged by a different standard i think he does not like eyelash extensions because you cannot really tone them down not that we have seen anyways enhanced boobs can be covered up or downplayed with the right outfit they also can be highlighted in the appropriate settings things like eyelash extensions and lip injections are more overt and just out there for everyone to enjoy hopefully this makes sense ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,omg yes my teeth hurt so badly from professional grade teeth whitening this is why i had to switch to crest strips m also had some sensitivity from zoom whitening but just the normal pangs nothing too unbearable glo science whitening systems apparently do not cause sensitivity at all and you can have that done in office or get a professional grade kit from your dentist so that what i will be getting moving forward and yes i love realself the site has pretty much erased any fears or concerns i had about plastic surgery i know i will be getting silicone inserts under the muscle but have not settled on a specific doctor yet when it comes to eyebrow tattoos or other permanent cosmetics you are right if it done right no one will notice i just feel like my aversion to it is because it a tattoo and i am not a fan of tattoos at all regardless of the location or significance or purpose i cannot separate something like permanent liner from other types of tattoos totally my irrational bias i would have made a great butch lesbian if muscle development was all it took lol i know you will look great whichever route you choose 3,1,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325,i do not have social media accounts outside of reddit and pinterest so i was not aware of the men are trash hashtag if it real and not a 4 chan hoax or sarcastic or some other thing that pretty awful i am hoping that men will stop putting up with this sort of behaviour in women and that women will stop encouraging it as well right now there are no consequences for feminists and they are not going to stop as long as they can get away with things i think it was roosh originally who described feminism as a big shit test maybe it was another manosphere guy but either way i totally agree ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i agree with everything you are saying and it a shame that the author of the piece did not go in depth enough to really prove his point the shallowness of the article really takes away from the main arguments ,3,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325,i am very pro cosmetic enhancement psa realself com is the best for information on procedures before and after photos and reviews of top doctors near you that perform whatever you can think of so far in my life i have straightened my teeth with braces used over the counter whitening kits and this is not something you have covered but i have worn hair extensions as needed and i am considering getting a fake ponytail thing https www amazon com prettyshop ponytail extension heat resisting different dp b00jtcg568 ref pd sim 193 5 encoding utf8 pd rd i b00ngyk7o6 pd rd r 821722t1ptg3cqp7mk51 pd rd w vugip pd rd wg svhea refrid 821722t1ptg3cqp7mk51 th 1 for when i am feeling really lazy i just want to wear buns at the end of the year i should be getting a breast augmentation and i also plan on whitening my teeth again as i get older i will totally embrace the latest technology and get whatever it takes to stay attractive the full body makeovers you linked to are cool the women do not look particularly fit and yet the end result is a hypersexual figure i think procedures like this are awesome options for those who are not interested in working out and dieting or perhaps they have done their best but their body structure just does not allow them to have an hourglass figure i agree with you though it looks like he is following some sort of template and i feel like women who want a different look would be better off with another doctor coolsculpting is a procedure i am super jazzed about in general i do not know if i will ever need it but i would 100 do it you freeze the fat away it works by exposing targeted areas to extreme cold to kill fat cells these dead cells are then disposed of by your body through the natural waste elimination process from what i have read it perfect for women who have trouble areas that are resistant to exercise and dieting i imagine it will be really good post childbirth procedures i am not a fan of microblading eyeliner tattoos and lip liner tattoos they all just seem so trashy ,3,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325,aww voles this article is really cool i want to highlight the underlying message the brain circuit they identified had previously been linked to learning which suggests social bonding itself is a form of mental training a lot of people recoil from rp ideas because of how clinical and detached they can be emotions and impulses play a big role in nearly everyone decision making process so deconstructing various dynamics and processes feels inhuman and even vulgar but human relationships are more than the intangible and irrational there are patterns that some can intuit and others can arrive at logically and once these patterns are known we can develop strategies using this knowledge in our favour understanding that we can evoke specific responses from men is the first step in learning how to get the outcome we want ,2,RedPillWives

camille11325,what an original subject to talk about here i really like your approach and how you re connecting it with existing rpw ideas have you heard of attachment styles https www psychologytoday com tests relationships relationship attachment style test we had a post a while ago where people took a quiz it d be cool in the future to bring it up again and connect it to this post however it s utterly irresponsible to simply throw your hands up and say oh well this is how i am and everyone has to cater to my neuroses this is so important to understand so many seem to expect and even demand that others will put up with and accommodate their mental and emotional issues while finding a man who is understanding and invested in your well being is key forcing this man to deal with the worst sides of your personality while you refuse to change is just selfish a woman with anxiety can still achieve psychological femininity and she should it will be more difficult but that s life i think that a low level of anxiety can actually enable femininity and better performance as a wife it will make you more likely to feel dread which will motivate your girl game it can help push you to put in effort into your appearance even when you re not up to it of course i m not talking about clinical or debilitating anxiety i just am cautioning women from trying to eradicate all pressure from their lives being confident is attractive but so is being slightly insecure plenty of men admit this when they don t feel like they ll be punished for their preferences femininity comes in tons of forms and like you said in your post women who are naturally high anxiety are never going to be 100 anxiety free this doesn t have to be a bad thing and i think it makes certain aspects of femininity easier to answer your questions based on my own experience in high anxiety moments it is hard to separate irrational feelings from reality which makes it harder to put up appropriate boundaries or prioritise effectively i wouldn t say this affects my ability to be feminine but i understand how a woman who isn t naturally feminine and struggling with that aspect could backtrack when she gets stressed or fearful trying out different methods of dealing with anxiety was the only way to discover what works for me personally some things that definitely don t work for me writing in a journal talking it out immediately going for a run spending time with pets meditation although guided hypnosis does work for me i included the list to show that it s okay if the commonly recommended cures don t help i strongly recommend keeping your so in the loop at all times so that he is aware of what s going on and can respond accordingly p s tiny nitpick i hate the term empowered because of the strong connotations it has to feminism yes i m aware that there is a separate definition but i feel like using that particular term gives the impression that we agree with feminism on some level you and everyone are totally free to disagree with me and i welcome hearing all sides but i just really can t get behind using the term rpw is definitely about women having agency and personal accountability but the term empowered is just so loaded thank you so much for starting this conversation 3,3,RedPillWives

camille11325,totally agree about body scrubs helping you feel better when you are unwell when it comes to blush i actually layer shades to give a more natural and healthy effect a lighter more subtle shade of pink across a larger part of the face depends on your face shape i would imagine can make the normal blush shade fit into your look more seamlessly ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,totally underestimated my situation yesterday but i am finally back to comment lol when i am not feeling well i try to stay in the bedroom as much as possible and rest in bed so there is no makeup hair styling cute outfit etc i do the bare minimum for skincare too water toner moisturizer this actually forces me to rest because if i got up did my hair and makeup and had on contacts and an outfit i would feel like i had to do something while objectively i know that it okay to just rest sometimes i need something stronger to get me to do it looking not my best is an excellent way to ensure i stay in bed away from anyone seeing me haha of course if i do actually have to go out and interact with others i do everything as if i was perfectly fine i find that using a light shade of blush on my temples and under where i normally apply blush helps me look healthier and nude liner in the lower water line gives the illusion that i am more awake other than that i do not do anything special i enjoy taking a bath after i am all better kind of like a treat for improving ,1,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325, this is why i cringe hard when i hear women calling for the destruction of patriarchy it still the very structure they are standing on they might as well burn down every building because men made them yep and men are the ones giving them new privileges as well as the ones enforcing these changes feminism would not be possible without the institutions set up by and run by men true when i posted this it had a kneejerk downvote which i assume might be because of how the title is phrased that it seemed far fetched yeah i think its a combination of bp lurkers and women who are not familiar with the ideas in the article who judged based on the title and the boob photo that is the first thing you see lol it not just about sex itself but how it now detached from the concept of paternity and direct male investment absolutely i think the normalisation of birth control is tied to this as well sex has been separated from reproduction for a while now so modern women are not thinking in the same terms every step of the process can be controlled by women preventing conception terminating pregnancy getting pregnant choosing who raises the child pursuing funds for the child from the father or gvt or both providing for the child via her own job etc nearly everything i just listed is possible due to the expanded role of the government and other changes brought about by feminism or they are just not invested in their smv because their welfare does not involve direct financial investment from a suitor yes we see now that many women who do enjoy things like makeup and fashion make a point about doing it as a form of self expression or as art or for my self esteem looking good for men or your man is not considered a worthy goal because women can still get sex and resources without putting in max effort into their smv and rmv there is no reason for them to improve honestly there a lot that could be discussed from here because of how sexual currency has changed overtime at the very primal it all we have had as women agreed but even in more traditional circles it is taboo to talk about these things so plainly i would love to explore the concept of out sexual currency more on this sub i wrote female sexual strategy https www reddit com r redpillwives comments 5hz4md female sexual strategy to break down the reasoning behind rpw strategy but there is so much more to say about what is happening at present and what women have done throughout time after emancipation modern women use their currency mainly for attention and now in social media times it even more muddied up thinking outloud has there been a shift to seeking short term pleasure over long term stability via our sexuality not specifically talking about afbb although that is a good example social media and the internet in general gives instant gratification several popular environments for women today also shower them in attention eg modern clubs without having to worry about pregnancy or security women are able to live in the moment more which is something feminists are proud of but like you said society is suffering i got a very frightening reflection of our current times young women being fulfilled by digital likes hearts and not striving for something more while young men look at porn so they do not have to improve themselves either this is heartbreaking is not it unfortunately i do not think women will change unless men do first ,3,RedPillWives
camille11325,i like how direct and well sourced this post is the outsourcing of the male role to various institutions and organizations is such a central part of feminism and yet not many people talk about it in depth and even fewer people connect it to sexual promiscuity i also feel like women reliance on their bodies is the result of the way the female role has been outsourced due to technological advancements and things like dry cleaners laundromats cleaning services tailors fast fashion retailers restaurants at every price point etc not only do women not learn skills that used to make us assets men grow up getting all sorts of needs met by the economy so that what they expect of course a woman excelling in various homemaking and wife skills is a bonus but there is not as much pressure for women to go the extra mile anymore in that sphere i definitely think this is tied to the central argument of the blog post you linked and i am so glad that you shared it ,6,RedPillWives

camille11325, if all i watched was the ad i would not know what a guinness tastes like or compares to or anything about it but i do know the demographic that drinks it masculine looking men who play in wheelchairs with their disabled friend ah but the whole point is that the wheelchair men don t drink guinness they don t even exist guinness is combining symbols to communicate to a type of person an entirely different person than the one depicted in the ad what we know about guinness from this commercial is what they think about their target which as tlp points out says a lot about the target the men who might want to drink guinness would think those men depicted are cool and aspirational edit because they themselves are not masculine and do not understand what masculinity is i feel like this ad is capitalizing on what i keep referring to as the push for androgyny but in disguised packaging isn t it interesting how seamlessly they combine male and female traits into an appealing to the target audience package i really loved this part of the essay the guinness ad proposes that what makes men men is that they do not act like stereotypical men if and only if they look like stereotypical men otherwise they are not men this redefinition of masculinity to mean everything but actual masculinity was happening even years ago when this ad came out and it s only getting worse guinness is capitalizing on that over saturated supply and catering to the starving demand to see themselves as more than they are guinness is profiting ingeniously off the damage caused by feminism and liberalism frankly it impressive dove is too for that matter a big part of tlp s site is about how ads and the media are a mirror of the state of society the people making ads often don t intentionally pack all of these layers of meaning into what they create but they can t help it because it s always going to be a reflection of the zeitgeist of the time the psycho demographics of the target audience this is why he often states if you re watching it it s for you which of course also applies to reading material there are a few other big ideas that inform all of his posts individual and cultural narcissism how the system perpetuates itself through the media how we are taught by the media not just what to want but how to want etc i say all of this because i don t think it s genius of dove or guinness i don t think they could have made any other ad at the time that these were created i fully believe that the majority of the people creating and greenlighting these productions are blind to everything tlp is pointing out here they are true believers of feminism and liberalism and these ads are an honest reflection of their own ideas as well if a clueless or loser that worked at guinness or dove read either of the two articles they wouldn t agree sure execs of corporations are profiting off of liberal ideas but these people aren t the ones pitching or executing the commercial they just sign off on it and i doubt they give it as much thought as tlp did fat ugly women would not need a campaign telling them that it fine to be fat and ugly if feminism had not tricked them into thinking beauty does not matter in the first place have i shown you this article yet http thelastpsychiatrist com 2013 01 no self respecting woman would html it fleshes out what i m about to say i don t think feminism has successfully tricked most women yet about beauty not mattering this is why people spend so much time researching debating and defending this aspect of feminism this is why so many articles and songs are about the subject they have to constantly reaffirm the audience that it s true it s not yet held as axiomatic like other liberal ideas such as everyone is equal or diversity is a virtue and worthy goal in and of itself the amount of energy spent pushing the message of self esteem above everything else is their attempt to truly convince everyone of the message ,2,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325,haha i thought the flip cap comment was funny i am not bothered by the bottles either i do not use dove so their decision does not actually affect me i just find it interesting that time and again companies trying to embrace the values of the young modern left get rejected by that group i think most of us do not want them saying we wanted them to look like you agreed ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,have you read the other comments in this section this about more than hating vs not hating the bottles themselves or are you saying that the women featured in the article are overreacting about the dove campaign why do you think they are so strongly against the designs what mistake do you think dove made if any ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,love the prestige and agree with the analogy most people are content enjoying the show and do not want to see exactly how they are being tricked unfortunately as these articles show ads and the media in general impart several messages in addition to the one producers intended we cannot help but absorb these implicit meanings it hard to take a step back and analyse the many layers and larger contexts when it comes to dove i think that his point about ads being about identity and not the product is so key and women are reacting poorly because dove failed to adequately appeal to the identity of their target demo i talk about this more in my comment https www reddit com r femininenotfeminist comments 6dby1a doves real body shaped bottles are mocked and di1xzqb to u violetpiecrisis but to add on to what i was saying the literal approach these companies are taking shows too much emphasis on the product in a way distilling the values of that group of women into something tangible and consumable must feel vulgar to them ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,do you think the design of the bottles cannot be analysed what cultural factors lead to someone creating them why did dove think women would enjoy and purchase them why do a lot of people hate them all of these things make for great discussion if you expand your view a bit ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,omg fat girl lotion is perfect i agree the campaign is pandering and it too obvious about being pandering totally piggy backing on something u phantomdream09 brought up a while ago but these big companies seem to be trying to appeal to the under 30 crows in the most literal way possible and that why it backfires bottles shaped like female figures is such a dumb idea but it really does check off multiple sjw feminist boxes they complain that business do not create products that represent them dove literally created a product to represent different type of women similarly pepsi had the add that incorporated every possible thing considered cool by most people under 30 today and everyone hated it i have not studied the company too much but i feel like the woman dove is targeting wants to be comfortable in her skin and pretty in a natural happy way she does not want to have to do much to look good and she does not want to feel like anyone is pressuring her to change these figure shaped bottles make everything about the physical whereas dove women are all about self esteem separate from appearance fat girl lotion is actually genius because it shows that by emphasizing the body in body positive dove is calling attention to the physical traits these women are trying to rise above more women will connect with i am beautiful because i am me my appearance does not define me than i am fat and that makes me beautiful to me these bottle would only appeal to women who agree with the second quote like phantom said in her comment if a woman buys the one that matches her body she will see what she may not believe is beautiful every time she uses the body wash on the other hand if she picks one that is not like her body shape she will be confronted with her lie every time she showers ,2,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325,i am here i will help and i agree high contrast is more attractive it is a sign of sexual maturity whereas low contrast is neotonous young girls have paler lips and cheeks their skin is more translucent and their eyebrows are less defined red pink er lips and cheeks are a big indicator of being in heat and things like darker lashes and brows signal whatever the female version of virility is if you do not like leaving the house without makeup i think thats a good sign that you are high contrast or at least medium contrast i am very high contrast myself bright winter and the more i embrace high contrast makeup and clothing the more me i feel ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,what a great topic i agree that the way relationships and men and women in general are portrayed in the media influences what viewers expect in their own lives the messages can be communicated regardless of the intentions of the writers and often we do not realise what we are absorbing until it backfires a small silly personal example when i first moved in with m i would start conversations with him right as we would go to bed i did not realise i was doing something that annoyed him until he snapped at me one evening talking right before bed seemed natural to me and i did not understand why he just wanted to go to sleep i realised that it felt natural because in tv shows and movies whenever a couple is shown in bed they are usually having an important conversation this makes sense in fiction because nearly every scene is going to advance the story in some way but in real life it okay to just go to sleep on a more serious note i think that a lot of women expect that their relationship and life in general has to have a plot to be legitimate they craft a narrative and expect for every beat of the story to occur but sometimes there is no climax other times there is no denouement and in other cases there not even rising action in the absence of these expected moments women often create the drama themselves i think we do this because we need a purpose and we want to live a life that has stakes i asked m about lessons the media taught boys when he was growing up and he said that the content in his youth he was born in 1982 promoted the idea that men were lucky to be in a relationship and they had to do more work and take on more blame in order to maintain the happiness of the woman something i just thought about right now a lot of modern films and tv shows involve women entering into relationships with complete strangers that they meet out of the blue is this conditioning them to expect to meet their man randomly with minimal effort in the past older women in your family and in your various social circles church friends organizations etc were very involved with the dating process as we move away from having real communities this traditional practice has diminished not completely of course location matters i do not recall many tv shows and films that show women successfully being set up by family and friends and the amount of media showing women actually putting in effort to meet a man other than getting more attractive is lacking as well now this is definitely a reflection of the current smp but i think it also reinforces things ,8,RedPillWives

camille11325, sometimes i will disrespect my husband without even knowing what i am doing and i obviously do not want to do this but it leaves me so confused because i am not actually looking to take a dig at him i am just not thinking in the right context same and i know many other women who feel the same way i think this could be a good topic for women with high dominance thresholds in particular h men are going to be more sensitive to disrespect i think or at least more vocal when they notice it this really goes hand in glove with my comments on this post about how society limited and negative view of masculinity can cause men who are more intellectually masculine to feel feminine when in fact they simply express more of the inward facing masculine traits than other men i like that insight and i hope you save it for when we discuss the subject in its own thread i really hope that the suggestions shared here inspire everyone to start new conversations i know i will be searching online for articles and blog posts based on what people say i think that breaking down and identifying your man relevant archetypes and energy style can help you recognize his masculinity and dominance because he probably putting it out there but you might not be looking for it yes exactly ,4,RedPillWives
camille11325,topics that the sub could really enjoy how we can promote or inadvertently hinder our man masculinity common sources of stress embarrassment and fear that are unique to men and how we can best recognise and respond to them how men perceive disrespect body language word choice tone expressions etc male respect vs female respect male archetypes i speak about it in this post https www reddit com r redpillwives comments 4qmox5 relationship dynamics part ii all about men but i think it would be cool to really explore and celebrate the different types of masculinity we can also talk about where our men fall on the spectrum of different archetypes and how their traits mesh with our female archetypes modern depictions of men in pop culture and how they promote a warped version of masculinity masculine traits that society demonizes but are actually great or good in the right contexts ,16,RedPillWives

camille11325, in general though its never a good idea to cater to a group of people and say its better for everyone this way if each idea has to go through a filter of will this be good for women the system becomes tyrannical and we will forego good ideas no doubt yes i agree with your answer and especially this part we shut out so many possibilities when we only look for solutions for one group your response to 2 really highlights how important it is for women s safety to be with men i m not talking about having mandatory escorts or anything just the basic reality that we are more vulnerable and one of the best protections against dangerous men is other men even if nothing actually happens there is a definite psychological benefit to walking around with a man who cares about you in some way i agree that there were some cool suggestions i hope you take a look at my other comments in this thread i flesh out my stance there a bit more i m so happy that you also picked up on the weird invasion of privacy being casually included into the discussion feminist solutions often involve increasing the government s role in our lives ,3,RedPillWives
camille11325,i agree there are some good ideas being proposed and it s ridiculous that they are ignoring how it benefits everyone not just women i find it interesting that they can identify that something is wrong with how cities are set up but their solutions are limited because they have to conform to the reigning ideology their worldview prevents them from seeing the problem from another angle and from asking questions that could yield uncomfortable answers for example people are burnt out isolated craving community tired of long hours instead of rethinking the way the system is structured they are coming up with ways to preserve the system merging the office and home only reinforces the idea that our days should be dominated by working for someone else and everything else should come secondary in this case the solutions are oriented to maintaining or increasing production the happiness of the population is just a means to that end i too find it interesting how they are merging elements of pre industrial life with the modern experience community is so important for human flourishing and big cities are inherently disruptive to this this article gardens need walls on boundaries ritual and beauty https www ribbonfarm com 2015 03 04 gardens need walls on boundaries ritual and beauty is long but a great read the central arguments the loss of these small groups in favor of nation level organization of atomized individuals has had serious consequences for human welfare and human agency we are missing a layer of organization essential for our happiness the lower levels of maslow s pyramid reflect material well being but material abundance is not itself the cause of anomie and angst rather ancestral evolved solutions to lower level problems also tended to contain solutions to higher level problems as well as these ancestral solutions are made obsolete by solutions that are more efficient on the material level the more ineffable higher level problems they solved present themselves anew we are lonely and bored not because of material abundance simpliciter but because the specific cultural patterns that have reproduced themselves to produce material abundance have whittled away the social and psychological solutions that were built into old solutions to material problems i think that only small human groups are capable of supplying these benefits that are difficult for the market to capture both producers and government find it easiest to tile the world when humans are atomized into individuals rather than in small groups with appropriate permeable boundaries but a nation of individuals makes it difficult for anyone to experience belonging only a small group and not the nation or even worse mankind can supply social belonging and even multiply agency there is way more in the article so definitely give it a read when you can ,3,RedPillWives
camille11325,so first i m going to point out that you didn t respond to the first half of my message it s odd that you d do this when the exact subject i was speaking about is your dismissiveness when your man points out things you don t want to hear do you also ignore him i m not sure i agree that you re only shit testing him because you realised he isn t perfect based on all that you ve shared it s clear that how your man handles conflict is not enough for you wanting it to be enough doesn t make it so you have a bad attitude engage in terrible behaviours and hold negative opinions and emotions about him a man who could keep you in line would not elicit these things or tolerate them you wouldn t be shit testing him all the time and acting out you would feel dread and have a tangible sense of the consequences to your actions he may be meeting your dominant threshold but his method of dealing with your bullshit isn t expressive or strong enough while seeing him as human is certainly part of this i think it goes deeper when you say you don t want anyone to keep you in line are you really trying to avoid being vulnerable submitting deferring to the authority of your man requires that they keep you in line from time to time it necessitates that you rely on someone else that you remain open to guidance and criticism it involves your man truly seeing you warts and all you re starting to get that your man isn t perfect but please remember that you will never be perfect it is not possible for you to avoid all error or hide your mistakes from your man and if he loves you and is interested in a traditional relationship dynamic part of his role is to lead you left rpw and were certain that you could do great things on your own but you could not you re not going to be able to get better on your own either and you re not going to be able to stay better on your own you were a work in progress when you met this man and you are still a work in progress don t try to shut him out of the process just because you are too proud you literally cannot control yourself and your main issue is refusing to submit defer to your man so how can the solution to the problem involve you acting on your own you want to get better you hopefully will get better but you are not better yet you need to actually develop self discipline before you can use it yes it would be ideal if you could manage your moods and think before you speak but at present you can t and even when you can your man will need to keep you in line you re still reflecting and coming to conclusions but i hope you let us rpw help you when it s time to come up with concrete steps identifying the problem is only the first step and i d hate to see you convince yourself that you re improving just because you now have new language to identify your problems tagging u phantomdream09 and u littlegoosegirl in case they want to add anything or have alternate opinions ,2,RedPillWives
camille11325,thank you s much for responding i am having internet issues this afternoon evening and currently typing via phone hopefully i can send a proper response tonight,2,RedPillWives
camille11325,internet problems all day but will be on later if it resolves to respond further thanks for commenting ,1,RedPillWives
camille11325,so i think the idea that a city s design can be sexist is ridiculous while some of the issues they highlight are real looking at this solely through the lens of gender seems incredibly unintelligent and selfish from what i can tell the root causes of the various issues mentioned are the result of social class ethnicity culture older systems being incompatible with new technology and human nature in general if a problem impacts women that doesn t mean that the problem is inherently anti women in some way for example it s great that new features are being installed to make public areas safer such as more lighting but acting like women are the only victims and that the biggest crime is sexual harassment will only prevent people from coming up with truly innovative ideas i also feel like it s really dishonest to compare american issues to the issues occurring in other countries the sexual harassment happening in the us is nothing compared to what women go through oversees and american feminism is not the solution for either problems to me this looks like a sneaky way to increase mass surveillance and government involvement in our lives they are upping the amount of cameras for our safety but what about encouraging women and everyone to learn how to defend themselves and their fellow peers cities are being designed so that they are communal and mass transportation is the most viable option what about privacy and individuality i hate that soon freely driving your car isn t going to be a thing self driving cars and hi tech public transportation systems are seen as the ideal but that is so limiting instead of trying to change the layout of an area to promote an agenda why not consider that the agenda itself is at odds with the ways humans naturally organize ,3,RedPillWives
camille11325, right i could be more specific in some things i guess i just do not know what else to say except that i m being a bitch specific instances of that really wo not detract from that but if you think it will help why are you responding this way to someone trying to help you can you see that right now you are engaging in behaviour that acts as a defense against change how can you seriously act like you know more about what would or wouldn t help you get better in this situation you came to us for assistance and now you are getting dismissive if you can t point to exactly what you are doing wrong how will you be able to correct the problems i m a bitch is as useful as saying i m sick a doctor can t do anything without understanding the specific symptoms and background factors the treatment for a cold and lung cancer are so different despite coughing being a shared symptom thank you for sharing a more comprehensive list of what you ve been doing wrong i find this far more useful than what you mentioned in your original post take a good look at 3 and realise that this is a pattern you have in general not with him everything you ve listed here is terrible and i m glad you came back to rpw to deal with this it s clearly not something you can handle alone humor is just my way of speaking really probably a bad habit when trying to actually be taken seriously like in this post yes it is not helping you at all i still stand by my assertion that you are using it as a crutch to make yourself feel better about posting and to minimize some of the damage you ve done to your relationship your tone does not always match up to the gravity of the situation and it s concerning the way i feel when these things happen are basically like i go in well intentioned but then something will just knock out the perfection of the moment and i will just flip my shit but it is an example of how i will like try to be ok but then things do not go exactly how i think they should and totally focus on how he fucked up this is the crux of the issue and it is why you need to focus on managing emotions in the moment having regular activities that allow you to let out negative emotions showing unwavering respect to your man it s good that your man handles things the way that he does but i m wondering if this is enough for you do you think you are acting a certain way in an attempt to incite him could you be subconsciously trying to get a more extreme reaction you don t seem to feel much dread and you get away with a lot of bad behaviour you say that you ve been feeling superior to him do you think he is dominant enough for you or perhaps he is dominant but he isn t expressive enough to keep you in line this is not about finding a flaw in him but rather getting to the root of why you are doing what you re doing you mentioned that this is your first sober rp ltr could you be trying to create a dysfunctional relationship because that s what you re more used to is this self sabotage or maybe you re just the type of woman who legitimately needs a more aggressive man i m glad you ve lost weight and i hope you continue to get healthier your mood whiplash came out of nowhere have there been any changes in any other area of your life that could be contributing to your emotional imbalance missing aa meetings could definitely be related to this as well as the general lack of self care u phantomdream09 has great suggestions as do all the women on the sub but please don t close yourself off to what i m saying just because it is harsher and more difficult ,4,RedPillWives
camille11325,first welcome back to rpw it was shocking when you left so abruptly and without any indication as to why but it makes sense now the issues you are struggling with do not sound pleasant and i really hope you turn it around and save your relationship if your man cannot trust you to accept him as he is and respect him things will only get worse and he will probably leave you it does not matter how good you were in the past or how good you could be if you are not presently an asset to him or making clear strides in that direction he going to start thinking about being with a woman who can give him what he wants your post is really vague and you seem to be relying on humor to make things seem better than they are or to make you feel better about submitting the post repeating i m a huge bitch with slight variations doesn t give us the information we need to help you come up with concrete steps that list you give at the end is true and helpful but it s not enough to solve your problems you said you want someone to knock you off your high horse so here you go you are a single mother overweight and a former alcoholic at best you are evenly matched with this man if you continue down the path you re on he will see that he can do better than you at your age and with your past it will be difficult for you to find a man with an rmv over 5 that you can have an rp dynamic with there are real stakes here and you cannot afford to fuck it up any more than you already have now how to turn things around give us more specific information on what you are doing what you are feeling in the moment what happens immediately before you do x bad thing and how both of you react if anger is a problem in general what are you doing to regulate your moods what are your outlets for when you feel bad in the moment what are you doing to prevent feeling angry in the first place brainstorm ideas on how you can realistically hold yourself accountable to your new standards i also fully agree with everything u tempesttcup u stingrayvc u phantomdream09 and u thatstepfordgal have said definitely reflect on their comments as you figure out what you need to do to improve i m so glad you re back and hope you really commit to being a better woman and having a harmonious relationship 3 ,5,RedPillWives

camille11325,oh wow i cannot even imagine what your elementary and middle school experiences were like that sounds awful so glad you were able to turn it around in hs talent is definitely a great way to gain status do you know why your mom opted out of your town fsm i find it so interesting that this had a major effect on your status it makes sense i just never considered it i suppose i benefited from my own mom status and even just watching her as i grew up she is a social butterfly very charismatic popular and an excellent hostess i learned a lot from her in those areas both through intentional instruction and just by observing her i agree you can definitely see the fsm in action within this little sphere of reddit it also very interesting to see it on other subreddits filled with women i study a lot of the discussion on other subs and there so much to glean about female social dynamics when you look for it you can really see how much women are driven by the need to achieve consensus i talk a lot with u phantomdream09 about various posts and what they reveal about the fsm and female nature so i hope she takes a look at your comment ,2,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325, i mean in a sense he was right about that but he could have at least tried posting fliers or something first lol right i just had a thought that is really obvious in hindsight the method chosen to spread his ideas pretty much makes sure that no one takes him seriously all of those insightful arguments are associated with terrorism and insanity i have had conversations where i organically weaved in a few points i gleaned from the essay and people agreed without hesitation but if i were to go around in public citing the unabomber they would be really uncomfortable and close their minds regardless of what was said ,10,The_Donald
camille11325,great point i definitely see how that aspect could have been the result of programming ,4,The_Donald
camille11325,have you read the unabomber manifesto it has a brilliant analysis of the current cultural issues facing the modern west it incredibly harsh on leftism and brings up so many amazing points about human nature the entire essay is available online easily searchable and even looking up terms like the power process would show just how well thought out these positions are i really cannot imagine a scenario where tptb would want that information to be put out there for all to see ,18,The_Donald
camille11325,it would be really helpful if you told us about your age skin type current routines and any lifestyle factors that are relevant i have normal skin that can get dehydrated and i just started using this toner by ole henriksen http www sephora com balancing force oil control toner p416816 and it been great for any hormonal breakouts i have tried tons of different exfoliants and acne products but something about this formulation just really works for my skin i use it most nights and wait a bit before putting on anything else to give the ingredients time to do their thing i do not think it would be too harsh for anyone who is not used to actives but i have been using chemical exfoliants for years so to me this seems super mild maybe it obvious to everyone but i cannot think of what dim is supposed to mean can you explain what it stands for thanks ,2,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325,it always great to see an rp concept explored in depth the connection you have made between the male and female experience really underscores why humans have developed intricate systems and norms over the centuries when it comes to romance even something as simple as going on a proper date prior to having sex is a method of adding structure to prevent common pitfalls the way we have organized as a species to address these innate tendencies is so awesome is not it the garden metaphor is so lovely everything by cs lewis is really and it is so relevant to women today it may sound boring to think about your goals and have standards for yourself and your man but these lifeless things will enable something beautiful women who are not used to engaging in future oriented behaviour in their love lives probably imagine the worst when vetting gets brought up but really these things can be incorporated into your life easily and it will feel organic in the moment so i would disagree with the idea that being cold is necessary but the spirit of that part is spot on some women need to learn that they can exercise agency and rationality without being boring or missing out on life it all about knowing what you want and then orienting yourself in that direction i especially appreciate what you are saying about media representations of relationships movies and tv shows have been teaching audiences about reality basically from the start i am sure i mentioned the last psychiatrist to you but if you have not checked out his archives do so asap your post highlights so many great things that will resonate with rpws at any stage a closer look at this bssic concept is just refreshing thank you i am really excited to see the discussion this generates note on phone sorry for typos ,1,RedPillWives

camille11325, what our men want is submission for the religious folks out there this goes hand in hand with meekness which means contained spirit think about that deference our whatever word you choose to use for it they do not want a milquetoast they cannot trust to make decisions this is so key you can be submissive and have a personality and spine having agency and being able to do things without someone holding your hand or constantly reassuring you are essential traits i am saying this from personal experience like you said in your comment none of us are perfect as an l woman i get moments of extreme insecurity and self doubt but you do not always need to act as you feel if that makes sense you bring up a great point about leaning on our men as necessary this is something both h and l women should embrace let your man in allow him to help you it does not have to rest squarely on your shoulders h women seem to struggle with being vulnerable and humble enough to ask for help whereas l women may be too indirect shy afraid etc i do not know where i would be without m help and guidance and it really warms my heart to see you saying the same thing about your husband your relationship has always been an inspiration to me and i am sure everyone else feels the same way 3,3,RedPillWives

camille11325,spoilers do not read further if you care about that i was so excited when i started watching the show because they depict a lot of different relationship types in a realistic manner madeline was alpha widowed by her ex and in a dead bedroom situation with her bb ed celeste did not know how to deal with perry dominance and they had a twisted dynamic that deep down they both enjoyed renata and her husband were a dynamic duo bonnie had tamed nathan and that relationship also worked well i also really liked all the female social dynamic stuff that was included at the start it all felt very rp pretty much every character let me down in some way as the show progressed and by the end of it i hated almost everyone a story about two people struggling with rage issues and being the best spouse possible is way more interesting than what the celeste and perry story devolved into they ended up checking off every cliche in the book and it saddens me that they transformed perry into a evil monster to have a more satisfying ending there was so much nuance to the story i thought they were telling initially so when they removed all shades of grey it was disappointing i could go on about that story arc but i will cut that particular rant off here for now the reaction of the parents to the 16 year old auctioning her virginity online was the 2 thing that frustrated me the most nathan where were your balls they were way too calm and helpless when they should have been angry and taken charge i know that this is the point it just really bothered me i also could not care less about jane rape story loved the shot composition music wardrobe soundtrack and editing i have seen it twice and added the soundtrack to my spotify perfect background music for lots of tasks i will definitely watch season 2 ,1,RedPillWives
camille11325,i noticed this too great motivation for anyone on the fence haha,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i actually disagree the similarity between the images show exactly which features and or qualities make a difference as you go up or down the spectrum there are so many variables that go into attractiveness so keeping some things constant helps isolate the ones that distinguish a 4 from a 6 from a 9 u phantasmagnolia did an awesome breakdown of some of the differences between the faces are they minute sure but that does not make it insignificant there are clear patterns that line up with the underlying preferences most men have ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i do not disagree with a lot that you are saying but i did not intend for these images to be taken as definitive authorities on female beauty i wanted us to dissect them and think about what they reveal about human preferences i may be misinterpreting but your comment gave the impression that you thought these images were presented to show exactly what should be considered a 5 7 10 etc composites allow you to see the big picture and while the images do not account for every possible iteration of female beauty they certainly provide insights that we can discuss as a community for the purposes i intended i do not think that the lack of obvious differences is an issue it so cool how much of an impact subtle shifts in weight bone structure feature size proportions and ratios can have it not about presenting an exclusionary definition of beauty but rather zeroing in on certain aspects of beauty as presented in these images it easier to compare women who look similar vs women with wildly different characteristics there are too many variables that impact how women are perceived so having some constants is helpful imo my comment to u littlegoosegirl covers some things that i know you will be interested in i also think you will like the thorough breakdown by u phantasmagnolia ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325, i found hot or not composites of the most attractive women for different age groups http media boreme com post media 2009 hot or not composite images 2 1 jpg ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,love your analysis i picked up on the same things as you and i see what you are saying about the less genuine smiles the eyes also have a different feel in comparison to the women under 5 to add on to what you are saying about the differences in features the defining trait that seems to push people to the below 4 5 category is being obese these women are not smiling as much probably because they are self conscious and embarrassed they also wear less makeup not that it would make a huge difference between 4 5 and 5 5 the women look entirely unremarkable i feel like the 5s have the most balanced of faces but beauty requires more than that they are not exceptionally feminine or striking but there is not anything wrong with their proportions 6 really gives off the girl next door vibe i think its the tan and her smile she looks so open and approachable you should look at my comment to u littlegoosegirl to see some cool charts showing how different facial features are associated with different personality traits i agree the miss universe composites are way hotter than any of the women in hot or not the africa photo is lovely is not it i do not think the fuller features would go away completely but i agree with you that they might be diminished a bit if even more women were included somehow my favourite is the finalists but all of them are truly beautiful ,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,yes i definitely was not trying to present these images as the be all end all when it comes to depicting female beauty i think there a lot to discuss both the areas that the images excel and provoke thought and also the ways that they may be lacking i kept a lot of my thoughts out of the post so that i did not bias anyone so i appreciate you bringing up this point ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,from what i understand hot or not catered to a demo that was overwhelmingly middle class and below and the people participating are mostly under 35 i think that makes the composites useful references for the average person curious to learn what people find attractive almost all women hit their peak smv sometime between 16 and 25 and women over 25 are considered more attractive if they look youthful the ethnic makeup of the site seems to be in line with the makeup of the us population at the time this is an old image i don t get an overwhelmingly latin vibe but i do see the influence of multiple groups if you look at the composite image of the americas in the second graphic you can see that influence as well especially when compared to the european composite i don t think that it hurts anything in the hot or not composites especially since the ideal look in america isn t based 100 on any one group s features one thing that i think contributes to the perception that some lower ranking composites are more attractive is that the subtle shifts between each square affect more than how feminine or hot the women seem in this image https i stack imgur com eanhw png you can see that bone structure proportions and ratios have a huge difference in how a woman is perceived they also did the same thing for men here https i stack imgur com ty84l jpg to be clear these are composites created after individuals ranked different photos on different traits i wonder how much our assessments are impacted by subconscious judgements about the personality of the woman depicted i completely agree that the paleness of the highest ranked woman is due to makeup and lighting her eyes are more defined which lends credence to that theory as well honestly past 8 5 most girls blur together in the really hot category and those factors usually hinge on size of eyes and lips vs size of nose and chin yep and that s why i like this chart it shows how women you d see on a daily basis stack up in real life outside of big cities there are not drop dead gorgeous people at every turn the 1 10 scale is more subtle 5 7s are not boring or ugly or undesirable 8 10s stand out of course but they look more real here vs what you see depicted in magazines or on film the miss universe photos also seem more realistic those women are gorgeous but you can definitely picture them as existing in real life perhaps this speaks to the level of editing and manipulation that is done to photos today that composite images seem more realistic than what is offered lol have you read my post on the characteristics of feminine beauty i ve also shared a few links on feminine bone structure and i have plenty more if you re interested don t want to be redundant if you ve already taken a look but the end of your comment made it seem like you hadn t read them so just let me know ,2,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325,absolutely we are two of a kind you have definitely been a great contributor to the community so far and i am excited about the future maybe we could collaborate on something together ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,great point it probably because asians are too high achieving and do not really fit their victim narrative is there legitimate institutional racism that afflicts certain black populations absolutely but that is not what most sjws and feminists care about at all and it definitely not why most of those contestants were chosen just thinking out loud right now and connecting some dots between existing theories but i feel like black women are venerated so much by sjws because black women are pretty much at the bottom of the list when it comes to status in the sexual marketplace and female social matrix there are so many factors as to why and that is a separate convo but feminism has definitely always been about evening the playing field between high value women and women with low value obviously there are women of all backgrounds at every point on the value spectrum i am just speaking in general terms here if the competition was 100 about looks we would see less diversity but the black women who made it would have truly earned it and leftists seem to be against fairly earning something semi related have you seen these composite images of beauty pageant winners from across the world https www newscientist com blogs shortsharpscience composite 20miss 20world jpg so cool how similar everyone looks definitely a good argument for innate human preferences and objective beauty i actually might submit this image as it own thread it pretty awesome ,2,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325,so well put in the real world people are not necessarily chained to their skin color gender or nationality when it comes to evaluating policies incredibly true and hopefully people start to resist being put in a box based on how they look ,6,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,it great that she spoke her mind and is handling the backlash with grace from what i can tell i think it hilarious that people are freaking out when she is not even that conservative people on the left are so quick to tear her apart but she is pro equalism which is what feminists love to claim feminism is about if you corner them in an argument on a separate controversial note i do not think she was the most beautiful contestant and it bothers me that only one of the top 5 women was white https pbs twimg com media c 1icwsu0aanpvc jpg yes miss illinois http angelopedia com newspic fomhjgb2k6nwsimg jpg is gorgeous but the others there were definitely women far more beautiful that could have been in the top 5 i did not watch it so maybe all of those women truly were the best i just want contestants to advance in the competition based on merit and not because of politics ,4,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,ohh okay well i think that the majority of the population would embrace the lowered standards in a more extreme way that what we are seeing now so i was thinking more about this subject last night and i feel like there are so many more ways to signal and and gain status than there were in the past because of the variety of outlets and options i think the power of appearance has fallen significantly in a lot of circles i see this as being connected to the idea of persona striving http akinokure blogspot com 2015 11 persona contests next development in html vs lifestyle striving and career striving it not about wearing the best outfits or looking awesome at all times which would be more career and lifestyle status contests your appearance has to communicate the persona and for a lot of people that means that there is less pressure to look put together in the traditional mainstream way some personas require rejecting those norms outright or rebelling against them others are about looking like you do not have time for anything or like you cannot adult properly i will flesh out the connection in a future post i think the gears are turning but i have more to think about ,4,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325,take a ton of pics at home in your bathroom or wherever else is private with decent lighting practice different poses angles and expressions identify which ones you look best in and practice those more so that it a reflex while doing this definitely have on makeup styled hair nice clothes etc so that it accurate playing music can help you feel more confident it might sound like a lot but doing this until you have mastered a few looks will ensure that you look awesome in photos because you wo not have to think about it ,1,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325, i also believe that the simple habits we practice such as grooming affect us more than we expect you know that old tip that says to make your bed first thing in the morning it seems pointless but it nurtures a sense of productivity encourages overall organization and makes you feel welcome and just plain good when you get home same concept agreed i also think that focusing on your appearance helps develop femininity in women patience attention to detail appreciation of beauty gentleness discipline etc are some of the fruits that come from really devoting time and energy into looking great on a daily basis based off facebook beach pics i am beginning to see some of my sjw friends shaving their legs again the future looks bright and smooth thank goodness ,7,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325,love this subject i actually shortened my comment so that there can be more discussion i definitely have more to say but want to have something more manageable to respond to do you agree our personal standards have declined if so what would you indicate as the cause of the decline yes the general standards for what is appropriate to wear in various contexts is way more casual today vs in the past i read and reread and study a lot of old etiquette books and their guidelines for dress reveal just how much things have changed of course i m going to say that prole drift is a cause of the decline of personal standards but i have some other ideas as well improvements in technology make it easier for different types of clothing to be made and cared for synthetic fabrics lend themselves to all sorts of styles and they are cheaper making them easier to obtain more variety in entertainment allows people to seek out the exact content they are interested in this creates a bubble where people don t have to feel judged for not meeting certain standards for every possible niche there are online and offline communities and resources reinforcing those norms there is less struggle in general so people are lazier and don t feel as much pressure to present themselves nicely at all times i agree with the second article when it says that people are primarily focused on their individual comfort and less concerned with other people or what is appropriate this ties in really nicely with the cocooning theory written about extensively on akinokure i have a particular blog post in mind so i ll have to find it and link it here do you think it becomes a self fulfilling cycle how might it affect our culture to hold ourselves and one another to lower standards i assume you mean higher standards if we held everyone to even lower standards i think a lot of people would do the absolute bare minimum before leaving their homes i definitely think casual and or inappropriate dress is reinforced by the media as well as individuals so many in the public eye dress improperly for the given situation which signals to audiences that this is an acceptable thing to do even youtube gurus promote dressing casually and skimpily to millions of women across the country i ve seen influencers slammed for looking matronly trying too hard stuck up etc just for wearing demure and or professional dresses and skirts all of these outside influences affect what is considered cool and normal within social groups so it makes it harder for individual women to change if they want to avoid criticism or ridicule if we held everyone to higher standards i think there would be resistance at first but in the end everyone would benefit i m fortunate that where i grew up everyone dressed well it really impacts how people carry themselves and act are there any specific fashions or attitudes you think this has affected for the better no not off the top of my head i m totally open to hearing the positives though which direction do you see our relationship with fashion going in the next 5 10 or 20 years i think in the next 5 years the divide will only get bigger between the two camps traditional vs casual all the time after that maybe we ll see a return to normalcy in america as a whole and higher standards for appearance will come with that ,6,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,great point there were definitely more attractive white women in the competition than the one who made it to the top 5 in my opinion ms illinois is beautiful but the other minority women seem to only be there for political reasons of course pageants are not 100 based on looks but do those women really have personalities so amazing that they beat the other objectively more beautiful women the woman who won looks attractive depending on the angle her makeup and fashion choices which are often questionable looking at her instagram there are several women who look consistently gorgeous including other black women like ms illinois i just feel like in a beauty pageant we cannot discount physical appearance just to make a statement ,3,The_Donald
camille11325,great find time and again male and female nature are proven to be real and ideal for each gender so great that the study confirmed a lot of what we discuss here that definition of healthy masculinity they gave was kind of gross was not it i feel legitimately repulsed by non masculine men ,7,RedPillWives
camille11325,a lot of people today do not dare with the intention of getting married to the person they are dating they are just looking for companionship ub the moment this can change as they get older or they just marry whoever they are with at the time because marriage is just what you do and there are tons of couples who never marry even after 5 years do not stress your man out or cause drama or read into things i am not trying to scare you and do not have enough info to really give advice in this situation be optimistic but prepared for anything ,3,RedPillWives
camille11325,agreed ,2,RedPillWives
camille11325,disclaimer i have never read any laura doyle books iknew i wanted to marry m day 3 of knowing him and we officially started our relationship it was with the understanding that we would be getting married i think dating with the intention to get married is so key from the first moment you should make sure he fits your criteria for your husband not in a rigid or harsh way just as a background process while youre having fun and wowing him if he is looking to settle down he will be doing the same for you i really do not understand all the secrecy and refusal to discuss marriage within a relationship it does not ruin anything to be upfront abiut your goals and intentions you do not have to be engaged by 6 months but i would be concerned if one or both parties literally has mo clue about what they want the future of the relationship to be on phone so sorry if there are typos ,10,RedPillWives

camille11325,everything you just said is exactly what i had in mind including the not lying about santa claus part i really love the idea of treating kids like future adults i definitely still want to let kids be kids while they are under 12 but people really coddle or otherwise hold back teenagers i think kids 100 need those people too the uncle that slips them beer at age 13 the aunt that sneaks them into rated r movies before mom says so i do not think it can be done as well with your kids because you need to maintain that level of respect but kids need to be exposed to bad things in fun and safe environments to learn more about the world and know they have role models who will give them insights while still looking out for their best interests yes exactly ,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,yay i am excited as well thanks for all your hard work 3,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,in a lot of ways my upbringing reinforced traditional values i spent a lot of time in church choir and in dance classes both activities that encouraged femininity self discipline and good character i also was not allowed to watch much tv when young and never had one in my room these things i will definitely repeat with my own kids also my father is a very masculine and dominant man which is very important for the home there will be tons of changes as well not all specifically aimed at instilling traditional values though that will just happen naturally since m and i have strong personalities and our views are evident in nearly everything we do we are also in a conservative area with conservative friends and family around us so i am not worried at all ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,your comment made me smile i also like being the fun aunt but i am totally a bad influence hahaha i think leading by example is great being a resource when they seek you out and also explaining why you make the choices you make without pushing those choices on them is more than enough to spark an interest in a curious young mind definitely in the future i think that my daughter and her friends will turn to me for straight talk about relationships and life in general i would also like to be the parent called if they need a ride home b c they are too drunk not sober or if they got in a jam i would rather be there in times of crisis than have them hide it and get into a more dangerous situation ,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,my paternal grandmother embodied biblical womanhood and definitely set a standard to live up to in terms of being a good wife mother and friend i cannot point to a specific moment or aspect that had the largest impact she was just an exceptional woman who excelled in traditional female areas with grace her humility and devotion to her husband were two of her best traits while my work on r redpillwives fnf and the old rpw before we moved subs counts as being a role model i contribute to these communities in order to connect with like minded women i do not have any desires to specifically be a role model to anyone i do not want to have that sort of pressure affecting my life choices or the things i say my top concerns are my happiness and m happiness and the decisions that we make are not necessarily the right ones for others and i have no interest in changing anything about me or my lifestyle to better appeal to others or spread a certain message the only impact i know i will have on the next generation will be through raising children ,2,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325, skincare product definitely oil cleansing to remove makeup before using a regular cleanser i have been doing it for a few years now and wo not switch to any other method unless something truly revolutionary comes out cannot believe i was relying on makeup wipes for so long vitamin supplements it cliche but biotin really does help with hair growth you just have to drink a lot of water when you take it hair care roller setting such a great way to style your hair without using a lot of heat i am really fast at setting my hair now and i use my computer while under the dryer so it does not take any time out of my life really i can get a straight curly or in between style depending on what techniques i use and my hair is always bouncy and soft changing clothing styles cut colour etc obviously i am going to say kibbe https www reddit com r femininenotfeminist comments 64g5nk guide an introduction to kibbe makeup technique starting with my darkest darks so that i do not accidentally make my face too intense or unbalanced my eyebrows are essentially black so those go on first and it gives me a frame of reference for eyeshadow and doing my eyes before blush ensures that i do not go overboard there either if i wear red lipstick that goes on first so that i do not make my eyebrows or anything else too harsh doing eyebrows eyes and or red lips first also helps me not over apply base makeup because those colours take away focus from tiny flaws i would have fixated on otherwise and that how most people see me anyways so it allows me to have a lighter hand and look more seamless change in diet drinking bone broth makes me feel and look really healthy i get this brand it basically farm to table http www pacificfoods com food broths stocks bone broths organic bone broth chicken aspx ,7,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325,yeah it so weird that leftist women applaud men taking over a female space and appropriating our language and practices i am 100 for separate male and female spaces for certain activities it traditional and allows both genders to flourish i also feel like most male bgs are not even very talented and certainly less talented than other female bgs with smaller channels and followings are yet they seem immune to criticism yes well except for j who probably has the most amount of actual talent it open season on him since he said some racist stuff years ago not defending him just pointing out how foolish it all is lol you know i have never actually seen a jeffree star video they talk about him all the time i am just tired of him in general the whole thing really is foolish welcome to fnf ,1,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325,i am about to start retinol so that should erase them it really not bad at all but in the short term i am really focusing on hydration and plumping the skin i got the drunk elephant b hydra gel for an extra boost but i am actually underwhelmed with it when i mix it in with my moisturizer i notice a difference but if i do it on its own underneath moisturizer it does nothing no idea why but i am experimenting to see if i can get it to work as a single layer if not i will definitely use up the bottle but wo not repurchase will have to find an ampoule or similar hyaluronic acid serum gel to replace it spraying mist in between different steps really helps my face feel full locking in hydration is just so key i love the one love organics vitamin d mist and i am excited about exploring the world of face mists i am sheet masking more often every other or every night i love the donkey milk aqua mask and i will be getting some whamisa masks and this one brand i saw on sephora whos name is escaping me right now maybe starts with a k it has peptides speaking of peptides the buffet serum by the ordinary i was not a fan of their alpha arbutin hyaluronic acid serum and it is too soon to tell for buffet but i am hopeful also i have an eye cream that has peptides in it by youth to the people i definitely have noticed improvement finally sleeping masks are so key for me even the average ones still make a difference i just finished one by sheseido and i am about to get the sulwhasoo overnight revitalizing mask oh also i have an acid toner now ole henricksen it marketed as an oil control acne toner but it has ahas and bhas it not crazy strong but it definitely works it actually helped keep my hormonal acne under control which is great since that the only time i break out now hope that helps as you know skincare is my obsession i could have written a novel but tried to keep it short lol ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,m is always honest with me even if what he has to say is negative he does not hold back and is only tactful if it something i am extremely touchy about i have toughened up a bit over the years but i still cry 95 of the time in response to any criticism lol i cannot help it his opinion matters so much and i get really self conscious and embarrassed usually we just end up laughing at the fact that i am crying it just my natural response when i am overwhelmed with emotion it fine though he likes that i am a sensitive person in other areas of life this is just part of that i know i will get better as time goes on it not causing any issues in our relationship so it not a priority for me i am definitely never blunt with anyone ever i hate confrontation indirectness tact compliment sandwiches or just not bringing it up are my mo ,6,RedPillWives

camille11325,agreed 100 it gotten to the point where i do not even know who i would be without the influence of my husband my personality has been utterly shaped by my relationship and i love it i have had so many acquaintances and even close friends question the health of my relationship because i was willing to let myself be shaped and pruned by my husband but the joke is on them because i am happier than all of them put together 3 this resonates with me so deeply i am so happy to see someone else feels the same way i really cannot phrase it any better than you just did and i am so happy that you are in the best relationship for you i think that so many women today are concerned about independence and identity to the point where they are unable to be in a union with their man as an example when normal heterosexual couples use the term partner to express their equality it really just shows how much things have changed marriage is not two becoming one anymore it two individuals leading separate lives that intersect when mutually beneficial ,3,RedPillWives

camille11325, in this day and age young couples sorry to generalize i mean no offense tend to treat their love like it is a performance and their lavish dates have to be good enough to meet what looks successful according to the internet i have seen fancy date photos and brag posts about people relationships when i see that it screams more to me about how much the relationship actually lacks compared to what it has yes it all about getting attention not about true connection with the one you love a lot of people today do not know how to be vulnerable or authentic i think tech advances and the new norms that came with them reinforce traits that prevent true intimacy ,2,RedPillWives

camille11325, not having funds for lavish dates is not a 2017 thing it a youth thing there were not lavish funds for 19yos in the early 80s either no one went on lavish dates in their teens in any year such a great point i feel like people get the wrong idea from movies tv shows and magazines and then try to live up to that ,6,RedPillWives

camille11325, so what are you thoughts about the youtube personality deleting her video and using a new title i understand why she did it but i think it was a bad decision both from an ideological perspective and a business perspective her original title was the best one to appeal to the target audience it had key words that would show up if someone did a google search or searched on youtube and women absolutely are searching how to look sexy without being slutty or a variation of that query the new title does not really speak to what women really want to know including the term slutty made it clear that she would show you the right way to present yourself to prevent others from forming the wrong opinion about you male or female naked does not have the same layers of meaning all the women talking about how lut and similar language is a serious issue i do not care about their concerns and do not see why most people would either as much as they say the stance is about freedom and equality it really seems to be about hurt feelings and status in the fsm those who lead a lifestyle that is considered slutty by modern or traditional standards do not like that their choices are labeled as undesirable and they do not like that women actively try to distinguish themselves from sluts they feel left out and they want to try to bully people into giving them higher status the only non sluts i have seen arguing against slut shaming are low rmv women who i can only assume look up to sluts because they at least are achieving some sort of success in the smp do you think words like slut skank and whore should not be used since the main idea against slut shaming is that women should have it as easy as possible in the smp with few consequences i cannot say that i agree the words are an important way for women and men to influence the actions of other women and maintain a balance in the system when more women engage in slutty behaviour it changes male expectations for other women and lowers the incentive for them to commit and or stay committed i think it in the interest of nearly all women to enforce the idea that certain practices are inappropriate ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i used to have a big problem gaining weight and then it turned out that i have celiac i literally was not absorbing nutrients and going gluten free taking steroids really turned that around so my advice is to bring up your weight with your doctor just in case there is an underlying medical issue preventing you from gaining weight normally not that you have celiac but maybe there another reason you have stalled maca powder can be added to food and smoothies or just mixed with water and that should definitely help with weight gain ,2,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325,the love languages i prefer to receive vs use differ as well i express my love through acts of service and words of affirmation but i prefer receiving physical touch and quality time maybe not everyone gives love in the way they want to receive it but i do think that a lot of women fail to recognise that their men prefer different love languages entirely for example a lot of women enjoy providing acts of service for their men and they are hurt and confused when their men try to get them to take a break and do an activity with them quality time they assumed that the way they prefer to express love is the way their man prefers to receive love i have also definitely seen women on this sub struggle with the idea that their idea of fun and or romantic is not the same as their mans your unique situation definitely seems to have shielded you from these misunderstandings and that is so awesome women who find their man later in life have a lot more to adjust and relearn m and i have been together since i was 19 and i am almost 23 now but i get what you are saying about how the relationship impacts the adult you become so much of my personality is the direct result of being with m and it allows me to be the best woman possible for him ,11,RedPillWives
camille11325, i really though that the op was being attacked for getting misguided advice from her aunt so i defended her and then myself honest mistake okay i will believe you and i am willing to move on in the future just ask a clarifying question before insulting someone i appreciate your response i am working on it and learning the nuances of this sub i am not perfect but no doubt i have my opinions but again i will learn the appropriate context have you looked at our wiki https www reddit com r redpillwives wiki index this page gives the highlights of rpw https www reddit com r redpillwives wiki about and then we have an essential posts section filled with great in depth content if you are interested in a specific subject just ask me or make a post using the flair askrpw everyone here loves to help you just have to be sincere ,7,RedPillWives
camille11325,this comment is so amazing i should have looked at her comment history before i wrote my other reply i assumed she was being solipsistic and did not realise that women can have different standards but clearly this was not an innocent mistake people who go on and on about being classy and a lady are usually compensating and or hypocrites and she not an exception edit she has apologised to me hopefully she responds well to you and we can all move on ,10,RedPillWives
camille11325, why would you call someone deliberately trying to wrong you by a neutral or even kind title this is such a great question we have zero obligation to treat people with respect and kindness if they are actively doing something cruel to us stealing a woman fiance or husband has a devastating effect on the wronged woman who would expect her to remain perfectly happy at all times who would expect her to speak highly of the other woman these are really unrealistic standards completely at odds with both human nature and female nature if an individual woman desires to hold herself to this sort of standard cool but to apply this as a blanket rule to all women maybe we need to do a separate post about how there is a hierarchy of the different relationships we are involved in and each level receives different treatment to echo your other comment your so gets treated better than your coworker who gets treated better than a random stranger at the grocery store and that stranger gets treated better than a different stranger who tries to rob you the only person who should get 100 of your psychological femininity submission deference gofl ness etc is your man and there is not anything wrong with expressions of anger disgust annoyance or any other negative emotion provided it appropriate to the situation at hand ,13,RedPillWives
camille11325,this is not r emilypost it great that you have a clear set of standards for your behaviour but again shaming someone for their use of the term skank in this instance is inappropriate the subreddit wiki makes it clear that our definition of femininity is not restricted to one archetype some women choose not to use bad words others refrain from drinking and then there are women on the other side of the spectrum both types of women and those in between are able to use the information on rpw to improve their relationships this does not mean that i do not think one should have standards when it comes to word choice but there are a lot of factors behind where to draw the line i do not think it as black and white as you are making it a civil discussion about different positions would be excellent for the sub i encourage you to get the ball rolling i would also love to have a discussion about femininity and social class because there are definitely different standards and norms at each level but this comment section is not the right place ,9,RedPillWives
camille11325, skanks is this what we are calling other women now how elegant this is attempt at shaming is completely unnecessary there is nothing unfeminine about defending your relationship against the attempts of scheming women a woman who tries to steal your man is not deserving of your respect it such a sleazy thing to do to someone is skank a hurtful word absolutely but that the point it supposed to insult the other woman because she is doing something wrong you do not have to use the term if you do not like it but there is absolutely nothing wrong with the comment left by u lauraxvii ,18,RedPillWives
camille11325,i am confused are you currently interested in a nearly married taken man and unsure of what to do or is this a general discussion question that does not relate to your personal life in any way i think flirting with and pursuing taken men is more common than we would like to think but i would never suggest it to anyone morality aside it just does not make that much sense as a strategy if you are of average or higher rmv you should not have any problem getting men who are actually available why waste time trying to convince someone who is not on the market more often than not does not the man just string the other woman along dangling the promise of something more in front of her and if he does leave his woman do you really want to deal with that drama and the baggage he will definitely have also can you really trust a man who you got together with via and affair i would seriously question the character and value of a woman who was comfortable with what you are describing edit word choice ,6,RedPillWives
camille11325,lol is not it such a fun song i cannot help but dance as it plays ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i absolutely love listening to music as i get ready the right combination of songs helps me feel energetic flirty and ready for anything i use spotify and constantly tweak my playlist so that i do not have to pause what i am doing and choose a new song there are a range of genres but most of the songs are either about being in love or enjoying life i stay away from anything sad angry or aggressive because i do not want anything to bring down my spirits one song that i am obsessed with at the moment is queen of boredness by kinny https www youtube com watch v mus6vyz ksq i heard it first on big little lies and just had to add it to the playlist the entire big little lies soundtrack is on spotify as well in case anyone was looking for it ,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i would not use the term battle line but yeah essentially it so important that we do our part to minimize conflict and bring joy to our relationship but there are plenty of situations where our men may need to be corrected in some way i just thought of another scenario to avoid correcting him in front of an audience i feel like it better to do that sort of thing privately do not want to embarrass him or give a bad impression to others again this depends on your man some may not care at all or even prefer you to tell them asap regardless of what is going on around him this is why knowing your man is key it the only way we can truly respect and support him ,3,RedPillWives
camille11325,how wonderful i am usually good at doing exactly what you described but recently i realised that gift giving is one of m top languages whereas it last on the list for me m has been offering to take me shopping and get me things and i did not connect it to love languages at all even though now it obvious i would say things like no thanks let just watch a movie together or some other quality time activity one of my top languages i am definitely going to make an effort to be receptive to gifts ,7,RedPillWives
camille11325,i personally do not always agree with what laura doyle recommends but that because i am not her target audience some women really need to work on holding their tongue because every time they open their mouths they are disrespectful and hurting their relationship in their case it really is better to say nothing when it comes to bringing up something your man is wrong about i feel like you have to consider his personality and how important the topic in question is does it really matter what the nutritional value of iceberg lettuce is no so you probably do not need to correct him a woman who constantly has to fact check and nit pick her man statements would get annoying very quickly however if it something that actually matters then you would have to pick the right timing and method of telling him this varies from man to man and woman to woman some broad guidelines would be not bringing up something that would upset angry him when he is already upset angry stressed or when he is enjoying himself also tone facial expressions body language and word choice are key you would never want to imply that your man was an idiot for being wrong about x ,3,RedPillWives
camille11325,this is such a lovely reminder thank your for posting it i am personally working on lesson 1 because life has gotten a bit out of control recently and self care is always the first thing i put on hold in order to deal with everything else it easier for me to ignore my personal needs and focus on everyone else but this is not sustainable ,3,RedPillWives
camille11325, i am grateful that m and i are fully moved into the new place i was responsible for 90 of the packing unpacking and organising so that ate up all my time we also did not have internet and ran out of phone data pretty quickly while that was annoying and i was not able to be on reddit as much as i wanted i was able to really focus and be productive i am so grateful for m he is turning 35 this weekend and i am throwing a party for him planning this has also taken me away from reddit sorry everyone and i am just so happy that he is who he is and that we are together i am grateful for life in general my uncle died recently and that was a major reminder of how important every day is i know it sounds cliche but it true ,3,RedPillWives

camille11325,agreed 100 i really enjoyed how nuanced all of the characters and dynamics were at the beginning of the show and felt that the conclusion removed a lot of that shading i completely agree with what you are saying about how perry character was cheapened and the women were reduced so many things happened before the final chapters that were complicated and or twisted and i was pretty frustrated that in the end these intriguing grey areas were resolved in a cliche manner it felt too easy ,3,biglittlelies
camille11325,i am sure there are plenty of communities subs and forums specifically for trans women to talk about being trans this is not a space about how to be female fnf is a sub where women can celebrate the femininity we have intrinsically and discuss beauty culture and self development with likeminded women try doing a google search to find trans specific forums or again try to blend with a new account just know that on this sub no one is going to walk you through how to pass as female feminine ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,this post was removed because it violated our rules regarding trans people posting i agree with u stingrayvc when she says we would never know you were trans if you had not put it in your name just ask questions and partake like any one else here and no one would care either way what is the point of making yourself stand out like this when all you have to do is participate a big reason that we have a rule against trans is because they make things all about them their status your username and this post are great examples if you made a new account and acted like everyone else we would never know ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i do not think so i have seen women roller set hip length hair maybe past your butt would be too long but even then they make some huge rollers haha i use large magnetic rollers they sell all sorts of sizes on amazon and in beauty specific stores you do not have to get a multi pack depending on the exact look i am going for i will use rollers between 1 5 and 2 5 inches i also do not roller set my hair when it is soaking wet something that is often advised i dry my hair with a t shirt and wait a bit before adding products and setting that way i am not under the dryer all day ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,no they do not last 4 days and i do not think they ever will due to sleeping in a bun nightly ms preference pin curls and other methods of preservation are not sexy lol at the moment i get 2 days of great hair 1 day of pretty good hair and then after that i wear it in a bun until i wash it that day or day 5 my plan at the moment is to find a product i can use so that on day 3 at night day 4 in the am i can refresh my style and have my hair feel soft and nourished but not weighed down that way i can have my hair down for 4 5 days instead of only liking the first 3 days when it comes to glutathione pretty much everyone can benefit from helping their bodies increase it my diet is very clean 90 whole foods organic best practices as much as possible most meals cooked by me from scratch etc but i have celiacs and i take medicine for migraines that apparently lowers glutathione so i am interested in amping up my immune system and taking my health to the next level increasing glutathione is also supposed to have a positive impact on your appearance glowing skin and longer hair and anti aging benefits which makes sense here more info http blog radiantlifecatalog com bid 39522 what is glutathione and why do we need it ,2,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325,so cute and classic i bet if you look on pinterest there are a ton of great outfit ideas that pair tweed blazers or blazers in general with skirts and dresses i do not get a masculine vibe at all if you are worried about looking too stiff think about the colours textures and patterns you wear along w the blazer also you can add some softness with your makeup and hairstyles ,5,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,replying on mobile hit send too soon it not about it being hard to comprehend it about whether or not a position can be defended when looked at under a magnifying glass can you prove your side rationally can you convince someone without relying on cliche phrases shaming or appeals to emotion in an honest debate discussion you do not just say that things are obvious or common sense you have not differentiated yourself from others on the left who dodge legitimate questions ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,great job ignoring everything that i said you still have not justified any of your statements and to be clear your position as described in your initial comment and your justification is based on liberal values you may not be an sjw but your comments certainly put you on the left side of the spectrum at least with this issue ,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i was bringing up the fact that those questions are out there not asking you the questions in an attempt to gain understanding for myself the point i am making is that no assertion is immune from being questioned a lot of people refuse to engage in debate regarding cultural appropriation and just dismiss any sort of argument as offensive i think it would be more interesting to discuss the actual justifications behind various positions instead of just attacking those who disagree let look at your response to me and assume that i was in fact asking you those qs instead of using them as a rhetorical device if someone asks a question about why something is offensive then replying can you not see the offensiveness in that and come on that cannot be serious is not the best way to show it to them you have to make a case you have not proven anything except for my point that valid avenues of discussion are closed off when it lefitsts get uncomfortable you could have taken the time to explain exactly how wearing an item that you enjoy is an act of mocking i asked a lot of legitimate questions in my post that you did not remotely come close to addressing you assume that putting yourself in someone shoes is necessary but you do not explain why in a debate or argument you cannot just say its common sense and expect that to be a reasonable response and then saying this at the end i guess you are one of those people who have to experience it first to understand why it is hurtful is just condescending you are saying that i do not agree with you because i have not experienced what you are talking about as if the only reason that i would think differently is lack of exposure you have zero insight into who i am or what my personal answers are to the questions i posed can you not comprehend that people can have experiences and come away with different opinions than you the left ,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,thank you i was hoping someone would bring this up a relationship can be inappropriate immoral or illegal without it being pedophilia there are plenty of reasons to disapprove of this woman actions and i think the term sexual predator is fitting using that term when it unwarranted does not help anyone cause it just desensitizes people to the proper use of the word for criminals that are actually trying to have sex with children yes ,3,The_Donald
camille11325,i agree completely re jeffre he is all about shock value and controversy and as much as they claim to hate him posts about him generate the most activity notice how we do not talk about him on this sub we made a rule and it followed super simple and no drama lol i do not know if everyone even knows about the rule but then that goes to show just how easy it is not not care about him and really mean it you bring up some great questions regarding white feminism they are so black and white and i honestly do not think they even consider alternate perspective and nuances before deciding on positions i think a legitimate criticism of feminism as practiced by white women initially would be the promotion of female empowerment in the workplace which took many white women out of their homes and then homemaking jobs were outsourced to minorities nannies house cleaning services etc but i am not criticizing this from a leftist perspective i wish that women did not enter the male sphere en masse at all that being said i can definitely see the merits to the argument that white feminists live in a bubble they do but so do black women and other minorities who have time to be intersectional feminists and or in blm basically i feel like there is a sliver of truth that they are touching on but i cannot stand by the arguments themselves or the proposed solutions it pretty interesting how controlling mods can become belligerent intolerance is always ugly even when it under the guise of tolerance but i do not think this is restricted to the left groupthink is a problem on a lot of forums and there are a number of right subreddits that are equally intolerant of commenters that do not toe the line regarding that subreddit specific flavor of groupthink agreed there is a difference between having a specific focus to the subreddit and censorship some subs are explicitly about positive discussion towards x like the donald and i think that great because it clear in the rules and it literally the purpose of the sub their focus is more limited but even then there are robust discussions and debates within the comments i do see groupthink on that sub but actually not when it comes to conservative issues there are a lot of liberal stances that many people assume everyone shares the presence of these positions within the greater community only underscores the fact that differences of opinion are welcome on the sub i think anyone who bashes t d for censorship does not read it regularly i also think there is a tendency for non conservatives to label a group of conservatives who mostly agree as a circlejerk close minded etc regardless of the degree of actual closed mindedness and then there an assumption that being open minded is superior in contrast many of the beauty communities claim to be for everyone people routinely are encouraged to share alternate opinions but then anything that goes against the grain is punished thanks for commenting ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,thanks for the tag i honestly do not understand women who do not wear makeup or men who say they do not like women that do not wear makeup properly applied makeup makes everyone look better and it just a normal female activity and interest i cannot think of a single person in my life that was not wearing makeup every day by 16 i agree with those saying that men claims are virtue signaling and hamstering and that they do not even know half the time who is and is not wearing makeup the instagram look and most noticeable makeup looks are sexy when done right because they exaggerate signs of sexual maturity of course men like it women would not do it en masse if men did not like it that why its the style women wear to bars and clubs it is arousing and it looks good in photos lol ,2,PurplePillDebate
camille11325,your position is thought out and makes sense and i do not disagree that people of a certain religion group will feel disrespected if they see out groupers wearing their garb out of context but there is a lot to the cultural appropriation discussion that is not covered by that statement and even your statement could be questioned just looking at what you are proposing i could ask why should someone who is not part of a specific religion should adhere to the rules of that religion why should out groupers imbue objects symbols and practices with the exact same significance as in group members why cannot they form their own relationship with said symbol object practice if an individual chooses not to insult or annoy a specific friend coworker neighbor etc but otherwise wears whatever would be considered offensive in a situation where no one is around to be offended does it matter can something be inherently disrespectful or does disrespect require the presence of a wronged party how much of an influence should complete strangers who we would never interact with have on our wardrobe choices and overall look should people refrain from posting photos to social media on the off chance that they would offend someone who happened upon their profile i really wish honest discussion on all sides was possible u bellascarletta brought up a great point about how half of the argument is entirely off limits and i think this prevents growth there are so many assumptions made on the other side about what is and is not moral and true but they do not seem to realise that these are assumptions and not axioms thanks so much for your comment ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,why do you feel the need to rationalize this hobby hundreds of thousands of other women engage in the same activities as you every day while everyone is doing it is not always a good justification in this case hopefully you can see how you are not abnormal or evil or anything else whenever i get insomnia i lurk on gurugossip and it always a blast ,2,RedPillWives
camille11325, have you checked out rpwi chat room lol this was my first thought too ,2,RedPillWives
camille11325,is this behaviour actually causing problems in your life is it affecting your ability to get a man make your man happy if the answer to both of those is no then i do not really think you need to do anything about it many of us here agree that women need a daily dose of drama and for some gossip sites scratch that itch what does reducing negativity in my life actually mean for you if you are having an enjoyable time does that really count as negativity identify your own standards based on your lifestyle and values if you legitimately want to stop going to those sites then you need willpower and something else to fill the time there is not a magic trick block the sites with an extension and spend more time with the people you love and or get some hobbies ,7,RedPillWives

camille11325,will write more later just remind me we are moving today so there no internet on phone but cannot say all i want to with the tiny keyboard there are areas where i agree and disagree with your comment but it a super interesting discussion that i look forward to continuing later today ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,everything that you said is so great i cannot even add to it you really hit the nail on the head i would love to hear your thoughts after you actually read the comments some of them are especially hilarious horrifying ake a statement like cultural appropriation is bad then underneath it branch into agree or disagree yes they engage in debate and take different positions but it all falls under the branch of agree they may not see eye to eye on their solutions or interpretations of the issues or what have you but they cannot engage with anything that falls under the entire branch of disagree anybody operating under that branch of perspective is immediately demonized and labeled as a racist misogynist other buzzword this part really sucks because i think there are interesting conversations to be had in the disagree camp for example questioning the definition of cultural appropriation itself when is it real if at all another question how many people feelings do you have to consider before making a decision about what to wear i fully understand the desire to appeal to your family friends and individuals in your immediate sphere eg office guests at a party etc but if there are not any people who would be offended by what you are wearing should not that be factored into the equation there was a women in the bgc comments who did not wear traditional indian dress to an event she was invited to because she was worried about offending anyone she had the explicit permission of the indians who would be there who wanted her to wear the clothing but she was terrified of going against sjw morals and appropriating their culture why do the feelings of hypothetical strangers matter more than the feelings of people you know and care about this goes back to what i was saying about pathological altruism the left i think the loss of ability to communicate with anyone who views issues differently than them is the true crime of the left absolutely i would never claim to be open minded or tolerant but i definitely love exploring ideas and hearing the perspectives of others i had a lovely exchange with u sunflowerhacker in this very thread and we were both able to learn from each other i would like to think lol reddit seems to be getting worse each week so it good that we carved out this space when we did ,6,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,love hearing your thought process and i really appreciate that you took the time to explain your stance on these things i agree with basically everything you have said although i will go a bit further and argue that women entering the male workforce en masse has been terrible for both our economy and culture just like you i am a big fan of people promoting their ideals through private means charity organizations etc we can accomplish so much in our communities without the government involvement thanks for sharing the yt video i am not a feminist in the slightest not just a rejection of the most recent wave but all waves and versions so i am not a fan of the arguments in favor of previous waves but he definitely makes some good points and pokes holes in the most common arguments it great that there are people on every part of the ideological spectrum that are spreading knowledge ,6,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,yes so irrational i cannot even imagine the level of cognitive dissonance they must go through on any given day lol there also a segment of them who keep referring europe as if all 50 countries are the same lololol imagine if someone was doing that with africa or even just calling ukraine russia their sjws would be allll over that omg i want to watch someone just say africa now i feel like their reactions would be hilarious hahaha not that any of them could name locate more than 5 african countries on a map i would be surprised if a significant portion of us feminists could accurately fill out a map of europe the white feminism thing cracks me right up too please go ahead and fight amongst all your female selves feminists keeps y all busy yelling and arguing with each other while the rest of us are leading fruitful more pleasant lives now that we do not have to hear from you hahahaha yes this 100 their infighting really does reveal the flaws of the ideology and pushes more people away from the far left it just sucks that the quality of beauty communities has to suffer in the process makes me extremely thankful for this sub i actually have more than a few friends who decided to lurk here after that mess of a thread letting their ridiculous behavior run rampant has grown our community here at least it a silver lining for sure and omg tell them to participate ,4,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,one of the best things about america and the internet as well is how you have access to so many opportunities to engage with elements and people of different cultures sjws seem to want to keep each group in a separate box and that so sad because there so much to appreciate and benefit from outside of our bubbles building off of your example the dia de los muertos aesthetic is so cool and i just cannot wrap my head around how someone could think it was immoral for you to enjoy those things as a non mexican ,6,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,you are asking the right questions the far left is alienating more people every day with their strict rules and hypocrisy i am so glad to have a space like this where no one gives a flying pug abound your ethnic backgrounds sheesh hahaha so glad you are here with us ,6,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i am curious as to how you would want to achieve the ideals of inclusion high standard of living etc through government intervention or some other means it so interesting that you agree with the constrained view but also still agree with the core values of the new left although really i would argue that their stated values are not their actual values i definitely want to promote the prosperity of americans but i cannot say that i agree with the left on what that looks like or how to achieve it in social justice deviations from their principles are not considered opportunities to explore the ideas of your opposition they are considered attacks that need to eliminated at all costs this is such an important distinction that really harms those legitimately interested in finding the best way to help others humans will always be flawed and this is going to be the most controversial thing i have said on the internet i am not racist sexist and i think you have the right to think or be racist or sexist you cannot force respect it is so sad that this is a controversial statement now unfortunately anything outside a tiny window is now considered bigoted do i think racism sexism should be acceptable in our legal processes absolutely not i used to cite many statistics and studies without reading the actual studies and how they were conducted and was convinced that systemic oppression was rampant in this country then i took a closer look at how certain organizations arrived at those numbers and things began to fall apart it always good to challenge our beliefs and do first hand research instead of just believing what we hear i think there is systemic oppression but not in the way that leftists argue one example would be the treatment of poor blacks the welfare program hollywood music industry and prison system all contribute to a terrible culture that really reduces their chances of advancing and succeeding through legitimate paths another example is the way the irs is used to target conservatives who are a threat to the establishment i am with you not a fan of too much centralized power but i am so glad the tide seems to be turning after this most recent election i want american culture restored on a lighter note as a hispanic who likes mayo and is really sensitive to spicy stuff i ai not got no room to make fun of white people food hahaha ,4,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325, you can see online as a weird lense into how people think act behave and know that real life things do cross into every aspect these days it a sign of the times and there no going back if i flicked my cigarette bud on the ground i fully expect for someone irl to shame me whether or not i was aware of the litter problem no argument from me here people can be rude but just skim past those posts and move on no need to over think it i feel like you are misinterpreting my mood and intentions when making this post seeing the type of interactions that i mentioned in the op is off putting to those who do not agree with the intersectional feminist stance on the subject multiple beauty communities are pushing women away and labeling differences of thought as hatred racism oppression etc even women who are on the same team are not safe from this my post is using the once incident to show the bigger picture i wanted to discuss something that bothered me with a group of women who would get it and note that when i say bothered i do not mean that i am personally hurt or offended by anything this is about ideology and culture some things though do need to be brought up some people live in isolation with other people just like themselves here in an open online forum there many people from all over where a better place to learn then here sorry i am not sure how that ties into anything white women who asked how they can learn what to say vs not say were yelled at the main line of thought presented was that minorities are not obligated to teach their oppressors how to not oppress the internet is so great because of the way ideas can be exchanged but when subreddits that are supposed to be about a non political subject infuse all sorts of politics into everyday conversations it only natural that those who are mistreated for expressing disagreement alternative thoughts create their own communities which again is why i am very grateful for this subreddit sometimes i just want to talk about makeup or fashion and that it and if i want to talk about something political ideological i would rather not get tons of downvotes insults pms etc hope that all makes sense ,6,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325,my post is specifically about how real world issues are affecting online spaces that are not supposed to be about those real world issues the whole point is that while women are invited to post any thought that pops into their heads those who express certain ideas are then downvoted argued with insulted and even have their posts removed i can take issue with this and i can also take issue with the ideas and word choice used by women on the other side of the aisle irl if someone said something they did not know was racist i would ask them what do you mean with a smile i would draw them into discussion and have a worthwhile conversation on the internet people do not do that you might do that and that is fine not everyone would but fortunately i do not live in an area where i have to interact with those types of people and i pretty much always patiently engage with whoever comments to me regardless of our differences that not relevant though i can state how i feel about what i observe regardless of whether the incident in question is online or offline do not take the internet for real life the people who submit content to reddit are real people who believe what they say their words have an effect on those reading they do not exist in a vacuum if you read the thread there are women who are legitimately distressed the women championing for intersectional feminism certainly do not think that their actions exist outside of real life 2016 and 2017 have shown exactly how much of an impact interactions on the internet can have on the physical world i do not think you can draw such a harsh line to divide the two anymore ,6,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,yay glad you like it i agree with the constrained tragic vision of humanity 100 and i love how he puts to words things that i felt and believed but did not think to unify in that way now that your affiliations have changed do you find that you agree more with the constrained side as well all atrocities committed by civilizations of races cultures other than white people are normally not up for discussion that would be racist the fact that this happens really makes it clear how leftism is more about being anti white and anti western civilization instead of equality brotherhood and other liberal values they proclaim this is just me venting now but what is up with the white people have no culture meme i swear to god i have seen people who unironically say this all the time then plaster my facebook feed with pics of them backpacking all over europe on their oppressed parent dime hahaha right this is a real problem though and i hope that people start arguing against this terrible line of thinking the idea that white people are neutral nothing really bothers me we see it in terms like people of color everyone has a color or when minority groups are referred to as ethnic eg the black hair section of the beauty aisle is labeled the ethnic section everyone has an ethnicity you cannot have more or less of an ethnicity haha guess i needed to vent along with you ,10,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,yes thank you for saying this like you i am fine with women or anyone making a designated space to discuss x subject from y position rpw and fnf are communities of like minded women and i do not hate the overtly feminist subs for enforcing certain rules about comments on a lot of the beauty subs they claim to value diversity and they ask for everyone opinions but it just as you said they are not actually interested in diversity of thought it sad to see them turn on each other though there were white women who wanted to be an ally but they were treated like the enemy also love that you quoted thomas sowell this chart is a handy summary of the difference between constrained vs unconstrained worldviews http www nku edu gartigw teaching files weaver 20ch 2012 20handout 20 20constrained 20versus 20unconstrained 20visions pdf i like to share it when arguing with leftists so glad that your parents safely escaped from that situation 3,11,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325,i am glad i am not alone here i still have hair bows that i am keeping purely for sentimental reasons lol,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,hahaha how did that even become a trend what were we thinking ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,you are welcome ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i would definitely question your answers then because it is impossible to be a tr without any a answers maybe what you put down as c is actually a and you are just being hesitant not seeing yourself properly alternatively you could just be a romantic it not like marilyn monroe was huge or anything and i could see her having some cs in her results if she were to take the kibbe test herself ,1,RedPillWives
camille11325, so a lesson to you gals from me your body is always communicating with you to tell you what it wants you just have to learn to interpret its messages so so true thanks so much for sharing this update and congrats on figuring out your skin needs i am actually transitioning into having a skincare wardrobe instead of 1 standard routine because i find that my skin really does need different things on different days weeks i have seen great results so far ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,lol yes keep it in mind and do not stress yourself out have you considered group fitness classes like zumba you would burn calories and also slowly build muscle but it wo not be so extreme and you can feel like you accomplished a workout and do not have to think about it until the next class as long as you eat a pretty normal diet you would maintain a figure that any guy would enjoy looking at ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,haha omg three pigtails i bet it still looked cute i inexplicably wore side ponytails like in the 80s for at least a week in 8th grade luckily no pictures were taken i definitely think we will cringe at over contouring i am hoping we also cringe at the super pale nude lip smokey eye combo that was cool in the late 2000s and early 2010s ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i was born in 94 and i totally did all the 2000s trends wearing dresses over jeans so so stupid trying so hard to be boho even though it did not work with my coloring or body type or personality after 500 days of summer came out i dressed like zooey deschannel lots of light blue and whimsical looks started listening to the smiths haha this is 2010s but in college i followed all the southern prep trends that appealed to me at the time i either wore greek life related clothing or stereotypical outfits like lilly dresses or a denim jacket white lace dress j crew necklace cowboy boots i showed u bellascarletta a pic of me in this get up and we had a good laugh about how everyone was dressing like this at one point back to the 2000s i definitely remember wearing a north face denim mini skirt and uggs all at once throughout that trend time while i was in middle school nothing super bad when i look back on it i have always been into fashion and had a strong sense of style i just loved a good trend ,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,well if you have a lot of cs and no as you are more likely to be a soft classic http seasonalcolor yuku com topic 1980 kibbes soft classic trs require sharp yang in addition to the extreme yin while photos can help i would not use them as a primary method of self typing they are an excellent way to confirm a result though what do you think of scs ,1,RedPillWives
camille11325,yeah a lot of the models today lack the softness that is so appealing to men being fit is great for tons of reasons but people take it way too far with distinct visible muscles in their arms abs and legs most naturally thin women today have their weigh concentrated in their stomachs and arms it seems i feel like once you have functional strength and the sculpted but soft look stop there and just maintain and enjoy life ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,well you know yourself the best your answers make you a romantic http seasonalcolor yuku com topic 1990 kibbes romantic but if that does not fit you will probably want to look into soft classic http seasonalcolor yuku com topic 1980 kibbes soft classic i have another post coming on kibbe fashion soon we are moving right now and i am responsible for 95 of the cleaning and packing so i have been busy ,2,RedPillWives
camille11325,before i got their products they seemed really cool and i looked up reviews and tried to really understand what they were about they seemed awesome and i was so excited about trying something out i purchased the 2 alpha arbutin and ha serum which was maybe 8 it was not a waste of money since it was so cheap but it definitely did not blow me away now i see more mixed and even negative reviews out there and i feel like the initial praise was all hype and paid advertisements i have always been a big believer in investing in skincare especially when it comes to treatments having single ingredient purpose products is a great idea in theory but i do not think the ordinary has formulations that can compete with other brands a lot of asian skincare brands have a similar approach but their formulas are better for some reason i have not investigated the specifics i will say that m does use the caffeine eye serum for depuffing and that works but it caffeine so of course it effective i think anyone on a budget should look to asian brands and also save money for high performance western skincare ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,so glad you enjoyed it ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,lol it takes tons of makeup and styling for me to look normal as a theatrical romantic and bright winter on my own i am fine but due to my features and being high contrast i can never just have a no makeup makeup day a full face intentional outfit and styled hair are the bare minimum otherwise i look off i have seen so many trs vent about this exact thing in forums if i find any interesting convos about your predicament i will send it your way ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,omg i had no idea that she did that on election day that is so annoying why throw away money like that thanks for letting me know i do not use the product all the time but it is handy when i want an all in one especially post chemical peel ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,hahaha agreed the pin up images are pretty much always an improvement ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,now that you mention it i feel the same way btw found two blog posts that talk about some of the issues i faced when trying to type you the woman is an fg who was torn between sg sn and finally realised that she was in fact an fg http stylesyntax com blog 2014 11 28 the two types of flamboyant gamine http stylesyntax com blog 2015 06 24 why im not a curvy fg http stylesyntax com blog 2015 02 23 why im not a soft natural taking all three together makes it clear why we had some issues in this area i am going to include her ideas about the specific kibbe language in the next post because it something i picked up on intuitively but did not realise that others would not get hope this helps is interesting ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325, have you read this post on kibbe https www reddit com r femininenotfeminist comments 64g5nk guide an introduction to kibbe finding your type could help you figure out ways to express your femininity in a way that is both age appropriate and suitable to your personality ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,ooh yay definitely give a review during our next product reviews megathrea ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,yes these women look so healthy and happy slim and attractive but not starved or uncomfortable i actually think women feet are bigger today just like their frames overall every time i see these sorts of pictures i imagine guys saying stuff around the lines of this is what we are fighting for boys but i guess it now what we are fighting for in a completely different way oooh yes so profound ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,this is a really good point i agree completely and love that you drew the connection ,1,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325,they also last forever ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325, i think it would be so much fun to create an album of different people fun fact there a system for men too and have everyone try to type the people in the album then you could post the answers at the end of the week that would be so fun definitely will keep this in mind once the series is finished i am not really good at typing people but i am picking a few things up one thing that i think helps is to simply try and identify different shapes that appear on a face and try to figure out the proportions of each trait as well as how they compare to each other this definitely makes typing faster gamines feel pointy diamonds triangles naturals are square classics are oval and statuesque dramatics are lines and rectangles romantics are circles and hourglasses and hearts glad you liked the post ,3,RedPillWives
camille11325,it definitely depends on the features you choose as well not just the final tally if you are comfortable with soft classic it probably the right fit look out for part two coming soon ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,are you overweight by any chance our faces tend to match our bodies but women who are overweight will test more yin than they actually are if you are at a healthy weight i would ask about your exact measurements ethnicity height how often you work out and other factors it odd that someone who seems like a romantic mostly es and one d would not have any es and few ds in their face are you sure that the letters are accurate both for face and body ,2,RedPillWives
camille11325,there no such thing as a mini romantic haha you are going to fall into one of the categories if you are a romantic then you are a romantic no need to qualify it lucy liu is not a mini dramatic even though she is 5 2 is it possible that you are a theatrical romantic ,1,RedPillWives
camille11325,i feel like you chose so many cs because that the safe answer will have to think about it some more and get back to you right off the bat i know you have more yin than you are allowing for so you may just be a classic and not a dramatic classic but i feel like since you are a bright clear winter you are going to have more contrast than classic allows for just thinking out loud not trying to confuse you will get back to you for sure ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,yay so glad you figured out your type i will be posting more related to kibbe on fnf for sure possibly on rpw if there is interest but i do have to get back to posting rpw things to the sub i have been busy with the move and my health as i mentioned in my last fr a lot of classics echo what you are saying about not feeling stunning and luckily there are solutions ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i would not say you are too old for girly things just too old to wear frilly socks in public haha why not wear lace on other clothing items ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,omg baby oil and aquaphor are not going to hydrate you at all you need a product that is hydrating emollient and occlusive what you are using is just occlusive but there nothing to lock in stratia liquid gold https www stratiaskin com products liquid gold is the only thing i would endorse 100 under 30 good ingredients effective formulation targets all of your skin barrier needs if you need additional hydration there are essences and serums that provide just that plus extra benefits if you need something to seal everything in there are a ton of sleeping masks on the market as well but try a real moisturizer first so that you know what you skin truly needs ,5,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325,yes i do have a heart shaped face that style does look pretty i may give it a try thanks speaking of super high ponytails i found this pretty accurate http badspot us img ponytailtheory gif haha retarded looks the best on me but i can also pull off below average ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,looks like i am the odd one out but the socks you are talking about seem both too old and too young at the same time i think your concerns about looking weird at your age are valid and i cannot imagine situations where they would be appropriate socks are not expensive i am not sure why you cannot upgrade to a sleeker style there are other ways to add girly touches to your look that still fit in with the times if that something you are interested in ,5,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i agree it looks dated and odd you are getting downvotes due to your tone i guess but criticism and disagreement are allowed on this sub she asked for our opinions and this is not a place where we just say you do you and pat people on the back regardless of their choices ,7,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325,my hope is that everyone here can find their kibbe type and use the information to look and feel their best i waited until free friday to post but this is not completely irrelevant to rpw being attractive is incredibly important to maintaining or obtaining a great relationship additionally there is a lot to discuss in terms of female nature and the relationship between different physical features and personality traits certain archetypes and stereotypes definitely correspond with specific looks a while ago i wrote a post about the characteristics of feminine beauty and never posted a sequel about makeup that is because my project kept growing and growing and then i stumbled upon kibbe which complemented my ideas but also added further layers of complication i will definitely get into the fashion and beauty side of kibbe in the future with this post i really wanted everyone to get oriented to the system itself i shared this on r femininenotfeminist earlier in the week there are a lot of great exchanges in the comment section https www reddit com r femininenotfeminist comments 64g5nk guide an introduction to kibbe so definitely take a look ,1,RedPillWives

camille11325,this write up is phenomenal i don t think i ve ever read a more in depth analysis of the disney princesses and this is only part 1 so excited for future posts within this series or the sequel if there s just one more left the part i found most interesting is just how well each princess conforms to the ideal woman of the time period the film was released in it s when you not something i ever picked up on but your photo and video audio comparisons make it abundantly clear that this was an intentional choice by disney it s actually brilliant how well they married the aesthetic of the fictional setting with contemporary trends i especially enjoyed hearing the similarities between snow white and the real life singer the vibrato in both of their voices is a treat to listen to thank you for sharing that what i noticed when comparing the realistic drawings to the animation stills is that none of the princesses have pronounced noses when the artist s added noses it really changed the faces often making the women seem more mature since larger noses more yang i think belle and jane had the best nose illustrations out of everyone but in the films those two had more visible noses than say snow white with this post you ve essentially proven without a doubt that the disney women are not all carbon copies with no personality i really hate that complaint and feel like the women repeating this myth are just lumping all attractive women into the same box as much as these types of women claim to love diversity they fail to notice the very real differences between each character one thing that does make the women seem similar is the fact that they all have very feminine features and ratios regardless of kibbe type i don t think this is a bad thing at all why should anyone be upset about having a visually pleasing main character romantic lead the animation artists did such a great job translating each woman s personality into her appearance movements and expressions i really appreciate that you took the time to collect all of the gifs and images the comparison between ariel s hair and pocahontas was a great way of highlighting the attention to detail that went into the design of every princes i agree with you that the hair is almost like it s own character i m really honoured that you included the kibbe categories from our discussion on the subject earlier your point at the end about how the ability to type them means that these women aren t too far off from real women is eye opening i also feel like it underscores that kibbe identified underlying patterns that are universal across women certain features just go together and create a specific look this entire post was really fun to read through and now i want to watch some disney films haha thank you so so much for sharing this with the community 3 ,3,RedPillWives

camille11325,yay you took the test i totally see the b influence i feel like if dc ends up not working you could be in the natural family since b blunt broad yang a lot of women end up choosing c or d because it hard to tell traits apart and those two feel safer easier more inclusive this collage has women who are dc https s media cache ak0 pinimg com 736x fe dc f8 fedcf8c2bce1260eb29b5813cbf64bd0 jpg personally i think they are a bit more angular than you but i only have the 1 photo to go by so please do not let me change your mind if you are really happy in dc there are at least 4 women that look similar enough to you so perhaps the angularity of the more recognizable dcs should not be our main metric here are some naturals http getthelook pl wp content uploads 2015 03 natural twarze1 jpg i think these women have similar ratios to you what do you think ,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,glad to hear it there are stereotype free links and tips in future posts so keep an eye out for that later this week and next week ,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,it depends on the exact features not just the final tally i wish the person who made the quiz stressed that part haha it would not be surprising if you were a soft classic look at how many cs you have are you sure all of your ds are accurate i decided to do an additional post before i do the fashion one to further help women identify their specific type so keep an eye out for that later this week of course if you have more questions in the mean time you can definitely ask ,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,thank you and i agree the right outfit really does wonders for your appearance ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325, not sure if you saw this post but it will help you with body typing https www reddit com r femininenotfeminist comments 64g5nk guide an introduction to kibbe ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,are those answers in order and both from the body and face quiz i have been getting pms with photos so if you are up for it i would take the test for you and tell you what i thought for each answer based on your tally alone you could be a soft classic but if you were choosing c because you were not sure then it may not be accurate i am getting curious as to how this can dictate styling do i make myself look like what i am make my favorite features look like what they are and try to make my less favorite features look the way i would prefer have you read this post yet https www reddit com r femininenotfeminist comments 5saqva how to choose the right type of clothing based on kibbe basically groups people with the same features and builds and then the suggestions are about highlighting the assets and avoiding unflattering outfits the suggestions that kibbe gives are in line with the post i wrote but he has great insights for each family that go beyond my post since that one has an individual focus essentially your wardrobe hair and makeup choices need to harmonize with your features so if you are very yin and low contrast your clothing should be yin and low contrast if you are high contrast mostly yang then your clothing needs to be the same in the next post i will talk about yin vs yang and contrast vs blended when it comes to your wardrobe choices everything from necklines to patterns can be assessed in terms of those factors ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,love every single one of these suggestions i really cannot stress enough how important it is to write down your answers it definitely matters which features are more yin vs yang not just the total amount of yin or yang in your entire body so glad you enjoyed the post thank you for commenting 3,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,when you pmed me about being an sg i immediately rejected it because i 100 remember seeing yang within your face and sgs have more delicate features this is why i thought sn it mixes blunt yang with yin but then as i was rereading my post last night i looked at tina turner and liza minelli and i feel like you fit in with those gals better than the sns fgs have yang and yin of course since gamine is all about combining opposites it also works very nicely with you being dyt type 4 so did sn for the record and i think your secondary is probably 3 but it could be 1 definitely something more high energy to go with your gamine status there will be a dyt kibbe post eventually i am going to write about this in the next post but there are 3 aspects of kibbe types the most important is the actual body type which is determined based on the ratio of yin to yang and contrast vs blended i wrote in this post https www reddit com r femininenotfeminist comments 5saqva how to choose the right type of clothing based on about how to identify the nature of your features and dress them kibbe basically takes the traits i discussed and puts women in different boxes based on similarities i feel like 80 of women in any given type are going to align with the persona that goes along with it and then 80 of those women are going to align with the style that kibbe describes even though the majority of women will fall in line completely with kibbe descriptions in every way the only requirement to be a certain type is having the right features ratios and proportions an entire community has developed around kibbe and women have been expanding on his ideas and some new systems have even been invented trying to change improve kibbe this coupled with the fact that a lot of info online about kibbe is very dated eg lookbooks from the mid 2000s makes it harder to parse out what is mandatory real official vs what is personal opinion vs what is completely wrong like i said before you can have any style regardless of your kibbe type audrey hepburn and tina turner are both fgs because they are different people they are going to gravitate towards different looks there are a lot of factors other than kibbe type that contribute to what looks good on someone and i feel like there is some female solipsism at work in the wardrobe community that prevents women from seeing the variety and diversity within each type it also just easier to stick to stereotypes and shorthand naturals are not all hippies but if you look at some sites it totally looks that way just like how sgs can seem like overgrown children haha i hope this helps but if i can clarify anything else please let me know ,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,even celebrities who look really similar are not in the same kibbe type and it hard to pin down some modern celebrities because there are tons of factors that go into why their wear a certain look they are never purely seeking to flatter their natural features kibbe has not officially said anything about either women that you mentioned but the consensus from my brief online search is that emma watson is in the gamine family and natalie portman is either a classic or a dramatic classic like i said in my earlier post you may in fact be a classic it all depends on which features you picked for a and e it not only about the final tally at the moment i cannot think of a similar modern celebrity who is a classic other than kate middleton but maybe that helps you make sure you took the test accurately use a mirror sometimes our mental image is off a bit ,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,thank you so i kind of remember what you look like and you absolutely struck me as part of the natural family you cannot be halfway between gamine and natural that does not make sense what do you mean your style is more gamine the necklines lengths construction patterns etc or do you mean the stereotypical gamine style which is not tied to the kibbe type also i thought you were dyt type 4 id be very surprised if you were one of the gamines and type 4 what was your secondary dyt type i am looking through this blog post now but right off the bat my first impression is that this idea is retarded i hate when people over complicate and add on to the kibbe system i will have a longer response once i finish and dissect the post it may even be it own post actually since i wrote another comment about a specific add on to the 12 types ingenue edit anyone reading this is in a joking tone do not be offended if you liked the blog post ,2,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325,what a great suggestion ,1,RedPillWives
camille11325,hahaha you are welcome and i am so glad you decided to stop lurking too ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,yep that right i cannot see you but depending on which features you picked for e you may just be a classic they have angular faces as well i am not trying to over complicate things for you just do not want you to feel frustrated if dc ends up not feeling 100 correct based on your comment alone you would bee a dramatic classic http seasonalcolor yuku com topic 1979 kibbes dramatic classic ,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,of course d,4,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325, it can even be fun to think introspectively ie does this look good because of my kibbe type or because it projects an image i would like to align myself with does my husband like it because it shows just the right amount of skin or because it complements my body structurally yes this is great i have concluded that no it has not at this point but seeing those photos lit a fire in me to stick to my diet like no other thinspiration post has ever before i have saved the photos in a particular folder and i think i will post them to the fridge so that i can consider my choices even more carefully when i am preparing and eating dinner haha that is awesome and a great idea best of luck with your weight loss 3 ,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i think it super cool too definitely let me know what type you are i need to learn more about naturals they are harder for me to pin down for some reason ,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,you are welcome ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i would bet money that you are a theatrical romantic i have thousands of resources for this type especially so keep an eye out for the next post ,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,you are definitely a gamine but do not forget the personal style aspect can be seperated from the kibbe type not all fgs borrow from the boys and sgs do not have to be really twee or vintage inspired as far as your edit goes you are a combination of opposites which is reflected in the a c and d responses assuming you answered accurately based on my memory of you it should be a d and e with some cs this is why i like for people to write things out they can see how their features relate to one another a is sharp yang b is blunt yang c is balanced d is like small petite yin and e is like lush yin you have both yin and yang in equal measure and you are high contrast which we know just by looking at you so that means you have both strong yin and strong yang features throughout not middle of the road features does that make sense p s trs do not have yang bodies they have slight yang bone structure but they are thoroughly yin and therefore in the romantic family it might sound like semantics but i do not want anyone to get confused and i cannot imagine why the person who typed up the test would be so general like that ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,looking forward to hearing your thoughts ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i was saving this idea for a future post but i really really hate the ingenue category as well as all the other corrections people have made to the original kibbe system first let me tell you that if you answered mostly d and e with some as then you are either a romantic or a theatrical romantic i encourage women to write down each answer so that they can really see how their features fall on the spectrum of yin yang contrast and blended you have mostly yin and lower contrast which is in the r family whether you are an r or a tr depends on which features you marked as a but everything that you shared about your style seems squarely in the tr camp there are a few reasons why i hate the ingenue type as a concept it ignores the variety and diversity that is present within each kibbe family audrey hepburn looks nothing like tina turner but the are both fgs some romantics are going to have fewer as than others some might even have bs or cs thrown in that doesn t mean they re in the wrong category it conflates personal style and body type to an unreasonable degree even though there are personas given with each kibbe type you can have any type of style no matter what you are michelle dockery is constantly mistyped as a dramatic classic because she has a more classic style scarlett johansson is a soft natural but her personal style is very sensual and so she gets mistyped as romantic drew barrymore is apparently a romantic but many would have pegged her for some type of natural ingenue seems to be used by people who want to be extremely girly in their style not realising that they can choose the colours and cuts that give this impression if they are sg tr or r it reinforces the misconception that tr is always super sexy and intense i m a tr myself and i get really annoyed looking around the wardrobe planning community and seeing things that are more theatrical and completely ignoring the romantic part you don t need a different kibbe type to have fitted skirts defined waists pencil skirts with ruffles bow details more delicate jewelry and slightly toned down sex appeal with slightly rounder cuter features this is literally part of the definition of tr again i was planning on going into fashion in a future post but here is a great resource http www seasonalcolor yuku com topic 1988 kibbes theatrical romantic i have a few more abstract points but i ll save them for the next post ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,yeah you definitely have to write down every answer so that you can see how your features relate to each other being petite should not throw you off too much you have to compare yourself to other women not to you at a larger weight if you look at yourself and look at other women how angular are you if your hands are narrow and dainty then that what they are but they are also small because i am small does not come into play you have small hands lol there are plenty of short women who do not seem short in photos ask around if you cannot assess that aspect of yourself objectively i am 5 5 but people always guess that i am a bit taller because i have long legs other women may perceive you as slightly taller than you are too best of luck and please update us ,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,that what the test is for i just put all the explanation before the test so that women do not just zero in on their type i am hoping that we can use the system throughout the sub but if everyone only knows about their kibbe category we cannot really have productive conversations if someone reads this entire posts they will be able to discuss each type a little bit and they can learn more about their specific type after they take the test let me know which category you get or if you need help after you score everything ,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i just found two more helpful charts this shows every kibbe type on a spectrum with a brief description http i1325 photobucket com albums u622 el amira kibbe yin yangscale zps75e7ea63 jpg this is a spectrum that has images http i1325 photobucket com albums u622 el amira kibbe 41a04380431043104380 zps56bb6061 jpg ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,so glad you enjoyed the post i do not think that working backwards is an effective way to type yourself for several reasons there is a lot of overlap when it comes to what each type can wear or not wear with seasonal colour analysis every colour is definitively in a specific palette this does not apply to kibbe the same shirt dress or necklace could be worn by different kibbe types and flatter them there are too many factors to definitively say that x neckline only works for y type it is easy even for an untrained person to tell which shades work for them when they are being draped have the colour next to their body in some way if a woman has no idea about fashion and tries on a dress but thinks she looks bad she is not likely to understand why it looks bad is it the length waistline construction materials texture sleeve length pattern size pattern definition pattern type neckline a combination etc it is harder for a lot of people to differentiate between personal preference and genuinely unflattering items if you hate tulip skirts you might think they are unflattering and rule out theatrical romantic the reverse applies as well you could be really into a specific style or clothing type and not realise that it looks unflattering but even if we assume that a woman is able to specifically identify the exact cuts that work and do not work for her with the proper terminology and everything is this same women unable to look at her body and accurately answer the questions on the quizzes i linked can she not determine if her eyes are large or small or the length of her arms the only time i think that using clothes works is if you are stuck between two similar types for example if you cannot figure out if you are dc or c trying on clothing for both can make it clear this works for different families too sd vs tr sn vs sc d vs fn etc my answer is not official or anything so i am curious to hear other opinions ,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i used to have oily skin and what really helped in terms of makeup application is applying the setting powder before the liquid foundation this is referred to as the wayne goss method so definitely look it up it works i just stopped because i do not have oily skin anymore turns out my condition was due to the products i was using and lifestyle not genetics ,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i am so late but this is a great post i hope it starts a trend of people reexamining rpw theory and exploring avenues we have not discussed much or at least not outside of rpw ,2,RedPillWives
camille11325,this is too cute lkf thanks for all you do for the sub 3 also note to all fnfers we can do birthday shoutouts if you want like each month we can celebrate the bdays of anyone who let us know ahead of time and do a mini spotlight on them a survey is coming soon where you guys can give feedback and ideas so i will be sure to include a question about this ,7,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,yeah absolutely fortunately m understood what was going on and did not think i was not genuine but the more intentional you are with how often you express gratitude and your method the more weight it will hold ,3,RedPillWives
camille11325,saw that i was tagged but i have not read anything on the thread other than this comment i am out and on my phone and have not had a chance to look at reddit today i created this sub reddit with the intention of it becoming a real community of women in pretty much every beauty sub on reddit there are posts where women mock or vent about other women so i do not think this is abnormal now i dont want that type of content to dominate or define the sub but fnf is still really young and not everything is perfect in order for a distinct culture to develop we need active users who consistently participate and contribute both content and comments it harder when only a few people are responsible for entertaining everyone else finding ways to encourage more participation is a top priority and i really hope that you are a part of that i always enjoy talking to you and seeing you around reddit definitely pm me if you want to discuss specifics 3,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,so glad to see this site being linked it such a great resource ,1,The_Donald
camille11325,what a fun question assuming that there are other people on this island with us and that there is electricity based on some ppl answers i would bring veet hair removal cream do not want to have to worry about body hair while stranded shea butter i would use it on my body lips face and hair to stay moisturised and soft a big tube tub of clay and or charcoal mask since i wo not have my full skincare routine i will need to detox regularly heavy duty full coverage cream to powder concealer i am picturing the kevin aucoin sensual skin enhancer but i have no idea if that one is cream to powder i want something that would set itself basically mascara chanel le volume is my hg but if i am going to be on an island i will indulge and take the chantecaille faux cils d this was really hard it would have been a challenge for me to choose only 5 haircare or 5 skincare or 5 makeup items ,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,pm modmail i want to know too ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,hahaha oh no the more i use it the more annoying the new navigation is i do not like all the steps it takes to get to subcategories for products i preferred having separate sections for makeup skincare tools etc that you could hover over and instantly go to the specific page you want i still am a fan of the direction the company is going in overall though ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,yay it one of my favs too definitely give that post a read if you have not already it a good one d,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,yes thank you ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,yes ditch contouring embrace blush i started adding more after reading about makeup for bright winters so you will probably see good results too ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,lol i never expect anyone to read them asap just bookmark and then get back to me when they have read it expect a pm sometime in the next week i always forget about things so give me time haha ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,oh i do not wear all of my makeup like those women just the blush and even that is placed slightly differently those photos were just the closest i could find while my blush is in that intensity my skintone is darker than theirs and my contrast is higher so it reads as more harmonious i just could not find any pictures of women with an intense amount of blush that were not in that colouring group it makes sense though those images are striking ,4,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,is not it cool when you can apply these sorts of systems to real life if you want the book class by paul fussel or distinction by pierre bourdieu let me know i can send them your way both are extremely well done resources on class differences and signals i also have a ton of class related blog posts essays articles etc bookmarked so if you are ever in need of something to read just message p s i have not read it but into mind has a series all about things like seams and construction that seemed like a good intro for beginners to the subject ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325, i am not into minimalist wardrobes or the minimalist style at all but this is all the rage on ffa on the makeup addiction sub everyone seems to love too faced but i cannot get past the gimmicky packaging on muacjd they seem to be obsessed with the idea that spending money on makeup is bad there are tons of posts about how people avoid giving into capitalistic urges and i just cannot relate at all it not even about the budget i disagree with the idea that anyone should feel bad for spending money they are anti consumerism to an extreme that i am just not on board with on beautyguruchatter replaced beautyguruchat they are really into the various collabs that brands do with youtubers but those releases have never interested me on the asian beauty sub they are way more into snails and sheetmasks than i have ever been i have tried tons of snail products and was not blown away and when it comes to sheet masks i stick to 3 specific ones i do not see the appeal in buying hundreds of random masks ,10,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,fun question apparently skinny jeans are not cool anymore i will literally never wear any other type of pant i have been wearing them for about 10 years now and cannot imagine any other cut i also really love bustier style tops these were in style one year but i have been wearing them for ages they just really flatter me and do not look hyper sexual if you pick the right material cut colour print etc finally i would say that the way i wear my blush is not in style at all but it what flatters me the best i will have to find images that show what i mean but i wear a lot of blush all over my cheeks and in a larger area than what is commonly advised today it looks great but if someone who had different features tried it they would look like a prostitute hahaha i have done informal tests on my own to see what people prefer on me and the way i do it now is the clear winner so it not going to change any time soon edit okay so obviously i exaggerate the severity of the blush but here are some pics that give an idea of what i mean i found all of these on pinterest but it was hard only look at the blush not the rest of the makeup example 1 https s media cache ak0 pinimg com 564x e4 8b eb e48bebd3cfd04387469048f5cdf69dea jpg example 2 https s media cache ak0 pinimg com 564x e8 27 28 e827288cefab44c0f3c2a0b821114712 jpg example 3 https s media cache ak0 pinimg com 564x 67 fd d2 67fdd2b9680e22e7f064e61d55243440 jpg of course none of these are exactly right especially 3 but hopefully the general idea makes sense ,5,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,my point about high profile muas fashion editors etc wasn t about skill vs no skill which is their claim i was speaking to the larger power struggle that is happening so many women are seeing their influence diminish as the instagram and youtube stars take over they retaliate by pointing out the lack of knowledge and talent but this is their method of trying to gain back status they want audiences to judge beauty gurus through a lens that will make the old guard appear superior i see the criticisms against the baddie look as a similar way for them to assert their status if they strongly oppose the look it signals that they have taste and know their craft it also gives them a stake in controlling the narrative i think the cultural appropriation claim is a specific way to shame and assert dominance over the competition how does anyone who buys into leftist morality defend against that now i don t believe that every single woman or man is intentionally carrying out schemes just that their subconscious urges and jealousies are contributing to their actions ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,are the women being marketed to actually in hard economic times i think it makes sense for companies to promote these trends it takes way more products to look like a baddie than it does to look subtly enhanced please correct me if i am wrong but this trend seems to be aimed at 15 25 year old middle class and upper middle class women so their budgets are a bit freer due to not having children and these are women who use social media and are more likely to go out to bars and clubs you definitely need to do your makeup differently when you are being photographed and a lot of the baddie techniques help with longevity as well there is a really strong hip hop influence in the clubs in major cities so it makes sense that this would carry over into the makeup looks all of this is just off the top of my head i think you posed a very interesting question to sum up my answer i do not think it unethical of companies to identify a need and fill it i do think they are creating a need as well and while i am not a fan of prole drift the market clearly is in support of these trends or was since as you pointed out it going out of style ,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i do not think that white women are intentionally setting out to copy the features of other ethnicities i think that they are using makeup and fashion to play up sexual characteristics that are more noticeable in other groups due to either biology or cultural differences as i said before all the features are indicators of sexual maturity and availability it s not about copying any other group specifically and really no one group owns large butts or plump lips there are so many different and unrelated types of women who can have these traits you can t lump western asian northern african and latina women together just because they aren t white the world isn t white vs everyone else also there are plenty of white women who have extremely feminine features both of the sexually mature and neotenous varieties this goes back to what i was saying about the way that the reality of white ethnic groups and cultures is either denied or demonized as you go down the socioeconomic ladder it becomes more acceptable to be overtly sexual with your appearance in a wider variety of locations upper middle class and up adult black and latina women do not have their bodies on display on a regular basis and they do not wear the makeup techniques that are popular on instagram these aesthetic codes are the result of class not ethnic background further evidence that it isn t about stealing definitive traits of minorities white women aren t giving themselves monolids or making their noses look wide and flat they aren t growing their hair down to their knees or rocking afros none of those things are about looking sexier and or cooler so they don t catch on i am not sure how i implied that these looks have to be restricted to certain women you re entire argument seemed to be that white women should not wear anything close to the baddie look because it was cultural appropriation this type of look is extremely flattering for women of some ethnicities and that is who it is meant for direct quote from your blog post i disagree with the idea that the look is extremely flattering on anyone or that it is meant for anyone i have zero problem with women of any background wearing their makeup like this they re just going to look low rent lol the point i was trying and apparently failing lmao to make is that i think it is disingenuous to the self to try to force yourself to look a certain way just because celebs do it or just because it on instagram when either you dislike it or it just does not work for you you can make this point without dragging race into the discussion though plenty of people within the beauty community make the claim that the trend is cultural appropriation and everyone agrees with those people but they are perpetuating a leftist myth just because enough people say it doesn t make it true people on the left love to make everything about race and oppression they also completely deny the biological differences between race and gender so i m not even sure that it would occur to them that dark lashes plump lips duskier skin sexually mature they also don t seem to remember all of the times throughout history where it was perfectly normal for white women to do things like contour have heavy eye makeup etc and it was never considered racially motivated it s also really taboo these days to mention class if it s about anything other than the oppression of the poor by the elite in all i really wanted to encourage some to step outside what is popular at the moment and embrace their own features i repeatedly see women looking well not so great due to them attempting to embrace this trend and it just not working this is a valid discussion to have but shaming people for cultural appropriation is a terrible way to go about it haha poor skill and lack of knowledge are absolutely issues that should be addressed although most women will have to take steps to look more feminine and it does involve making their lips look larger or altering their bone structure via creams and powders as far as what you said about women not thinking about things in biological terms nearly every youtube tutorial talks about how sexy the look is so it s clear that they implicitly understand the overall effect re glossier i have a love hate relationship with into the gloss but i absolutely cannot stand the makeup brand i agree with your criticism about their ingredients and brand philosophy and i think that the majority of the fans try way too hard to seem cool and effortless why do you feel most women are incapable of determining this do you believe that biological instinct has faded or that people ignore it i could write a whole book about this there are too many answers haha here are just a few off the top of my head there is less pressure to put effort into your appearance due to how casual things are today not just in terms of dress code but the way people interact the lifestyles women lead the more open and fluid sexual market place etc leftism has changed people s values subjectivity and emotions trump objectivity and reason beauty is considered either irrelevant oppressive or up to each individual s judgement the internet makes it easy to stay in your bubble and so if you aren t interested in fashion at all it is easy to avoid learning how to dress yourself attractively additionally the internet shortens the fashion cycle it s all about trends and staying current not about developing a unique and personal look the cocooning phase http akinokure blogspot com 2013 02 cocoonings web of mental dysfunction html that we are in now encourages attention seeking behaviour http akinokure blogspot com 2012 01 getting attention vs being popular html which prevents actual introspection and growth the erosion of the nuclear family and local community https www ribbonfarm com 2015 03 04 gardens need walls on boundaries ritual and beauty prevent tons of women from being guided by their parents and other adult role models these adult women aren t able to pass down their wisdom when it comes to beauty adult women are divorcing and or not getting married and or being cheating sluts and are on the market and not reinvesting into the female community as described earlier middle class women have more income free time and information at their disposal but they do not have the ability to synthesize and act on the beauty advice and information they absorb as effectively as they want to this is due to lack of confidence lack of practice and lack of existing examples for example i have a theory that tons of women on reddit are at a loss at how to dress professionally because they didn t grow up watching their mothers get ready for a business professional job environment or formal events technology removes a lot of the pressures that caused us to develop our biological traits and instincts so it makes sense that we d lose touch as we get further away from primal existence on the subject of insta baddie i think this is not a beauty standard but only a trend i think it s a beauty standard for proles and a trend for non proles i also think that women who were baddies prior to it being popular may feel that it s about race because they don t see the bigger picture they also would not be familiar with the term prole drift they don t like that something once mocked is now

camille11325,i am actually starting a blog soon that will mostly be about beauty class and the female social matrix both individually and all the ways they intersect because i have so much to say on these subjects prole drift is definitely one way that ideas customs and trends spread across society but you are right that lower classes emulating higher classes occurs too each level in the hierarchy has it own standards codes values worldviews etc so it not like everyone at the bottom is desperate to be exactly like those at the top often people borrow from other classes as a way signal to and gain status amongst their peers instead of trying to climb or descend the ladder it really interesting to look at how trends and styles change over time and which direction things move and why semi related have i shown you this paper https msbfile03 usc edu digitalmeasures jnunes intellcont brand 20prominence 201 12 10 1 pdf yet i know i introduced a lot of rpw to this one but i am unsure if you were part of that group it long so if you want a tldr let me know the main info is between pages 6 and 7 ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,thanks for commenting here what i wrote on another comment i have zero issue with heels being expected in professional environments i do not believe that companies are obligated to adhere to what is the healthiest it is not healthy to sit at a desk looking at a computer screen all day it not healthy to be inside for 8 hours at a time without sunlight it not healthy to get less than 5 hours of sleep each night employers are not responsible for the health of their employees to the extent that the anti heels argument assumes and i do not think things should change so that they should have that level of concern for those who work there the reality is that today as it has been for quite some time heels are considered professional wear for women in america everyone thinks so therefore women who want to appear professional must take this into account at the end of the day personal preferences and wishes do not matter when 98 of the working world thinks the opposite it just does not make sense for companies to change their policies and i do not think there is any ethical issue here and i do not think that women who do not want to wear heels have a compelling argument two inches is not that big of a deal and if they cannot handle that and their boss is unwilling to compromise well that sucks but life just is not fair no situation is going to be completely perfect for everyone all the time there are always sacrifices and tradeoffs i see this particular feminist argument as an inability to handle the real world ,0,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,thanks for such an in depth response i liked the glimpse into that dress code and i agree with the reasoning behind the requirements that being said i have zero issue with heels being expected in professional environments i do not believe that companies are obligated to adhere to what is the healthiest it is not healthy to sit at a desk looking at a computer screen all day it not healthy to be inside for 8 hours at a time without sunlight it not healthy to get less than 5 hours of sleep each night employers are not responsible for the health of their employees to the extent that the anti heels argument assumes and i do not think things should change so that they should have that level of concern for those who work there the reality is that today as it has been for quite some time heels are considered professional wear for women in america everyone thinks so therefore women who want to appear professional must take this into account at the end of the day personal preferences and wishes do not matter when 98 of the working world thinks the opposite it just does not make sense for companies to change their policies and i do not think there is any ethical issue here and i do not think that women who do not want to wear heels have a compelling argument two inches is not that big of a deal and if they cannot handle that and their boss is unwilling to compromise well that sucks but life just is not fair no situation is going to be completely perfect for everyone all the time there are always sacrifices and tradeoffs i see this particular feminist argument as an inability to handle the real world ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,thank you i am interested in hearing your thoughts on my comment as well there is not nearly enough honest conversation about class in the beauty community ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i agree with you that there are a ton of people within the beauty community who vilify those that wear the baddie look i just also disagree with a lot of their criticism even though i do not like the look either it difficult to have conversations about the subject when everyone is not on the same page and has their own biases and beliefs there are tons of instances of people within the makeup community voicing their dislike of the trendy instagram look however if you examine what they say and who they are you would see all the other factors at play there are so many conflicts wrapped into the discussion a big one is older generations vs younger generations what is trendy today is not understood by a lot of people over 35 and then there is the ongoing battle between professional makeup artists and women who are popular without any credentials i have seen a lot of really great concerns raised about the way youtube and instagram gurus are changing the beauty community in a way that disadvantages professional makeup artists proper theory techniques and methods are disregarded and personality is elevated over skill this is also connected to the generation battle because a lot of women are losing their place in the hierarchy since younger trendier women are more popular i will have to find it but there was this piece in vogue i think that was belitting fashion bloggers and instagram models and saying they do not compare to the contributors to real fashion magazines while i agree with that sentiment the insecurity of women who see their influence slipping cannot be ignored going back to cultural appropriation i think that making things about ethnicity complicates both the actual issue and our ideas about race in general the argument that so many make is that because black women wore the baddie look and now white women are wearing it white women are in the wrong and black women should be the only women wearing it because it is meant for them i see so many people are quick to tear down white women but it apparently not okay to say that you do not like this look at all or especially on black women minorities so we can say that white women look slutty trashy masculine ugly aggressive stupid ridiculous like trannies etc but if it a black woman all of a sudden she is fierce empowered expressing herself staying true to her culture etc any of the negative words used on white women are considered racist if applied to black women and if someone says what everyone is thinking that it looks ghetto everyone freaks out black women should not be above criticism anywhere but especially not in the beauty community all of these things go back to what i was saying in my other comment about class and prole drift the glossier look is an upper middle class and up look that is trickling down into the mc the baddie look is a prole look that has trickled up tagging u bellascarletta and u littleknownfacts to hear their thoughts too ,5,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,before i start i just want to let you know that you re one of my favourite contributors to the sub so please don t take my comment as anything other than a desire for in depth conversation also u littleknownfacts i d love to hear your thoughts on my comment too i ll start with the blog post first and then move on to your reddit post a lot of the baddie makeup trends you listed are in fact feminine they are just about enhancing sex appeal i wrote about this in my post characteristics of female beauty not currently on this sub b c i have to redo the albums but basically dark eye makeup duskier skin shaper bone structure long lashes heavy blush plump lips i am sexually mature and currently ovulating and ready for an alpha to fuck me hahaha and men absolutely want to sleep with these women in the right contexts some of these techniques have a masculinizing effect because as women mature they do in fact look more masculine but in order to look sexy you have to look mature from a biological standpoint so it s just not accurate to say that the current trends are completely unfeminine i do agree though that some women are unskilled and take it too far or they don t think about their own features and exaggerate their existing masculinized bone structure also there is a certain aggressiveness that can be felt coming from a lot of the women who use these techniques but i actually think that ties in to my next point i don t think the adoption of baddie makeup is an example of cultural appropriation but rather further evidence of prole drift the looks that you complained about are not limited to one specific ethnicity poorer women of all backgrounds have worn things like that for a while blacks hispanics italians other white groups depending on the location their look heightens everythign sexual about women at once this used to be considered vulgar now it is cool it is now trickling upward as so many trends and practices have over the decades and centuries really there is an illusion that this is a race thing because the people going all out on this trend are mostly middle class and up white women i actually want to write a whole post about prole drift in the beauty community because it really bothers me so i won t say too much right now but hopefully you see what i m driving at to speak briefly on what you re saying about cultural appropriation i just completely disagree with the idea that makeup looks have to be restricted to certain groups each individual component was not invented by or perfected by the proles who popularized the baddie look and there are plenty of white women who look objectively hot wearing that makeup now i personally am not a fan but i don t think the subject is as black and white as you re making it and i especially don t think there is a moral issue with white women or anyone adopting this look next i want to talk to you about glossier and a cool idea that i read on a different sub i don t have the link but this person differentiated between three types of makeup looks no makeup makeup as it is traditionally used refers to when your final result looks like you have as little makeup as possible even though it took you several steps to get to this point there is no restriction on the amount of products you can use to look like you re not wearing much in contrast glossier is all about looking great without makeup through skincare and then adding a few products to enhance your natural beauty they believe that less is more and then finally there are brands like milk makeup where the goal is to look like you spent as little time on your makeup as possible but it is different from glossier in that you can use bright and unorthodox colours it isn t about natural beauty at all just looking effortless i agree with these distinctions and i think it s important to separate glossier from no makeup makeup because the philosophies are very different i d also like to challenge the idea that both no makeup makeup and the glossiser look are flattering to everyone they are certainly not flattering for me i have a different posts coming soon about that so i ll keep this comment from going on forever haha i m almost done but i want to single out this phrase from your post on fnf it is not flattering unless you are ethnically diverse there is this awful idea ingrained in the west that white people don t have an ethnicity or culture phrases like this really highlight how whites are lumped together and cast aside as if they are neutral and or don t count there are white ethnicities just as there are black latino and asian ethnicities and there is diversity both between the white ethnicities and within them and finally beauty standards are not about our personal preferences they are external pressures and expectations that come both from biological instinct and the tastes of the men and women at any given time and location most people are incapable of determining what flatters them so i don t think that encouraging women to solely use her own judgement is the right course of action ,9,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,what are your thoughts on that dress code and why beauty matters i do not see anything wrong with a company regulating any of those things they are all directly related to professionalism ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,edit i see someone else gave the answer before i replied anyways thanks for reading and commenting what are your thoughts on the april issue of glamour as described by the article ,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,have you seen the new sephora site design i was thinking about starting a discussion here since i saw other subs talking about it personally i like it but it been controversial ,1,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325, no one has ownership over a matte black eyeshadow for example or plain black flats or a black cardigan but as soon as my plain black pumps have a red sole on them i am sending a message that either i purchased shoes worth a couple hundred bucks or that i buy knockoffs well put ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,exactly so glad you get it i feel like people should either save their money and buy the real thing or get something that suits their needs within their budget nearly every possible type of makeup product exists for under 40 i seriously do not understand how these knock offs are appealing where is the pleasure coming from at least with a fake lv bag you can gain status by tricking people the mur palette would not have the same effect so why even bother ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i absolutely love department stores niche online beauty shops and sephora at all three you have a more personal experience and the settings are clean organized and visually appealing i really like to take my time and look at packaging read boxes and browse without pressure i do so much research online but nothing beats the in person experience for example i spent tons of time reading up on this caudalie moisturizer and i was so pumped to buy it i went into sephora and the container was so tiny not one photo or video made it look as small as it really was for anyone who is into clean beauty my go to online shops are integrity botanicals cap beauty and the detox market pharmica also has a ton of stuff but their selection is more like the drugstore and midrange equivalent thankfully both sephora and spacenk are expanding their clean beauty offerings ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i have read so many discussions on the issue across reddit beauty community and it really disappointing to see women dismiss kat von d point i think it terrible that companies like mur steal the designs of existing brands these knock off products are not harmless not only do they diminish the hard work that went in to creating the original they reinforce a sense of entitlement within the makeup community if you cannot afford a palette then you cannot afford it you are not owed a product just because you want it there is a huge difference between products that have similar color and formulas the normal use of dupe and products that are created to look and feel exactly like a more expensive product it is really gross to me that the latter happens and yes i am 100 against knock off fashion as well it is just so tacky to use a cheap imitation ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325, not a huge fan of the multicoloured bright urban decay type packaging it feels far too busy and got too much going on for makeup i am using everyday i want to feel comfortable and not be subjected to something that too buzzy first thing in the morning idk colourful packaging is just too jarring to me same and this is a really good point the way a product looks affects you as you use it ud and similar brands just too much haha ,2,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325,your four uniforms reminded me of this post about proportions https anuschkarees com blog 2013 08 25 proportions catalogue it great that you have identified the combinations that best suit your body and lifestyle if you have not already check out the whole site she is very minimalist both in her approach and sense of style i appreciate how thoughtful and organized she is and have totally stolen her methods for myself even though i am not a minimalist at all do you wear sweaters or jackets at all the weather here is super hot as well but i find that buildings are freezing if they have the ac on ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,its so cool hearing about your transformation over the years i can totally imagine you in steam punk costumes haha do you think you will incorporate more flamboyant clothes into your capsules the asian beauty sub is so awesome and informative you are going to have so much fun reading and researching personally i like to mix western and eastern products and philosophies as i develop my routine i think the only asian products i will use are an fte essence sleeping mask and sheet mask these all fill a niche not covered well by western brands although there are a few really cool essences on the market now worth looking into for sure thanks for sharing your thoughts ,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,my approaches to skincare and wardrobe organization have reversed i used to like mixing and matching clothes and trying out different looks and styles on a whim in contrast i wanted one set routine for my face that i adhered to strictly now i am totally the opposite i want a signature look and i want to be able to pick and choose products based on how my skin feels that day personally i define signature look as a separate from the concept of a personal uniform not everyone does this so i will explain how i see it to me a personal uniform involves wearing roughly the same items every day your colors items silhouettes etc will be almost identical daily tons of women prefer this because they do not have to think about what to wear they know it will be a white top and black pants or a skirt suit or whatever other combination they like sticking to personal uniforms seem very utilitarian and dependent on accessories to mix things up on the other hand signature looks are all about leaving a consistent impression to me i plan on staying within the boundaries of my style guide which means the same silhouette and color scheme always but the individual outfits and combinations will change it one step more limiting than having a defined style there will definitely be less room for experimentation for example even if i come across a jumpsuit that i like and it checks all the boxes for my personal style i would not wear it because it does not match my signature look i could look fabulous in it but attractiveness is not the only factor here i want people to have a specific image of me in their head even if i do not literally look like that all the time when it comes to my skin i think i have changed positions because i have solved most of my immediate problems in a month i will be able to just focus on maintaining great skin in the present and anti aging this means i can have more fun and flexibility since there wo not be hard goals anymore i would love to hear how you approach wardrobe planning or your skincare routine that could even be a whole thread what are your thoughts on defined styles vs signature looks vs personal uniforms ,7,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,great question i hope people share some good info i am interested as well when i go grocery shopping today whole foods and also heb i will take a look at the brands there and do some research for us ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,there is so much wrong with your comments i do not even know where to begin you clearly have not read a single rule or wiki page because if you had you would know that this is a community for likeminded women not a debate sub you would also know that we do not tolerate disrespect shown towards moderators u phantomdream09 was clear about why she included something by chomsky there is nothing ironic about using a relevant source to provide further information on a subject how arrogant of you to attempt to correct her for a perfectly valid choice you have zero clue about her level of knowledge regarding political ideologies and yet you lecture her as if she is retarded how on earth is that an appropriate response yeah i read all your post but i just find it pretty funny when people earnestly quote people who would be completely against all of their ideas i just feel like it shows a certain lack of self awareness i do not think you know what earnestly means because it does not apply at all to this situation you also might want to look up the definition of self awareness because it definitely applies to instances where a person accurately explains what they are doing and why based on these comments alone you have a very shallow understanding of political ideology especially as related to america the fact that you chose to mock and condescend instead of ask followup questions reveals a lot about your character did it cross your mind that you could be wrong did you even consider that your opinion might not even be wanted as if an established member of our community needs your special insight into politics you are already banned and i know she does not feel the need to justify herself to someone like you but i am in a ranty mood atm so here i am informing you that your assumptions were wrong and make you look stupid idk if you have terrible social skills or it just the fact that you are foreign or both but you should really work on not sounding like a tryhard teenager that all from me happy st patrick day,3,RedPillWives

camille11325,older videos like this are so wonderful and classic films i loved how normal it was for her to make statements about women being lazy there were tons of great quotes but two that stood out the only time women are not on parade is when they are in front of their dressing table to be beautiful and natural is the birthright of every woman could you imagine if a beauty guru today spoke like this people freaked out when tati said that women who have chipped nail polish do not have their life together i did listen carefully and she says her lipstick ends up on the cheek of her son when she kisses him goodnight and goodmorning it funny that some makeup struggles are still with us today no idea what a stimulus cream is but it was cool that she shared techniques instead of pushing specific brands unless the whole video was sponsored by one brand and i missed it it was a lovely video and i am so glad you enjoyed it too ,5,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,this is awesome so great that you are sharing your thought process organization and capsule items with the community a lot of women will be able to learn from this and improve their own wardrobes having 4 seasonal capsules 1 capsule full of year round staples is a really inspired idea way easier than 1 or 2 capsules that somehow suit all situations do you feel like your clothes are more harmonious with you as a person now that you are following kibbe and sca guidelines i have found that the closer i stick to all of my types the more confident and attractive i feel i was going to post an in depth guide to kibbe but i keep adding to it so it will be up next tuesday hopefully more traffic then and i will have a lot of links for gamines i will also link to this post if you are okay with it to use as an example of how you can embrace your type there also another system i will be writing about in the future that is more about personality and demeanor and making sure your clothing is compatible with that it integrates really nicely with kibbe and sca so keep an eye out for it ,3,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325,i will look into it thank you ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,great comment all around i m going to quote only a few things to respond to otherwise i d have wayy to much haha thanks for sharing your thoughts but this accessibility of androgyny gender bent expression in a way makes this look book almost pedestrian and less high fashion excellent point i do believe this is the intention though normalising non heteronormativity even h m has androgynous clothing it isn t elite in the slightest but it does have some edge still due to how unnatural it is the taboo aspect makes it feel cooler than it really is and while i love rocking an accentuated waist red lipstick and done hair on most days there something about my blazer and brogues every now and then that although a masculine style somehow underscore how masculine i am not making me feel all the more feminine i remember borrowing from the boys being a trend not too long ago and it was about this very idea a woman wearing menswear menswear inspired clothing in a way that heightened her femininity i remember seeing some really cool photo shoots that played with this idea but you never got the vibe that they were promoting actual gender bending you know that sort of exploration is something i can get behind not personally but it certainly is visually interesting overall i am excited about it because it means options for everyone and that makes me feel good about the world i get to live in i think it great harmless exciting for artists and wonderful if it presents opportunity for practical innovation as a believer in free market capitalism i do support the right for everyone to purchase and wear what they please however these collections aren t just about clothes they are one more component of the larger agenda to blur gender lines destroy the nuclear family and many more things that spell disaster for the west u phantomdream09 made a post today that touches on some of these ideas i also speak about this more in other parts of this comment section if anything that title makes it easier for people on either side to decide if it was worth their time agreed i said this in a different comment but my issue with the title is how it falls in line with the general celebration of degeneracy that is common today art used to be praised for its beauty goodness technical skill perspective and all the other intangibles that make something legitimate for many today the most important standard is how evil it is so it s not just about morality in my case but the overall change in standards for judging art above a certain class level so glad you joined in the conversation ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,so glad you decided to post i actually just got my first thing from the ordinary in the mail today the alpha arbutin serum super excited to see results from it your reviews are very encouraging ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,pretty sure you didn t read my stickied comment which explained why i posted the article and the focus of the conversation as well as discussion questions i m also willing to bet that you didn t look at any other comments prior to posting because there are discussions about the larger implications of runway collections the blog post i shared used hyperbolic language to emphasize how terrible it is that so many designers are rejecting the concept of masculinity itself your literal interpretation of the post and hyperfocus on the one designer mentioned is causing you to dismiss a really serious issue u phantomdream09 submitted a very informative post earlier today that goes into more detail about the cultural impact of seemingly trivial things i m not convinced that you re seeing the bigger picture if you re dismissing these collections as just art and the viewers as pretenders many designers and thought leaders have explicitly stated their vision of turning gender on its head this isn t just an attempt to be different or make headlines i go into this more in all of my other comments so do take a look ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i am in love with this so glad that you ve collected a lot of examples that show the way that media can influence society on every level i agree with you that many don t seem to see how everything is connected what is fashionable today is not an accident let me answer your qs and then after you respond i ll share more thoughts so that this comment isn t too long obviously i m not a fan of the androgyny aspect of the collection but i dislike it from a non ideological standpoint as well i ve never been a fan of normcore or minimalism so the clothes do nothing for me i think the models are both attractive and i can see that they were trying to seem cool effortless modern tough etc but the clothes just seem like something lmcs would wear in the 90s this one is tough because there are so many to choose from something i wasn t old enough for but i m sure many people here remember women getting their hair styled like rachel on friends when i was in high school 500 days of summer came out love this film and everyone wanted to be a manic pixie dream girl who listened to the smiths haha sex and the city is one show that has had an enormous impact on women in terms of fashion dating friendships and self esteem makeup looks from runway shows always trickle down into the mainstream beauty community bold brows intense highlighter pale nude lips etc all were buzzed about after shows and in magazines before i saw them in real life or even on youtube yes i am very concerned about the war on gender not for myself or anyone in my immediate sphere but i worry about western civilisation as a whole we have been in decline for so long and blurring gender lines will only further set us back i completely agree with your points about how bad many are at dating today how are nuclear families going to form if people are too socially awkward or non conforming to actually have a proper date i don t believe that women will be satisfied with androgynous or feminized men regardless of what feminists claim what incentive would the men who can resist the media programming have to commit to women when his options are whores sjws fatties and the mentally ill celebrities might have money and influence but i don t think most have the cultural capital to justify them attending exclusive events centered around politics or the economy their opinions aren t newsworthy with a few exceptions and any statements that they make should be covered by specific media outlets like e espn tabloids lifestyle magazines and websites etc not actual broadcast news networks or respected papers i think bringing in politics into awards ceremonies is a bad idea but i ve never watched any so maybe everyone else enjoyed it i just feel like anyone who isn t inherently cool and interesting should shut up but the mediocre and lame seem to be really desperate for fame thank you so much for taking the time to write all of this up i really enjoyed reading it and can t wait to refer it to women on this sub in the future ,2,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325,different subcultures will have different norms and i do not think we can apply mainstream standards to those subcultures in the exact same way even though they may still come into play the first example i will use is your rockstar question within the niche of whatever genre the man is part of it may be perfectly normal if not required for him to wear nail polish if these men are wearing nail polish as an aesthetic choice seperate from gender then we have to take that into account i am not familiar with the reasoning behind why certain performers wear nail polish and i am on the phone so i cannot look it up easily while typing this response if the hypothetical rockstar is presenting exactly like all other men then within that subculture he is not androgynous assuming of course that they are not trying to be androgynous however women outside of the subculture are probably attracted due to other aspects of his appearance status and talent another example black men wearing cornrows is accepted within that culture whereas in the mainstream us culture men wearing braids is gay it is not androgynous at all for black men to have their hair braided so many decisions related to presentation have different significance in different groups within the us that being said someone could certainly be objectively androgynous or feminized regardless of their intentions or subculture they would have to pass a certain point on the spectrum of gender presentation via the combination of clothing hairstyle accessories etc i am imagining that the standard here would be based on biology this is just my personal opinion and i hope it makes sense i am off to bed now ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i definitely agree with you that this post didn t have enough context for those unfamiliar with the subject it s totally solipsistic on my part to have not considered this i read the post and liked with it because i saw how his argument fit in with my observations anyone who doesn t read magazines or keep up with the fashion world in general can t be expected to have the same response i really appreciate your thorough responses and the fact that you point out the areas you know less about conversations like this are part of what make reddit great to clarify yes i mean the realm of fashion there is definitely a lot to criticize about the modern fashion industry so it s not something i m holding against him i found his comments pretty funny so i do think our interpretations are the result of differing degrees of familiarity with that world since this post was a critique of something very specific i don t think that it s necessary for the author to show the other side or mention the positive things about runway shows or magazines it would only detract from the main point imagine if someone on rpw ranted against a post about how modern career women weren t wife material if their comment said that the post was bad because it didn t talk about all of the positive traits that career women have that allow them to succeed in the office that wouldn t be a good argument i didn t get an sjw vibe from his comment about emaciated models but i can see how you did sjws don t hate the emaciated models because of the gender bending though i m not sure if they can even perceive that this is occurring any argument i ve seen has come from a pro fat real woman stance that argues models are too thin because of the patriarchal standards for female perfection or something like that i can definitely imagine terfs criticizing the gender bending catering to gay men aspect though that said if the author is talking about high fashion and vogue no longer fits into that category why is it being quoted us vogue is regarded as elite by the middle class some new money and celebrity wannabes it is totally coasting on the brand image and it still has a ton of influence due to its longstanding position in the industry the magazine is a reliable method of seeing what the mainstream attitudes are even if it is not as cool as it once was as an analogy cnn is totally coasting on its reputation as an unbiased popular news source in reality it is pure propaganda and its numbers are dwindling nevertheless looking at what cnn is reporting and the opinions of its viewers can often be a legitimate way of gauging the pulse of the population on certain subjects from what i can tell everyone else liked the show as well here is a review on wwd http wwd com runway mens fall collections 2017 new york palomo spain review very positive you can also see more pictures from the show i think the clothing itself is pretty interesting but i hate that it s for men and the intent behind it all is disgusting so i can t see it as anything other than terrible when you bring in the lens of does this normalize and damage what it means to be masculine and feminine in our culture will this translate into even more radical trends for young boys then the conversation changes completely for me yes i posted a comment immediately after submitting the article that gave discussion questions but i don t think that anyone actually read that prior to commenting themselves that was the conversation that i wanted to have next time i ll do a self post to further shape the conversation and avoid confusion i don t follow fashion i don t read fashion blogs magazines or watch runway shows i m entirely blind to how the fashion elite drive culture i also expected that women who responded would in fact be familiar with all of these things perhaps we can have more conversations as a community on this topic it would be useful for future discussions on culture if everyone is on the same page i don t think people should allow media or entertainment to warp twist push pressure or influence them beyond the morals values and interest they personally define for themselves while i agree that people should be strong enough so that their values aren t warped twisted pushed or pressured i think that the best tv shows films songs and art in general will have an influence on your worldview we can t experience everything ourselves so the media is often a source of information about the world and about humanity the key is exposing yourself to the right things and critical thinking in my opinion i agree that it s a far more interesting discussion and a worthwhile one to talk about the overall agenda to confuse erase invert gender roles presentation etc me too i ll probably start another thread in a week or two unless this one picks up with more discussion on this subject specifically i do enjoy the speech by streep in the devil wears prada and i absolutely see her point i know i m the clueless andy for the most part lol 3 i also think it would have helped the author to point to multiple examples other than the fashion show i saw the article as one piece of a larger conversation using one specific moment as a jumping off point i agree that it would have been more accessible if more examples were used i still feel like conversation is possible without in depth knowledge of high fashion you yourself said that you get the meryl streep speech in the devil wears prada that s basically all you need to know to answer my discussion qs which i will now sticky for the benefit of future post readers this comment is so long already and i didn t even get to talk about the meat of the discussion you already know how i feel about the subject though and i m glad to see more of your perspective ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,thanks for such an in depth response i don t think that an understanding of the world of high fashion is necessary for this comment section because i am interested in discussing the larger impact of runway trends not the runway shows themselves as i said in another comment i disagree with the author s negative opinion of high fashion but agree with the main argument of the post i think that outright disliking that realm or any broad category is totally fine everyone can have their own interests his perspective as an outsider allows him to make points from a different angle i appreciated the critical tone of the post and enjoyed the hyperbolic statements that the author made it was entertaining while still emphasizing his points i didn t take things as literally or seriously as you did some of your takeaways from the post were entirely different than mine for example the statement about modern art being transgressive and for lunatics this was definitely a joke designed to make a bigger point that being said in many circles modern art absolutely is about being transgressive the definition that you copied is one that many who create and enjoy modern art would agree with i didn t take the statement to mean that every single designer was a lunatic trying to be the most transgressive i m also not sure why you thought he was saying that vogue was the origin or sole publisher of skinny models again i found his description quite funny there are skinny models the result of designers and photographers selecting for androgyny and women who look like teenage boys and there is celebrity gossip both of these things can be criticized it doesn t matter if it is the norm also i wouldn t compare modern vogue to how it was in the past at all the magazine has declined so much over the years and so many people who are into fashion have given up because it has basically turned into people magazine the kardashians have been on its cover they are the exact opposite of high fashion if you look at fashion forums or blogs of women who are really into fashion us vogue isn t held in high regard like it used to be it s basically a cargo cult i just feel like you read a lot into his statement that wasn t there and argued something that he wasn t even talking about if you read vogue or harper s bazzar porter or any magazine that covers high fashion you d see photoshoots and articles that encourage women to embrace androgyny and masculine presentation this is considered cutting edge but it is presented as more than being in it is about rejecting heteronormativity the relationship between runway shows the media and everyday people is definitely something that i wanted to discuss with this sub the article was just a clear example that shows one aspect of the issue yes the reviews in the magazines are not 100 literal but the point remains that they are promoting feminized men not just as a fashion statement and the way that they choose to discuss these shows is by using language that highlights the degeneracy there is a strong relationship between the left and the celebration of ugliness chaos and death i said this to another commenter but the point about changes in men s fashion throughout time isn t equivalent to what is happening here what we are seeing on the runway is a reflection of the changing definition of what it is to be a man at all the fact that technically x group wore y item that is stereotypically feminine today is really just a distraction a man who wears a kilt due to scottish heritage is not challenging gender roles because in that culture men wear kilts in mainstream us culture it is abnormal for men to wear clothing with feminine characteristics the designers and stores who carry new clothing are not just trying to be different or bold they are intentionally trying to change the way that men and women define themselves this isn t a conspiracy it is stated boldly in magazines and online if you read about the inspirations behind various collections furthermore if anyone looks to movies fashion or music as moral guides i think that the bigger indication of lunacy i completely disagree with this not only do the majority of people take their cues from the media it is understandable because a it is human nature to both look for authorities and follow the herd and b the lack of religion creates a need in a lot of people s lives for a new standard it may seem ridiculous but many people form opinions about the world by looking at what others say and then cobbling together what makes the most sense to them ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,agreed i think its both the runway collections mirror how people are thinking today while also shaping our tastes and preferences the everyday person has so many different sources telling them that traditional masculinity and femininity are wrong oppressive boring etc ,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i get what you were saying about men fashion in the past and it lines up with my point about how some designers today have completely different intentions it not just about being different or new for them you keep going to extremes with your examples but the effects of these designs are subtle and widespread even men who do not actively follow fashion are still going to be impacted by the overall changes for example slim fitting tops pants and even suits are increasingly considered more fashionable than the more standard cuts here is an easy example that shows the differences that i am talking about http cdn shopify com s files 1 0073 8132 files slim standard and loose fit suit or shirt jpg 1236 another example is skinny jeans a look that has been trendy for men for a while now here https www thetrendspotter net wp content uploads 2016 01 how to wear men e2 80 99s skinny jeans 3 jpg and here https www thetrendspotter net wp content uploads 2016 01 how to wear men e2 80 99s skinny jeans 2 jpg are examples of men wearing them in a variety of styles showing that the look is not confined to one group if you look at the media aimed at men magazines or even the male fashion advice sub you will see similarly feminized looks not saying every look will be feminine just that the idea is present in nearly every level of fashion today the people who decide on the designs to make and or sell at their store are influenced by trends and make choices based on what is currently popular in many stores this means that more androgynous or feminized clothing will be on display because that is what is in it will not be marketed to straight men as a super rebellious or gay way to dress so while the number of people intentionally subverting gender roles through their clothing choices is low overall we see men dressing differently due to the larger shifts in the way people think about masculinity and femininity this does not have to be a conscious decision on the man part but it is a conscious decision on the part of the designer and the fashion buyer ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i agree with you a lot of the gurus apply highlight in a way that makes their skin look textured or even oily bobbi brown makes amazing highlighting products that give the exact effect that you are looking for i can definitely recommend her powders this one in particular http www bobbibrowncosmetics com product 14022 42387 makeup face and cheek highlight glow highlighting powder afternoon glow fh16 in the future i want to try some of the hourglass alps i know they are not technically highlighters but i am interested in a subtle glow just like you so something like mood light http www sephora com ambient lighting powder p377723 skuid 1483536 is right up my alley as far as drugstore products go everyone seems to love the loreal true match lumi liquid glow illuminators http www ulta com true match lumi liquid glow illuminator productid xlsimpprod12651013 this product does look really cool and customize able ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i do not think that individual designers are masterminds behind any of the cultural decay we are seeing but they certainly are assisting in that decline by pushing their own messages through their work the concepts of androgyny and rejecting heteronormativity are not exclusively being promoted to people under 20 or those who are sjws or edgy these ideas can be found in magazines aimed at adults such as vogue harper bazzar and porter there is a difference between people who naturally are not as masculine feminine as the average man woman and the promotion of intentionally rejecting the concept of gender via fashion maybe you have not seen it but the sheer excitement that many adults in the fashion industry have towards the idea of tearing down the traditional understanding of masculinity and femininity is concerning ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,the issue is that high fashion affects ready to wear collections magazines tv shows the choices of celebrities and ultimately the everyday person runway shows do not exist in a vacuum many actively turn to these looks in order to determine their own personal style and those who do not will still be impacted by the overall changes in the mainstream high fashion is art yes but it also is a reflection of the times and a source of cultural change what the article is arguing is more than just men fashion changing over time sure in the past men wore tights and heels but there was a very clear understanding that men and women were different men were not wearing feminine clothing in an attempt to challenge heteronormativity the designers of the time were not attempting to be as depraved as possible nor was being evil considered a badge of honor so many men today are embracing the trends of androgyny or outright femininity no it is not as extreme as the outfits in runway shows but that is not the best metric to assess how well any designer ideas have permeated into mainstream pop culture additionally these shows shape the tastes of the women consuming these images it will be interesting to see how the concept of the ideal man changes as androgyny and gender flipping continue to gain popularity ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i actually find all three of those looks interesting and appealing but i understand why someone who is not familiar with the realm would be confused as i said in my other comment i wanted to have a discussion about the cultural implications of the latest trends while artists and designers have been exploring gender and presentation for ages there is an obvious difference in the messages today vs in the past additionally there is a difference in the way the designer vision is discussed and promoted to mainstream audiences i for one am not a fan of the race to the most depraved and subversive hailing a show for being evil just does not sit right with me i am all for questioning the status quo and presenting something novel as art but there is clearly an agenda that extends beyond mere expression how do you see these trends and ideas impacting both men and women ,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,did you actually read the full post what are your thoughts on the author position regarding the direction of modern high fashion ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,now i actually enjoy high fashion so i do not share the same negative attitude towards the entire field like the author but i agree with the overall issue presented in the post obviously if you are not religious ignore the religious paragraph at the end the point remains that those who are in charge of shaping the tastes of the country are pushing androgyny and the inversion of gender roles even if the runway versions of the looks are more extreme the concepts trickle down into ready to wear lines and influence magazines tv shows and celebrity choices all of this influences the everyday person of course not every man will start dressing in this manner there are plenty of subgroups that are insulated from the feminization of male fashion i would love for us to discuss these trends as well as the effect it has on women fashion have you all noticed the push for women to be more androgynous and or dress in menswear what do you think about runway shows where men wear traditionally female articles of clothing are you comfortable with titles such as palomo spain the most amazing beautiful decadent evil thing at the new york men s shows let talk about anything else that comes to mind ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,what a well written and informative comment i agree with all of your points especially the distinction between learning about a culture through the lens of that cultures values and perspective vs glorifying and normalizing their beliefs and practices ,2,The_Donald
camille11325,people do not just use one singular source when discussing the wage gap on either side of the debate i have seen several blog posts and articles that reference statistics gathered both from hard data and self reported surveys and polls additionally when women discuss the subject using their own personal experiences and observations the risk of overestimation of hours worked comes into play the concept of the gender pay gap is not as narrow as you seem to believe real life conversations that happen surrounding the subject are not limited to one report or type of study ,4,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i want sweater 2 so badly where did you get yours the color does not look right in the photo but that may be lighting or the lack of makeup not sure i definitely prefer it to sweater 1 although i feel like different pants would work better the lighter wash and whiskering of the jeans draw the eye to the place where the shirt ends which creates the illusion of the top being slightly too short or maybe it just me i know i prefer the darkest most even wash ever for jeans so i am probably just biased haha ,4,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i do not think you understand the point that she was making overestimating is not the same as lying it involves miscalculating how long something took you to complete it is a mistake not intentional fraud if you ask someone how long it took for them to create a report if they did not keep a precise log they have to rely on their memory when they think back on the process they may remember the pressure and stress that they felt and the research they did and they may recall sitting at their desk for a considerable amount of time taking all of this into account as well as possibly the length of time of previous projects they may say it took 6 hours well it may have actually only taken 4 or perhaps they did spend 6 hours working on it but they were multitasking both with other projects and personal tasks conversations if women respond to a survey asking how long they work each day it is not implausible that some women would over estimate their hours ,4,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i agree that everything you listed contributes to the wage gap and want to note that most people who disagree with the concept of the wage gap are disagreeing with the idea that men are intentionally paying women less to keep them down and paying other men more because of the patriarchy feminists use the term to describe the same scenario and if they do mention things such as a woman inability to negotiate her salary it is still used as evidence of the evil patriarchy and other feminist talking points many of the factors that contribute to a difference between male and female salaries are due to the choices of individual women whether it is their choice of job their decision to have children their choice to accept the first deal offered instead of negotiating etc the issue is not that there is a gap the gap is indicative of how incompatible most women are with the male workforce feminists do not seem to be able to accept responsibility for their position and constantly blame others and outside forces in my opinion private employers should be able to make their own decisions when it comes to hiring firing and paying employees so if there are male bosses who actively choose to pay their female employees less or more it does not bother me when it comes to government institutions it makes sense to have regulations in place however we will still see a difference in the average male and female salary due to all of the factors we have been talking about i just cannot get up in arms like some people can when discussing the subject ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,managers and executives run businesses with the goal of making money the reality is that women who are pregnant have children or are soon to be pregnant cost the company money maternity leave reduced hours in office emergencies with their kids etc cannot be ignored why would the person in charge of promotions choose the woman who is about to leave for months or constantly puts other things above her job or worse struggles to manage the work life balance appropriately if there is a man who shows up every single day does not leave or bring his kids in wo not need extended months off of work does not feel the same sense of stress or even depression about being away from his family is not he the better choice many women choose to have fewer hours and arrange their schedules so that they can spend less time at work and more time with their families this is fine but its not economical to hire and promote people who are not as committed to the job this does not mean that all women do this but any prudent exec will be aware of the statistics and probabilities you have a lot of other ridiculous points in your comment but i am not going to get into them because this is not a debate sub our rules can be found on the sidebar and on our wiki we are an anti feminist space and do not want to waste time defending basic concepts especially when they are not related to the post in question edit removed the rape culture part i missed phantom bringing it up earlier and see now that you were replying to that ,6,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,great point ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,nice find i really like his point at the end about the potential future without chemistry between men and women if things continue as they are or get worse i definitely think that a lot of people conflate femininity with a specific type of personality when there are a variety of ways that true femininity can be expressed i have seen the concept of yin and yang being used to describe women personalities and features to differentiate between masculine and feminine in fact i will be writing about two of these systems in the near future for fnf there are plenty of female traits that are more yang not masculine in the slightest for example imagine the archetypes of a femme fatale or a warm but strict older black mom both of these women have a feminine energy it is just different than the introverted quiet giggly loves bunnies does not drink or curse stereotype my hope is that we can avoid an overly narrow description of femininity within this community so that all members can celebrate what makes them awesome women ,6,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325,it actually seems like they are mostly targeting open minded women who also believe that men should wear makeup these women want to align themselves with a brand that is progressive and edgy two things that do not usually come to mind when you think covergirl i agree with you that beauty trends are strange these days thankfully there are tons of brands who do not run these sorts of alienating campaigns ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i think black eyeliner is different than concealer because defining the lashline makes you look more feminine whereas concealing a blemish just makes you look normal plenty of women would be uncomfortable knowing that a man wears eyeliner i know i would whereas they would be sympathetic to a man concealing a blemish ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,love all of your points what was really annoying this rewatch was the amount of times andy said that she did not have a choice she totally acted like a victim without agency the part where she misses her boyfriend bday stands out to me as an area where she messed up but not in the way the movie portrayed it i feel like it would not have been hard for her to communicate clearly about why she would not be there and send a text or two during the party what we saw was her promising to be there and then silence for hours and then showing up to apologise if she stopped giving people false expectations they would not have been as disappointed ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i agree with you too she either could have tried to make it work with the current bf by controlling herself more quitting her job or she could have left him and found a new man who was in line with her new path she was so bad at trying to have it both ways always saying she had no choice when she did her bf was pretty pathetic but andy chose him so it not like she was not attracted to and putting up with him for years prior to the job ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,omg that a full face what do you apply your foundation with fingers brushes sponge some other device technique i think you are on to something about adjusting the brow to match the lip in intensity when it comes to color correction the bobbi brown correctors http www bobbibrowncosmetics com product 14018 15905 makeup face and cheek corrector and concealer corrector ss11 are a cult classic there are a ton of shade options but i think one of the bisques will work best to cancel out a wide range of shadow tones i have not tried her serum correctors but they seem to be the same level of quality in terms of canceling out unwanted colors ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325, i would have to say being delicate which to me entails grace speaking lightly being gentle while this is definitely one example of inner beauty i feel like a lot of people act like it the only way to be feminine when that is not the case you can have a vibrant or bold personality without being ugly on the inside or masculinised do all women master this of course not haha you are right that many women are cringey but i do not think that being delicate and gentle is the path to inner beauty for all women i definitely think we are told to value our inner beauty but i do not think it means the same thing to many non rpw today inner beauty seems more you go gurrrl and you be you instead of actually taking the time to evaluate whether you even have good qualities to offer anyone agreed this selfish mentality is definitely not part of inner beauty generosity compassion support etc are all some good traits to have instead do not you think ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i believe inner beauty is a distinct characteristic that measures a different set of traits than value at the most basic level beauty is a quality dependent on the person object in question having a combination of attributes that pleases the observer if you look at this definition alone it seems interchangeable with value but both words mean so much more than this definition throughout western history we have mostly agreed whether formally or instinctively that the truly beautiful meets these two requirements the object in question must excel at being that object when judging anything we compare it to all other things in that category as well as the platonic conception of that thing often the most important factors for judgement are the traits that define and separate the thing from all other objects a beautiful painting isn t beautiful because of the wooden frame used to make the canvas and it wouldn t be a beautiful painting if it was actually a photograph it also could not be beautiful if it was a failed attempt at a painting or if it violated every single principle of art and visual theory the object in question must be exceptional it must stand out from objects just like it and have an impact on the observer it must be deeply satisfying in a way that is nearly indescribable both of these qualities are easily seen when considering physical beauty but that doesn t mean that the term is limited to assessing the aesthetic i believe that the most important element when determining beauty is the impact on the observer an item can check all the boxes and excel without being beautiful humans have multiple dimensions to our being we are more than our appearance and therefore there is more that can be assessed we have many intangible aspects that combine to create impressions and leave impacts additionally there are standards both for humanity as a whole and for our gender that we can either meet or fall short of we are capable of excelling as humans and by this i mean eudaimonia and we are capable of having a pleasing deeply satisfying impact on others is inner beauty the exact same as beauty of course not that is why there is a modifier in front of beauty it further defines what is being discussed mostly the personality and demeanor of another person when women discuss inner beauty they list traits that are examples of excelling at the uniquely feminine eg grace this ties into another thing i want to talk about later women using the term feminine as a synonym for good there is a subconscious understanding that being a good woman being good at being a woman both inside and out but onto value while beauty refers to the state of the object itself and the emotional impact it has on the observer value is a measurement of worth this could be intrinsic or it could be something exchanged used for other benefits i believe that beauty can give value to something but something can have value without beauty and people can have value without inner or outer beauty just a different type of value than those with both to connect with your comment my idea explains why attractive people have access to more opportunities as you noted in your comment they exchange their appearance for benefits there is value in their beauty two separate concepts being used together to advance that person tying this into inner beauty the issue arises when people act like the value given by inner beauty outweighs the value that outer beauty gives to the point where they disregard outer beauty entirely and then there are those that see that outer beauty is easily used to obtain benefits so they discount the importance of inner beauty to be fair to feminists the idea of traditional female inner beauty is completely at odds with their standards and goals so of course they would reject them and so the only avenue many of them have for value within the female sphere is through their looks their pursuit of signifiers or male value only makes matters worse but that s a conversation for another day too so i agree with a lot of what you re saying just from a different angle ,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,haha yes grace is definitely important and yet so lacking in many modern women ,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,what a great idea for a post i actually wrote a post on r redpillwives called psychological femininity https www reddit com r redpillwives comments 4f9pjl psychological femininity which is all about cultivating a feminine frame of mind within your relationship all of the traits that i listed in that post are key to inner beauty in my opinion when we embrace our nature as women we thrive to be good women we have to excel at what is uniquely feminine ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,this is phenomenal and so true my mother has an hourglass figure and i spent soo much time with her when she was getting things tailored haha it really makes all the difference in how things look love the point you made about how people wo not ask you about the size you are wearing a semi related tip for anyone who has mental hangups about their size number when you try things on be sure to get a few different sizes of the same garment try on the largest size first and work your way down this way you avoid the embarrassing feeling of having to go up a size if this is something that embarrasses you thank you so much for writing this up ,7,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,it makes sense have you read this post http theredpillroom blogspot com 2012 05 female social matrix introduction html it is mostly about the female social matrix but it starts out by talking about male social dynamics it definitely mirrors what your so is saying ,3,RedPillWives
camille11325,agreed completely ,4,RedPillWives
camille11325,what a great mini fr sometimes a change in our mindset can improve things much better than any other course of action like you said when you let go of a tit for tat score keeping attitude it makes the things that he does do even more meaningful ,3,RedPillWives
camille11325,it so great that you know his love language and make sure to speak it often the fact that you are not just communicating with him but listening to what he actually needs and wants is so important best of luck with the distance 3,4,RedPillWives
camille11325,aww that is so sweet that he thanked you assisting our men in this way really does make a difference every little bit helps ,3,RedPillWives
camille11325,i bet that all sounds wonderful being his soft space to land and creating a welcoming stress free environment takes a lot of thought and energy sounds like you are doing a great job ,2,RedPillWives
camille11325,yes this is so key sometimes it difficult to follow through and be consistent about everything so this message is definitely worth repeating ,5,RedPillWives
camille11325,this all sounds so great i am excited for you both definitely keep us posted on how things go it would also be cool to have some threads about ways to make your man look good at events with colleagues ,3,RedPillWives
camille11325,which app do you use i prefer writing things down too but i can see how it could get tricky in the future if there is an app that makes things as efficient as possible i would definitely give it a try ,1,RedPillWives
camille11325,being prepared to make mistakes and fix them is definitely key not just in terms of supplies but also when it comes to your mindset once i stopped expecting perfection it made the whole process less stressful it will never look as good as if you took the time in your house to apply your look and that fine ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325, 2 is great advice i have made the mistake before of not checking all angles and looked completely ridiculous when we arrived at our location ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,your no makeup look is great how many products are you wearing if you are wearing any sort of base it is undetectable which is awesome cc i can think of eyebrows may be a bit to sharp defined and also you could use a bit more concealer under the eyes not sure if there is actually anything wrong with your eyebrows or if they just stand out more due to how subtle the rest of your makeup is it just feels a bit unbalanced in the bottom two pics but not in a way that anyone on a day to day basis would notice for under eyes do you color correct at all or something to depuff i just watched briana stanko latest favorites video and she sets her under eyes with an hourglass alp maybe you could do the same equivalent ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,there really is a hole in the market for a makeup company that is 100 for men to cover their imperfections i do not think most guys would use products from companies that already exist and cater to women most women would also probably be weirded out if they used the same brand as their so potential romantic interest ,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325, but men with full beards rocking lipstick and contouring no thanks i probably wo not buy from any company pushing this sort of advertising it is a bit absurd is not it i am with you about avoiding companies who advertise in this manner i wonder if they will alienate enough women to reevaluate their campaigns ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,it is off putting ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,yes this is exactly why fnf is ladies only trannies and men get so much praise and attention on the other beauty sub and they would only try to do it here too we have already had some try despite the clear rules haha speaking of being out of touch i feel like half the people making the decisions are super leftists with sjw values and then the other half are opportunistic and looking to profit on the latest thing i also feel like they are manufacturing this trend and if things were able to develop more organically we would not have so many male gurus ,7,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,agreed 100 it very confusing to see everyone embracing something so backwards and unnerving ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i agree it is off putting and i am sure plenty of ad people do not care about the social political side of things and are just looking to capitalise on recent trends men wearing undetectable makeup to hide a blemish or something makes sense and i am surprised that there are not more products brands for that there are all sorts of lip balms skincare products non basic hair care products etc aimed at men a natural looking concealer could easily be sold if the company did a good job making it not seem gay lol yes the virtue signaling on mua and other beauty subs on reddit is so annoying that why this sub is ladies only ,7,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,that a great point it just so alienating to see companies cozy up to these fringe groups but perhaps the money they bring in is more than the money they lose from normal women when they put out these campaigns more alternative women do seem to enjoy makeup but they have to have special languages and messages in advertisements content direct towards them i agree its a bad move for everyone except for the tiny niche of women who are getting catered too ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i have been taking on even more responsibilities so that m does not have to deal with them he is crazy busy with work and it only getting more demanding in a good way which means i am now busy too lol one big thing i am doing right now is taking the lead on finding our new house our lease ends sooner than we thought so there is more pressure i also have been writing things down for him that he wants to remember do later because he has so much on his mind and does not want to always think about it i am thinking of setting up a bullet journal type thing for him and i to use to make sure nothing falls through the cracks my personal bujo has been wonderful and i think if he had a simple notebook that he could log things into and that i could update as well it could relieve a lot of his stress he does not want to stop to type things into a document another option is voice memos but it definitely takes more time to record and review vs write if anyone has any tips here let me know ,6,RedPillWives
camille11325,exactly they andy friends all seemed to be successful in their fields so maybe they forgot the work it took to get to that point and even then it does not compare to what andy had to go through working for miranda so sorry to hear that you are going through something similar ,1,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325,she has been super anti trump and embarrassing herself on a daily basis recently with her hypocrisy some people are taken aback by how out of touch she seems there has been a lot of anti meryl streep content on the donald recently lots of it is funny even if i still enjoy her as an actress ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,she has been super anti trump and embarrassing herself on a daily basis recently with her hypocrisy some people are taken aback by how out of touch she seems there has been a lot of anti meryl streep content on the donald recently lots of it is funny even if i still enjoy her as an actress ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i see what you are saying and it definitely would have been helpful for andy if her boyfriend was more flexible and supportive that being said he entered into the relationship expected a certain dynamic which she fulfilled so it not a surprise that when things change completely he would not be on board if he wanted to be with a career woman he would be with one to me at least it seemed like he had his own ambitions and wanted a woman who supported him not one without a life of her own or anything just someone who made him a top priority i personally think they could have made it work with her at the magazine like you said they could have accepted that it was a season in her life but she definitely would have had to work on her ability to make him feel significant because she totally slacked on that while doing everything for miranda ,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,definitely and yes having photos really helps ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,exciting keep us posted ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i will start by saying i am not a fan of any of this no issue at all with male makeup artists there are were some genuinely talented artists who are were visionaries in the field that is completely different from male instagram models beauty gurus and spokesmodels for makeup brands the way that the media and everyday women are embracing these men is baffling are things so warped that these men really are aspirational or have people bought into the media spin let discuss the article and all related issues ,18,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,agreed maybe because it a nod to an older trend it just looks odd ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,yes it really was not necessary at all ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,exactly ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,yes haha,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i see a lot of women on the female fashion advice submitting visual wardrobes they photograph themselves in every item of clothing that they wear and then a get feedback on what to keep vs ditch and b use the photos in organization systems like custom excel sheets you could even do it by outfit instead of every single item on it own of course if you decide to go this route it would be welcome on the sub ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,me too 3,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,omg you got her book do a review for the sub i adore her and her site even though her style is completely the opposite of mine haha so great that you have such an in depth resource for your own style ,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,you should start a thread on little ways to elevate an outfit there are tons of things you could do to satisfy your need to look more dressed up without sticking out inappropriately in lectures also i love that you love flowers floral print is my fav lace is a close second ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,those are great goals i feel like the norm today is mix and match but having defined outfits just feels more natural for me and a lot of other women apparently ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,we should totally have a discussion on this subject as a community ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,awesome is it harder to feel feminine in the clothes due to the lower number of items worn subdued color scheme i assume and the combinations and fits of what you wear anytime i see minimalist clothing it is blocky androgynous or just plain do you interpret it differently for your wardrobe side note that scarf is awesome ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,ooh love this i actually came up with phrases and ideas when i was making my personal style guide for the new style that i am transitioning into so i will explain that in detail in case it helps others with the process at first my style was called understated bombshell a name i made up but then i went down the rabbit hole that is the kibbe system will write about this later and i loved the term theatrical romantic which is my type and i resonate with it 100 he describes tr as femme fatale chic which is very close to my ub description romantic alluring and timeless so i started with both ideas and built on them to flesh out what i want to look like femme romantic to me meant feminine delicacy i wanted that aspect of my appearance to be charming enchanting flirty light i like how kibber describes fatale alluring as an arresting magnetism i definitely want to be sensual and stunning it why i chose the term bombshell initially finally chic timeless is all about looking elevated but since i enjoy the aesthetics of multiple time periods the phrase i came up with is anachronistic elegance so those are all the words that i use i will note that the words you use to define your style definitely affect your mindset towards your look understated bombshell fits but the connotation is that i am reigning in the bombshell a bit where as theatrical romantic captures the dynamic and vibrant aspect of my look i feel more confident wearing things i would have considered bolder in the past something to consider edit typos,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,yay greek life that is so cool that one of your sisters was the author i actually preferred the new guy to her current bf maybe not visually but definitely in terms of personality and general awesomeness haha completely agree about how great meryl is in this film for many this is her defining role so interesting that you did not enjoy it as much as others i am totally part of the cult following haha it such a fun film ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,agreed i wrote about it a bit in my comment would love to hear your thoughts have you seen the september issue ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,so i actually completely disagree with andy growth at the end and the way her friends treated her now some of her growth was legitimate and necessary andy intentionally accepted for a demanding job and this job was even more demanding because of how little she knew about the world she was entering she made it harder for herself from the beginning by resisting everything and being condescending when she got rid of her ego put effort into her appearance and actually had a handle on everything she was great her external makeover matched the internal makeover that was happening at the same time loved this transition and seeing a peek into the magazine world throughout the film i highly recommend the september issue for anyone who wants more not only is it real life it about vogue the inspiration for the devil wears prada okay so the parts i did not agree with her friends were totally selfish and not understanding of the pressures of her new job they expected her to have the same amount of free time energy enthusiasm etc and get mad at her for actually being productive none of them have the sort of position that andy did so it not like everyone was busy but all of them managed except for her it understandable that they would be a bit let down when she could not make things but they literally never seemed to accept that she had a new demanding job where she thrived her boyfriend issues are more legitimate and i think their relationship struggling is very realistic it hard to be a career woman and good so at the end of the film andy is horrified by the awesome maneuvering that miranda did to maintain her position she realizes how fake and cruel things are and decides she does not want a part in that world i get that it a film and all but she wants to be a journalist that whole field is nothing but alliances lies secret deals heavy information dropped on you without warning selfish people climbing their way to the top people who do whatever it takes to stay in power etc it just as fake and shallow if not more in some instances and of course the fashion industry is not 100 fake or about gambits but the idea that she was now going to be real and stress free any new job is just funny when you think about it business is business and if she cannot handle people looking out for their best interest and bottom line she should stay at home which i would totally have approved of as an alternate ending lol let me know what you all thought 3,7,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,okay there were technical difficulties before sorry for all the delays guys definitely continue talking all weekend about the film d,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,this post is removed due to multiple reports as well as evidence that you identify as trans if you are in fact a biological woman then let me know if not there are lots of other subs that have information for you specifically also there are forums and websites about taking hormones and using devices to enlarge boobs one girl that i met a while ago on reddit had success with the noogleberry and there are other creams and systems that encourage fat production in the boobs look for products with vollufiline or whatever it is called google it it will come up ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,going to be a bit contrarian but i do not like the strap it does not do anything for the dress imo and a cleaner neckline would look more elegant i did not think it was a bra strap but it just looked superfluous ,6,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,love this i completely agree that the way that our country dresses is a reflection of our morale values culture etc while the author brings up a good point about seeming like we have given up i also think that the way people dress is a result of coasting both point to laziness but from different sources america has been 1 for so long that many here take it for granted this leads to people shrugging off all sorts of standards effort does not seem as necessary since we have already won obviously most people are not consciously literally thinking about it in this way but i believe that this idea subtly influences a lot of people we have prosperity in comparison to other countries so there is not as much pressure from the environment which will shape the way society organizes itself including our dress codes ,5,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,yeah it does not make sense to buy a lot of casual clothing if you are not going to wear it in the future i completely agree about preferring to be overdressed vs under dressed thanks for reading and commenting 3,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,you are welcome sometimes we cannot see our situation as clearly because we are right in the middle of it this flow chart is so simple but that what makes it effective so glad you found it helpful ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,this is a really cool post on a really cool website i have always had the issue of a closet full of clothes yet nothing to wear so this flow chart was perfect my issue is that my wardrobe no longer matches my personal style and that is definitely something that i have been working on fixing what were your results how are you working on underlying issues with your wardrobe p s hope everyone is doing well i got super busy out of nowhere but i am glad to have some time to post today looking forward to getting to know all the newest subscribers ,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i totally did not even think about that it still a great film we will just ignore her recent awfulness haha,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,agreed these levels really help with discussion let me quote myself from a different comment levels of refinement is different than a dress code because it looks at each individual piece and not the full look for example a business casual top could be level 1 or level 2 the same could be said for a dressy casual and smart casual top this is because most tops in those categories are either dressed up or down via accessories and the other items worn saying a level 2 top is more specific because it talks about the top itself and does not rely on the other clothing in its definition i hope we can use these terms across the sub ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,that interesting that you find leggings more flattering than jeans i am curious as to why what styles and brands have you tried what does not work about jeans ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,that great that you are incorporating more level 1 your point about the coat is so key it can really enhance your look or detract from your look i like to wear leather jackets or cardigans as my warm weather options but i want to get a few embroidered jackets like this https s media cache ak0 pinimg com 564x 31 15 48 3115488aea5cfb591f85221ae229df54 jpg this https s media cache ak0 pinimg com 564x e2 f7 b4 e2f7b4fa631708b5e43879b374ddf5dc jpg and this https s media cache ak0 pinimg com 236x 67 02 76 670276525624356c3ec6227478ecaf8e jpg so glad you enjoyed the post ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,awesome i love mixing 1 2 for everyday you feel pretty and put together without being dramatically overdressed or inconvenienced ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,thank you for including photos it will make it easier to discuss the topic i think the general nature of the categories is important because it allows you to make faster decisions when you are getting dressed or shopping it also make it a bit easier to analyze exactly why an outfit does or does not work for the layperson levels of refinement is different than a dress code because it looks at each individual piece and not the full look for example a business casual top could be level 1 or level 2 the same could be said for a dressy casual and smart casual top this is because most tops in those categories are either dressed up or down via accessories and the other items worn saying a level 2 top is more specific because it talks about the top itself and does not rely on the other clothing in its definition the pearls that you gave a picture of would be level 2 so it fits with the idea that 2 3 and 1 2 works the leather makes it more casual taking it out of the level 1 group it not just about the pearls it about the entire piece shape length materials etc trends that are about juxtaposition only underscore the rule because the point of the trend is going against the grain and matching up things that are not supposed to go together if there was no underlying principle about what types of clothes matched best then these trends would not be seen as daring or different also most people do not like the trends that you listed specifically because it looks ridiculous on most people in everyday situations and it looks ridiculous because 1 3 pairings are just extremely hard to pull off and why would most women want to as someone who style has been a mix of southern and northern prep for most of my life with 90 of my friends dressing the same i can absolutely say that mixing levels 1 and 3 were not a thing on an everyday basis the first photo looks like 2 3 to me just because something is pearl does not mean it is level 1 it also not a fashionable look just a trendy one the second photo looks like a mix of 2 and 3 as well but we would have to know what the clothes are made of to be sure there is a relaxed fit of the blazer which is rolled up at the sleeves possibly indicating that the materials and cut are level 2 she also could have sized up in a regular blazer to get the effect but that choice still makes it less formal than if she brought a properly fitted standard blazer the pants are level 3 and we would have to feel the shirt to know if it is level 2 or 3 shoes and bags are also 2 scarf could be 2 or 1 i wonder if having all 2 1 on top and 2 3 on bottom makes it possible to mix all three and look cohesive often trends are about breaking the established rules and this post is about an established rule that does not often get articulated as clearly even within these trends there are rules for example in the casual southern prep image that you linked there are certain types of tops leggings socks and boots that get worn you cannot just throw together anything that vaguely resembles the outfit and have the same effect there is a similar principle of balance necessary to make sure you look cohesive and not sloppy the material cut fit length color etc are all part of that and even though the items are casual they are still far more refined than what one would wear working out to someone who does not dress like this it may just seem like leggings but i believe that the elevation of those casual pieces allows you to wear level 2 things and look like you are more refined than you actually are in the moment ,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i love this concept and have applied it successfully to my own wardrobe the clothing shown in the article is very dated who knew what was in style 5 years ago would look so jarring so quickly just move past it lol personally i dress in a mix of levels 1 and 2 and feel so weird if i am head to toe in level 3 clothing casual for me is wearing all level 2 items and then if i need to be more formal it all level 1 from what i can tell the women on reddit eg on femalefashionadvice mostly wear level 2 and level 3 clothes i often see people complaining about clothes not being functional due to the material and construction what level are you most comfortable in do you mix and match which makes you feel the most uncomfortable if any ,4,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,great idea just wanted to let everyone know that this thread can have both beauty and culture related content so anything anti sjw or anti annoying women is totally fair game if you are the type to get offended then this isn t the post for you and you probably won t like the sub either lol just a note to all we ve been getting brigaded i m sure you ve all noticed how some post have less than 5 points votes this post will probably be brigaded too ignore the downvotes and have fun d ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i literally never get tired of the american girls be like meme haha here http imgur com a ijqff is a short album that i made a while ago and here http imgur com a yc7pp is another one anyone who watches beauty gurus on youtube will enjoy this video https www youtube com watch v 36jpidnntcw so accurate this vid https www youtube com watch v 8yi4y5b1bb4 is nsfw but it another funny parody of beauty gurus ,12,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,wonderful post thank you so much for sharing it kellyanne conway is so refreshing and i hope she inspires young women across america to have agency and reject the terrible messages pushed on women today ,4,RedPillWives
camille11325, this may sound corny but i find some food strikingly beautiful it not easy to explain but it can arouse such emotion in me and there are times during that show i want to cry hahaha same not just with food but with beautiful things that have an impact in general m enjoys mocking me when this happens lol,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,lol ,4,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i think there is a lot that separates storytelling from other concepts such as leaving an impression signaling creating a mood and infusing with meaning the first that comes to mind is the desired result those four are all about obtaining a specific perception from the observer when it comes to you your product for example a woman who carries a bottega veneta handbag may be signaling her socioeconomic class and also she may desire for others to view her as sophisticated and tasteful impression this is totally me thinking out loud but i would define mood as the feeling that you get as a result of the combined elements in a given product thing whereas impression is the feeling you have about the product thing due to that combination of elements and then signals are often the individual elements themselves finally meaning is found in the interpretation of one or more of the elements both intended and not in contrast the desired result of storytelling is taking you on an emotional or intellectual journey by transporting you from state a to state b in clothing that may manifest in simply the form of professional the working woman casually put together the busy mom chic the fashionista maybe those genres are really the best story achievable by the every day person i absolutely think that these archetypes are simple ways for women to tell stories through their clothing without having to be experts on fashion or any other related subject of course not everyone is trying to tell a story when they get dressed some are just trying to signal or leave an impression more thinking out loud even if women aren t trying to tell a story through their clothes many tell stories with their clothes to clarify they dress themselves as if they are in a story and the clothes support their character the archetypes come in handy here as well as they fit into personal narratives ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,absolutely love this the technology is out there and i think it so great that we can look as great as possible both in real life and in photos i have learned through trial and error my best angles and expressions but this is absolutely essential for women to know it completely takes away any anxiety when you have to take an unplanned photo definitely going to practise my editing skills thanks for sharing ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,am i right to infer that you are speaking in general to hypothetical sjws who go on and on about other people privilege while not realising the benefits they have themselves there really is a lack of self awareness among that group of women all the freedom to express themselves without legal or major cultural punishment and they still find ways to tear others down western women are so ungrateful for the economic political and cultural awesomeness that gives them this unique environment to comfortably complain haha ,20,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,my thoughts on the concept of storytelling as described in your post i think that when people use the term storytelling they usually mean communicates a cohesive message that elicits emotion within the observer specifically a message that attempts to transport or expand the perspective of the receiver going from state a to b provides the illusion of narrative we innately desire these sorts of experiences storytelling has been part of human culture since the beginning of our existence in an increasingly digital and detached age it isn t surprising that we d yearn for authentic human connection i believe that the emphasis on storytelling is a manifestation of something primal the trend of elevating storytelling in mainstream pop culture mirrors and contributes to the way we elevate the subjective over the objective we see this in competitions dealing with anything aesthetic in many cases emotions and personal experiences are considered equal to if not superior than objective beauty color theory ratios proportion history the principles of art skill etc on project runway if a garment looks terrible or has poor construction but it excelled in storytelling designers won t even get kicked off i am not sure if the word storytelling was specifically used this past season but mah jing absolutely benefitted from his strength as a storyteller he wasn t a good designer or sewer imo i think our ability to glean both information and emotion from inanimate objects is amazing i also think we can tell stories through any medium some obvious examples a runway show a symphony or the mise en scene of a film things like meals at restaurants or everyday clothing choices can also tell stories their small scale makes this less obvious but the audience is also more targeted using fashion as an example the nuances of different brands styles combinations materials silhouettes etc can be lost on those outside of your target audience someone unfamiliar with the world of fashion would just see your ensemble as clothes whereas those who know the subject in depth would respond on some level to your choices a good example of this is in the devil wears prada the wardrobe selections and settings for andy vs the fashion minded tell her story even without the explicit dialogue in one of the best moments miranda breaks down the context behind one of andy s outfits https www youtube com watch v yj8mhwvfxmc in this scene you can see that andy cannot understand the stories that they are trying to tell through fashion due to her lack of knowledge on the subject which is reflected both in her reactions and her own clothing choices miranda s monologue also hints at the way runway collections like all things can be in conversation with each other each building on innovations and adding ideas to the collective body of stories told through clothing this comment is so long so i m going to wrap it up but i look forward to more discussion thank you for such a thought provoking post ,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,disagreeing is fine but i hope you can understand that the source of the conflict was the approach that you took when disagreeing do you know your mbti i don t believe that you were intentionally trying to be awful or anything i think there were lots of misunderstandings due to our different cognitive functions ways of processing information now that you ve expanded on your statements about her business approach your earlier claims don t seem so ridiculous but without that context you seemed like you didn t understand that her website is literally how business is done today i m not a fan of the approach either but i don t think it invalidates her ideas whereas you seemed to be claiming that because she uses x normal tactics all of her ideas are bad your first two comments to me gave no indication that you actually understood the argument that was being made in the article or my comments you spoke about generalisations and how things didn t apply to you personally you also brushed aside the issue at hand by saying that people are different and everyone gets stressed it was not clear that you even understood the idea that male and female nature makes both genders better suited for different things from my and others perspective there is a gap between what you were trying to do and what you actually ended up doing your statements weren t just disagreeing with the article they misconstrued and or missed the point the point of the article if you had written a comment sharing your personal perspective but in a way that made it clear that you got the post and just personally didn t have the same experiences that would be one thing but that s not what happened and now we have all of this lol we always encourage women to post what they want and share what they are interested in but there are definitely more women who lurk than submit content and the number of women who regularly write oc is very small this doesn t mean that the subjects aren t welcome on the subreddit i personally don t write about that topic since it doesn t have anything to do with my life or experiences so what would i even say i think in general more women here are comfortable having discussions in the comments vs writing full posts there are so many interesting conversations that happen and so little of that gets turned into oc feel free to start the conversations that you want to have and it will encourage other women who are interested in the same thing ,3,RedPillWives
camille11325, in fact i would argue that a theory can never fully explored or developed but that is another philosophical discussion entirely i totally agree with this the intent of your posts provides a good frame for their consumption i also read them from the approach that they types apply strictly to longterm romantic relationships therefore i struggled to see their applicability to other relationships yes they are about ltrs between rmv and smv 5 people but we can apply the underlying concepts to other situations the traits that make you a certain way in a relationship usually do not exist in a vacuum your nature as a person affects all areas of your life and it interesting to explore this as well as see patterns and commonalities within groups of women ,2,RedPillWives
camille11325,yes exactly ,2,RedPillWives
camille11325,hahaha yes that reaction to renee completely makes sense she definitely has a target audience and it is not h women i similarly recoil to things written for h women for example a lot of laura doyle posts are for a specific type of overbearing h women who need to chill out and stfu these women literally need to bite their tongue and practise not controlling every little detail for someone who does not struggle with that issue all the advice can seem extreme but really these women have to retrain their minds and that can only happen if they put in the effort and really think before acting disclaimer in case silverspoon is reading i do not mean that all h women deal with that issue or need laura doyle advice lol ,2,RedPillWives
camille11325,did you read the follow up posts there are two more also i have not written my full post on h vs l even though sub theories get discussed across the sub and on irc all the time avid participants on the sub know the ideas and contribute to the theory and we have expanded and come up with some really cool ideas this is why i said it did not seem like you were that familiar with the sub and i do not expect everyone to automatically know that this is going on the delay on the other post s is due to life and also coming to new conclusions about things i make it very clear in 1 5 that h and l are not inherently good or bad but since this is rpw the series is both a general theory and geared towards being applicable by women here in their relationships h women absolutely need to have psychological femininity and yield to their men which in general comes easier for l women l women have their own set of issues which also get discussed across the community there is a significant population of h women who come to rpw and need to work on not being controlling micromanaging nagging distrustful etc so that is why my series initially focused on that aspect of h women tagging the phenomenal u tempesttcup in case she has anything else to add ,3,RedPillWives
camille11325,the way that renee runs her website is pretty standard in terms of bloggers who also have books and services there is nothing illegal about it she is not revolutionary or scammy she is just doing what plenty of other bloggers do to make money she uses language and techniques that are commonly recommended if you read any modern resource on online marketing it isn t predatory or shady to attempt to appeal to your reader by identify an issue need in their life she is trying to capture her target audience just like any other business if you re not part of her target demo the message isn t going to have the impact that she wants i don t have love life issues so i just ignore her calls to action and get the information that i do like from the site giving people some information and saving the best info for your larger monetized product is business 101 additionally presenting yourself as an expert on a subject to give people a reason to buy your product is also business 101 she has a specific perspective and is putting in effort to share that message with other women who may benefit from it i think that qualifies her to do what she is doing as much as anyone else can start a business selling whatever service or skill someone would pay for when it comes to photoshop she could just be bad at it or she could have taken her face from one photo and put it on the body of a different photo taken during the same session and by she i mean her or whoever she paid your initial comment to me gave the impression that you were in fact offended i arrived at this conclusion because of the way you personalised everything every single claim or piece of advice from the article was refuted due to its irrelevance to your specific situation the intensity of your comment also supported my perception of your offense your word choice and overall tone read as emotional and the way you constantly compared yourself to the hypothetical women described by renee made it seem like you felt insulted and angered by her words taking this most recent response into account i believe that it is female solipsism that is preventing you to grasp the purpose of the article and what i am saying it is possible to recognise that something can be true and useful for others without it having to apply to you you don t seem to be able to understand the extent to which other women process things differently from you which i will expand on as i continue replying to your statements but when i read renee article at the end i took away the message women cannot work because their women this is a very odd takeaway from the post she specifically wrote about women who are in the male workforce which is not the same as women who work in general the message that i received that other women who read also understood is in general women do not thrive in the male workforce because it requires a specific set of skills and traits and most women have a different set of skills and traits due to the innate and biological differences between the genders the male workforce is designed for men and women have only recently joined it in large numbers many women who have jobs in these fields are not fulfilled by their roles and in fact the environment is draining depressing exhausting and all sorts of other negative things this is not due to everyday stress and burnout this is because they are ill suited for the role being able to perform an action is not the only requirement for success in a job there are specific mindsets attitudes habits character traits demeanors and even lifestyles that are necessary for the best performance plenty of men can change a diaper and read a book to their child but hate the idea of being a stay at home dad who does 24 7 care of their children this doesn t mean that they are bad fathers or bad people they just thrive in different environments due to their nature it also doesn t mean that every single man is incapable of being a sahd but we can speak in generalities because there is a bell curve when it comes to how masculine or feminine one is and most people are located right next to or near the average zone for masculinity or femininity i do not support the assertion that working outside of the home is automatically masculine neither does rpw and neither does renee from what i can tell i haven t read every post on her site just the ones that i ve linked to rpw so i will only speak about the rpw position right now women have always worked there is just a difference between traditionally female jobs and traditionally male jobs you can be employed without being a career woman 80 of the time when people online in this sphere talk about women working they are talking about career women in male dominated fields this can be inferred by looking at context clues so many women today are pushed into fields where they don t really thrive and they feel bad about being unable to succeed 100 these women blame themselves and an article like this is important to show that it isn t a failure on their part the way one approaches having a career can be masculine but it can also be feminine it just depends on the mind frame from which you approach the situation sure but this was an article for and about women who are more on the feminine side who feel crushed from their job because it requires a lot of masculine characteristics i know of at least one post on rpw about being feminine in the male workplace and people discuss it all the time on the sub the article that i submitted is an addition to the conversation not a stand alone theory of everything it s only discussing a tiny piece of the situation and i appreciate that limited scope renee makes sweeping generalization in her article it is not directed towards one type of woman but to all women yes she does make generalisations but again they aren t universal statements it s pretty understood that when you say men are like x and women are like y you don t literally mean every single man or woman with zero exceptions and no nuance the whole point of a general statement is to be general they are useful when relaying big ideas everyone operates in the world differently everyone can tolerate different levels of stress and different things make different people happy okay but do you understand that there is a fundamental difference between male and female nature and that women who have average to high levels of femininity can struggle in male areas specifically because of these innate differences you seem to be shrugging off the crux of the article different things make different people happy is true but we can go a step further we can look at what types of things make most women happy and what types of things make most men happy there is nothing wrong with examining the preferences strengths and weaknesses of each sex we can look at the trends and patterns and form theories generalisations and hueristics that helps you take the big pile of raw information and make it actionable i enjoy my feminine role in a masculine workplace what makes you think i never operate in a support role or that i never utilize my nurturing side in the office this is what i mean by you misinterpreting i actually specifically stated that you in fact did thrive in your workplace something that i only could claim based on reading your own testimony to that fact me talking about what other women are like me saying that you are not like that again where did i state that i cannot be vulnerable or that i need to have direct control of all things people and situations another example of solipsism if i am explaining the characteristics of a different group of women i am not asserting that you lack all of those traits low dominance in women travels with a suite of traits just as high dominance in women travels with a different suite of traits that does not mean that it is impossible for an h woman to have l traits or vice versa h and l women aren t characterised by those other traits we are just speaking about patterns and probabilities the l and h system differentiates between dominance level and that is the dividing line your location on the spectrum just makes you more likely to have other traits as an example a high dominant woman is more likely to be comfortable with confrontation this does not mean that all h women are comfortable with confrontation it does not mean that no l women can be comfortable with confrontation one s degree of comfort with confrontation does not determine one s dominance level but we can absolutely look at the traits that one has and use that to infer dominance level i am very familiar with rpw ideas but do not buy into the idea that you cannot have a career and a wonderful loving rpw relationship you are familiar with rpw but think that we believe that women can t work or succeed in the workplace you realise that most of the women on the sub are employed right there is a difference between being a career obsessed bitch and succeeding at work and as i said before there is a difference between a job and a career not all women need to have careers and not all women want one even if they are afraid to admit it to themselves feminism has made the idea of careers and career women the norm the ideal even in some circles it is important to show women that this isn t the only option it is refreshing for many to read something like this that tells them that it is okay that they are different the message clearly wasn t for you but hopefully now you can see exactly what was and wasn t being said and why something like this is both rp and welcome on the sub ,4,RedPillWives
camille11325,you are welcome ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,yes i agree that this was her audience and i feel like the working women here who feel overwhelmed could use a positive message it definitely possible to go too far on either extreme but there are definitely more resources for women who are too passive vs too aggressive or any other set of hyperfemale vs hypermale traits glad you found the post interesting ,3,RedPillWives
camille11325, feminism did not change the workplace it still designed with men in mind the competitive rat race one up manship of the workplace is not feminine and i find it incredibly taxing and exhausting so true love everything about your comment but especially this part ,4,RedPillWives
camille11325,hahah you are just further on the feminine side of the spectrum than others and that fine as long as it does not negatively impact your life be sure that you are not just justifying laziness irresponsibility immaturity or other signs of poor character ,5,RedPillWives
camille11325,yes i found this thought provoking as well it actually connected with an idea i have been thinking about men can improve themselves and become more masculine through hard work labour sacrifice etc which often includes things that take a physical toll i think women can improve themselves and become more feminine by doing things like self care prioritising appearance cooking etc these activities require feminine traits and skills such as being patient having an eye for beauty taking things slower being nurturing etc it takes discipline and responsibility to commit to regular self care or cooking really well i think that it a better way for women to develop the skills that mature adults should have without losing their softness basically challenging themselves within the female sphere hope that makes sense to actually respond more directly to your comment what s interesting to observe is the way her feminine energy pushes back this is such an awesome insight to have would love a larger discussion on this topic thank you so much for commenting ,3,RedPillWives
camille11325,so glad you enjoyed the post while homemaking and other traditionally female jobs can be stressful and difficult there really is a big difference between the effect that has on most women vs the effect that working in the male sphere has when it comes to finances i do not think that all men should always control the finances it just does not make sense if the man is not better at that or if he does not want to i do agree though that men are less likely to be stressed out by controlling the budgets always great to hear your thoughts ,3,RedPillWives
camille11325, in my opinion she authors click bait articles in an attempt to get women to buy one of her books or programs she definitely is trying to sell her products and services but her articles aren t click bait she provides actual information and actionable advice in her posts and delivers on whatever is promised by the title and intro there is nothing wrong with marketing yourself it s her website of course she is going to use it for promotion why shouldn t she profit from the work that she does especially when there is a market for it and i could be wrong but all of the photos i found of her online look eerily similar and i see signs of photo shopping looks kind like a con artist to me 99 of photos on professional websites are photoshopped how does that make someone a con artist plenty of women have go to poses and end up looking similar in photos again how is this shady she likely has success from having a consistent brand and image women can remember her if they see similar images wherever she is mentioned this is standard for those whose identity and business are intertwined you sound like an h woman who is taking offense at a message for l women https www reddit com r redpillwives comments 4ep0xh relationship dynamics part one updated expanded are you aware that there are hundreds of thousands of women who are working in environments that go against their nature and they struggle and blame themselves not realising that it is okay to be different than h women in your personal experience you simply get stressed deal with it and move on but there are women that this does not work for because they are different from you don t read her general statements about many women as universal statements about all women you thrive under pressure plenty of women don t and a post like this is a relief to them and when other women aren t thriving it isn t always a simple case of burnout and the surrender that she is talking about resonates with l women it s not a desire to defer to all men in a romantic way we just operate within the world differently there are posts about what this means throughout the sub but an obvious way to contrast is that while you personally enjoy your active role in the masculine workplace a lot of women thrive when they are in supportive positions that require nurturing skills when it comes to non professional relationships l women are more comfortable with vulnerability and not being directly in control of all things people and situations this is something that h women tend to struggle with if you re not familiar with rpw ideas or renee s work then i understand why you wouldn t know the connotations and larger context ,6,RedPillWives
camille11325,yay so glad you like the sub ,2,The_Donald
camille11325,yes it so refreshing to see her stand up to their oppressive standards all the other female european leaders wear the hijabs and smile lol,2,The_Donald
camille11325,yay ladie night thanks for the shoutout 3 love the donald and all it lovely mods and moddesses also i am loving trump first month so much winning and i feel so vindicated now that the truth about leftists is becoming public knowledge ,4,The_Donald
camille11325,please read this post https www reddit com r redpillwives comments 5hz4md female sexual strategy and the other top rpw posts they will help you with dating also i was not around today and i really do not feel like countering every single comment but do look at what i did say about tinder and similar sites in the comments that i did leave best of luck with everything write a field report if something interesting awesome happens ,1,RedPillWives
camille11325,you are fine ,2,RedPillWives
camille11325,haha of course 3,2,RedPillWives
camille11325,this might just be because i am lh but i feel like a man who would sign up for a dating site where women initiate would not be the best in terms of leadership and dominance the app just sounds like more female entitlement and i have the same criticisms for it that i do for tinder in terms of removing the romance and everything else i said in other comment sections ,3,RedPillWives
camille11325,i am not talking about a meet cute when i use the term romance tinder and similar programs make the entire process of being on the market and trying to find a man way more clinical less personal when it is a major part of your dating strategy it hampers your ability to have real life chemistry in my opinion because you concentrate your energy on doing well online with the apps which requires different traits than more organic methods of dating it also changes your perspective in terms of your estimation of your smv and rmv most guys swipe to approve nearly every woman or they send messages to multiple women because they are looking for the quickest lay any chance of success additionally having that power in your hand to say yes or no so officially reinforces a sense of entitlement also just thinking off the top of my head it removes some of the need for insecurity because you are not there face to face when you first talk so you do not have to put in as much effort in terms of connecting charming them into the date text is not the same as body language appearance facial expressions laughter etc even if you personally have a good relationship from tinder it does not mean that the app is a great option for single women looking to get married asap and have a traditional rp dynamic and i think that this whole comment section is filled with a lot of hamstering and female solipsism ,0,RedPillWives
camille11325,no you were not being an asshole and i am so glad you were here to represent the rp perspective rpw has women at all levels of knowledge and experience and no one will learn or improve if others do not point them in the right direction posts like this actually demonstrate why a this sub is necessary left to their own devices not all women will figure out what to do to get what they want and how can they when no one in their lives or mainstream culture is giving them the truth or calling them out tinder is so normalised and even expected in some circles so this is a valid question for single women to ask online dating and dating hook up apps are a feature of the modern smp so we cannot ignore it it just takes more than one person to combat the hamsters lol i am not sure if you saw but i wrote a post on female sexual strategy https www reddit com r redpillwives comments 5hz4md female sexual strategy that breaks down the reasons behind what we advise on rpw feel free to link it to women on this sub or even ppd if it comes up ,2,RedPillWives
camille11325,exactly you are spot on as usual rpw is about female sexual strategy and it rarely is optimal for a woman to use her time energy and resources to try to convince men who are not interested in settling down to settle down with her beta orbiting is the perfect parallel so hopefully drawing the comparison makes it click for women ,2,RedPillWives
camille11325,i am talking about serious exclusive relationships so over one year and also living together and marriage the most important thing though when it comes to discussion on rpw is how likely it is that a relationship will lead to marriage i am sure plenty of people meet men that they date through tinder how many of these relationships last longer than 1 year how many lead to marriage how many have rp dynamics ,1,RedPillWives
camille11325, surely then it will be more difficult to lock down any attractive guy who has tinder in the first place regardless of how you met him since the presence of options will make it so that he is less likely to commit to any one option at all yes and the only way you will be able to lock most of these men down is by giving away your resources sex time attention etc disproportionately to his level of investment it just does not make sense for women interested in rpw you can get rmv5 men outside of tinder who are actually looking to settle down in the near future ,2,RedPillWives
camille11325, tbh i think the real motive of this thread is more like how do i get the hot dudes from tinder to commit and tinder is the place that will landslide the most options in attractive men favor making the odds of an ltr very low yes ,3,RedPillWives
camille11325,in america tinder has the reputation of being a place for flings and nsa sex it is not the most optimal route for most women in terms of getting a man and that is why we do not advocate it on this sub i also do not like it because it completely removes the romance from the dating process it is way less personal and i think it warps the way people think about dating and relationships also i think it one step removed from a website advertising escorts you are basically putting yourself out there saying you are dtf when you are on tinder it reduces many women to the sex that they can offer which really is all that some women can offer so it is fitting i suppose a woman with an rmv over 5 should be able to get an man without tinder so why even waste time with the app ,2,RedPillWives
camille11325,haha my result was actually not very accurate either i posted before i finished the test because it looked fun i am going to find a better quiz for the sub and share that ,1,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325, the red lip thing i can pull off in a very formal setting with a full face of makeup but anywhere else just looks weird and cheap imo i think it to do with my colouring being both very light and low contrast chucking a bright red lip on just makes it stand out in the wrong way makes sense i am the exact opposite very high contrast and i look so weird if i try to do a natural no makeup look when i get back from vacation i have two more posts about body typing systems that also will clarify a lot in terms of why some women can pull off certain styles looks and others cannot keep an eye out for it ,1,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325,okay checking pms ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,ooh yay i definitely recommend seeing someone in person be sure they are sci art trained and not other systems keep us posted ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,it hard to say just based on that but some places i would start looking soft summer bright clear spring and light summer if you know of any celebrities that have similar coloring to you that would be helpful ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,yep bright winters can have dark eyes but they would be super intensely dark if you can pull off blonde highlights i am not sure what that says about your bw status highlights reduce the contrast between your features and bws and winters in general are all about contrast the site i am about to link to i am not sure if it officially uses the sci art system but it is a very good introductory site that could help you figure out where you belong this is their page on winters http www thechicfashionista com winter color analysis html and here is their page on summers http www thechicfashionista com summer color analysis html maybe you are a deep dark winter since that contrast level is medium high ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,awesome d,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,the dark winter palette is not actually brown though it just has more brown in the shades not sure how to explain here is dw https s media cache ak0 pinimg com 564x 4c 72 0f 4c720f41e159ee67c1b511909063475b jpg here is bw https 1 bp blogspot com kzzgu dy4a4 vvk30h2vq2i aaaaaaaaen0 q8uf6vfgqgyzxwspwbfkovrianhipxx8q s400 bright 2bwinter jpg see what i mean if you wear some of the brighter and bolder colours of the dw palette you will definitely pop did you read the blog post i linked about the 4 subcategories within each season you should figure yours out also to clarify it not that it impossible to pull off other seasons it just depends on where you start and which season you are trying to become for many you could dye your hair tan and change your makeup look and successfully pass people do this all the time but i feel like it would be really hard to go from dw to bw especially considering your coloring from both personal experience and what i have read over the years studying sca when you embrace your palette and find the shades and combinations that you enjoy you look your absolute best even if it looks boring or in my case intimidating just try it on and see if dw does not end up fitting maybe you are a bright spring https 4 bp blogspot com ggom9jtbsa4 vvk3 fz9iei aaaaaaaaen4 9qmvoutxqwmmttkz8h3c9b gafv1je dw s1600 bright 2bspring jpg after all which is the closest to bw and could explain why you are drawn to it you would know better than i would photos are useful but seeing colors react to your skin in real life is the absolute best way to figure out your season ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,this week theme is perfect timing because m and i are taking a much needed vacation starting tomorrow i will definitely pack some sexy lingiere ,6,RedPillWives
camille11325,thank you i am a clear winter too and only just now getting into bright red lipstick it so fun if you have not already definitely read the makeup guide for winters that i linked it was a total game changer for me it really alters the way you approach makeup application ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,it might just be the lighting but you read more neutral cool to me either way your dominant feature is definitely deep and you seem to be on the higher end of medium contrast both dark autumn and dark winter are medium high in chroma let assume you are right and it just a lighting issue so you are neutral warm also putting you in the dark deep autumn camp since you are drawn to the softer shades maybe that is also indicative of your autumn status here is the deep autumn palette https s media cache ak0 pinimg com 564x 33 f8 34 33f83475c54245723e9884909d47fca8 jpg what do you think there is definitely something really subdued about you at least in these photos if you were to go to a consultant in real life she would drape different colours over you to see which ones look best take another look at the clothes you have and see which shades make you look the best ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,you are welcome so glad it was helpful ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,nope each type has distinct hair eye and skin traits and it affects the types of clothes you can wear not just the colours but the textures and level of detail when people dye their hair to a shade within their palette they still look great but if they go outside of their palette they often have to do tons more work to look normal from what i have been reading dark winter has a lot of brown in it that bright winter just does not have your pictures definitely confirm this i have a darker skintone than you do but you seem browner and i am bw another big part of bw is the eyes i am not sure how that could be replicated by a non clear type why do you want to change ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,of course ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,haha is not it so great enjoy ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,excellent tip did you read the article i linked about why there are only 12 seasons in the sci art system i am curious to hear your thoughts ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,you are welcome and wow that so cool that your wardrobe matches your season already ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,in the sci art system there is no deep clear warm category because that is not something that is found in nature other systems have other combinations and categories that go beyond the 12 systems but i trust sci art the most and included a great article about why 12 is the best number of categories there are two options that you have to consider here are you sure you are clear based on what you have shared that the first one i would question what makes you think you are clear and not soft how does your skin react not only to high chroma colors but to pure black and pure white if you feel like you are medium chroma with neutral warm undertones you may be a deep autumn does that palette match you well i would also question if you are actually deep and not light while your actual colors are the easiest way to determine your season a large part of it is looking at how fabric colors react with your coloring i am not a professional by any means but i have read enough blog posts and forum conversations to see multiple cases of women who look so different than the standard type if you are light clear and warm that would put you in the spring category since we know that warm is not your dominant characteristic you would most likely be bright clear spring if none of that helps u onacasserole gave a great tip in her comment about seeing how the yellows look on you keep us posted ,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,wanted to add while i and a handful of other women know and understand exactly what you are talking about in your post a lot of the girls have no clue and need to be introduced to the ideas if you just throw it at them they shut down and reject it ,3,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325,are you sure you are not allergic to an ingredient maybe a type of fragrance preservative dye colour or some other common addition to a lot of formulas i would recommend brands like jane iredale 100 pure w3ll people rms beauty zuzuluxe gabriel cosmetics etc they are very mindful about ingredients and their products perfect for women with sensitive skin ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,if it a surprise i would stick to black just to be on the safe side my style is very romantic in general and black lace really amps up the sense of drama my go to casual date look is black lace top skinny jeans strappy black heeled sandals if it will be more formal i would wear a bodycon fitted lbd my favourite at the moment is black lace all over and the runner up has a deep plunging neckline and i would wear the same strappy black heels ,2,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325,all we have to go by is what you tell us your initial post gave the worst possible description of your man to the point where users went into you go girl mode and cheered on the idea of you dropping him like he was a useless weight please take responsibility not only for your initial misrepresentation of the situation but for your role in the problems you are facing currently if you need help identifying your role and the possible solutions just let us know it why we are here lol,9,RedPillWives
camille11325,i do not think the images that he chose should be ignored but if that helps you understand the point then okay the women could have chosen better products to achieve the dramatic look they were going for the colour choices were not the most optimal and he picked up on that without any sort of formal training or experience he showed two extremes to make his point clear although again the women were wearing the same amount of makeup i said this in another comment but to modernize the examples think about the instagram yt beauty guru looks that are popular today the trends that many women love end up looking fake and unflattering when worn on an every day basis this is because they are applying the wrong products and techniques for their features even gurus who have mastered the techniques often look jarring when you see them in real life http femi coach com wp content uploads 2016 08 zgimpowane2 copy 1 768x1024 jpg this is the point he making ,4,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,yes i agree women do not always know how to best appeal to men many women who are into makeup would not see anything wrong with the looks on the left but to the men and many women you would interact with on an everyday basis the looks on the left seem fake these makeup looks are dated but the same could be said about the popular instagram style makeup looks women within that subculture love them but to outside observers especially men it looks fake and unflattering ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,no they are not before and after they are photos from different events this is an older post so the makeup is dated but that is not the point of the article the point is that a skillful application of makeup is the best way to go there are much better colour choices that the women could have picked the images on the left look more jarring than the ones on the right because they did not select products and techniques that harmonise with how they look there are women who do this every day and look even more out of place and fake because they are not on a red carpet it appears fake to men and to many other women he was speaking as a man and not speaking as a makeup enthusiast ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,looking forward to seeing the op response to your comment ,2,RedPillWives
camille11325,looking forward to seeing the op response to your comment ,4,RedPillWives
camille11325,yes ,3,RedPillWives
camille11325, you are not a wife you are a provider for the lifestyle to which he has become accustomed and has no intention of changing this x 1000 ,5,RedPillWives
camille11325, you can do much better and there are tons of men who are better suited for you out there do we really know this though most people date their rmv equivalents this might be the best she can do he may even be out of her league she did a great job giving a negative picture of her man but does not seem to acknowledge her role ,5,RedPillWives
camille11325, i guess what i am saying is your post paints him as all bad and it hard to see why you are with him so what are you leaving out here yes ,7,RedPillWives
camille11325,i agree that she is not a plate but she certainly is not his wife the idea that she would want kids from a man who is not legally bound to her is baffling she is assuming so much risk and she already has more on her plate than she wants i do not think anyone here has really asked the op the right questions to get a better sense of her situation there are always multiple possibilities and solutions it not just silently put up with it or leave him asap i also think people are applying their own standards and boundaries to their interpretation of this relationship and not considering that the op and her boyfriend may require something different ,10,RedPillWives
camille11325,thank you for this comment you are bringing up excellent questions for the op ,6,RedPillWives
camille11325,the op description of her man cannot just be assumed to be 100 accurate calling him a child repeatedly is disrespectful and only encourages her belief that she should change him manage him in some way ,4,RedPillWives
camille11325, if you do not want to do the majority of work for a man who wants to as little as possible do not complain when the inevitable consequences of your poor choices plays out exactly ,3,RedPillWives
camille11325,she agreed to this dynamic and has been doing 80 for years why would her man suddenly want something different just because she does she does not seem to understand her role in the situation and is blaming everything on him it not feminism fault she made bad decisions and she is not a patient saint for them ,7,RedPillWives
camille11325,let not encourage women bashing the sos of other women she has been with him for years and presumably wants to stay with him remarks like this only encourage a disrespectful mindset and make it harder for the op to realise her role in her situation ,9,RedPillWives
camille11325,let not encourage women bashing the sos of other women she has been with him for years and presumably wants to stay with him remarks like this only encourage a disrespectful mindset and make it harder for the op to realise her role in her situation ,2,RedPillWives
camille11325,let not encourage women bashing the sos of other women she has been with him for years and presumably wants to stay with him remarks like this only encourage a disrespectful mindset and make it harder for the op to realise her role in her situation ,5,RedPillWives
camille11325,bashing another member so is not okay you are contributing to a mindset of disrespect within the op a woman who is not seeking an rpw solution to her situation she signed up for this relationship and has contributed to this dynamic for years she is not a victim and she is not infinitely better than her man just because she wants something different than he does we should be questioning her judgement calling her out for wanting to change her man pointing out her errors in general and identifying multiple solutions instead of just leaving you are just taking her at her word and immediately assuming she is in the right and he is in the wrong if the differences truly are irreconcilable and she cannot continue committing to a man who she claims she loves and wants to spend the rest of her life with then okay but you can suggest that the op move on from the relationship without tearing her man down and inflating her ego ,9,RedPillWives
camille11325,i posted the rules revisited link to the sub and added these thoughts https www reddit com r femininenotfeminist comments 5tu0do how to avoid looking fake ddozcan wanted to give you more context to the post basically skilled application of products is what matters and you cannot fixate on the number ,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,such a great post two things i want to add in the before and after photos the women are wearing the same amount of makeup the choices are better and therefore the women look better x number of products is not automatically bad but people notice when you have used a lot of makeup poorly he talks about this in a followup post but i wanted to make sure that everyone here noticed the reason that the women do not look as good is because the makeup does not harmonise with their features so it is jarring it is possible for them to wear dramatic looks but not in the way that they did in those photos he has an anti plastic surgery slant to this post that i do not share at all plenty of women get work done without anyone even noticing it similar to the point i just made about makeup two women can have the same procedure done but one can look natural and the other can look fake it all about the choices made leading up to the surgery ,6,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i have learned that things that seem unnatural when described can actually appear natural when you actually have it on your face and at the moment it looks unbalanced which is not ideal if you are going for a natural look if you did something like tightlining an extra coat of mascara and a subtle light brown in the crease your eyes would look enhanced but anyone looking at you would not be able to pick out why as for bronzing or contouring light contouring would keep you looking natural bronzing would make you look more tan so it up to you some people can use bronzer as contour so maybe you will be able to pull that off all the step requires is a light dusting along your hair line 7 seconds at the most there no magic number that defines the ideal amount of products one should use on a daily basis i use quite more than you do every time i do my makeup because i do what it takes to get the results that i want here is a great post that talks about makeup effort and not looking fake http www therulesrevisited com 2012 05 how to avoid looking fake html hope all of this was helpful 3,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,omg i wish thank goodness it on netflix it one of the shows i have on rotation for when i am cleaning cooking doing makeup or styling my hair other shows include sex and the city lipstick jungle revenge and it always sunny in philadelphia not beauty related i know but always hilarious ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,yes i do cream eye shadow on my lids immediately following brows for this exact reason so great to hear that you do it too it too easy to fixate on your flaws and get caught up in things that others do not notice as much as you do ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,you look like such a sweet genuine person your makeup look really allows your character to radiate even in photos ,6,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,sorry i know i am super late some cc more eye shadow liner mascara on your eyelids upper lashline it looks unbalanced at the moment it possible that the camera just is not picking up the product but it something to consider you could also amp up the intensity on your blush and lip product just a little bit it would really enhance your features do you have any contouring or bronzing products it would minimize your forehead if you dusted something subtle along your hairline that it from me love the updo so jealous that you can pull it off ,5,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,you know i have always heard tati mention it but i never actually thought to watch it haha if i ever do i will let you know if it any good the concept of revenge body sounds like fun and khloe has done an excellent job reinventing her image going by the magazine covers and headlines i catch glimpses of lol so it makes sense that she would host something like that thank you ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,ooh i love korean shows so i will definitely check those out i have never heard of revenge body but i am always looking for fun light shows to watch while cleaning the house and doing hair and makeup that one might be good for that thanks for the suggestions i totally agree reboots would be amazing ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,haha yes those shows did not age well there really was a golden age for beauty makeover shows and we did not even know it at the time i guess youtube and instagram have taken the place of those shows but it not the same ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i am a big fan of local boutiques and department stores you get personal attention at both and there are a variety of brands and styles available did you know that you can have a free consultation at most department stores you can tell the stylist what you are looking for and your budget and they will pick things out for you and you can try them on and get immediate feedback since mall stores have more focused aesthetics it would be helpful to know more about your style jeans and a top could mean this https s media cache ak0 pinimg com 564x 4d 95 99 4d9599b060093d78ab16cc40f680756d jpg this https s media cache ak0 pinimg com 564x 6a c2 23 6ac223516fdd91df9acb7eba33960ec7 jpg or this https s media cache ak0 pinimg com 564x a7 70 bc a770bcc56c3f64575fa479286f82eeb8 jpg of course there are even more examples of jeans tops but hopefully you get what i mean ,4,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i mentioned this in a different thread but i always start my makeup application by doing my brows and if i am wearing a bolder lipstick that becomes the first step before brows when i paint i make sure to put my darkest dark somewhere on the canvas to ensure that i do not accidentally make things that are supposed to be of medium value too dark similarly when you apply your brows and or dark lipstick first it prevents you from going too heavy with eyeshadow blush and other products it also takes focus away from imperfections and reduces the likelihood that you will overdo it with foundation and concealer ,10,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,this is wonderful i will be making a wiki page in the near future to spotlight the wonderful original content that fnf members create this post will totally be featured i think that while youth is glorified in the mainstream it is often women 30 50 who are hailed as beauty icons in magazines and in pop culture in general a lot of aging celebrities are clinging to their status and we see their pr teams working overtime to perpetuate the brand of these older women as the ultimate ideal an example of this would be the various hottest women in america lists that show up yearly in magazines there is rarely a celebrity under 25 listed i am saying all of this not to say that women over 30 cannot be beautiful or sexually attractive but to say that a lot of women under 30 are taught that they need to aspire to look like whichever older woman is currently popular there is this weird thing happening where the older trendsetters are trying to look younger and the young women copy these older women even though they have exactly what these stars are after it kind of similar to how women copy drag queens when applying makeup when all drag techniques are designed to make male faces look more feminine i love the advice that you have given in this post and hope that it is helpful for the younger women reading i am 22 myself and love that i can experiment and have fun with my looks in a way that 14 year olds and 60 year old women cannot we should all definitely make the most of this time ,6,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,so glad you like it too ,2,RedPillWives

camille11325,i have tried whitening my teeth with activated charcoal and it didnt work at all i do enjoy using charcoal to help sober up when the situation calls for it oil pulling with coconut oil was a great way for me to naturally lift some of the stains on my teeth 10 minutes a day 3 days in a row slightly lighter i am so inconsistent with it so i am not sure how dramatic the effects would be if i did it for more time ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325, things i would be okay with my daughter getting under 13 mani pedis earrings earlobes only massages using moisturising and nourshing skincare products at home shaving if necessary things i would be okay with between 14 and 17 all of the above plus facials teeth whitening and more serious skincare if necessary things i am totally fine with between 18 and 22 other spa treatments not botox body contouring nose jobs boob jobs laser hair removal things i would advise her to wait until after 22 plastic surgery such as altering facial bone structure botox products with growth factors veneers and other more invasive and permanent things i would never want my daughter to have tattoos of any kind or piercings outside of the 2 on her ears that she will get as a baby ,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,she is one of my guilty pleasures her foundation is often wayy too dark she dresses like an escort she copies the kardashians and jenners her contour does not always look great especially when she is not controlling the images she is annoyingly vegetarian and her vlogs are not always the most interesting but i love her haha ,9,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325,maybe because her look is dated the techniques themselves are solid but the look she creates is definitely not on trend this is an older video though so it to be expected hope you can apply some of the tips in the future ,2,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325,you are welcome and yes please ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,of course ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,well thank you just so you know this is a ladies only community and we are going to be enforcing this so glad you are excited we are too feel free to read but i am going to have to ask that you do not participate in any of the discussions or post to the sub separate spaces for both genders is a tradition that needs to come back men need a space to be men and we need our space to be women this is not personal at all but i will be removing this post we cannot start making exceptions before the sub is even off the ground you know i wish you the best of luck with your love life ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,great questions i wear a full face of makeup every time i do my makeup almost every possible category from primer to setting spray with the exception of bronzing and contouring products i also do not wear false lashes on a regular basis due to having long curled lashes naturally i think the word that most youtube gurus would use is natural glam it is not casual or subtle but it not avant garde creative or even formal my features are enhanced and it clear that i am wearing makeup i look polished but flirty at the same time m does not know anything about makeup but he gives me feedback if i try something new he likes cat eyes smokey eyes and red lipstick so i definitely do these when i want to look sexy for him he likes my everyday makeup as well it just is not as arousing which is the point lol not trying to attract people when i am out and about i wear makeup to look more attractive to myself my man and others in general i also really enjoy the process of applying it and have fun researching new products and techniques i am always in search of hg products for every category i do not care about having a full varied makeup wardrobe i would rather have one perfect product for each thing that i need i am not a fan of minimalism at all so do not think that this is about having the bare minimum i just want to have exactly what i want and no less in terms of techniques i definitely want to keep growing in my skills and really maximise each feature on my face i want to look as close to perfect as possible ,6,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,yay i would definitely never want to shave again never wear pants i am close to that already but i do love skinny jeans white skinny pants gain an inch of boobs please free skincare and i would drench myself in the la prarie skin caviar cream every day haha i would lose manicures in a heartbeat i am so obsessed w lipstick at the moment bullet lipsticks are so amazing you guys alright here is a q that i stole from google haha would you rather chop off all your hair or never be able to cut it again ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,good to know about the ysl concealer it was on my list but i have been on the fence about it the bobbi brown retouching wand looks really cool and i keep hearing great things about it i will probably end up getting that one maybe you will like it too ,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,ooh eyebrow pomade intimidates me haha which one do you use did it take a while to master or is it actually fairly easy to get defined but natural looking brows ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,which geurlain primer i am lusting after the meteorites base atm hopefully you love it also welcome to the sub it would be so cool if you wrote a post sharing your experiences and tips that you picked up as an mua ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,this is totally because i paint but i always do my brows and then one coat of mascara first because it like establishing my darkest dark and i can use it as a guide when doing the rest of my look it prevents me from going too intense with my eyeshadow because i have a reference point w the black colours already on my face also when wearing a bold lip i apply that prior to doing my blush and eye look the same principle applies if i am wearing a bold lip i do not want the rest of my face to compete when i have it done first i can make sure everything else complements it also i find that when i put on the darkest things first it makes the imperfections on my face less noticeable and i do not go overboard with foundation and concealer ,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i never reapply sunscreen when wearing makeup honestly i think reddit obsesses about sunscreen a little too much i wear a physical spf 50 daily and do not feel like anything more is necessary unless you are constantly in the sun all day i do not see why you would need to reapply ,5,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,what part of blending are you having trouble with are you using the right tools the right consistencies formulas are they in the right order are you using the right colours are you placing things correctly are you using enough product or possibly too much are you using a lot of pressure or perhaps not enough when it came to face makeup i found that completely ignoring the trends and getting a bright berry raspberry shade and wearing it all over my cheeks was the way to go as you know i am a big fan of using your features to determine beauty decisions understanding your seasonal color will help you determine the right shade because it not just about the hue i will post links to guides for all seasons tomorrow ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,thanks glad to you know someone liked it haha ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,awesome i have actually never been to or used mac but i have heard tons of great things about it i totally get what you mean about sephora being overwhelming but i love the chaos and energy haha,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,that awesome that you found the right shade i struggled a bit too before i realised i had olive undertones the wrong undertone can really make your skin look weird and unnatural ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,they are for sure i have olive undertones and love the brand ,2,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325,lol yes it been hilarious to watch ,6,The_Donald
camille11325,updates last week i made sure to be extra gofl y and it was great we share silly moments like a pillow fight dancing to 80s music and i even planned a romantic bath date where we watched narcos drank wine and vaped such a fun time and i am looking forward to going above and beyond this week i am currently out with m right now on phone so i will look for a opportunity to praise him publicly since we will be together all day ,5,RedPillWives
camille11325,this was made in 2013 so a few of things things are more popular today but this video is still a really good resource even some of the suggestions that seem weird or like they wo not have any effect really do make a difference she uses really dark colours to show the techniques but if you use soft browns or other light colours it looks awesome and not so obvious i do this myself ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,you are welcome and i agree completely ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,yay welcome ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,there are a few other style and body typing systems that i plan on writing about as time goes on they all rely on using you actual features to determine what you should wear but there are definite categories that make it easier to know what to do a lot of modern style guides start by having women figure out their tastes but knowing your preferred aesthetic understanding how to pick garments that will compliment you this is why i like the older systems that actually teach you why something looks good on you you can apply the knowledge from this post to any style keep an eye out for those future posts ,4,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,haha is not it so cool how certain techniques have been around for ages my routine is similar too ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,of course and yes it was but so worth it i am so glad everyone is enjoying the new sub ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,okay so i wo not be getting into this system until a future post but you are totally a gamine that is for a different system but this is why it harder for you to find your types just from my summary here my opinion and anyone else feel free to disagree body lines straight vertical body type skeletal but not extremely so possibly skeletal muscular face lines i see diagonal and horizontal lines on the inside vertical for the perimeter facial features eyes and nose are large mouth is small but long cheeks and forehead also large but chin is small this is totally part of the gamine look your features seem pointy if that makes sense since you have both large and small features and also large and close together spacing you can do a lot with prints complexity i would have to see you but you seem med high to high just from the photos texture medium ,4,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325,definitely not when you match your appearance to your demeanor personality vibe essence you look your best it would not balance you out to dress more simply it would make you look tired uncomfortable or some other unwanted thing i was so worried when i started adopting things from all the wardrobe resources that i was reading i am a bright winter theatrical romantic type 1 mix of vertical curved straight lines skeletal molded high complexity med texture those are all very bold animated types i will be writing about those other systems in the future for sure when i put on a bright pink floral dress and did more intense makeup to match my high contrast colouring and also styled my hair in big bombshell curls i was so self conscious i thought i looked like a prostitute lol but when i took a step back i realised that i had reached a level of visual harmony that i was not before everything just worked so well together and i felt energized m loved it of course and when i go out dressed entirely like all my types i am my most confident and radiant self in the tube my lipstick was intimidating but on my lips it looked amazing on the hanger the dress looked overwhelming but on my body it looked perfectly natural the more i embrace all my various types the more amazing i feel i think you will experience the same esp if you put together different systems you can improve yourself without losing your essence edit changed texture type as i remembered the category lol,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,always loved this article i have read a lot of bret website have done strong curves multiple times and have watched his yt channel he really understands women so glad he is creating resources for women who do not want to look like fitness models or men yes there are guides in magazines but often they are not as well researched and some things do not even work this article is definitely one to bookmark if it the aesthetic you are after ,5,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,actually yes have you ever read heard about couples where the wife scrambles to keep things clean and stretches herself thin trying to make everything perfect but all the man really wants to do is have her sitting next to him now i am reminding myself of mary martha but thats not necessarily a bad thing lol a lot of times we add on all these extra standards that while our men do appreciate they also would be fine with the more basic version one example is cooking dinner plenty of women go all out with ingredients techniques variety etc and plenty of men would be fine eating the same 4 meals on rotation does not mean that he does not enjoy or appreciate the extra effort just that it is not central to why he has you in his life sometimes women lose sight of their purpose as a companion to men ,9,RedPillWives

camille11325, i find that his workouts put me off and seem really unsustainable in that there are lots of new exercises being implemented often and all the time to get it right would probably add up and take far too long i have done strong curves multiple times and did not have this experience at all the very first time i did it i had zero weight room experience i was a dancer so that was my main means of exercise not only does he explain every exercise in the appendix it just takes a quick google search for any moves you are uncertain about and there are hundreds of videos showing you how to do it i did not find anything complicated or confusing just new and something to learn you do each phase for a month so you are going to do specific exercises at minimum once a week at maximum 2 times a week it took between 30 mins and 1 hour to do one of his workouts as i gained strength and did more reps the time increased i say give sc a chance it a really well made program ,3,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325,of course to respond to your qs about cultures i d have to know what communities these are are the people us white descended from the settlers first waves of immigrants us black ancestors came when us practised slavery or ethnically of european descent what religious affiliations christianity judaism atheism some other thing related to those 3 if what you re thinking of is not part of any of those groups i mentioned it is not part of what rpw officially deals with i may think of a group that i left out so that list isn t set in stone but you can get the idea of where our focus lies individual women can read and apply rpw stuff to their own personal lives but it is not written with them in mind nor are the ideas based on groups other than the ones that i listed what culture is this and what ages are these things applied to parents have the right to decide if their children can work or go to school up until 18 unless the child is emancipated and i also agree with the right of parents to enforce rules about sex and contraception with their children are adults forcing adult women to abide by these standards are there physical consequences or just social expectation and risk of ostracization i don t have enough information to speak to the situation that you describe but as a general rule i think that the us law should apply to all cultures equally everything that you listed being disallowed banned is legal so i disagree with adults literally forcing other adults to act in ways they don t want to i m all about free will and personal autonomy but cultural norms and traditions are not the same thing as force if people choose to go along with what others want due to a sense of obligation they may feel unhappy about it but it is their choice so i don t think the law comes into play and don t think the law should come into play in those sorts of situations i can t get into detail beyond this without knowing the culture because i do not believe that all cultures are equal and i have different feelings and thoughts on each one and their place within america keep in mind that culture ethnic group race individual i make judgements about values traditions norms practices etc and don t believe in cultural or moral relativism this does not mean that i believe that any individual people are intrinsically better than others i am talking about ideas and group actions not inherent value of a person feminism to me is not the mandate that women have to do both but rather that she has the choice to do either both or none here is a comment https np reddit com r muacjdiscussion comments 5rqsn9 red pill women made their own beauty sub lets ddbc8p8 i wrote to someone else in this comment section about the definition of feminism it s more than the idea of equality and choices for women also have you read anything by feminist thinkers or heard what even everyday feminists have said both now and in the past about female choice there are absolutely things that feminists don t believe that women should be able to choose many second wave thinkers didn t even want women to be able to choose being a sahm recently feminists have made it clear that you can t choose to be pro life anti abortion and also a feminist i totally get that you are saying that for you feminism is about choice and i am aware that other women also feel this way to be clear i am not saying that you agree with the women i mentioned earlier simply for being a feminist just brought that up to hear your thoughts my objections to feminism are not based on whether or not women are able to choose their own life path while still being under the feminist umbrella so if you want to be traditionalist or not that your choice and what would being traditionalist mean if one was feminist it is impossible to hold all of the traditionalist opinions and values and simultaneously hold feminist opinions and values many are mutually exclusive especially since a lot of feminism was developed as a rejection of traditional western values so what does this statement really mean if you take away the incompatible parts of the ideology and cultural practices what are you left with appearance music choices some relationships some life choices that don t affect anyone else this stripped down version is not an example of freedom it reminds me of how a lot of people on the left claim to want diversity when really they want everyone to think the same and only have variety when it comes to things that are inconsequential in the big picture example to leftists it is fine when black people listen to hip hop wear street fashion eat southern food use slang etc but if they deviate from the set of values that liberals hold in high esteem they are absolutely vilified not sure if you ve seen conservative black men called uncle toms and mediocre negros but this sort of policing also happens to women who deviate too far from the approved list of ideas so my question to you is how to you feel about these subcultures communities where women are not given a choice to think critically or where the choice to be traditionalist non traditionalist is not given do you think something should be done as i said earlier it depends on the culture as well as what you mean by not given a choice the education system in america absolutely needs work and i think if that were improved people would be better equipped to make their own decisions this would be done by returning power to the states and counties instead of having terrible federal curriculums outside of a few subcultures women in america actually do have a choice and while all paths are not easy they can still go their own way and design the life they want i think that restoring a lot of power to the local level would incentivise community organizations churches and charities to be more involved and these groups could be a good resource for young women as well some people are born into shitty situations but almost all of them don t have to stay there there is no perfect solution though and i personally am not a fan of the government legislating so many aspects of our lives how does rpw deal with homosexuality bisexualism trans issues etc rpw is focused on heterosexual relationships between biological men and biological women who identify and present as their natural sex and gender we don t really talk about things outside of this scope because it is outside of the purpose of the community i do know that there are a few bisexual women who use the information on the sub and a few poly people as well there are many aspects of rp that are descriptive about human nature gender dynamics and the sexual market place this information could be useful for anyone regardless of how they identify i have no idea how useful information for straight women on how to appeal to straight men could be used by gay people or trans and i don t particularly care about the subject so it s not something i plan on investigating myself if your son were to tell you he was homosexual therefore making it basically impossible for him to form a traditional family how would you react i would be upset and give him resources about traditional catholic men who are homosexual but choose not to pursue a gay lifestyle if that failed i would hope that he was as awesome as milo yiannopoulos and i d encourage it i would not support him if he also decided he was a leftist same if your daughter was a lesbian if she is not out trying to get a guy at the top of his window then how would the rpw community and yourself deal with this the same thing applies traditional catholic route as first attempt then i d just encourage and support avoiding leftist and gay culture the rpw community has nothing to say on the subject this is my personal opinion and other members have their own personal opinions many of the rpw members are totally fine with gay ppl so they ll be more accepting than me i m sure i wrote in another comment why we don t allow trans women the main reason is because it would disrupt the cohesion of the community here are the points i brought up women who otherwise value honest constructive criticism and feedback feel compelled to praise trans women for average or even subpar makeup looks hairstyles fashion choices etc women who believe that trans women are not actually women would get into arguments both with trans women and with women who do believe that trans women should be treated as women content about how to pass as feminine is different than content for biological females who want to express themselves and celebrate their natural femininity we want to have a community and so that means members should be able to get along and get to know each other we want to share what is going on in our lives and experiences we have had in the past trans women do not have the same set of shared female experiences that enable us to bond easier with unknown women what is the thing that you enjoy the most about your relationships that comes from your lifestyle what is the thing from your relationships in this style that aggravates you the most it s not a lifestyle i am just being myself i never had to unlearn bad ideas to adopt rp ones i naturally am a traditionally feminine woman who is attracted to masculine men and thrives in a traditional dynamic the thing that i most enjoy about my relationship is that i am with someone who understands me and loves me completely if you were looking for something more unique to rpws i d say that i enjoy the perks of being in the traditionally female role things paid for me doors opened etc nothing aggravates me about my relationship or my dynamic i wouldn t choose to do something that wasn t fulfilling for me ,2,muacjdiscussion
camille11325, we in my last comment actually referred to rpwives not the fnf community that post was originally submitted to the old sub and had far more than 23 upvotes but when we left the trp network we the mods deleted all of our posts from that sub i have since resubmitted a lot of what i wrote back then people on the subreddit link the post and use the term in conversations weekly it is not a term that i came up with another mod coined it years ago and we have all been fleshing out ideas since then i just wrote up a summary for new girls which is why it used to be called rpw 101 while my personal opinion is in the post it is a summary of one of the basic ideas that the subreddit is founded on women who join rpw are introduced to the subject and everyone who chooses to stay embraces the idea we have a set of concepts terms and theories that we agree is the definition of rpw hashing out and developing what rpw means is also part of participating on the subreddit women write posts and comments about their experiences and thought processes we talk in the irc the main people involved in creating content have known each other for years i am not sure why you do not seem to think that i or anyone else who has been with rpw for as long as i have longer does not know what we think ,2,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,there a difference between traditional relationship dynamics and sexual dominance and submission and i do think it different in terms of human nature we believe in psychological femininity https np reddit com r redpillwives comments 4f9pjl psychological femininity and often use the analogy captain and first mate to describe how most rpw relationships run yes fnf launched on wednesday it is young and growing so quickly a lot of the women who are on fnf are from r redpillwives so i know what those women think because i have been speaking to them anywhere from 1 month to 3 years both on reddit and on irc and we have discussed how we define femininity how do you know what the majority of women in r femininenotfeminist think about traditional western vs traditional protestant femininity they do not have to think about it in those terms to have a definition of femininity that is in line with the traditional western version although many women do use the phrase traditional western when describing their values i am actually working on some oc now that explores different definitions of femininity within the us over time and how the definitions affected the culture and vice versa i did read the discussion threads and i do not recall that being discussed so i am not sure where you get your expertise about the dominant views of the community in addition to what i said above many women submitted a survey that gave additional insight into their beliefs on femininity also it is possible to look at the words people use when talking about femininity or things related to femininity and infer which definition people will align with ,5,muacjdiscussion

camille11325, in general men seem to prefer bmis between 18 and 22 the fat to muscle ratio and the way your fat is distributed are both important factors that could mean that you look good with a bmi over 22 if you have a dramatic hourglass figure or are muscular you are going to weigh more than average women at your height waist hip ratio is also key if you have a bmi of 19 but a whr of 73 you are not going to look as feminine as someone with a bmi of 24 and a whr of 65 if your whr is naturally higher shapewear and dressing to enhance curves would make you look more hourglass also cosmetic surgery is becoming more accessible and advanced every year as far as fashion goes i am a big proponent of clothes that are both slimming and curve enhancing the specific type of clothing that will have this effect on each body type is different though i am not sure how many things are universal not even wrap dresses ,3,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325,yes i can sorry for the delay today was hectic and i ve had your message up but kept opening new windows and tabs lol i m not the most organised person there are two sides of rpw the descriptive and the prescriptive on the descriptive side we look at male and female nature in the abstract the mindsets and behaviours of men and women throughout history today the sexual marketplace the way that the culture is changing surrounding women s roles the significance of marriage and we look at the consequences both positive and negative of feminism in the west the prescriptive side of rpw is about applying the conclusions and theories based on your unique romantic situation we stress personal responsibility and accountability and focusing on what is directly under your control your thoughts actions environment etc since rpw is about female sexual strategy we stress efficient and effective choices that get you from your current status to the goal a harmonious marriage i go into great detail about female sexual strategy here https np reddit com r redpillwives comments 5hz4md female sexual strategy and here https np reddit com r redpillwives wiki about is a wiki page i wrote that gives a summary of some of the descriptive and prescriptive concepts we focus on women come to rpw for different reasons some need to work on themselves and be less controlling nagging shrewish or aggressive within their marriages others have husbands that they don t get along with or are not attracted to but they want to save their marriage there are a number of single women eager marry but unsure of how to obtain the relationship they want in the modern dating world and of course there are women who live rpw ideas every day and want to help others and discuss culture and current events we all believe in the three basic components of the prescriptive side of rpw girl game traditional dynamics and good character in terms of the anti feminism element of rpw we disagree with the first premises of feminism and therefore the entire ideology this doesn t mean that individual users don t believe in things like female education voting rights property rights etc we reject the idea that these positions are unique to feminism and also disagree with the feminist description of women s oppression throughout us history a number of us would also argue that patriarchy is synonymous with civilization and it is not the boogeyman that feminists make it out to be i ve been sharing a chart that contrasts two different views of human nature http www nku edu gartigw teaching files weaver 20ch 2012 20handout 20 20constrained 20versus 20unconstrained 20visions pdf and this really is at the heart of our disagreement with leftism as a whole hopefully this the three links i share are helpful let me know if you have any more questions ,2,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,sorry for the delay in my response i had your comment and a few others open in a different window and didn t realise until now feminism is the the advocacy of women rights on the basis of the equality of the sexes period this is a good summary of the underlying mission of all the various waves and subsections of feminist thought it is not the totality of what it means to be a feminist however because there are beliefs that you have to hold in order to agree with the succinct statement that you gave for example you have to agree that there is a such thing as women s rights you have to agree with the concept of changing laws to advance the socio cultural status of women you have to believe in the idea of equality of the sexes you d have to believe that the sexes are currently unequal and that historically women were oppressed one of the most fundamental things that you also have to have in order to be a feminist is an unconstrained vision of humanity this chart explains the difference between constrained and unconstrained visions http www nku edu gartigw teaching files weaver 20ch 2012 20handout 20 20constrained 20versus 20unconstrained 20visions pdf one small statement has so much behind it the definition itself does not prove a monopoly but any person striving for equality between humans is therefore a feminist your definition of feminism is not the same thing as equal application of the law for both genders a feminist could believe in what i said and those who are against feminism can also support this idea i know for a fact that i have a different idea of what equal application means and we d also disagree about what the law should be notice that my statement talks about equality in terms of the system not equality of people i believe that us citizens should receive just treatment since our tax dollars fund the legal system anyone can hold this belief without also having feminist values this is what i mean when i say that feminism does not have a monopoly on the idea of fair treatment under the law i agree that any person striving for equality is in the leftist camp and likely a feminist even if they don t use that label i disagree that wanting a fair justice system striving for equality because you be unequal economically culturally socially politically and in all other spheres but still get the same treatment in court or when dealing with any other arm of the government hierarchy struggle and competition are all part of nature and part of human nature the genders are different and therefore not equal we have different strengths weaknesses tendencies and shared experiences and i think this is awesome i don t believe that any one group is inherently better than anyone else but that doesn t mean i think everyone is the same to me and many many people to not consider yourself a feminist is backwards or just plain confusing i understand why you all feel this way alternative systems of thought are not really taught in school or easily accessible although i often use the term anti feminist as a quick way to describe some of my beliefs those of us who oppose feminism don t just have an ideological system that rejects feminism my values are not just an inversion of feminist values as an analogy being atheist doesn t mean that the only thing you believe is not god and it does not mean that you celebrate things christians consider evil like robbery murder etc you could have any number of opinions on the nature of reality the meaning of life or lack of meaning morality etc you could use other labels in addition such as materialist but that requires more explanation and everyone has an idea of what atheist means i personally have one foot in the traditional catholic camp and one foot in the objectivist camp i think both are well thought out sound theories that fully explain everything objectivism of course requires that there is no god and i do not think it is possible to disprove the existence of god so i do not reject traditional catholic ideas think aristotle aquinas augustine both are full schools of thought with hundreds of thousands of words written by brilliant minds moving away from the philosophical large scale aspect of things on the everyday level things are often presented as a binary between the feminist position and a conservative protestant position eg sex negative vs sex positive leaves out a whole range of opinions one can have on sex similarly i often see people act like you can either support feminism and therefore want women in the workforce or oppose feminism and therefore want all women to be homemakers another example you can either support feminism and women s right to vote or you oppose feminism and hate women having political opinions what if you disagree with the current election process entirely what if you have ideas about alternate ways that people can express their political positions without voting what if you want restrictions on voting based on something other than merely being 18 years old these false dichotomies limit people s ability to explore other ways of looking at the world it is also completely possible therefore to be a feminist that disagrees with many leanings the movement may entail without labeling yourself anti feminist i agree with this it just doesn t apply to me it does apply to some women who are active in rpwives and fnf even if by definition being a feminist and rp are mutually exclusive ,3,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,i have no idea if you have even ready my comment or not but i just wanted to let you know that i edited it to add an additional thought that i had did not want you to miss it ,1,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,hey sorry i m just responding to you now i ve had so many tabs and windows open today some messages slipped through the cracks what made you feel existing subs were not doing it for you is it because you want to be able to digress into discussions of what feminine is i ve been reading the various makeup subs on reddit for years they have consistently great content interesting questions and entertaining discussion the few times i ve participated on posts that specifically asked for a range of opinions i received hostile comments downvotes and insulting pms i specifically don t share my opinion much on main reddit subs to avoid these situations because i generally seek to avoid conflict but when there is an interesting question that asks to hear all sides i thought i could try it out i decided to turn fnf into a community for beauty because other women reached out to me and asked me to they received the same treatment and some had it even worse i ve seen screenshots of harassment on fb by members of muacjdiscussion towards one of the other fnf mods the benefits of this new sub are not having to read circlejerks against trump conservatives women with traditional values women who want to be attractive specifically for men etc not having to apologise for disagreeing go out of our way to not offend someone over explain or hold back not having to read posts and comment sections that we disagree with but know we can t actually participate in successfully the ability to discuss the problems and situations that we have that are unique to being a woman who is traditional anti feminist and or conservative the ability to celebrate traditional western ideas of femininity and beauty without being insulted mocked harrassed or looked down on i could go on would you welcome trans women for example if they were traditional in their look i wrote in another comment why we don t allow trans women the main reason is because it would disrupt the cohesion of the community here are the points i brought up women who otherwise value honest constructive criticism and feedback feel compelled to praise trans women for average or even subpar makeup looks hairstyles fashion choices etc women who believe that trans women are not actually women would get into arguments both with trans women and with women who do believe that trans women should be treated as women content about how to pass as feminine is different than content for biological females who want to express themselves and celebrate their natural femininity we want to have a community and so that means members should be able to get along and get to know each other we want to share what is going on in our lives and experiences we have had in the past trans women do not have the same set of shared female experiences that enable us to bond easier with unknown women now nothing is stopping a conservative trans woman who passes from being an active member of the community we d never know but i think enforcing a female space is important there are many communities on reddit for trans women already radical feminists i am not one believe femininity is a performance in the female eunuch greer wrote about how drag queens were more feminine than cis women could ever be because they can take all these symbols of femininity and create this new persona this is interesting and definitely something i d love to have a larger discussion about both on muacjdiscussion and rpwives and fnf i disagree completely but i would love to really dive into this idea with people from all sides of the subject i believe that gender and biology are inseparable and that femininity itself is not inherently a performance although drag queens and trans women are certainly performing they are not authentically feminine i actually agree with the radfems on r gendercritical on a lot of things regarding trans people they may not be representative of all radfems though to expand more on my position people communicate today largely through signals and symbols references are so key in all interactions and media as well in a lot of ways the symbol is more important than the reality an example of this i am going to steal from a post from the last psychiatrist jay z has a music video where he is singing about being authentic from the streets super real and hood etc but the actual images are him going to an italian restaurant eating spaghetti playing cards with the mafia etc none of this is actually who jay z is but italian authentic in the minds of americans he communicated a truth about himself by showing a fiction if he had a video of him in the streets with guns being in a black gang that seems fake even though it is real because aspects of black culture have similarly been reduced to a brand and that symbol is not in line with the message he was trying to communicate during that song he would have seemed like every other rapper and therefore unoriginal not authentic posing etc i m saying all of this to say that even though people can use symbols of italian culture to signify authenticity or symbols of black culture to signify masculinity neither italian or black are inherently based on performance it is genetics that determines your ethnicity just as genetics determine your gender building off of this i believe that many women today use symbols of vintage post wwii america to signal femininity today in the same way that white men adopt hip hop culture to signal masculinity similarly drag queens and trans women take the modern symbols of femininity and use it to signal something they are not to reveal a truth they believe about themselves hope that makes sense and thanks for reading edited thought of more i see a difference between choosing symbols to signal your values personality choices etc and choosing symbols to signal that you are trans one is an expression of your innate characteristics in the manner that most people do today the other is rejecting your innate characteristics and using symbols as if you were a different group so it two layers of performance and it is not performance to convey a reality eg a conservative woman who longs for a return to normalcy gravitating towards vintage illustrations but rather a performance that attempts to alter reality ,5,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,nothing you said to me throughout the day indicated that you would taken the time to read what i have written if you actually have then i was mistaken my rhetorical questions were intended to convey that you did not seem to have actually learned what i believe not that you were not able to understand my points i hope that distinction is clear regardless have a great night ,1,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,the long hair community is a forum that is full of women who love their hair i have learned so much reading through the archives and it cool to see how long some women are able to grow their hair ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,you read my relationship dynamics series my post on female sexual strategy my post on vetting men and my post on psychological femininity and yet you still do not have a grasp on what i believe interesting we are clearly not getting anywhere so let just end the conversation enjoy your evening ,1,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,you asked a question i answered it interesting that you can admit that i am smart but then do not consider that i have researched both my opinions and the ideologies that i oppose i did not randomly arrive at my conclusions you have not read my posts or had a real conversation with me so to write a condescending paragraph about how i can do better as if you even know what i believe or why is pretty hilarious ,0,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,from another comment that i left today the term red pill was coined almost 10 years ago within the de reactionary manosphere subsection of the internet trp was made a few years ago as a reddit forum to discuss the ideas that those websites and blogs focused on it has since developed its own culture and theories and when we the mod team of redpillwomen decided that we did not like what they were saying at all we left and all of the active women came with us to the new sub we actually reserved the name feminine not feminist during that time because we were not sure what name we were going to go with but we wanted to keep the acronym rpw because it is useful as both an noun and adjective and it would mean that we did not have to change a lot of posts that we would written haha plus we like the connection to the original manosphere trp did not create rp ideas and it is our belief that they have warped things and also have added in a lot of non rp stuff to their sub our community has also developed new ideas and theories which you can see in the essential posts section of the wiki there is also a wiki page called all about rpw that gives a short overview of the sub beliefs and purpose ,-3,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,the fnf subreddit is explicitly a community for women who are not leftist feminist sjws or anything similar to discuss a wide range of subjects members can have different opinions on plenty of subjects and many users have had disagreements already in contrast this subreddit has no official political or ideological position it is not explicitly a community for feminists and in many posts a variety of opinions are encouraged despite the appearance of open mindedness the users here reject those with a different perspective i actually used to really enjoy reading this sub i have read basically every post submitted i was dismayed when participating led to hostility but i am glad that is not an issue for me anymore i will still read and participate here because the discussion questions and perspectives that others have are interesting i love all things beauty and i love exploring different ideas edited to add i am commenting on this specific post because it is about a subreddit that i created and people are making statements about two communities that i run me personally and the women that i affiliate with ,2,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,oh shit i want all of these ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325, it seems the point of the sub is to be honest and not sugarcoat things right definitely unless a person specifically says ccnw constructive criticism not wanted feedback is totally fine as long as it follows the rules of the sub your comment does of course ,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,agreed ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,by your definition it is bigoted we do not care about that we operate using our own ideological and moral framework inclusion is not a top priority trans women would disrupt the cohesion of the community ,3,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,our opposition is to the fat acceptance and haes movement we believe in women doing what they can to look as good as possible a woman may naturally store fat in undesirable areas but she does not have to keep it there we disagree with the normalisation and celebration of unhealthy lifestyles and body types we also disagree with the elevation of these women and the way they often claim to be equally as attractive as thinner women in terms of individual everyday women if someone is chubbier and fine with it okay you are right that does not matter and it not something that anyone particularly cares about there is a difference between being overweight and advocating for haes and fat acceptance if a naturally chubby woman went around the sub arguing with people who promoted self improvement fitness proper nutrition etc then it would matter because it would be disrupting the community ,1,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,also a lot of women expressed that they wanted to talk about traditional relationships homemaking and personality r redpillwives is the exact subreddit for this i am a mod many women here are already also rpwives members everyone is invited to join our 28 days of romance challenge we have one for singles and one for women in relationships discussion on the personality and relationship side of femininity is totally fine here as well but let just remember that this is a beauty sub first ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,nothing is stopping anyone from participating the rules say no feminism and feminists have commented the rules say no bashing president trump people have still done it i deleted a male post today even though we are clearly a space only for women if a trans person wants to post and hide the fact that they are trans they will if it becomes known that they are trans they will be banned existence of a rule does not mean that people will stop unwanted behaviour it just means that we are going to take action if someone does something out of line as defined by the community ,-1,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,i do not know much about her personally but she is so alluring it is inspiring i definitely appreciate how sexy she is and i am excited to see the impact she will have on american women ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,nope it does not say that fat acceptance culture overweight women there are many self admitted larger women on fnf they are determined to lose weight and are against the fat acceptance haes movement there also is not anything about sexual identity on the sidebar or subreddit rules we only want biological females who identify as females lesbians and bisexual women are free to participate so long as they follow the rules ,4,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,oh i know you were not asking for us to change anything i was just speaking in general we want the community to stay focused and often trans women shift the focus when they post this happens in a few ways women who otherwise value honest constructive criticism and feedback feel compelled to praise trans women for average or even subpar makeup looks hairstyles fashion choices etc women who believe that trans women are not actually women would get into arguments both with trans women and with women who do believe that trans women should be treated as women content about how to pass as feminine is different than content for biological females who want to express themselves and celebrate their natural femininity we want to have a community and so that means members should be able to get along and get to know each other we want to share what is going on in our lives and experiences we have had in the past trans women do not have the same set of shared female experiences that enable us to bond easier with unknown women there is nothing stopping a trans woman from participating without bringing up their status but they probably wo not like the community anyways and since we are not a debate sub i would imagine they would feel left out and possibly stifled ,-4,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,the disagreement between rpwives and trp or the disagreements that led to fnf i am happy to answer either since i made both new subs just let me know which one you meant ,2,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,thanks i agree it is great to be friends with people who have different worldviews i love exploring new ideas and challenging my beliefs i agree that a lot of the criticisms people here have about fnf we have equivalent criticisms about the reddit beauty community people rarely actually ask us questions and try to understand what we believe and why you and anyone else who is interested in discussing beauty are welcome to participate on the sub we will have more politics free stuff as the community develops it so brand new people are excited and letting off steam not to reduce or diminish our beliefs just saying that as time goes on the beauty to politics ratio will shift naturally ,1,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,i really enjoyed this comment and agree that there are a lot of women who are moderate or right of center and feel relief with this sub i have received a lot of positive pms post comments and survey responses that confirm this we wanted to start with a bang and also draw a line in the sand so controversial posts were a great way to do that women were able to let loose a bit make jokes exaggerate speak without apologising for their opinions etc maybe a lot of people here do not know this but when you have a non mainstream opinion you have to be careful with how you phrase things you change your language you over explain you make sure to mention the merits of both sides you go out of your way to not offend this can get exhausting it only the second day the women are letting off steam after walking on eggshells for ages as the community develops there will be a lot more content that has nothing to do with politics and the political posts will have a different tone unless they are specifically topics that lend themselves to jokes sarcasm etc i appreciate you sharing your perspective on fnf ,-1,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,99 of the subs on reddit allow users to mock president trump his platform his family and those who support him it is hard to avoid reading anti trump statements even on subs you would not think have anything to do with politics since the members of fnf do not hate the president or his supporters i did not want to encourage or allow others to attack us for our beliefs i have not seen any legitimate racism on the subreddit i have seen users discussing race as it relates to some aspect of a larger conversation but i have not seen any hatred expressed toward ethnic groups if fnf members see something that concerns them they can always report the comment or post but we are not going to change our beliefs or how we express ourselves to appease outsiders that are not part of the subreddit do not share our values and have no interest in seeing us succeed ,-6,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,hi this subreddit is a female space as it says on the sidebar wiki and welcome message men are not allowed i really hope you find the answer to your question but this is not the community to ask your post is going to be removed but you can respond to the woman who has already written a comment to you ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,thank you ,2,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,i am not blaming anyone in fact i have said in other comments that i understand why people would get the wrong idea especially since the op used the wrong subreddit name a sub which is in fact within the trp network the negative connotation that you guys have with rp is not the same connotation that women we want have towards the label so there nothing to be sorry about ,2,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,on reddit red pill is linked to trp sure but across the internet it has a different connotation to the specific people that we care about appealing to it does not matter what non rp people think about the term rp if people are not willing to see what we actually believe and they would rather lump us in with other groups that on them they are not our target audience ,4,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,again i have never claimed that we were not red pill i have clarified exactly what that means stop acting like i am trying to distance the sub from red pill you keep missing the point of what i am saying ,-4,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,hi these are great questions you are literally the only person who has responded in good faith to my comments thank you and feel free to ask anything else you say you are not anti women yet you are pro fat shaming and do not believe that overweight women should waste time on makeup or looking attractive yes i think that cultural and social pressure are good motivators and when we normalise and celebrate being overweight and obese it damages these women s lives it is unhealthy to be very overweight and fat acceptance and haes proponents are in denial about this do i hate every individual fat person of course not but i don t like the messages of those movements or the mentality of the women who support them i love women and want us all to look and feel our best i believe that people have more control over their lives than we think and wish that everyone would value their health and appearance in terms of being a waste of time i feel like it s misplaced priorities if an overweight woman wants to improve her looks she should concentrate on losing weight first before spending tons of money on wardrobe or makeup this blog post www therulesrevisited com 2011 09 feminine beauty is highly controllable html explains what i mean it isn t an rp blog post or anything it s very objective and accessible and cool i think but if you are not anti women why so much of your sub revolves around hating sjw hating overweight women hating x or y thing etc niether rpw or fnf revolve around hating sjws or any other thing rpw is primarily about relationships and fnf is about beauty our communities have different definitions of what it means to be feminine and what female nature is since fnf just started i made a post about unpopular opinions and there are posts that focus on culture because it is important that women know that they can actually speak their minds there will always be posts about current events and culture on both communities just as there are posts about current events and culture on muacjdiscussion or beautyguruchat both of these subs regularly discuss political issues and express disagreement towards conservative and right wing opinions both of these subs regularly insult and mock those who hold conservative and right wing opinions and make jokes at their expense as fnf grows and develops we will have plenty of politically neutral conversations i m excited to see what culture we will develop i made a survey for new members to share what they want from the sub and this weekend i ll be posting the results and possibly making new rules based on the feedback to an outsider it seems like it bothers you guys more than necessary and from my perspective as an outsider to feminist groups i think a lot of things bother you all more than necessary haha these differences stem from our different worldviews and values and that is fine i don t think that rpw has a higher number of things that bother us in comparison to other groups it s just not the same things that bother feminists if someone is happy overweight would not that mean that more rp men would be available for you guys why spend the energy shaming others who are not your competition if by rp men you mean the men of the redpill subreddit please know that those guys are not who we want at all i did a survey not too long ago and i believe around 80 of the women were already married or in serious ltrs and only a few of the subscriber s men even know what rp or the manosphere even is just because we discuss amongst ourselves our opinions on various things eg fat acceptance culture doesn t mean that we act on these things in real life and try to get people to change we are all about accountability and agency and focus advice on what we as individuals can do there is a difference between our personal opinions and what we think others should do no one spends energy shaming others having a conversation with other women who agree with you is not shaming another person the community is not for fat acceptance proponents we are not speaking to them we are not telling them how to live their lives as far as competition goes that isn t relevant to my and other s opinion that celebrating being overweight is unhealthy and ultimately damaging for women our position has nothing to do with sexual strategy how do you feel of fetishes like feederism women are considered to be the most beautiful as they grow larger and they are attractive to their subset of men yet she would be obese curious to hear what you think i think it s gross but great that the internet and technology allows people to connect that have niche interests like this wouldn t want anyone to not be allowed to do this but i don t have to personally approve or support it i m all for tolerance just not forced acceptance i am also all about freedom but actions have consequences these women are leading an unhealthy lifestyle it is their choice me disagreeing with their choice isn t the same thing as me wanting their ability to choose to be taken away this same mentality applies to a lot of other positions many feminists who read the sub don t realise that we separate what we personally believe and choose from what we think that others should do yet do you think that adopting the same name as red pill wives is actually a validation of red pill culture the term red pill is a signal to other likeminded people they know what it means and know what they can expect anyone who is actually interested in the ideas will take the time to read our subreddit and see what we believe they are able to distinguish between our community and the redpill sub we absolutely agree with red pill ideas from the early years of the manosphere and we are not ashamed of the term red pill people who disagree with us have a negative association with the term we do not have this same negative association so it doesn t bother us we re not interested in changing ourselves to appeal to groups that don t want us to succeed i like i can explain to you what feminism is to me but to you just because it is called feminist you would have a preset idea having an idea of what something is based on the label is fine but refusing to listen to further explanations from people who actually know more about the subject is not this is what i have experienced commenting today people making up what i believe and then telling me that i am wrong when i disagree feminism and leftist ideology in general is actually a subject that i study a lot both the present iterations and its history a lot of people assume that if you disagree with feminism it is because you just don t understand it but that isn t the case for the overwhelming majority of the members of rpw if i make a claim about what you believe and you tell me that no you don t believe that i would accept this as true it doesn t mean that i now agree with you but i can form an argument that actually makes sense as an example imagine if i told you that since you are a feminist you support throwing gay people off of roofs there are some feminists who support islam some islamic people have thrown gay people off of roofs therefore you support throwing gay people off of roofs this is how ridiculous some of the things that i ve been reading here sound to me haha this one is more personal but how did you get into this culture we are you raised this way my parents are both democrats and involved in the government i grew up surrounded by politics and was always in rigorous programs in school that exposed us to a lot of ideas i ve always been passionate about philosophy and history and have done extensive research both in school and in my free time on western culture and civilisations my worldview is mostly a combination of aristotle aquinas and ayn rand in addition to reading i acquired my perspective from my everyday experience it just didn t line up with the messages in the mainstream this comment is so long already so if you are interested i could expand in my response as far as how i found the de sphere it was basically religious blogs de reactionary rp male game pick up trp subreddit redpillwomen subreddit became a mod made new better rpw sub what do you feel is the most gratifying and the most frustrating thing about it most gratifying helping women who are struggling in their marriages having a group of women to bounce ideas off of and theorise with and rant with applying the ideas to my own life and seeing nothing but success most frustrating wanting to have real discussions and debates with people but they resort to insults fallacies lies or just yelling at me also another frustration is wanting to quote and reference so many things and link people to tons of blogs and posts but i know no one would ever read them lol thanks for reading all of this ,6,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,we do align ourselves with red pill ideas the ideas of the early manosphere not trp not redpillwomen not random blogs that also use the name redpill we are very clear on our subreddit what we do and do not support the term is useful to signal to other likeminded people where we stand rpwives is not a movement or interested in converting anyone so other people being offended by our name its connotations or our positions is not relevant to how we manage our community i never claimed that i do not agree with rp ideas i stated multiple times in multiple comments that we disagree with trp the subreddit you and others believe that the donald sub is a space for bigoted rhetoric but i and many others disagree this is fine many people who are on the donald sub describe themselves as liberal democrats centrist or moderate there are a wide variety of people over there many had never even heard the term alt right until hillary campaign started using it i understand why people would assume things about the subreddit but a real investigation on the official positions of rpwives would reveal that a lot of the claims made here are unfounded there is plenty that you guys disagree with legitimately based on your ideological and moral systems and that is fine but i would rather someone disagree with me for real reasons not invented ones and i do not think that real discussion or debate can happen if you do not know what your opponent is actually claiming hope that clears everything up enjoy your day ,5,muacjdiscussion
camille11325, their bodies belong to a man they have not met that was your takeaway i am very surprised that this is how you understood her point because that is not something that any of us believe you are framing it in a way that misses the actual point that we are making considering the possible consequences to your actions does not remove your agency wanting to appeal to someone you find appealing is not a bad thing being intentional in your actions based on your values and priorities minimizes the risk of unhappiness a lot of the comments were about the ladylike aspect though it is prevalent throughout the sub yes some users discussed how feminine tattoos are but the degree of femininity is separate from the official rpw position on what one should do and again that position would be consider your lifestyle and goals and make the most optimal choice u phantomdream09 even made a distinction between the official position and her personal opinion their self worth is entangled with the desires affirmations and the choices of her husband being affected by the desires affirmations and choices of your husband is not the same thing has having an unstable sense of self low self esteem or compromised identity wanting to do things that both of you agree with and will be pleased by is not weakness getting joy from bringing him joy is not terrible and it does not mean that we only get joy from bringing the men in our lives joy it does not mean that we never disagree or voice our opinions it does not mean we revolve our entire lives around our relationship rpw is a space to discuss specific subjects it does not mean that we do not have other interests and priorities and in the comments and more off topic posts people do share these things they are keeping themselves pure because it what her husband would want it is absolutely not about purity i do not know why people here keep bringing that up a lot of men in the us think that a tattoo is a sign of sluttiness risk taking low fto or just bad character in general it is associated with prisons gangs and the military several religions oppose tattoos and even those who shed their religious beliefs when they get older still have a bias against tattoos if you are a woman interested in dating and marrying a man knowing how men think is an important part of getting to your goal you cannot ignore that there are men who do not like tattoos and if you are on the fence but then decide not to get one because of this it a prudent decision it no more about purity than choosing not to get a face tattoo so that you are employable is about purity but even in your writing it is very negative it is negative in my comment because i personally do not like tattoos yes but there is a difference between my personal opinion and the advice that one would give on rpw your husband seems to have the final say making sure he happy is the important thing for you no woman has to give their husband the final say on this or any decision our community is a space for likeminded women who do value their man opinion enough that they would defer if he strongly objected to them getting a tattoo the happiness of the men in our lives is definitely important to us and those men value our happiness as well i really do not see what is wrong with advising a woman to consider her man opinion on this matter it could avoid a lot of conflict resentment and or loss of attraction to have harmony he must be happy with the implication of if he happy you are happy to have harmony both must be happy and making our men happy pleases us just as making us happy pleases them ,0,muacjdiscussion
camille11325, people assuming that we are from redpillwomen and agree with trp when as i just explained that is not the case comments claiming that we do not believe women should have choices or rights that we hate women that we support abuse and other false statements about our beliefs there was a thread that made it seem like we were concerned with female purity and virginity when that is not true there are comments that equate the members of both communities with white nationalists and nazis when that also is not true people are going to disagree with us and that is fine but a lot of the shock and anger that i see is not even based on what we actually believe i can tell that many women who are commenting here have not read much of rpwives especially not the original content from endorsed contributors and moderators ,5,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,i did not say i was indifferent i said i was not surprised or upset i have been very clear and consistent about why i am posting here ,3,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,i am not surprised or upset in fact a lot of women on this subreddit seem to be the ones who are surprised and upset by our existence and what we are saying on our own community i have spent 8 years in the de reactionary manosphere section of the internet and a few years discussing and debating these things on reddit nothing that is being said here is shocking angering upsetting etc to me or to other members of rpwives who are reading your characterisation of me is not based on anything that i have said i have been polite and informative in my comments here and while i have spoken about people misrepresenting us the issue is with the inaccuracy and dishonesty it has nothing to do with people being mean ,5,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,re the first point that fine this is an unpopular opinions thread i did not expect people to all rally around in agreement with my statement haha i think a lot of people who read that think that i am literally commanding women to spend that much time or that i am judging all those who are not that not the case it just one of many opinions i have and nothing more for 2 i have seen plenty of outrage at women and companies who are inspired by other cultures people see cultural appropriation in everything it seems if someone is mocking another group or disrespecting them in some way that is different than incorporating aspects of that culture into a look product i have an issue with the former and not the latter 3 that fine i just disagree lol i think that cultural and social expectations and pressure are great motivators and i do not like the normalisation of being overweight and even obese crop tops in those sizes help normalise it giving less incentive for people to improve ,5,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,because this post is about a community that i made women are discussing me and subreddits that i moderate and making statements about what we believe and why they disagree i have stepped in when seeing someone say something blatantly not true in terms of our stance as a sub but i have not attempted to debate actual ideas with anyone here i have no interest in changing anyone beliefs i have been reading muacjdiscussion for ages and often enjoy the topics a few times when i have commented in disagreement with the majority of the subreddit i was not well received other women experienced this as well and reached out to me and we made a new subreddit to avoid this issue did you not think that we would see this post or that we would not want to share our thoughts the fact that so many women are quick to assume the worst about us after doing very little research about who we are and what we believe is one of the reasons why we made our own space ,8,muacjdiscussion

camille11325,the term red pill was coined almost 10 years ago within the de reactionary manosphere subsection of the internet trp was made a few years ago as a reddit forum to discuss the ideas that those websites and blogs focused on it has since developed its own culture and theories and when we the mod team of redpillwomen decided that we did not like what they were saying at all we left and all of the active women came with us to the new sub we actually reserved the name feminine not feminist during that time because we were not sure what name we were going to go with but we wanted to keep the acronym rpw because it is useful as both an noun and adjective and it would mean that we did not have to change a lot of posts that we would written haha plus we like the connection to the original manosphere trp did not create rp ideas and it is our belief that they have warped things and also have added in a lot of non rp stuff to their sub our community has also developed new ideas and theories which you can see in the essential posts section of the wiki there is also a wiki page called all about rpw that gives a short overview of the sub beliefs and purpose i understand that most here do not agree with what we believe but i have seen so many claims today about us that just are not true hopefully this helps and if i need to explain anything else just let me know ,1,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,i have said several times that other commenters have been making things up about our community and beliefs and so i have been trying to correct it i also said that by your definition of those terms you believe that they apply to us i was not referring to your list of labels as a strawman if my comment was unclear hopefully what i was driving at is clear now ,1,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,i get that you guys define our ideas as all of those labels but i obviously disagree with them lol we are not going to come to any sort of agreement and that is fine i just do not like strawman arguments ,-3,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,the way you phrased your comment made it seem like you were trying to explain to me something that happened that i was part of my original comment was not inconsistent we are completely unrelated to trp the subreddit we stress harmonious relationships not team man or team woman trp is not the manosphere trp is not the main source or definer of what it means to be rp you can disagree with trp and still agree with rp ideas we have different theories and definitions of things than what trp uses and we give different advice than what trp members and redpillwomen members would give our community is separate from them and we actively reject a lot of the ideas that are prevalent in the trp network ,-2,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,well seeing as i am the one who created both subs i have the best understanding of what our intentions and definitions of things are our ideas and arguments are also explicitly laid out and defended in many posts the essential posts section of the wiki has a collection of the best people here are making up what we believe so i have been trying to correct that you can disagree with our ideas but when people are saying things that are just blatantly not true i take issue with it ,1,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,okay good glad you actually looked i have seen a lot of people who referenced things from rpwomen and it was bothering me everything else i said is still true none of the ecs or mods would endorse that sort of behaviour but we also stress that women do what works for them in relationships there are many posts and comments about that subject ,-4,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,hi i am the woman who made fnf and also rpwives i was a mod at rpwomen before so i am extremely familiar with the reasons why we left and what we believe i did not say we were not related to red pill theory just that we do not agree with trp there is an entire network of websites and blogs that have been around for a decade and longer than trp we agree with the original manosphere and we have developed female specific theory that does not exist anywhere online except for our sub ,3,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,having a subreddit focusing on beauty is not the same thing as believing that your appearance is the most important thing in fact on the sub r redpillwives not redpillwomen as the op claimed we are not related to them we stress other characteristics above appearance ,-2,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,redpillwomen is defintiely mostly men at this point all of the original mods and users left because we did not agree with trp and wanted to have our own space the op is incorrect we are from r redpillwives ,12,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,hi i am the creator of fnf just wanted to let you know that the sub that i adn others are from is r redpillwives not redpillwomen it is not related to redpillwomen or trp ,-2,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,are you talking about redpillwomen because the sub that i the creator of the sub and most others are from is r redpillwives completely different community with different ideas and aims what you are referencing sounds like an excerpt from the surrendered wife some women have read and liked it i never have it is not the foundation of the sub in any way and 99 of us rpwives think that example is weird and not advisable we are not about being doormats at all our wiki has more information in depth posts can also be found in my submission histor y ,-5,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,hi creator of the sub first the sub is r redpillwives not affiliated with redpillwomen or trp we are not interested in recruiting or converting anyone we are a community for likeminded women a beauty sub was made because women from this sub and beauty guru chat messaged me asking for a similar space where people could discuss all things beauty ,-6,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,hi creator of the sub first the sub is r redpillwives not affiliated with redpillwomen or trp we are not interested in recruiting or converting anyone we are a community for likeminded women a beauty sub was made because women from this sub and beauty guru chat messaged me asking for a similar space where people could discuss all things beauty ,3,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,if you actually read the sub r redpillwives not redpillwomen you would see that we do not promote anythign that you just said we tell women to vet thoroughly and find a man that suits them the only changing we encourage is normal self improvement and stopping bad relationship habits such as nagging micromanaging your man yelling and insulting him etc we do not think that men give us meaning and fulfillment and we absolutely do not believe that women should be subservient doormats without a spine or voice we have actually helped women get out of abusive relationships our priority is harmony there are in depth posts in the wiki and in my submission history that explain it more but you are just not giving an accurate description at all ,-4,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,hello i am the woman who created the sub first i would like to let you know that it has absolutely nothing to do with the redpillwomen sub or trp r redpillwives is completely separate and we have our own theories and beliefs second your response is very condescending if you actually looked to see what was happening on our sub and who believed it you would see that most women work most went to college and we believe in the equal application of the law to both genders there are fundamental ideological and philosophical differences that does not make us lazy at the level of first premises we have a constrained vision of humanity while feminists have an unconstrained vision of humanity http www nku edu gartigw teaching files weaver 20ch 2012 20handout 20 20constrained 20versus 20unconstrained 20visions pdf combine this with an acknowledgement of inherent male and female nature and wanting limited government and subsidiarity and feminism is just not compatible ,-2,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,and that fine but i wish that we were fairly represented from the start because i have yet to read a single comment that accurately discusses what we believe in and are about i see people making assumptions and insulting strawmen ,0,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,hi i created the sub and we are not actually redpillwomen we are redpillwives completely not related or affiliated with trp i and a few others were mods at redpillwomen but one year ago we left and made our own sub because we did not agree with trp and where a lot of the culture was going we are not anti women and we are not blindly pro men we write extensively about what we believe and why and there is a wiki that has both summaries and in depth post the oc in my own submission history gives a lot of information that would give you a better perspective of what we actually believe ,-1,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,that was one response by one user and the majority of the women who commented not only liked tattoos but had them as well at least when i last read it the comment you are talking about was discussing the way that getting a tattoo limits your pool of available men because a lot of men do view tattoos as a red flag if a woman is interested in getting married it certainly something to consider and then while in a marriage why would not you want to be sure that your man supported you getting a tattoo it not about being ladylike its about respecting the preferences of the man who loves you and commits to you of course anyone can do what they want but thinking about the effect our actions have our men is an important way to maintain harmony ,0,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,it not about being perfect if you actually look at the sub redpillwives not redpillwomen completely unrelated to trp you would see that it about harmonious relationships we actually stress vetting and not committing to a bad man we are not blindly following anyone our definition of going for dreams is just different than yours ,-3,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,nope we are not a religious sub and most of the subreddit did not have a baptist upbringing we also are not about female purity or virginity or anything like that either ,-2,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,note that i said the women who say this i am not speaking about all women i am speaking about a very specific type of person who both rejects stereotypically female ways of talking about makeup and instead embraces the art self expression war paint labels the woman i am talking to and i know exactly the group of women we are discussing and if you have been around the reddit beauty community i am sure you have seen them too basically i am not making a generalisation about all women i am describing a specific type of woman my last sentence speaks directly to this type of women hopefully it clearer now ,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,the 2 hours includes both all things beauty hair makeup nails skincare choosing clothes shaving other hair removal etc and also self care journaling taking a long bath going on a walk meditating whatever else you need to do there are people who spend 1 hour on skincare alone or on their hair i do not think it excessive if beauty things are a hobby pasttime for you and it not actually something i am trying to force other women to do it just an unpopular opinion that i have that is beauty related the more time you put into yourself the better you will look and feel also another reason why i shared it is because women who do invest their time into their appearance are looked down on especially by other women your comment about it being excessive and having better things to do is a great example do women who prioritise their looks not have anything better to do what if we just have different schedules different ways of spending our time what if we make time to take care of ourselves how we want there this idea that it wrong to focus so much on yourself as a woman and that is something i am challenging ,5,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,hi i made the sub i am a moderator of r redpillwives which is not related to theredpill subreddit or the redpillwomen sub the mods of rpwives were originally the mods of rpwomen but we left and created our own subreddit because we did not agree with trp and a lot of the culture that was developing over there something does not have to go wrong in your life for you to have a different worldview if you are actually curious and what an explanation i would be happy to expand on a few of the different underlying premises between us and the bulk of women here but i am not sure how interested anyone is in that we have written extensively about what we believe and why on the sub so if you actually want to know why i hold the opinions that i do you can look at the oc that i have created we also have a wiki that explains things and a collection of in depth theory posts we believe that beauty is one of many values that women have not that it is our only value people making assumptions and statements like you are is one of the reasons that women reached out to me about making a new subreddit it just really frustrating to see people completely misrepresent your views and insult you like this ,1,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,hi i created the subreddit and i am glad you made this post but i wish that you actually checked to see who made the sub and what i am about i am a moderator of r redpillwives which is not related to theredpill subreddit or the redpillwomen sub the mods of rpwives were originally the mods of rpwomen but we left and created our own subreddit because we did not agree with trp and a lot of the culture that was developing over there our rejection of feminism comes from philosophical and ideological differences we also dislike a lot of the consequences that it has had on america our focus is on harmonious relationships that have traditional dynamics because we believe in inherent male and female nature if you actually looked at the sub what we believe is clearly explained each individual reasons for opposing any or all aspects of feminism are out there in the open feminism does not have a monopoly on the idea of equal application of the law to both genders and that is not the entirety of what feminism is about it just really disappointing that you would direct users to a sub that has nothing to do with fnf and in fact it is a sub that i dislike and does not represent me or the majority of the women who have joined rpwives is linked all over fnf and it even in the sidebar i was contacted by many women after this sub and beautyguruchat got very political and women with conservative opinions were being downvoted insulted yelled at argued with and even harassed in pm one user even received harassment on her facebook account from the fb group of women from reddit pretty sure it affiliated with this sub there was a need and we already owned the sub name from when we moved from rpwomen and before we decided on the name r redpillwives i am so glad that i made it everyone is having tons of fun i am still going to read and participate on other beauty subs but it nice to know that there is a space where i can just speak freely without worrying about it being received badly when you hold certain positions on reddit people assume a lot of things about you and they discount your opinion on all other subjects it just not an environment i am interested in anymore if you have any questions feel free to ask ,-12,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,you are definitely welcome on our sub some posts may get a little too political for your liking and if you want to have a levelheaded discussion about the subject that is fine as long as you follow the rules and stay respectful i hope you can keep in mind that while some jokes may seem distasteful based on your beliefs or some statements offensive it does not mean we are terrible people i am obsessed with skincare as well so it great to know that we have that in common looking forward to seeing you around the sub ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i have not seen one person claim that fat people are the 1 most important issue that they are concerned about i have seen plenty of jokes as well as opinions expressed without reservation labeling conversations that you do not like as a mean girl club is an attempt at shaming that is not welcome here if you do not like someone sense of humour move on if you have something valid to add to the discussion do so people can care about multiple issues we literally just started yesterday afternoon there are going to be posts about all sorts of subjects just because there is not a lot of conversation about one topic does not mean that no one is aware that there is a problem i have already been part of a conversation about burqas since we launched and i saw others discussing it as well no one here is trying to win anyone over to conservative values this is a community for likeminded women we are not on a mission to convert anyone fat shaming only garners legitimacy for the burqua or tents by omar among non muslims this is just so ridiculous i do not know what to say it is fine to point out a woman may consider longer term health issues but leave it at that it is not your place to dictate what is and is not appropriate on this subreddit this is an official warning to watch your tone please review the rules and keep them in mind as you participate moving forward ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i really need to whiten my teeth again and then actually maintain the super white shade i always do it and then wait a year or so and in the meantime my teeth get stained from coffee tea alcohol etc i have used both commercial and professional grade whitening kits i just do not do it often enough what i plan to do this year to make sure my teeth are the best ever get a sonicare diamond clean toothbrush the professional version from my dentist use the glo science professional at home whitening kit also from the dentist this one is really awesome because there is apparently no sensitivity at all incorporate the crest 5 min touch up whitening strips into my weekly beauty routine and also use them before important events as necessary ,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i think your moisture protein balance is off do you know if your hair is high med or low porosity try a protein treatment and follow it immediately with a moisturizing deep conditioner and what are you putting on your hair as it air drys you may need to use a couple of products to seal in moisture ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,everything you are saying makes sense and i want to be clear that i am just sharing my personal opinion not making any larger statements about women here should or should not do while we are promoting femininity on this sub our definition is not narrow and if people have tattoos i do not think that should be a mark against them however i am also glad that we can have a space to discuss alternative opinions and i hope that women feel comfortable expressing disagreement on this sub so long as they write constructive comments obviously feminist and sjw stuff is against the rules but tattoos vs no tattoos is not a defining aspect of this community ,7,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,there always shape wear plastic surgery and dressing to enhance femininity ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,totally going to go against the rest of the comment section and say that i do not like tattoos at all regardless of the location design or intention i think they are a red flag for a reason but thanks to prole drift they are so trendy common now that it is not as reliable of a red flag as it once was i have only meet a handful of women with tattoos irl and would be very upset if my future daughter s got one i would also strongly encourage my future son s not to marry any woman that has tattoos note i do not think it makes you a bad person to have a tattoo i just do not like the concept and i also find them visually unappealing the thought of permanently altering your body like that is just off putting to me i like smooth clear bright soft skin radiant and uninterrupted by any ink if you have tattoos that fine we are still a new community so i am just putting this disclaimer here to prevent any attempt at starting an argument ,16,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325,that cool that your lifestyle is arranged the way you want i personally prefer to have a less active lifestyle and go to the gym regularly one is not better than the other this is a controversial opinions thread not what realistic ideas do you want every woman to adopt immediately i believe that it is worth it to put more time and energy into yourself so that you look and feel the best that you can the hour includes both beauty related things hairstyling makeup skincare choosing clothes shaving etc and self care journaling mediating reading relaxing taking a bath etc plenty of women spend an hour alone on hair makeup or skincare routines and i personally can spend multiple hours on all three haha but i am definitely a high maintenance outlier i am all about women having kids especially the right type of women having kids i do not think that it is mutually exclusive to prioritising your appearance and mental health ,8,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,welcome to the sub how cool that you make your own beauty products you should totally make a post about it be sure to take the survey if you have not already it short ,2,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325,welcome how wonderful that you have such a large family i definitely agree that appearance does not define femininity the name was chosen for symmetry one thing that is important though is to have a space where we can celebrate feminine beauty and everything that goes into achieving that appearance without worry or shame an interest in makeup skincare hair styling fashion etc is a completely valid expression of inner femininity and so we are not going to minimize it you will probably like our sister sub too r redpillwives it is a community that focuses on psychological femininity aka good character and traditional dynamics within relationships we also talk about feminism and culture but the focus is on our personality and actions whereas this sub is all about our appearance ,1,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325,welcome so glad to have you here you will definitely enjoy r redpillwives as well ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,excellent point ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,yes actually several women received insults and harassment from members of other beauty subs for daring to disagree with the feminist narrative i personally had to argue with multiple people for stating opinions that went against the majority of the sub it was clear that we were not wanted and we decided to make our own community where we can have fun without dealing with that sort of negativity ,6,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,my own thoughts on the questions yes i definitely think that social media and the internet enhances the sense of female competition i feel like before social media you really only were directly competing with the people in your social circle neighborhood church local groups family etc both for status and in the smp but now you have all of those groups people you normally would have lost touch with social media influencers celebrities other women who you never would have met heard of if it were not for the internet basically the more women you are exposed to the more pressure many feel to measure up or surpass everyone else i think that the normalisation of photo editing apps gives guys an unrealistic idea of what women in general look like i do not have a problem with photo editing in fact i would love for us to exchange tips just noticing the trend also wayne goss recently posted a video about how someone skin can look remarkably different with the right lighting and filters since most people do not realise that this is happening i think that it gives women unrealistic expectations of what products can do to improve appearance i think the bar will be set way higher when it comes to appearance since plastic surgery body sculpting laser treatments and more are becoming the norm i am really excited about the technological innovations happening in the beauty world and think it great that we can alter our appearance so that we can look exactly how we want this will mean that the difference between a 9 and a 7 will be even greater though when there are more women who look flawless even those who are above average in attractiveness will pale in comparison ,2,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325,confirming that i have read this will respond tomorrow ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,you are writing to me like i do not understand fashion or art when that is not the case disagreeing with your opinion not having a clue and needing to be lectured to i focused my initial comment to you in an attempt to cut through the fluff that is present in most of your comments within this thread you constantly bring up so much stuff so i made a direct argument to contradict your claims you are framing this discussion in a way that conceals the real point of the debate i am more than happy to discuss the subject with you but please refrain from condescending lectures in the future that like saying of a painting or photograph if someone has to know the full back story behind a picture for it to have any significance then it is not an iconic image plenty of iconic images are considered to be so not because of their inherent composition or the color palette but because of the moment they captured and the backstory behind it if the backstory is literally the only thing that gives an image or look any value then yes i would argue that it is not deserving of the praise and status most things that have compelling backstories also have other redeeming aspects in my opinion michelle fashion choices are not interesting enough on their own to merit additional interest the only reason anyone even knows of the backstory behind her looks is because of the extensive pr campaign that she ran throughout barack presidency if she were a regular woman with zero status i am not sure that anyone would be curious about why she chose any particular piece my argument is that her outfits are objectively normal and she is only considered an icon because of media spin the pure aesthetic value of something is only one measurement of the value it has yep but it is an important component when it comes to deciding who is and isn t a fashion icon it cannot be ignored and it is one of the most important factors but i also understand the backstory of the fashion she wearing it not something i can turn off it not something that the people she communicating to with her clothes can turn off either and there value in that even if a visiting head of state does not know the name of a designer whose dress she wearing they will understand the shared cultural aesthetic the dress speaks to they will know that the first lady has made an effort to make them feel welcome there is value in that you may find this valuable but i disagree that this makes her a fashion icon as i said before michelle obama is a brand she has done an excellent job presenting a cohesive image and educating others on her brand philosophy you buy into her brand and that s fine but it s not an objective fact that michelle should be regarded as a fashion icon because of the reasons that she claims that is what is being questioned and you re just repeating the very things that are up for debate while context is certainly part of the discussion when it comes to how to evaluate her wardrobe decisions michelle and her team emphasize this aspect and therefore others accept the idea that she is great because of the larger significance do you understand that we are challenging this very idea i think it perfectly reasonable for people in the fashion industry to understand the backstory and language of their own industry and to appreciate when someone with as much visibility and influence as the first lady does as well you seem to assume that the only reason that someone would disagree with michelle s status as a fashion icon is because they don t understand being able to identify references and fully know the intentions behind a look is doesn t automatically guarantee that you will like something no one was arguing that michelle isn t considered a fashion icon by people today the questions are does she deserve the label and how many women on fnf would agree that she deserves the label you never actually responded to my main point so i don t have much to add if you do respond to this comment please stay on topic ,6,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,from the sidebar wiki and stickied welcome post this is an anti feminist anti leftist and anti sjw community it is not a debate forum anyone promoting these ideologies shaming others concern trolling tone policing or otherwise disrupting the subreddit will be banned if you are not interested in participating legitimately in our community please leave if you cannot follow the rules you will be banned ,9,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325,michelle branded herself as a fashion icon and made use of multiple media outlets to cement this image in the minds of others she had extensive pr campaigns designed to convince others of her status and there are currently numerous articles on various websites and in magazines praising michelle and comparing her to melania that certainly is not an accident or just a coincidence while michelle was thoughtful about what she wore and why if she were not the first lady she would never have been seen as an icon intention alone does not determine how iconic your looks are the actual execution of the outfits has to be aesthetically pleasing in some way you can be bold and daring without being off putting and ugly if a random person who had no knowledge of who michelle was saw a collection of photos i do not believe that they would consider her looks as remarkably different from other upper middle class and upper class black women also to speak a bit more about her wardrobe choices if someone needs to know the full backstory behind every piece that you chose in order for your outfit to have any significance then you are not an icon if michelle wore the exact same clothes but they just happened to be off the rack from a department store does your assessment of her change ,3,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325,a lot of people believe that there are not really that many differences between men and women physically and an even greater amount of people do not realise the variation within women some are more masculine some more feminine in appearance this post is an amazing resource if the skeleton stuff bores you just skim it because there are tons of pictures containing faces and bodies of real women just know that this link and the rest of the site are nsfw it a wonderful site though so i will be linking a ton he has a whole series where he analyses victoria secret models ,3,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325, cultural appropriation as an idea is stupid and the idea of any privilege besides economic privilege is stupid though the feminist have tipped the scales heavily in women favor yes the only thing i can see people being annoyed by is if it a religious ceremonial thing worn out of context for example as a catholic i get annoyed when i see leggings with crosses on them or people wearing rosaries as statement jewelry this does not justify any of the hate that sjws spew at anyone who they decide is appropriating you can be privately annoyed and even offended without turning into a nasty person trying to destroy a business etc ,12,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325,lol it not surprising that everyone jokes about her being a tranny ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,it may be mean but it objectively true ,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,exactly i think the women who say this have a problem with femininity and they have to justify their interest in something stereotypically female by adding on other motivations that line up with their values wanting to look conventionally attractive is bad but if you call it something like art or self expression or war paint it somehow empowering lol ,11,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i am not familiar with cosplay but that good that the community has not been tainted too much it almost feels like people are looking for reasons to be offended at this point ,7,FeminineNotFeminist

camille11325,awesome thank you ,3,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,hi veronica welcome to fnf be sure to take the survey it super short ,4,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,so glad to have you on fnf i am totally on board with including fitness on the sub for the exact reasons you mentioned ,5,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,welcome welcome your story definitely lines up with what a lot of women experience but i am so glad you have grown out of those phases and found us i also love the asian skincare approach and that is so cool that your style is minimalist meets cyberpunk we should totally have a thread where we explain our personal styles and share inspo pics albums ,5,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,yay you are here so excited to talk to you about new products definitely give your reviews in our sunday megathreads and i also alter my appearance to suit my man taste he the one who has to look at me haha,6,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i think that wearing a burqa all the time is different from dressing modestly or even wearing veils during religious ceremonies burqas completely hide the entire female form elective or not this decision deprives the world of beauty modesty is about reserving some things for specific people and i totally understand how this message resonates with western women the female body has been so devalued over the years a woman legs used to drive men wild now women walk around wearing practically nothing and demand that men not feel anything sexual another controversial opinion i want my body to have an impact on men and i want the things i wear to enhance my sex appeal if my man looks at me wearing short shorts and a crop top and thinks meh totally normal that would be depressing ,14,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,honestly my bare minimum is a full face of makeup styled hair and a nice outfit i feel the most comfortable when everything about my appearance is taken care of i factor in the time it takes for me to get ready before agreeing to any engagements and my daily routines ensure that i have time to do all of the necessary steps to look great confession i even did my makeup and hair in the midst of my apartment flooding last year it was actually kind of calming and made me feel more in control in the moment ,10,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,haha yes agreed ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,yes and yes ,4,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325, b black chicks who have the same hip waist measurement problem but swear they have it worse and i do not understand because i am white lol just did a spit take i see this happening all the time online you should totally make a post here about finding clothes for your figure i have a similar problem but on a smaller scale i am a slim hourglass so while my curves are not as dramatic as yours my waist hip ratio still makes it difficult to find the right size ,4,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i do not even like the first 3 looks i just cannot get into avant garde or artistic makeup that deviates so far from the human face i guess i am old fashioned that way well in a lot of ways lol i like makeup being used to enhance women appearances ,5,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325, there an increased hift on the part of consumers to expect companies to make choices based not on the ability to make a buck but on the overall goodness of their message yes audiences totally forget that these are businesses and their goal is to make money and seeking profit is not a bad thing ,4,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325, i think the make up is harsh overdone and unflattering absolutely and yet women are copying these looks at best they end up looking like escorts haha,4,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,yes we should really have a whole post to just talk about men in the beauty community there are so many men who are famous now for applying makeup as if they were women it creepy and weird and annoying that even feminists are praising these men when many feminists hate on women who enjoy makeup ,8,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,lol yes agreed 1000 ,11,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,here are some of mine i am pro fat shaming without social pressure large people are not going to be incentivised to change for the better i do not even think that fashionable clothing should be made in plus sizes if you are not a large or below you should not be wearing things like crop tops short shorts or see through clothing anyways every woman should spend at least 1 hour in the morning and 1 hour in the evening on appearance and self care in addition to regularly working out and eating an appropriate amount to maintain a trim figure cultural appropriation does not happen as often as people like to complain about today people can be inspired by other cultures and want to include influences and references to other cultures with their look diversity is the norm today people are exposed to all sorts of aesthetics and if they want to incorporate them into a product or look that is not automatically evil the sensitivity of sjws is causing them to put every ethnic group in a box so that black people can only do x and white people can only do y i wear makeup to look more attractive it is not self expression it is not art i wear it to look sexually appealing to my man and to look socially acceptable to everyone else everyone looks better with makeup on as long as it applied correctly of course i enjoy applying makeup it fun it a hobby but it is not a selfish act or a feminist act to paint my face every day lol ,35,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,those before and afters are great they really underscore just how much we can change if we really put in the time and effort ,8,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,i love this post so much because it makes it clear that there is no excuse for being unattractive so much is within our control and i love the charts he makes to show exactly where priorities should be i also really like that he includes nakedness as a factor because it true slightly revealing outfits are more attractive than being totally covered up enhancing our femininity in every way includes highlighting our bodies this post is definitely one to bookmark or even print out use it to help plan your self improvement it also something accessible that could be shared with your friends without starting an argument ,6,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,you are welcome i am excited too thanks for joining us ,6,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,hi welcome to fnf i am so happy you are here d ,7,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,so glad you have joined us 3,5,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,welcome to fnf d i definitely want the sub to have guides and tutorials in addition to discussions and yes embrace the sub say whatever is on your mind re trump it gets so frustrating and disappointing to see nearly every comment section turn into a trump hate fest you almost cannot escape it ,5,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,thanks again for reaching out to me after that disaster on the other sub we would not have a sub otherwise 3,9,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325, my personal perspective on the left and its subsequent influences on fashion beauty and personal demeanor in general is that it does a massive disservice to women by pushing agendas that do not lead to long term happiness and fulfillment absolutely and so well put even though feminists claim to be about choice and freedom they only support women who choose specific things and exercise their freedom in specific ways just look at how many women who oppose abortion were treated as enemies during the women march if the words of prominent leaders from feminist history are not enough to convince people that they do not have women best interest in mind hopefully they notice what modern feminists are up to ,8,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,omg yes michelle fashion prowess is mostly media hype and even when she looks her best she cannot compare to melania have you seen all of the online magazine articles praising michelle taste and questioning melania fake news lol this hilariously illustrates the difference between the two https i ytimg com vi l gltliqbgi maxresdefault jpg ,7,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,yay so excited about this new sub i am 22 in texas and i have loved all things beauty related since i was a baby i am constantly reading and researching and while reddit is not my fav site the layout is perfect for discussions i hope that we can have a great community here on fnf discussing both beauty and beauty culture ,13,FeminineNotFeminist
camille11325,everyone on rpwives is invited to join r femininenotfeminist fnf is a community where women can discuss all things beauty related with like minded women we are all about having fun and celebrating femininity this subreddit was created because we saw how badly the reddit beautysphere needed a space for those with non pc opinions many of us were keeping silent because we knew our comments would lead to downvotes hostility and conflict r femininenotfeminist is a space where these controversial subjects and ideas are no longer off limits looking forward to seeing you over there 3 ,1,RedPillWives
camille11325,such a great idea thank you for writing this up ,4,RedPillWives
camille11325, i am embarrassed to say this but for the longest time when my husband had a tough day at work i would try to outdo him and prove that ai had a tough day too i wanted him to know that i was working hard too but actually i was just making him feel more tired this is such an important realisation that you had it normal for women to try to out do or share similar experiences because it part of how we bond but this can be draining or annoying to our men so great that you noticed and changed for the better ,7,RedPillWives
camille11325,haha i totally understand ,4,RedPillWives
camille11325,omg congratulations this challenge was made up specifically for february but we will definitely have more challenges in the future ,2,RedPillWives
camille11325,so glad you are participating 3,3,RedPillWives
camille11325, d,2,RedPillWives
camille11325,looking forward to hearing how the challenge works for you ,2,RedPillWives
camille11325,lovely list going to dedicate a spread in my bullet journal to these self care tips ,3,RedPillWives
camille11325,what a lovely idea this is also good timing for m and i our lives have settled down considerably after a chaotic 2016 i have already come up with some ideas for week 1 and cannot wait to share them with everyone on wednesday ,3,RedPillWives
camille11325,yay the first official post will be this weds so be sure to comment then ,3,RedPillWives
camille11325, i am sorry that my statement triggered you and that you felt i was painting men as abusive feel better now this tone is not necessary you can have a disagreement with someone without resorting to passive aggressive remarks your ideas are at odds with the subreddit and anyone has the right to question what you are saying if you want to discuss and defend your position you must do so respectfully ,5,RedPillWives
camille11325,your claim that dependency on someone else to be able to live led to domestic abuse and increased divorce rates is not an accurate representation of the female experience throughout us history it is also not an accurate description of what the overwhelming majority of sahms and part time workers who are dependent on their husbands experience to me it is clear that you are missing the actual point of the article and as i said before there are several fabulous comments that explain the message further if you sincerely think that anyone here is opposed to women taking care of themselves or earning money you are mistaken please stop making up strawmen and lose the attitude in general ,5,RedPillWives
camille11325,maybe it was not your intention but your word choice and tone definitely made it seem like you were mocking us be more mindful of this in the future please i am glad you are just now participating in the sub personally i lurked for half a year before posting and then another 6 months before making an original submission lol when we hit 2 000 subs we are going to have another general chat intro thread so be sure to participate in that also you may be interested in our irc room we have more in depth discussions and debates ,4,RedPillWives
camille11325,your comment shows a complete ignorance of us history and the fact that you are trying to minimize feminist ideas so that it just about trying to take care of yourself makes it clear that you do not understand feminism either please read the rest of the comments in this thread to get a better understanding of what the article was getting at ,7,RedPillWives
camille11325, but in the end we are women are we are different than men red pilling is about embracing and honoring those difference it not about sitting back putting our feet up and saying i have a husband i do not have to work now it about knowing we have a crucial role in the relationship that just happens to be different than his role embrace the womanhood the femininity because feminine guys suck exactly and when you spend so much time focusing on how to be more like men you are not developing the feminine skills that would be very useful in a marriage and that only makes it more likely that your marriage will fail and then you will need all those male skills you honed nothing about being a redpill wife says you have to give up your finances or job as many comments here seem to be getting stuck on but there needs to be a feminine masculine dynamic in the home for a successful marriage that rp right ,4,RedPillWives
camille11325,yes thank you agreed completely ,7,RedPillWives
camille11325,focusing on one aspect of an issue is not the same as being naive or ignoring nuance the author has hundreds of blog posts where she explores everything related to rp antifeminism relationships and culture she does not need to have every post bring up every possible argument and counter argument she just wanted to zoom in on a specific thought that interested her you have repeatedly characterised her and our community as oblivious and shallow and this is your first and only official warning to stop i viewed this post more as a rumination on a modern issue and not a specific actionable plan that everyone should act on immediately and the very fact that some of the ideas cannot be easily implemented is part of the discussion feminism pushed for women to join the male workforce which had a huge impact on the economy and on the lifestyles people expected now that they had more money coming in it is actually entirely possible to live on one income but you wo not have the same lifestyle as your peers that being said on rpw we are not anti women having jobs there is a difference between bringing in money and being a career woman this post is relevant because it looks at one of the ways that the system perpetuates itself even women who prefer more traditional roles and or dynamics encourage their daughters and peers to have the attitudes and skills that are necessary to advance along the feminist path the time that women spend focusing on being a great student and employee could be used to develop other skills so many women are unprepared to be wives and mothers and so many women do not think about other possibilities that would allow them to have money while also being available for their men on the individual level it is 100 possible that parents who are aware of how bad feminism is could refuse to indoctrinate their children and encourage them to seek out a more fulfilling path who cares if these ideas cannot be implemented simultaneously and en masse that is not a very good way to judge an idea or a blog post ,4,RedPillWives
camille11325,yes exactly ,1,RedPillWives
camille11325,it not naive it examining the issue and asking us to reconsider ideas that are taken for granted in mainstream society looking at how things are vs how things used to be vs how things could be is important when you look at what actually makes the majority of women happy and what actually makes the majority of men happy it is clear that the feminist narrative is wrong the values we instill in people today push them along paths that are not fulfilling and the effects are not just on the individual level our entire economy and culture has shifted to the point for many people it is near impossible to turn things around and adhere to a more traditional lifestyle the distance between what people innately want to do and what we are conditioned to want to do is something worth discussing ,5,RedPillWives
camille11325,i do not think that this article or anyone on the sub advocates that women do not do anything to develop themselves i am not sure if you are aware of the connotations that independence has when feminists advocate for it should women be able to pay all of their bills absolutely but there is a question of priorities and values and mindset the lifestyle that is encouraged in the mainstream causes women to not even have many of the skills necessary for a successful marriage you worry about women who put all their eggs in one basket but so many women are running away from any sort of risk when it comes to relationships and this only leads to more unhappiness vulnerability is essential trust is essential and if a woman develops wife skills she will a be less likely to have her man leave him and b be positioned to remarry in a way that women who solely focused on work skills are not ,12,RedPillWives
camille11325,you can have a steady income and even be financially independent without subscribing to the rest of feminist ideas and values i do not think the two go hand in hand and i felt that the article does a good job pointing out a lot of the ways that women are conditioned to accept 100 of feminist and bp worldview instead of picking out the truths and ignoring the rest another example of this would be the idea that believing that women should receive education or the right to vote automatically makes you a feminist it is entirely possible to believe in both without being a feminist there are hundreds if not thousands of ideologies and political positions feminism does not have a monopoly on the idea of equal application of the law to both genders just like it does not have a monopoly on the idea of women being able to financially support themselves but we should also question what it means to be independent and what values and skills we are passing on to our daughters and encouraging in our peers are not we hurting women when we act like the only alternative to being financially vulnerable is being a career focused woman who does not value marriage or men are not we hurting women when being financially vulnerable and or dependent on someone else is looked down upon that is certainly a perspective that can be scrutinized ,5,RedPillWives
camille11325,please explain how your comment is in line with what we advocate in rpw ,3,RedPillWives
camille11325,one thing that i have heard from couples that have been together for 10 years is that you have to continue to date each other i think that setting aside time as your schedule allows is a great way to maintain the fire because you are always intentionally doing things to preserve the sense of lust and excitement a break from everyday life is essential and having a designated time where you do not worry about your responsibilities is so helpful in relieving the sense of pressure that may be weighing on you both m and i try to have a weekly official date night where we put in extra effort to look our best and go on a traditional date we choose any day thursday sunday and we do not talk about his work or anything stressful it all about having fun and enjoying each other tonight is actually a date night and i will be wearing some new lingerie as a surprise does anyone else have a regular date night ,5,RedPillWives
camille11325,yay yes feel free to pm me ,2,RedPillWives
camille11325, i am kinda contesting this in my response because i do not think a man would sincerely strive for this beyond virtue signaling and even men who end up in lhl crave the respect they cannot command i agree with this completely personally i think that traditional dynamics and rpw style relationships are the most rewarding for 99 of people but the question itself said that he was a feminist and wanted a feminist so i was giving an answer based on that hypothetical if a man thinks he wants equality and no traditional dynamics but you try to have an rpw esque relationship that is not rpw since not only are you not doing what he wants you are trying to change him and will probably cause friction if he wants equality and no traditional dynamics and you go along with it it also not rpw hopefully that makes sense in the real world you and i are on the same page even if a man thinks he wants a feminist approved relationship he would be much happier with what we advocate here and applying rpw methods and concepts to your relationship would be the best way to keep him but that involves him changing his mind about what he wants in a relationship ,2,RedPillWives
camille11325,you are right that you can use rpw methods with most men to keep them but if a man truly wants a feminist woman and an equal relationship agreeing to that would be not rp you are technically doing what he wants but rpw is not just about following your man the real question would be would you want to keep this man if his worldview differs greatly from yours and if he going to lead you to places you disagree ideologically one of the first steps of vetting would be having respect for him so what would that take the same question would go for core values and religion absolutely ,3,RedPillWives
camille11325,agreed 100 ,2,RedPillWives
camille11325,thanks for posting this watching now and will share comments later here a funny image i found https i reddituploads com 2a21e7d9ef0946f194992a99d47dae77 fit max h 1536 w 1536 s 89ebb2d3ab433cd12208d197868f2c73 that i imagine fits in nicely with the message of this video ,9,RedPillWives
camille11325, you do not think someone could advocate for feminism but in their personal life prefer traditional male led dynamics honestly this is probably the majority of women that i meet they only think about feminism in the grande scheme but they go out of their way to honor respect and support their bfs husbands most people do not break down and analyze feminism as deeply as we do here sure people can do that they just are not rpws you do not have to analyze feminism or politics in depth to be an rpw plenty of conservative right wing women do not look at things too deeply but they are anti feminist and have rp relationships even w o knowing of the concept rpw is inherently anti feminist it is part of the definition of what it means to be rp additionally i have a very hard time believing obama would not be considered a good man disagree with his politics all you like but he is a well spoken high achieving man who held the highest office regardless of what he calls himself he a good catch he is attractive a good provider and a powerful man plenty of people would consider him a catch but most non liberals wo not because his worldview values and actions are all factored into how we assess a man you cannot just handwave this by saying disagree with his politics all you like because his politics are integral to how he attained any sort of status everything you said in this comment is entirely up to debate is he well spoken he has a teleprompter and speech writers and he regularly messes up both with and without those aids and since when is well spoken more important than shares the same outlook i do about the world when judging men is he high achieving he has certainly done things but if you disagree with what he has done then the number of achievements is actually a bad thing the fact that a person achieves something does not erase the weight of what it is that they achieved sure he was president but he does not have the best reputation and the rank alone does not determine if a man is good or not to me he is not attractive i am not sure where you are getting that he is a good provider and his reputation is not one of a powerful man not just with other countries but within his own marriage i just completely disagree that he is a good catch but again there are liberal women who would love to date him but their relationship would not be rp not one masculine man that i have met has been a feminist this was true throughout school and it true now that my social circle is mostly people 30 60 years old ,3,RedPillWives
camille11325, it just makes me think that the way you view these relationships has an effect on the outcome love this if you still see the man as a friend and cannot admit to dating him it going to stay that way i think a lot of women do this to protect themselves emotionally because they know that this man is not going to commit to them even if they really want it and are hoping he does refusing to call him a hookup or some other obvious short term label makes them feel more secure but they legitimately cannot say he a boyfriend because there is no exclusivity or official relationship and they do not want to say dating or seeing each other or some other thing because even if they want it they know that there is not a future there ,2,RedPillWives
camille11325,lol she looks like a man too there a reason that half the internet jokes about her being a tranny all the time ,2,RedPillWives
camille11325,i personally do not believe that any good men are feminist but regardless rp is inherently anti feminist pro male led relationships pro traditional dynamics and pro embracing male and female nature feminism is literally the opposite of that so it would be impossible to be both rp w and a feminist rpw is not just about following men just like how feminism is not just about equal rights haha,6,RedPillWives
camille11325,awesome ,2,RedPillWives
camille11325,this would make an excellent post lot that we could discuss as a community both in general and in terms of specific advice for your situation ,5,RedPillWives
camille11325,this would make an excellent post ,2,RedPillWives
camille11325,congratulations on this realisation it does not matter if it obvious to anyone else it is wonderful that you have learned something new that will benefit your relationship definitely post a fr when you can ,1,RedPillWives
camille11325,i have noticed this too ,1,RedPillWives
camille11325,makes sense although women can be outspoken and rpw at the same time ,3,RedPillWives
camille11325,love all of these ,1,PurplePillDebate
camille11325,yes his relationship with his wife is great i am trying to put to words some thoughts that i am having about women with high dominance thresholds our compassion for the hypermasculine is definitely not the norm and i am not sure if this is strictly an lh thing or if hh women feel the same way i could see hh women seeing these men as peers and partners in crime and possibly sharing a similar sense of alienation from the female sphere when i think of something legitimate i will let you know probably in irc i doubt it ll be coherent enough for reddit haha,1,RedPillWives
camille11325,absolutely and i am sure this is partially why even in legitimate careers there is so much corruption and conspiracy they need the risk thrill extra power and control these men are ambitious and will always try to get a better deal for themselves and expand their dominion greater betas and lesser alphas are rewarded the most in civilisations and with feminism poisoning everyone against real men it only further alienates the hypermasculine why would they feel any allegiance to official laws and processes have you seen narcos at all pablo escobar at least as portrayed in the show breaks my heart he truly is a tragic figure ,1,RedPillWives
camille11325,i disagree with this rpw is more than does not make a scene or publicly contradict her man and it is more than agreeable pleasant good at conversation etc unless the woman is clearly yielding to the leadership of her man respecting his masculinity and all the other things we talk about they are not examples of rpw michelle obama is publicly a feminist and actually has a reputation as someone who is controlling and selfish having good pr and knowing how to pose does not make you a good wife ,8,RedPillWives
camille11325,seeing as hillary does not believe in rp or rpw ideas her actions are not rpw since they are not motivated by traditional dynamics or respect for masculinity ,9,RedPillWives
camille11325,i tell m when i need time for myself and i use those exact words it helps to be specific because if you do not communicate that you want space for a period of time the other person may want to talk to you hang out do some activity and then when you decline they feel unwanted it also can make you want to retreat even further because you feel like this person is intruding it all about how you say it personally i just say m i need to reset recharge so i will be in the bedroom in the gym on the couch taking a walk if i just said i will be on the couch he may come over in a few minutes to try to talk to me this exact scenario actually happened before and i was unreasonably frustrated by him because i did not make it clear what i needed at the time he knows me more than anyone but he is not a mind reader perhaps this is an intro extro thing my default is wanting to be with others and wanting human interaction so when i want to be alone it a distinct feeling and i have to alter my usual actions in order to have that alone time that being said i feel like she used examples of not pleasing instead of examples of giving i talk about this more in my comment really interested in hearing your thoughts on my takeaways i think that a big distinction in the two mentalities is that pleasing ultimately is rooted in fear whereas giving comes from confidence and security pleasing is about avoiding negative consequences and giving is about creating positive consequences pleasing is more passive in a way since the feelings of others take precedence in contrast giving requires a sense of agency you have to actively decide when and how to use your resources and your feelings are a top priority i agree with your criticisms of her sex example and i am not sure why she did not present better evidence for her points she really missed some opportunities to explore the subject ,2,RedPillWives
camille11325,while not perfect this blog post makes a lot of great points about what is truly motivating women when they do things for others many of us are compelled to be generous kind forgiving accommodating flexible cooperative etc these natural instincts are great but the way we act on them is important doing something helpful so that another person does not stop liking you is something done by a woman with nothing else to offer if you have value to others whether it is your looks personality skills insight or a combination you should be more confident and not stoop to people pleasing bending over backwards and or being a doormat for your man is not the same thing as yielding to his leadership or being his soft place to land one example that she gives of pleasing really illustrates this point if you have plans with a friend and your man asks if you want to do x tonight you can say well susan and i were going to do y can we do x later if you truly want to do y if he is asking what you want to do be honest do not just say what you think he wants to hear because you are afraid he will leave you now there were also some parts that i did not like she defines giving at the beginning but then her examples include instances of a woman simply not pleasing giving is not the same as not pleasing it its own thing it is acting from a place of feminine power and bringing joy to others by sharing your value is it better to have no sex than have bad sex yes but it even better to have great sex and that would be the example of giving is it better to opt out of things than run yourself down absolutely but giving would be participating and being awesome at whatever the activity is you do not have to give 24 7 or indiscriminately but at least to me giving is always the addition of a positive element into any situation let me know what you thought ,6,RedPillWives
camille11325,melania definitely is very poised beautiful and at least publicly a supportive wife and good mother personally i trust that she is wonderful behind closed doors as well no one is perfect of course but i do not get the same vibe that i did from michelle who not only has rbf she has a reputation for being controlling and rude ,2,RedPillWives
camille11325,m and i just started watching narcos no spoilers and i have been thinking about how so many hypermasculine men do not have many legitimate avenues in civilized societies those that are born in certain classes can go into politics business and other fields that allow them to use their strengths those who have athletic talent can go into sports and then of course there are the armed forces and high risk blue collar jobs but what about the men who have aggression ambition leadership skills a strategic mind dt traits etc but cannot do any of those things it is not surprising at all that they would form gangs mafias and other similar organisations and try to run the local neighborhoods these men are wired to be tribal leaders and society is organised in a way where people do not have as much power on the local level both narcos and the wire show just how sophisticated the organization of these drug empires were the men who led them were brilliant creating essentially their own government economy and culture yes there are people who are just evil and also people who do evil things i am not a fan of the terror that many criminals and criminal organizations create amongst their own people but i still feel so much compassion for hypermasculine men who are basically displaced from their own cultures due to technological advancements new political structures and systems with rules that penalize their character ,4,RedPillWives
camille11325,lol i did not get that impression of her at all ,2,RedPillWives
camille11325,lol absolutely love this video it is both hilarious and completely true my fav part is when he makes the point that the only reason these women look better is because they spent hours on hair makeup and clothing which is exactly what so many men and women try to tell these fat girls put some effort into yourself ,2,RedPillWives
camille11325,also wanted to add that i agree and this is exactly why women occupied a different role in society throughout most of western history ,1,The_Donald
camille11325,you know the narrative of female oppression is not even historically accurate right women were always put on a pedestal in the west they were protected and occupied a different role in society but they were not horribly mistreated like feminists like to claim women at every level of society either worked or were involved in their community in some way if you look at the literature films and other media produced at this time it shows just how much freedom everyday women had and if a woman did not care about traditional roles different groups of women exercised tons of rights eg prostitutes owning property and guns and doing all sorts of things even back in the 1800s the thing is when given the chance most women actively choose a life that is more traditional feminists crafted a narrative and have been warping everyone understanding for nearly a century if you look up the statements of prominent second wave feminists you can see exactly how they intentionally poisoned everyone understanding of women roles in the west ,2,The_Donald
camille11325,the term natural rights is a philosophical concept that was integral to the establishment of america here is a brief overview https en wikipedia org wiki natural and legal rights that distinguishes between natural rights and legal rights however the main takeaway is that natural rights are present from birth and not granted by any government or ruler in addition to my belief in natural rights and natural law i have what is known as a constrained vision of human nature this means that i believe in an unchanging human nature i believe that man is self interested and flawed here is more information https en wikipedia org wiki a conflict of visions on the theory of constrained vs unconstrained visions i am curious to know if you identify with the latter the book a conflict of visions is amazing if you are interested in politics philosophy and or history understanding that these are two things i consider axiomatic hopefully you can see why i want a government that limits itself as much as possible i believe that in the right conditions local groups churches families and charities will care for those in need there has been a systematic dismantling of the nuclear family and this has made more people dependent on the state than ever so no i do not believe that healthcare is an intrinsic right i also do not believe that anyone has the right to not be in debt i support low taxes and want as much money in the pockets of the citizens so that they can spend it freely i don t think anyone should be compelled to have health insurance or pay for anyone else s i do believe that insurance companies should prioritise both health and profits and do not support the corruption that has occurred similarly i do not think that women deserve to have anyone pay for their birth control or other elective health services not only is it not fair for those who oppose birth control to have to contribute their money to it it just isn t anyone else s responsibility to ensure that a woman doesn t have children viagra isn t an equal comparison at all considering its purpose but i also don t think we should pay for that lol in terms of abortion even if you believe that the baby is not alive until it is born i don t think it is strictly a woman s issue at this moment in time women have 100 of the decision making power and the father has no legal right in this arena at all if he does not want to be the father he is still forced to pay money for years and years whereas if a woman doesn t want to be a mother she can end the pregnancy without his permission there are actually a lot of great secular arguments against the current abortion laws and feminist culture surrounding the issue a baby s heart starts beating at around 6 weeks there are a lot of other developmental milestones that could be used to justify signs of life and therefore it would make the baby under the jurisdiction of the government and entitled to rights it no longer becomes an issue of autonomy or choice but rather a question of licit vs illicit killing i won t dwell too much on this particular subject though re the question of taste i think it is distasteful for anyone to make such statements even if it was against obama when it comes to the speech she did not intentionally plagiarize michelle s words she explained exactly what happened and michelle s speech was actually inspired by an earlier speech made by a different political woman about her husband i will find a link about this and add it in i think it s great that you are aware that your views aren t the default but hopefully you see the instances where others are not while i would love it if every person was able to be healthy safe sheltered clothed educated and fed i believe there are other ways of achieving this goal besides strong government intervention and taxation not that it would even be possible to 100 fix things but again this is a conflict between constrained vs unconstrained visions it s interesting that you don t want me to lump you in with extremists but then wrap up your posts insinuating that i believe that people deserve to die hopefully i ve clarified my perspective edit typos ,2,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,hahaha i actually googled it and found a few references to the site being a secret whites only thing but i have no idea if it just a rumor or meme ,3,RedPillWives
camille11325,i know the post specifically mentions christianity but i thought we could have a discussion about the similar messages that women get both from people in their lives and the media have you had conversations like this or have you come across it in your entertainment there is a real crabs in a bucket mentality to a lot of women they just do not want others to be happier than they are and find ways to drag them back down ,5,RedPillWives
camille11325,i appreciate you taking the time to explain why you feel the way you do your passion for your beliefs is evident and i am not going to try to change your mind we have entirely different worldviews from the very first premises to the last conclusions i personally am a firm believer in traditional western culture and values i enjoy the works of various thinkers throughout time aristotle aquinas the founding fathers thomas sowell etc i am not a republican or a tradcon and have numerous frustrations with both groups some that even overlap with you i do not share the same fears that you do when looking at donald trump plan i feel hope and patriotism i believe that each person is born with natural rights that are intrinsic and when we have the freedom to exercise these rights without interference from the government we can flourish at this point in time donald trump is the candidate that puts americans back on that path as i stated earlier i am not a fan of the biased coverage that he received but more than that i have a completely different set of values and therefore some things that he has legitimately said or done i do not consider an issue one thing that i have observed and experienced first hand throughout the election cycle is the hypocrisy of those who oppose trump not only has there been extreme violence hatred racism and even sexism expressed towards trump and his supporters there have been several false hate crimes perpetrated by those on the left themselves in times of crisis and conflict one true character is revealed i was never a fan of the democratic party or other groups on the left but my opposition is cemented now to bring this back to beauty i do not find statements like not my president to be tasteful at all and while you may not be able to see this posting support of things like women marches casual insults about trump and his supporters framing women who agree with him as traitors diminishing melania style sense and beauty etc are all examples of bias not neutrality not morality a lot of people on the left assume that their position is the obvious answer the obvious and default way of understanding the world maybe people just do not understand that there are legitimately different ways of looking at things when you dismiss people as hateful bigots you dismiss the efforts and ideas of centuries of brilliant philosophers writers and politicians you dismiss the foundations of the west ,-3,muacjdiscussion

camille11325,donald trump actual plans for the country are what matter the most to me this is a document https assets donaldjtrump com landings contract o tru 102316 contractv02 pdf that he has published outlining exactly what he plans to do within his first 100 days he was one of the only candidates against tpp and one of the only candidates who prioritized the safety and prosperity of american citizens above all else i could go on but this is a makeup sub feel free to pm me if you want to have a longer conversation about his platform and how he is reinvigorating american culture for the better i will say that while i am a woman gender is completely irrelevant to my political opinions i completely disagree with the way the media has portrayed him and do not find him sexist racist xenophobic etc in fact he has been quite liberal throughout his life and he has been a friend of the democratic party for decades he regularly hired both minorities and women at a time when others in his industry were not and a lot of his more recent statements and positions have been twisted taken out of context or outright lied about to bring this back to the subject of the op i have been very turned off by companies and influencers who tear down mock and insult those who hold different opinions labeling every trump supporter as a woman hater or racist pushes us away and it certainly does not inspire us to reconsider your perspective edit typos,0,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,we are on the same page and you are welcome it rare to see other women for trump outside of a few subreddits one of which i moderate so that pretty nice so this was a fun exchange glad i could brighten your day d maga ,-7,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,absolutely based on today i bet that there are at least a handful of women who read this sub who agree with us and are staying silent to avoid drama frustration ,5,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,lol great find some of these are pretty normal and it cool i guess that this is out there for them allergies stds horse lovers etc i have no idea why i am thinking this but i feel like i heard that the farmer site was a white supremacist site does anyone else know what i am talking about maybe it not true and someone just made a joke or it was a dream that i had or possibly i am combining an episode of broad city with something else who knows that travel site is the most interesting to me it a great business idea and i bet women really take advantage of it the ugly ppl site is probably the funniest i was not prepared for that one haha thanks for sharing this ,6,RedPillWives
camille11325, boundaries like that can be a good thing though saves you from unnecessary frustration annoyance i have some personal rules about what i do and do not debate with people as well i read the sub daily and rarely comment but i was just so bothered by the way it appeared like all perspectives were welcomed but really only 1 or 2 opinions were considered acceptable ,-1,muacjdiscussion
camille11325, kinda fucked how women cannot respect another woman opinion but i guess there nothing you can do seriously i am glad you said something even if you are getting downvotes it is possible to support trump and have interesting things to contribute to a discussion on politics and beauty the fact that you were downvoted so much is just ridiculous are there any beauty companies that you know of that are pro trump i would totally support anyone who is brave enough to show their support too ,-4,muacjdiscussion
camille11325,so frustrating to see you and anyone else who supports trump getting downvoted for sharing their opinions i also support trump and voted for him why are our answers to the question less important if you only want to have comments from people who support your political opinions clarify in the op i was not even going to comment because i figured this would happen but i wanted to let you know that you are being heard i enjoy a lot of the conversation on this subreddit but the hostility towards those who have different opinions outside of a small window is very off putting ,-8,muacjdiscussion

camille11325,definitely posts like these try to make it seem like donald supporters are better liberals than the people who identify as liberal they reaffirm the idea that good inclusive and accepting of basically everyone the implied message is see we are normal we are moral totally buying into leftist standards ,1,The_Donald
camille11325,definitely not cool i am just going to lock the thread since all the rpw have stopped discussing the subject anyone who is a member of the community can start up more discussions about trans related things whenever they want and in the future we will be firmer with people coming in with blatant agendas thanks for your contributions ,2,RedPillWives
camille11325,i am not sure how many people will see this but i agree men have been exposed to more estrogen and modern carb filled diets do not promote testosterone in men ,5,RedPillWives
camille11325,it incredibly disturbing ,3,RedPillWives
camille11325,yep they definitely had agendas in the future we may limit random outside debaters though i do not mind if people who are regular participants have differing opinions and want to explore that in this thread everyone handled the two people very well and their comments did generate discussion but i completely understand not wanting to engage further a message to everyone report comments you do not want to see ,3,RedPillWives

camille11325, but if we are talking integrated messages from society as a whole they are mixed at best today and that a huge improvement over the very recent past so you agree that the pro trans messages are increasing this is a good thing from your perspective but terrible in my opinion it seems perfectly reasonable for a layperson who knows little about the subject to trust experts unless given very good reason not to yes this is human nature the issue is when this tendency is exploited and people are manipulated and or mislead i think there an important distinction to be made between genuinely internally disordered in the sense of not being able to accomplish your own goals and mismatched in the sense of being a round peg in a social square hole yep i agree with this as well the issue is that a lot of behaviours are being classified as a mental illness and or personality disorder when they don t fall in line with modern ideas of what is normal and ideal for example a lot of young boys have the add adhd label slapped on them because they can t succeed in a school system that increasingly punishes natural male personalities and behaviours the oppositional disorder that was discussed in the post i linked is similarly used to control children who don t fit in today and whose parents are at a loss what i do not buy is the increasing claims of a global conspiracy of thousands of scientists government organizations and social advocates to collectively turn society into a totalitarian liberal hellscape i m not sure how many people literally believe this exact scenario that you outlined what i believe and i have seen others argue is this there are many different groups of people with different agendas some of these groups are public others are hidden in addition to these groups there are individuals with their own agendas companies that also have goals genuine people who believe they are doing the right thing that may be part of any of the aforementioned companies or groups stupid people who are useful idiots for all of the above people who are completely unaware of what s actually going on wherever they are people who may or may not know but regardless don t care and whichever other groups you can come up with each of these coalitions and or individuals have agendas that compete with each other mutual interests align and outside factors have an impact there is no 1 conspiracy that encompasses everything else that all people are aware of and willingly participate in i very rarely see that argument presented what often happens is that people focus on some of the small powerful hidden groups and that can sometimes take on the tone of a master conspiracy since the people involved are indeed powerful in terms of a totalitarian liberal hellscape that is an excellent way to describe a very real reality that some groups do in fact want whether or not this is really possible in the near future i can t say but if you re a student of philosophy history and politics the end goal of leftist globalist elites is very apparent and also frightening particularly since you would think such a conspiracy first priority would be to you know not have republicans in unified control of government as they will be tomorrow afternoon have you been following the protests and false flags that have been going on throughout the election season that were funded by soros to delegitimize trump did you not see how hard nearly every mainstream media outlet tried to discredit trump and ruin his chance at winning it was nonstop propaganda every single day and it hasn t stopped now there is a coordinated effort occurring presently to derail his administration official websites popped up to promote violence tomorrow or rather in a few hours obama co have talked about setting up what will essentially be a shadow government they have not been quiet at all this entire time and they aren t giving up either and keep in mind when i say they i am referring to one of many groups as i mentioned earlier i could go on but there really so much on this subject alone stifling news stories and promoting false stories is the most obvious thing i can point you to in terms of conspiracy ,3,RedPillWives
camille11325, nor do i think you should since i happen to agree with them i do not agree with the media but i recognise that these messages are out there i do not deny that your experience is accurate and representative of what other trans people may go through as well growing up i just have a different perspective on both these things whereas you seemed to disagree with the idea that there was any support of trans people at all at least in your first comment as to your second point i personally believe that a lot of the official organizations have so much political influence and interference so this is why i used that term however i am aware that it is not technically accurate and failed to communicate the larger point i was trying to make in my initial comment so that one is on me i disagree with the idea that the article did not offer evidence of political motivation and your summary does not seem accurate either as far as the status of homosexuality being a settled question that is not relevant to the article at all the example was used to show how changes in how things are defined officially shapes the culture it not about gay people in the 70 being powerful that claim was never made the fact is the scientific opinion changed and the opinions of the public followed suit that why labeling actually normal behaviours as mental illnesses is so dangerous yes i agree that other organizations that have been mentioned in this thread are pushing conservative agendas i have not pointed to anything in my own posts precisely because of my stance on politics and medical definitions so what light sarcasm is now worse than calling my existence a liberal conspiracy to establish a totalitarian state and undermine the family you do not see maybe a little bit of asymmetry there no i asked you to continue respecting the rules implying that you have been respecting them which is great and that you are expected to continue just as you were a lot of times people who are not from our sub start out fine but then when enough people start disagreeing things turn ugly you have been fine and i was not trying to say that anything you would said so far was out of line it was just a clear reminder that all since this is a subject you are personally invested in ,2,RedPillWives
camille11325,your personal experiences do not invalidate the very real experiences that others have i have both read about and seen first hand exactly what i described there is an obvious pro trans message being promoted in the mainstream media and this is going to influence even those who do not have supportive parents you cannot ignore the tv shows newspaper articles magazine features and statements by influential people all in support of trans rights as far as medical definitions you realise that the government regularly changes what is classified as an aberration vs healthy for reasons not related to actual science right please read this for more information http www socialmatter net 2016 12 18 progressive twilight zone you clearly are not a member of this community and i have allowed you to interact with people on the issue because so far you have been fine in terms of attitude please continue to respect the rules of our subreddit as you discuss the subject with us ,5,RedPillWives
camille11325,agreed 100 ,3,RedPillWives
camille11325,this is so cool it really confirms a lot of conventional wisdom eg the idea of someone being in or out of your league and it is totally in line with what we discuss on rpw all the time compatibility is just more likely when the people themselves are similar ,5,RedPillWives
camille11325,i love everything about this comment and agree completely by taking this natural hierarchy of power away men have forgotten how to be men and have stopped enforcing standards within their family community and everyone suffering for it this is just a perfect summation of what is happening right now we all need standards boundaries rules guidelines expectations and norms that is how cultures preserve themselves and develop without weakening when fathers are the head of the family and maintain a certain family culture the effects are felt throughout all levels of society ,5,RedPillWives
camille11325,i am in agreement with u phantomdream09 you did not need to give any explanation a simple thanks for the invite but i cannot hope you all have fun was all you needed your response was actually rude in comparison to what you could have said if you were so worried about being offensive why would you say directly that you did not like the other women that is only going to make people dislike you and or feel hurt if you just said something similar to the example that i gave they would not have given it a second thought you really over thought this and ended up doing something that was not the best course of action if you wanted to be polite in addition the situation you were struggling with is not a situation where rpw even applies these women are not your husband and your attendance at the event did not involve your man you do not need to submit or yield to these women you are not obligated to be their gofl if you are worried about not being too passive or too much of a people pleaser understand that it is possible to be assertive without going too far in the opposite direction you can be sweet and fun without being a doormat and you have zero reason to be this way to those who have not earned it now another thing to keep in mind your message itself is not a huge deal at all and what you sent is not even an issue in the grand scheme of things it is impolite but it not un ladylike or anything it was a simple text i just wanted to speak to the mindset and conclusions you drew from this experience because they do not really line up with your actions ,7,RedPillWives
camille11325,i believe that there are only two sexes and do not like how sex gender gender identity gender roles and sexuality have all been separated from each other as concepts legitimate transgendered people are mentally ill and not actually experiencing some sort of biological crisis that being said there are a lot of people who believe themselves to be the wrong gender for many reasons other than gender identity dysphoria or whatever the official name for the condition is to answer your questions i do not think it is possible for children to be trans at all could some people have symptoms of the dysphoria present at early ages sure but i do not think we can accurately diagnose these kids since there are so many factors and possibilties growing up and figuring out how to understand and deal with hormones romantic feelings lust curiosity and everything else is hard enough for regular kids it is perfectly understandable that a child might develop feelings for a same sex friend or like certain aspects of the other sex without actually being gay or trans there is such a strong pro gay and pro trans movement right now and so much encouragement for people to identify as either or both i think this pushes children who are going through normal phases into lifestyles and choices that they would have grown out of naturally or with some encouragement from their parents and peers it is absolutely despicable that adults are intervening in the natural development of their children and forcing their politics on these kids lives even without medical procedures the choices parents are making are dangerous to the mental and social health of their children i think the absence of strong male leaders in the home is responsible what actual masculine man is going to be okay with his son wearing makeup and prancing around in dresses what masculine man is totally fine with his daughter rejecting her feminine beauty and engaging in alternative deviant lifestyles i read the other day that there were new rules in place that would prevent doctors from refusing procedures for trans people that they previously would have opposed for scientific moral or religious reasons this would mean that people would have to participate in all sorts of sexual reassignment procedures against their will and medical judgement it all just so terrible and the fact that parents are voluntarily pushing their children into these situations is the worst families are not democracies just because a kid feels a certain way one day does not mean he gets to make his own medical decisions parents have a responsibility to make sure their child grows up to be functional well adjusted healthy people supporting trans delusions is the exact opposite ,11,RedPillWives
camille11325,yay ,2,RedPillWives
camille11325,right that the impression that i got from the article while on the sub we discuss the aspects of masculinity that are relevant to relationships we cannot forget that there are other dimensions that can be downright scary power force and aggression are all extremely masculine regardless of moral systems or personal emotions ,3,RedPillWives
camille11325,agreed 100 and you should totally start a discussion on the gender transition thing that would be a perfect post topic for the sub i will have to find the article but i read something about a new baby boom possibly occurring during trump administration i think it totally possible for all the reasons you said there is just so much hope possibility and energy now that we have not seen in a long time ,3,RedPillWives
camille11325,oh wow i did not realise how things were over there the only difference in italy is both the man and woman are out for themselves if there a sign of a problem they run there no sense of solving a problem together this is definitely a problem in america as well many women even go into marraiges assuming that they will divorce and most advice given on other parts of reddit is about leaving the other person there is no sense of commitment or loyalty and no not everyone deserves loyalty but to not even attempt to have a deeper relationship where both people are vulnerable and trusting so sad ,2,RedPillWives
camille11325,yes things have gotten absolutely ridiculous and i cannot wait until american men really reclaim their roles unfortunately i think we will have to have things get worse before the majority hit their breaking point if classes like the one you shared are not motivating people to try to change things i am not sure what will ,5,RedPillWives
camille11325,well this author actually is not in favour of democracy so while your points are valid in that he does not mention the things that you are saying he actually does not agree so that is why he does not bring it up regardless of preferred political systems i think he did a good job describing the ways that many are now reacting to the lefitst globalist agenda we see it on a grand scale with world leaders and on the local scale with everyday men and women calling feminists and sjws out on their bs i personally do not think that aggression bloodshed and any other means of demonstrating power are intrinsically bad there is a time and a place and the abysmal situation the world is in right now certainly justifies men taking back their cultures by force of course you are free to disagree and i believe that our opinions on democracy nobility and other things are going to prevent us from finding common ground but that totally fine thanks for reading the article and commenting always great to see your perspective ,3,RedPillWives
camille11325,right the fact that people are dying or the situation is not ideal does not change the premise of the post there is a strong masculine reaction happening right now there are positive and negative sides of masculinity force and power are going to have consequences it does not mean we cannot talk about them in a larger discussion of the global situation and i am not suggesting that you are saying we cannot talk about it just emphasizing the idea that personal connections and emotions cannot interfere with how we look at these things as u stingrayvc says in her comment the pushback to the modern cultural decay is not going to be quiet or peaceful or polite ,6,RedPillWives
camille11325,i am not too familiar with the situation over there and i am also not familiar with the author stance perhaps he expands on his position in other posts so far everything i have read on the site itself is gold so i am going to give the author the benefit of the doubt and not let one small thing ruin the article or the website itself there was a lot covered in the post and as i said in my comment i am very interested in discussing the male side of things since we focus on women primarily what were your thoughts on the main points of the article ,2,RedPillWives
camille11325,i look forward to us all discussing as a community some of the consequences that globalism leftism feminism etc has on masculinity we focus a lot on the female side of things but an understanding of the male mind is key to being a good companion this article gives a great overview of some of the ways that changes in culture have impacted men how does it line up with your experiences and observations ,5,RedPillWives

camille11325,great article loneliness is not often discussed as a consequence of feminism so this was a very interesting and refreshing read it so sad how isolated people are even though we have so many advancements that should be bringing us closer together feminism absolutely encourages selfishness and immaturity so i am glad this was brought up as well thanks for sharing it with the sub ,2,RedPillWives
camille11325,it both a communication issue and a fundamental disagreement about certain things i wo not try to change your mind but i will clarify the things that were misunderstood not everyone on the sub has to agree about every single thing but there are definitions and concepts that we all do have to at least agree are defined a certain way without a shared understanding of what an idea means discussion is impossible we are seeing right here exactly how communication can get complicated if people are not on the same page it not about force i am saying people can do whatever path they want when i used the term force it was to underscore the idea that we have autonomy and free will i was not implying that you were under the impression that anyone was forced i was making my own point about the range of possibilities and avenues available to every woman yes people can do what they want that has never been part of the discussion at least on my end of things who cares you don t care and that s fine my whole point is that completely separate from how anyone feels about how to meet men there are optimal and less optimal methods and there are scenarios that will yield higher or lower chances of success also individual women who seek dating advice may care about how they are perceived by their peers family coworkers etc it doesn t mean that anyone else on this sub has to change the way that they evaluate themselves and their relationship s history we can all have different value and ethical systems my arguments have been entirely removed from all of this and you seem to still think i m saying things that i m not it not any less rp to get a man through being a plate and then convincing him to marry you as it is to date a man hold off on sex until commitment and then convincing him to marry you now this is just objectively not true based on the definitions and concepts that we as a sub have agreed to it can be your personal opinion but it is not in line with the community s position my use of the term acceptable was not about morality it was about how well an idea fit into the definition of rpw sexual strategy i tried to be very explicit about this using terms like optimal efficient effective plans thoughtful intentional etc i also directly said at several points that a i was not speaking about morality and b there is no one rpw place or way to meet a man there are many great places and great ways the existence of a variety of different ways and methods the way and or method has no effect on the relationship you may not care about the method or the potential effects and consequences and you may not care about how others perceive your relationship none of that changes the fact that there is a connection between how things start off and how a relationship will actually function ,2,RedPillWives
camille11325,the first sentence of your comment is a personal attack please remove it the rest of your comment is gold but you are getting downvotes because of the insult also please see my comments to u sunhappy dc i talk about the source of the miscommunication on the subject you and i have been discussing something completely different it seems ,3,RedPillWives
camille11325,just wanted to quote myself to further clarify my position where to meet men i do not think that meeting a man at a bar or party is objectively un rpw there is not an rpw location to meet a man although there are certainly locations that are un rpw just like how there is no one way to dress as an rpw but plenty of ways that are un rpw to dress that being said the location is not the only factor so there can be both rpw and non rpw ways to meet men at a bar just as there can be rpw and non rpw ways to meet a man at church what is considered trashy vs normal vs ideal differs based on location class ethnic group and more an understanding of what is valued in your circles is certainly important even if you do not follow it i do not think there is anything wrong with viewing specific places and ways of meeting and dating as immoral tacky bad or any other negative value judgement but i did want to clarify that in my discussions i have been focusing on the probabilities and consequences of meeting men in certain ways not the ethics or popularity of the behaviour ,3,RedPillWives

camille11325, correct in the smp that exists as it does right now there are so many variable ways women interact with potential boyfriends and husbands and it not always pretty or clean or ideal that just the cards we were all dealt all of us yes but we are not forced to follow a specific path just because we are dealt certain cards there is a lot in our control and the status quo of the smp doesn t have to dictate our personal sexual strategy just because other women are doing x doesn t mean you shouldn t do y if y will get you to where you want more effectively knowledge of the smp and what works and does not work is part of rpw sexual strategy when crafting a specific dating plan you don t just rely on theories you apply them to your situation no one can do anything perfectly the fact that things aren t clean or ideal doesn t mean that there aren t optimal paths i personally do not care how someone gets their so and the truth is most people do not either you can meet him anywhere you could be fuck buddies in college before deciding after 6 months that you both want something more serious and then commit to a relationship you could meet at 15 and decide to court each other without so much as kissing ever until 18 and then marrying you could be 35 and best friends for 15 years and then deciding you want to be with each other and grow old together who cares i think this feeling right here is the source of miscommunication between us when i see you write it doesn t matter how you get your man it doesn t translate to i personally don t care how someone gets their so due to the context of the rest of your comment and the op itself which was all about strategy now that you are expanding i see that you are talking about value judgements and your personal opinion your first comment did not give this impression it appeared that you were making definitive statements about female sexual strategy and the validity or lack thereof of the rpw approach at different stages of the relationship does what i m saying make sense the fact that you personally don t care or that others in the country don t care how a relationship begins doesn t mean that the way a relationship starts has no bearing on the potential success of the relationship this is completely separate from any ethical systems or value judgements that is the point i ve been making the feelings and how others perceive your relationship had no part in my comments i ve only been speaking about probability and consequences individual women can do whatever they want with men but if and when they obtain a relationship with a man there are basic things that men expect from their sos regardless of background or the methods to which you got him to want to be with you rpw is excellent in that regardless of who the woman is or how she met her guy if she a popular sorority girl a rock chick a goth a sperg loser anything she can draw from what is discussed and make an individual relationship plan that works for her like do not be a shrew do not get in fights with him respect him in so and so ways stay attractive to him based on his preferences etc right and this was never something i felt was being questioned but on the real a lot of what we discuss is not practical pre commitment in today smp a lot of it can solely be implemented once in a relationship the whole point of rpw is coming up with a plan that makes sense for your life and your situation as i said in my post it s about being efficient and effective using resources strategically etc is it not practical for a woman to think ahead vet men put effort into her appearance be fun and engaging with men avoid becoming a plate or any other ambiguous relationship zone single women who have an accurate understanding of their rmv male nature and their local smp can approach dating with an advantage that the average woman does not have yes it takes more effort but that s because the results are worth it if anything is not practical for an individual it means either their plan is wrong or they need to improve themselves and get more discipline motivation self awareness some other missing trait there is a lot in rpw that is restricted to relationships yes but that doesn t mean that rpw has no place outside of a relationship girl game traditional dynamics and good character are important at every step i don t believe the definition of rpw is as limited as a lot of people seem to think i may make a post about this in the future it does not matter what is acceptable feminism for a good segment of the smp is considered acceptable again you are arguing something i have not been saying i am actually going to take this idea further and use it to reinforce what i have been saying about going against the grain in the smp it does not matter what other women are doing rpw is about looking out for your self interest not being acceptable a good portion of women in this sub met their men in what would have been unacceptable ways 50 30 even 15 years ago but they have a man who they want to keep we can absolutely help them with that of course and again never said anything contrary to this but like i said to iris just because rpw can help people who are in bad relationships or who started relationships out via a certain way does not mean that single women do not need to be thoughtful or intentional when dating also i do want to clarify that i do not think that meeting a man at a bar or party is objectively un rpw this will be something i expand on in that future post i mentioned there is not an rpw location to meet a man although there are certainly locations that are un rpw just like how there is no one way to dress as an rpw but plenty of ways that are un rpw to dress that being said the location is not the only factor so there can be both rpw and non rpw ways to meet men at a bar just as there can be rpw and non rpw ways to meet a man at church ,1,RedPillWives
camille11325,and your advice is always wonderful ,3,RedPillWives
camille11325,i do not think that you are understanding the implications of your first comment it absolutely matters how you get him there are just a multitude of great ways to get a man bar vs grocery store vs class vs work are all different examples of completely valid ways to get a man there are also several not great ways to get a man which i mentioned in the last comment and in the sexual strategy post you are making a blanket statement that it does not matter how i am saying yes it does if you are trying to make a nuanced statement about the acceptable ways saying that library vs party does not matter that is fine and i would agree but you have not been saying that you have been saying that it does not matter at all and that is a message that is completely at odds with rpw for all the reasons that i explained and you exude qualities that encourages him to stay and commit to you this is exactly the point of rpw at all stages of dating so you seem to be changing your mind about the fact that rpw does not apply prior to relationships you have to exude qualities that get him to escalate commitment on the first dates and within an ltr ,2,RedPillWives
camille11325,the way that you got your man trashy or not does not mean that you cannot now apply rpw ideas to your relationship but this does not mean that single women should completely disregard rpw theory and strategy and just wait until they are married to start being great women many women would have better marriages if they had access to rpw at an earlier age and could apply the ideas while dating and at the early stages of the ltr and marriage ,5,RedPillWives

camille11325,actually there is a specific approach to rpw relationships i detail this in my female sexual strategy https www reddit com r redpillwives comments 5hz4md female sexual strategy post the way that you get a man makes a huge difference in the success of your relationship any single woman who is interested in a harmonious marriage should navigate the smp with a different set of values and an approach that both reflects who she is and gets her what she wants not all approaches to dating are equal there are many terrible ways to start off a relationship faking a pregnancy intentionally getting pregnant stealing someone else man etc there are also really inefficient approaches trying to befriend a bunch of guys before dating them sleeping with every man who makes himself available etc if you apply the ideas that are discussed throughout this community during the dating process you will have an easier time finding a man who is compatible and wants the same type of relationship i explain in my post the reasoning behind rpw sexual strategy so i wo not repeat myself here but basically there are efficient and effective methods to obtain commitment that involve an intentional use of all of our resources it sounds more technical when i write about it in the post or the vetting men post but really it simple in application and meshes easily with one life if marriage is a top priority for someone the how should also be a top priority it not just going to randomly happen and the more control you exert over the process the better chances you have of happiness within your relationship it what you do to keep him and that where rpw comes in as i say in the female sexual strategy post girl game traditional dynamics and good character are the essential foundations of rpw there is not a point in the relationship process where these three things are not being displayed in some way you have to do more to get commitment in the first place than just existing rpw comes in to play to get from date 1 to date 2 just as it can help get to date 1 in the first place different aspects of rpw are relevant at different relationship stages if the entire time while dating you behaved x way that is what a man is committing to how are you going to find someone who shares the same values as you and wants the same type of relationship and future if you are not acting in a way that is consistent with the type of life you want to lead are you just going to have hypothetical discussions about how you will be once you are in a relationship so that he can have something to hope for what man with options is going to continue seeing someone who does not give him the relationship experience that he wants it just does not make any sense when you are consistent from day 1 a man knows exactly what he is signing up for and you can vet him based on how well he does in the role as the head of the relationship you can assess his personality temperament vision authenticity etc and make decisions about whether or not you want to move forward if you just date without thought to the future or without evaluating and reflecting you are doing yourself a disservice finally you cannot get good at being in relationships with men without practice you have to actually apply things in order to know what works and what does not for you if you save everything for a serious relationship you will have a harder time actually putting it to use because it will be completely new if a woman does not practice gratitude yielding being supportive being a gofl etc prior to commitment how is she going to excel at that once she is in a relationship that just not how women work we condition ourselves and fall into patterns it is not practical to advise anyone to be inconsistent in the way you are describing so in terms of dating by all means once you are in a committed relationship it important to keep certain hard truths in mind the truths about male and female nature and female sexual strategy are important to keep in mind at all times while dating the advantage that you would get in the smp following rpw advice makes any other approach seem pointless and or dumb ,5,RedPillWives
camille11325, here a post all about vetting not sure if you saw it when it was posted originally https www reddit com r redpillwives comments 4h6f36 a comprehensive guide to vetting men ,3,RedPillWives
camille11325,just to be clear the term submission is still perfectly applicable to ltrs some women are more comfortable with other terms but it is not more accurate to say deference have you read this post on female sexual strategy https www reddit com r redpillwives comments 5hz4md female sexual strategy i speak about the different uses of rpw at each relationship stage there is no point during the relationship process where a woman is not making use of the 3 main categories of rpw girl game traditional dynamics and good character whether it date one or year 15 psychological femininity is encouraged if you will recall in my post this means being receptive yeilding supportive open etc there is no reason why someone cannot do this while dating and vetting men and when deal breakers come up that when you reevaluate and potentially move on as u irisandoleander said rpw is not synonymous with blindly follows orders from so no matter what and to emphasize the point submission does not mean that either ,3,RedPillWives

camille11325,such a great read this was my favourite part we tend to value in others the things we value in ourselves and we believe that relationships are the end all and be all and since marriage is primarily a relationship we believe we start out marriage on a much better footing than he does so it s our job to help him catch up what a great way to look at the issue i hope this resonates with everyone ,6,RedPillWives
camille11325,absolutely and it is sad but i think that we will see a lot more women wake up and reject feminism now thanks to trump and the new culture he is ushering in ,2,RedPillWives
camille11325,this is great info thanks for sharing it with us of course it appropriate knowing who she is and what she believes gives us more context for this article i totally agree she is pushing a feminist agenda through her work her neutral tone just conceals her bias and intentions ,3,RedPillWives
camille11325,oh yes there was never any expectation that time would delve into these things haha unfortunately the way they present the ideas influences how others consider the subject so i thought it was worth looking at the implicit lessons being imparted in addition to the main points they definitely did as good of a job as they could with neutrality even if they still were promoting feminist ideas and myths like the gender pay gap something i just thought about right now i can easily imaging women reading this article and thinking why do men get to do nothing at home and be the happier ones that is not fair when do i get to be happy their tit for tat mentality may only be strengthened by a piece like this and if they actually follow the advice and bring up divorce that would be awful ,3,RedPillWives
camille11325,this article brought up a lot of issues that people are facing but the feminist bias prevented them from talking about some of the causes and solutions to those problems one thing that did not get brought up but i feel like it contributes to the stress women feel is that they do not just want a sharing of household duties they want to share the leadership position as well so they have multiple sources of pressure at home whereas if they only focused on certain things they would feel more at ease when the responsibilities are clearly outlined it is easier to get things done if both parties are expected to do everything and without any explicit guidelines of course it will feel overwhelming and one or both people will get resentful there are many members of rpw who work and also take on the traditional roles at home and they are still able to be a goddess of fun and light precisely because they are not trying to run everything at home yielding to their partners and specialising in certain areas allows their minds to rest i also think this article ignores the very real pressure that men feel every day especially those that are in the traditional male role as the head of the household the idea that they are not thinking all the time at home is solipsistic just because he does not have the same thoughts or concerns as you does not mean he is not thinking at all it really diminishes all that men do for the family the article was trying to frame the situation as men kicking their feet up and being happy and relaxed while women toil away when that just is not the case it interesting that basically all relationships tend to fail at equal division of labour that is completely in line with what we discuss on rpw all the time but instead of questioning the concept of equality within relationships and considering alternative models that could lead to both parties feeling fulfilled women feel justified in leaving their man i feel like this shows just how unfit for the male workforce most women are they cannot handle running a home being a wife being a mother and having a career intense full time job this article really tried to give a neutral overview of the situation but the final lessons are a bit lacking there are forces bigger than us is so vague and does not really capture the reality of what all the studies showed to me it clear that we are predisposed to certain relationship structures and roles and the unhappiness that women feel is not because of traditional dynamics but instead due to their attempt to have the best of both worlds or abandon the female sphere entirely and the advice we need to talk to our spouses and potential spouses about our ideal plans and our backup plans could lead to some issues are women supposed to tell their men to do housework or they get a divorce what about when men try to talk to their women about what they want does time want women to respect these desires how can you compromise between the two i do not really see a way that could work long term one person is going to lose thanks for sharing the article i enjoyed reading and thinking about it ,10,RedPillWives

camille11325, i usually lose respect for a sahm when i see that her entire facebook feed is about justifying her choice to be a sahm for example those videos infographics about how a sahm is worth more than 100k per year it reeks of insecurity also while that kind of sahm are on facebook they are not taking care of the house nor the kids now are they i really do not like a lot of these types of arguments in favour of sahm when you justify homemaking and mothering by equating it with things in the masculine sphere and judging it through a male lens you are saying that a lifestyle or choice is not of value unless it is in line with male standards there are many intrinsic and intangible benefits to staying at home and it not all about the money or how hard it is or how busy the mom is women at home should not have to compete with those in the workforce by signaling how productive they are or any other workplace virtue being an sahm or just a homemaker in general is not as difficult as plenty of actual jobs and that is totally fine women and men are different we need to stop holding ourselves to male standards and instead embrace the awesome things in the female sphere ,6,RedPillWives
