N0rthernLight,could not agree more one should think ubisoft had the resources and staff to thoroughly test their patches fixes before releasing them this is some kind of behaviour that seems to become more and more common getting lazy trusting there will be some guys really dedicated to your game fixing the stuff you earn money with ,1,thedivision

N0rthernLight,i wholeheartedly agree with you milkman2500 it is very annoying having to sort stuff all the time going back to base to check if the dropped gear has better stats than what you have in your box it also very annoying to level multiple characters to 30 because that time going off of you lvl 30 quality playtime and when i let say store 2 different sets on each char and drop stuff from another set on the char i am playing i have to re log all the time very time consuming and annoying even worse considering i am storing mods in gear that parked in the box so they do not take away precious space ,1,The_Division

N0rthernLight,while that may be true for the singleplayer part of the game i do not see anyone playing what he likes best when it comes to endgame eg high grifts either you have the one and only build or you are out i find that kind of limiting but that only my personal opinion ,1,Diablo
N0rthernLight,and this only seems to go for women while they are making sure her sister is not having any premarital relation or sex they are all after blond chicks and fucking around as if there no tomorrow themselves funny huh ,2,Documentaries
N0rthernLight, for 20 years diablo like games have evolved surprised us i am proud to be the adviser for the game that pushes this genre to new heights did he mean pushed i am not sure if i am getting downvoted into oblivion for this but i am so bored of the exactly one possibly strongest build for every class and of all the must have items in certain slots i just do not feel the freedom to do whatever is fun to reach new heights anymore recently i have started playing path of exile and am amazed that all that content is completely free i have never seen such badass character customization i think for the passive skilltree alone they should offer a degree at universities because it is insanely big and diverse and full of possibilities every character can use every single skill if you wish to do so they do not have that ancient group system where joining a group takes forever and if the group is no good you have to leave the game and join another one you just choose a group ingame and join or leave and join another one content updates every 3 months play for free where you cannot buy advantages over freeloaders only buy cosmetic stuff it the first p4f game i have ever seen that treats every single customer equally wether they spend money or not oh and when a rare drops it that all exiting feeling again because it does not happen all the time like in a t13 rift when it goes ding ding ding ding and you know exactly it the same useless pair of boots for the 1000ths time or that underwhelming class specific weapon without any affix and there one more thing i really dislike in diablo nowadays when you are 1 day into the season and try to find a group and people are like fuck off come back when you are paragon 1000 did i mention they have pvp or you can show the exact ping fps and other magic ingame with one single button or that you can download a lootfilter and activate it from within the games own options to be able to see when useless drops clutter the map personally i do not have the feeling that blizzard pushes this genre to new heights anymore i really love d3 and hae been playing it for years now the same goes for d2 i also played pretty much every other arpg that out there and never have had that much fun but to be honest i have been playing diablo only for the stash tabs the last couple seasons and i just do not think that reason enough anymore ,11,Diablo
N0rthernLight,careers have been ended due to unfairness like this it was on purpose he did it repeatedly and laughed at it even if it not the right thing to do i have sympathy for carcela and can totally relate to his action i only wish he had hit him harder what an asshole ,1,JusticePorn

N0rthernLight,i would not recommend diablo 3 on the 360 simple reason they stopped releasing patches after 2 1 on the 360 and ps3 and therefore you basically are left with a shitty version of an otherwise great game i play it several times a a week on pc but there i have big gems awesome sets greater rifts brutal weaponry and 1000s of things that make it worth playing none of that is on the 360 alos the online community does not exist at all and when you manage to find somebody you have a great chance it an idiot with all hacked gear and a professional russian sword buying diablo 3 ros on the 360 has been the worst mistake in my videogaming life ,3,xbox360

N0rthernLight,usually i do not get mad today however i was in a pub tx rift with 3 other guys 1 min before we met the rg i spotted a big goblin pack so i told everybody in chat to follow me after we kill the rg 3 of us went after the gobs and killed them all it was in the prison map so it was not possible without tping or leaping getting to all the drops and it was a shit ton of loot in the meantime number 4 went back to town and closed the rift i lost 3 legs another guy 7 as he said and the 3rd guy was not sure how many he would missed i am para 520 in s5 and am still waiting for my 1st gift or decent focus restraints so not knowing what you are missing out on can be really frustrating did i mention the fact i said in group chat to please not close the rift man was i mad non the less were the other 2 guys but that about the only reason i would get mad for maybe one of those legs was the socket for the bow i am having in stash for almost 2 weeks now grrrrr,1,diablo3

N0rthernLight,personally i would not buy diablo 3 ros again on the xbox i own it on pc and am paragon 750 so i do love this game to death cannot recommend it on xbox360 though because blizzard stopped rolling out updates after 2 1 that means there so much awesome content grifts sets gems ect you will never see on the 360 even if you buy the exact same game as on xbone or pc that was one hit in the face when i found out after buying it on 360 because my pc was broken back then still playing it regularly on pc though also on console there a huge chance to end up with cheaters who onehit everything on the highest difficulty and that kind of takes the fun away i am only saying russian sword ,2,xbox360

N0rthernLight,i am really interested in how you would react if that was your kid that been touched inappropiately to my understanding the father went to school and nothing happened what do you expect him to do after his complaint was not heard also i did not get the impression he thought it the best thing on earth that his son hit the other kid defended himself after he was left alone with his problem but i can totally understand that he is getting a little upset after he and his kid are getting the blame now just trying to take something with me here that may be of use in the future although reading the last part of your comment makes me think you are not the go to person to ask for advice you seem very agitated and take things to a personal level when there clearly no need for also i highly disagree with your opinion your son 3 days the other kid 1 that really makes me hope you are not working with kids ,3,Parenting
N0rthernLight,the son did not randomly attack another kid he defended himself after telling the other kid to leave him alone in my eyes he had every right to do so after the school officials left him alone with his problem and with cooking hot i meant over reacting sorry i am no native english speaker and i think when the molesting kids parents go to the principal or whoever and demand actions instead of talking to their kid in the first place they are over reacting ,1,Parenting

N0rthernLight,depends on if you are planning to live in northern or southern germany the rental prices for living space in the south is a lot more expensive compared to the north also the electricity heating costs increased a lot over the last 10 years i always had to pay extra at the end of the year i moved to sweden 3 years ago and i would highly recommend doing this life quality and standard improved 200 but in general you can live okayish with that amount of money health insurance is always ingoing if you have a job your employer pays sth and the rest is taken from your money with the taxes so you do not have to worry at all about that thing about the travel is 100 bucks wo not get you very far considering the only thing that really working deutsche bahn is raising the prices 2 to 3 times a year ,2,germany
