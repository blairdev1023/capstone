Lucifirius,oh that great thanks ,1,GoldandBlack
Lucifirius,good comment and i appreciate it i was just offended by your insults i think a big part of where i disagree with the net neutrality regulations is that it not addressing the cause of the problem namely competition and monopolies the monopolies isps enjoy in some areas is because of regulations and costs of business regulations make it more expensive to run a business it a known fact it seems to me that instead of addressing possible symptoms that may or may not be reality it better to address the disease lack of competition and monopolies ,-5,cordcutters
Lucifirius,each isp already has their own monopoly adding more regulations just makes it even harder for more competition the solution is so much easier than people think it not a federal level problem it a local problem as long as the isps keep their locally granted monopoly all the net neutrality bullshit in the world wo not help ,0,cordcutters

Lucifirius,nice condescending language that article explains how zero rating violates net neutrality and not why it such a terrible thing i fail to see how it so bad nobody is entitled to a companies infrastructure if the terms of a contract are not what i want i will go to another company you are failing to discuss the issue by downvoting opinions you disagree with and by plugging your ears until i can see a valid argument for giving the federal government more power i am against an regulations the solution is simple deregulate the market and allow new competition local monopolies being broken would force isps to compete ,1,cordcutters

Lucifirius,yeah how dare a company give a better deal to people that use their products ,-11,cordcutters
Lucifirius,oh please that not even what the article says much like netflix s ongoing standoff with verizon fios the drop in speeds wasn t an issue of the isp throttling or blocking service to netflix rather the isps were allowing for netflix traffic to bottleneck at what s known as peering ports the connection between netflix s bandwidth provider and the isps until recently if peering ports became congested with downstream traffic it was common practice for an isp to temporarily open up new ports to maintain the flow of data this was not a business arrangement just something that had been done as a courtesy isps would expect the bandwidth companies to do the same if there was a spike in upstream traffic however there is virtually no upstream traffic with netflix so the comcasts and verizons of the world claimed they were being taken advantage of ,1,cordcutters
