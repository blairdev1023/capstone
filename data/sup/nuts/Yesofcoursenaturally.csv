Yesofcoursenaturally, why should a small group of people be able to determine who owns nature after they are long past what gives them that right i hear chesterton has some very interesting answers to that it an odd question to ask since distributism recognizes private property and indeed is oriented towards channeling that property toward one descendants and offspring so even after they are long past lines up quite nicely with distributism duties are like that then again i am talking about this as it was originally conceived even as it defined pretty commonly but it seems like people want to strip it down to pure economics but if so capitalism done a bang up job of distributing those means of production rather far and wide and making them tremendously accessible at the beginning there are tons of competitors but one by one they are forced out or merge together until only a few or maybe just one remains so the negative theory goes reality sure seems a lot different look at all these small businesses these people with houses these people with the means of production there do exist some monopolies and man i am not a fan of them but the means of production are available in abundance by and large asking who gives them the right is dramatic and all but if the end goal is making these things available to as many as possible that wicked and woeful capitalism has already pulled it off complaining about how they manage it does not mean a thing to the purely economic question ideal unless of course the politics really matters after all at which point well i have said a few things about that the idea of distributism is to give most if not all people regardless of the circumstances of their birth guaranteed access to the means of production not the opportunity to try to gain access as in capitalism but access itself cool so everyone gets enough land to have a farm that can sustain a family and a cnc machine to make furniture and all kinds of instruments in case they want to get into music and access to a printing press in case they want to write or put out a magazine plus a server farm and no that silly distributism at best spreads private property yes private property around they have something to work with and it rather fungible if they want to get into something else aside from what they have immediate access to they have the opportunity to try and gain access oh and they can also lose it all due to stupidity at which point their community should step in and assist them which may well mean telling them look idiot we are going to help you and you are going to do as we say because we are not giving you the means of production for you to sell for heroin again that the brass ring and insofar as we are eliminating political considerations and are only concerned with economic goals the central concern of distributism has largely been solved by capitalism anyway largely not perfectly let me know if you find perfection but i will probably need a ouija board to have you tell me about it tl dr i know what distributism is and i know how it differs i am delighted to focus on the power the political the social aspects of distributism indeed that was the point i am responding to the claim that all that are ally matters with distributism is providing everyone access to the means of production if that all it about then again problem particularly in the us largely solved and certainly tremendous progress has been made is the problem not solved in afghanistan unfortunate also not really my responsibility as far as distributism is concerned also a bit of advice i came here making some reasonable criticisms keeping entirely on the topic of distributism you now seem to have an axe to grind with me because a bitter person waltzed in and brought up some entirely unrelated politics plus you engaged in a bit of bad mind reading at guessing that i am are ally a republican or a libertarian in terms of economics so let not waste each other time are you actually going to converse or is this now a game of well you think people of all races whites included deserve both respect and criticism and should be allowed to have power over their communities to promote cooperation and distributist the original ones goals but that makes me angry so now everything you say is wrong i mean i would prefer to just continue conversing but if the shit hit the fan well then let get to it e oh and i also replied to the person who played the fallacy game with me https www reddit com r distributism comments 6fg910 platform american solidarity party dikfl5n gotta love finding an actual and proper bit of ad hominem in the wild ,0,distributism

Yesofcoursenaturally,not a fan of dreher usually but it an interesting piece some choice bits christianity in whatever diluted form was for most of america s history the ties that bound us together whether or not we were christians those days are gone liberalism in the broadest historical sense is secularized christianity and as such is parasitic on christianity when christianity disappears as it has largely done in europe and is well on its way to doing in the united states it takes with it the basis on which liberalism operates laws and procedures alone do not hold a people together of course christianity is being diluted too and has been for a while that said i think dreher is wrong here he thinking of at best ocial justice of a very narrow kind and sentiment this has already mutated into something horrible as american politics becomes more extreme on both sides serious christians will be squeezed out a significant number of conservative christians will give themselves over to a christianized version of blood and soil politics the uncritical embrace of trumpism by many conservative christians today opens the door to this what is odd is that this uncritical acceptance he speaks of as near as i can tell does not exist i talk with christians on the right quite often they are not trumpists they see him as a means to an end he is not to them what obama was to many on the left what trump really did is fascinating and a bit more subtle but i will put that aside for now those orthodox christians who understand the radical nature of the crisis before us will devote themselves to building up their faith communities institutions and ways of life to be resilient and resolute in the face of american decline i call this the benedict option the politics of the future may be more left wing or right wing but they will be increasingly anti christian keeping our heads clear and our hearts stout during this long time of trial will be the most important task facing christians in this new dark age we too will have to bind ourselves together more tightly to jesus christ and to each other in his church i am starting to get sick of how this guy keeps plugging his book you would think that if the benedict option was essential for the survival of freaking christianity itself in the west he would explicitly lay out his case for free in detail regardless a good read i think he partly correct in his diagnosis but i think his vision of orthodox christians is flawed sounds to me like he looking for the sincerely christian and politically pure i wonder if they had jerks in saint benedict time ,3,CatholicPolitics

Yesofcoursenaturally, yes this is how absurd your point is if this mechanism is true then evolution can occur and if the sun exists maybe astrology is right it utterly banal if creationism is true then there should be no out of order fossils at all no that straightforwardly false especially if creationism is expanded as it tends to be by its critics to include intelligent design otherwise the purported order of fossils is at best an interesting discovery that creationists need to explain why did they arrange this way what happened in time what went on what was god thinking great questions all but questions are not falsifications more than that you are changing the target the question is whether out of order fossils would falsify evolution and it would not at most it falsifies one theory of evolution it weird that you are trying to shift the topic to falsifying creationism creationism is not falsifiable remember ,2,Creation

Yesofcoursenaturally, two things among the many many other troubling things i am sure you can list all kinds of things you disagree with trump over but the fact is the author predicted that trump would betray catholics on his promises the central promises were related to abortion the scotus and religious freedom the first two have been largely fulfilled indeed the scotus one may be fulfilled like gangbusters the last has had seen progress with more forecast to come soon the author forecast was wrong he has literally been disproven by trump ,10,CatholicPolitics

Yesofcoursenaturally, that is one method of disproving evolution the fact that it seriously brought out as a front line falsification example is absurd to the extreme it perfectly in line with saying astrology is falsifiable just demonstrate there is no sun anyone who can see why the latter is absurd can see why the former is too there are other methods but they generally involve finding something somewhere we really should not and we do not and this is a different variety of deceptive the out of order fossil find would not disprove evolution it would at best disprove a particular model of evolution or a particular model of geological history or even both it would be entirely possible and even expected to spin around and say okay that model is wrong here the new model or even okay we are lacking a model for this aspect of the theory right now we are working on it theories are elastic evolutionary theory especially insofar as it takes place over deep time scales is tremendously so when someone says out of order fossil layers would falsify evolution they are leaving out at best a caveat for me anyway i promise it not really compelling ,1,Creation

Yesofcoursenaturally, the same side that is all to eager to rip healthcare from the poor yeah let stop there see this is one way the catholic left tries to make both ides equal by turning rejection of left wing policies into cartoon depictions of actual malice so if someone on the right says i do not support social welfare programs as they are i think we need to have more conditions for them i think there should be tighter qualifications i think the structure should be different the catholic left casts that as the right wants to rip food out of the mouths of orphans and then throw them to wolves they think they should all starve and die it an attempt to make left wing economic and social policy into dogma not just the desire or even personal acts to help the poor but literal specific economic and welfare policies as de facto dogma and it absurd desperate theatrics and part of the reason the catholic left engages in it is because the social policies of the left are so odious so obviously toxic and in direct conflict with church teaching that something needs to be done to take the spotlight off that otherwise we are going to end up talking about the abortion the ssm even the petty institutional cruelty of things like forcing a catholic pharmacist to sell abortion pills and contraception and the catholic leftist is going to be expected to at least rail against that part of the party even if they support the economic policies which in turn is a fantastic recipe for being hated by the party goodbye political connections and or political career heck goodbye to even helping your party because refusing to turn a blind eye to those policies will mean harming them that one of the great moral tragedies of left wing catholic politics in the west making people so invested in economic and welfare policy that they are forced to turn a blind eye to excuse literal infant slaughter and treat their opponents not just as disagreeing but as utter moral monsters for rejecting policies that hinting briefly at one reason for hesitance made venezuela what it is today ,5,Catholicism

Yesofcoursenaturally, so as usual you are attacking whatever views i may have because you cannot refute the fact that protecting the environment is objectively a good thing to do no i am pointing out that your attempt to lecture from a moral high ground on the basis of a papal encyclical you have radically interpreted as upport for a treaty is both empty and hypocritical since you do not have any concern whatsoever for church moral teaching when you disagree with it further i do not need to refute the fact that protecting the environment is a good thing to do because that not under debate what is under debate is whether it morally obligatory to support the paris treaty surprise it is not nowhere close to it in fact it runs roughshod over catholic principles of social order and again i think abortion and gay marriage are wrong no you do not as your comments show you treat them as the church says this is a bad thing and then you ignore it and openly talk about the church hopefully changing its view on these things to say nothing of female priests and more the closest you get to accepting pro life teaching is arguing that it permissible to give open support to people who both defend legalize and even normalize abortion on the hopes that maybe your preferred social policies could conceivably reduce the net number of abortions that not pro life that pro life hijacking and it opposition to church teaching but why am i even defending myself it not about me or my views when you chide everyone for living by an insane interpretation of a rule that you do not even follow in its sane and traditional form you open yourself up to these criticisms if you do not like the fact that your position is this flawed tough ,4,CatholicPolitics

Yesofcoursenaturally, the broader point is that yesofcoursenaturally brought up gay marriage and abortion to downplay the importance of being pro environment no i brought up the fact that you treat laudato si as not just dogma but insanely specific dogma that demands adherence to the paris accords on pain of sin meanwhile your attitude with gay marriage abortion and even women priests is advocating for change against church teaching supporting politicians who oppose church teaching even supporting laws that suppress and oppose it you wanted to tie support for the paris treaty as a test for fidelity to the church i am more than happy to point out the flaws with that and where you really stand on supporting church teaching ,7,CatholicPolitics

Yesofcoursenaturally,while some of the insights are helpful they are outweighed by the usual inability of many conservatives particularly pro lifers and christians to ever criticize women the only people he criticizes in the article are surprise the pro lifers they see as enemies because many of us draw the line here at consensual sex we say essentially that the mother s promiscuity determines whether we will stand to protect the child that is not a good look that completely uncharitable even as someone who does not want to draw that line it not her promiscuity it the difference between her making a willful choice that anyone with any amount of experience knows the risks of and one whose consent is completely stripped away i do not think the distinction ultimately matters but it certainly impacts considerations about the culpability of the situation the responsibility and eventually leads to discussions about frequency of the event some key moments they prize their sexual autonomy as an important element of their identity and one of the great pleasures of life frankly who can blame them everything in our culture tells these women that the worst thing you can do with a sex drive is repress it frankly who can blame them i do not know any thinking adult i wonder if this guy would be defending a bunch of men who were pro abortion because of prizing their sexual autonomy and if the culture card would remove their culpability in using abortion as a fallback position we are literally being told that these women principally are pro abortion because they do not want any responsibility for their sexual actions and he cannot criticize that in fact he cannot criticize anyone but again pro lifers you guys need to come up with more persuasive arguments people like this need to be anywhere but in leadership positions in the pro life movement and i suspect much anywhere else ,5,CatholicPolitics

Yesofcoursenaturally, i don have much time to argue this right now so we can pick up our debates at some later date but i do want to make an argument on this point since i followed gamergate from day 1 and spent hours and hours informing myself using sources such as the open house streams and i have been a member of kia complete with contributing posts and comments since near its inception they were in a sense the public faces of gamergate a far cry from the leaders of gamergate that participated in direct confrontation with the aggros much of the gamergate community despised them and divisions were born from this very topic you know who despised them primarily the people whose vision of gg was let prove we are totally pro feminist and pro social justice guys people who kept trying to insist that sjws were not leftist at all and people who were upset that sjws were even a topic because they wanted the gg focus to be exclusively on journalistic ethics aka people who were outnumbered and eventually left gg altogether the other front was the popular front where millions of people were acting for change behind the scenes one of our most successful campaigns was operation disrespectful nod where we emailed advertisers you may want to count the number of people again man it was never millions it was a lot but not millions and campaigns like that did not bubble up without direction guys like milo breitbart in general and those horrible e celebs were out there signal boosting keeping track of developments and getting the word out it not like thousands of people decided of their own volition to write letters to this day kia focuses fire heavily on sjws in gaming because that the source of a lot of problems are spectable moderate dialog hardly ever obtained and in part could not obtain because gg was and is cast as a pack of misogynists and quasi terrorists they demonstrated breitbart dictum of continuing to fight no matter what names you were called and doing so without apology i wish the church did that but alas it falls to people on the fringes to do anything nowadays ,2,CatholicPolitics

Yesofcoursenaturally, i am trying very hard to be charitable with you but it getting difficult if you are going to be this intellectually dishonest how is it intellectually dishonest to ask you a question if race has no basis in reality how are you connecting blacks with people with ancestry from this particular continent and not people who came to that continent from another continent in another time frame and surely you would not be able to tell much about the second gentleman ancestry just by a picture of him or for that matter the first now to me the obvious explanation is that race does have some basis in reality and maybe what you meant is that it not as relevant or should not be as relevant as others think it is that a different argument and claim but not the one you gave so i am stuck here trying to figure out how this concept with no basis in reality can nevertheless be relied upon to predict so much indeed so much that even you are making some surprisingly canny predictions with it ,2,CatholicPolitics
Yesofcoursenaturally,the funny thing is the overlap between alt right and gg is tremendous and noted so long as we are using that broad definition of alt right that includes the harsher anti sjws milo yiannapolous constantly gets called alt right and that guy rose to fame specifically as a gg advocate he was the one who picked up the issue and ran with it and you are right about the tarring with the same brush just the emphasis was more on misogynist than racist ,2,CatholicPolitics

Yesofcoursenaturally, i ignored your question because i did not bring up the parable of the good samaritan you did considering any answer but the untenable a is going to establish something mighty interesting about love and equality i await your answer i brought up matthew 25 to which your response would not have pleased saint mother teresa interesting speculation without support i do recall some saints talking about the war on the family however in other words it appears that the op point is that we must love our families and that we should allow the love we have for our families to grow our hearts and our empathy so that we can love strangers as well particularly the least of these it certainly does not say we must love these strangers more than our families and i did not say more equal is all the problem let me quote the op here i must see the poor as i would see my own family i must love the homeless as i would my own family i must treat the refugee as if they were my own family and this is wrong our families have priority contra fahey our families are not to be reduced to everyone or if you prefer everyone elevated to our family the church has taught us that the family is the bedrock concern what we secure and look after first in fact what the state must ensure we are capable of looking after in order to justify its existence at all but that does not fit fahey political vision so he looking for loopholes the idea that our family is a training ground to learn how to love some people so we can eventually cast aside the family and hold everyone on an equal plane in terms of our responsibilities is biblically groundless it groundless in the teaching of the church and it undermines both of those things the only thing it has going for it is it sounds nice to some people and the hope is that it can be used as a moral bludgeon to force others to accept in silence subservience other people inane political plans but purely secular morals have no authority and command no respect so much the worse for the op ,4,CatholicPolitics
Yesofcoursenaturally, you did not answer my question yes i did hell is indeed one being eternally separated from god but i am unaware of a church teaching that says god loves those souls in hell less than anyone else do you have a source for that belief i am taking god willingness to damn sinners for all eternity as prima facie evidence that they are not loved equally with saints now what evidence do you have that church teaching is that god loves all equally regardless of whether they are saved or damned saint or sinner nobody including the op appears to be arguing otherwise the op is treating all people everywhere as equal to the family such that love and care and concern for them must be equal to the family that obviates the family and flies smack against church teaching from the very documents you quoted the state exists to sustain the family the family rights overrule the state appetites are you really saying that by family 214 means everyone ,2,CatholicPolitics
Yesofcoursenaturally,i have asked a question you have ignored it completely to ask me two generously i will answer one of yours first a who has called for the obviation of the family loving and treating equally everyone without privileging our family is the obviation of the family it reduces the family to a footnote or a factoid at best if we are called to love and look after all equally and not prioritize family 214 is rendered senseless and the family is obviated if you reply that we should love all equally but loving all equally is entirely compatible with our families being our priority to take care of then you have gutted the op entire point and now it makes perfect sense to secure the safety and well being of our families before moving on to care for others now it your turn a f take your pick ,5,CatholicPolitics
Yesofcoursenaturally,i do not need to to make my point go through women and men are unequal in the church priests have authority that laity can never have people are judged based on their sexual orientations and religious beliefs god certainly does not love us all equally unless love can be squared with eternal damnation what exactly is left 1934 reference to the hylemorphic dualist conception of humanity if you want to say that all men are by nature rational souls you will get no argument from me you will also be rolling with a definition of equal that is inert i quoted from your own source showing that the church regards the family as the ultimate unit it is the reason for the state existence again so much for the equality the op is chasing ,4,CatholicPolitics

Yesofcoursenaturally, calling something heretical does not make it so any chance you can provide what church teaching or doctrine this article contradicts honor thy father and mother right off the bat a commandment we are called to keep and which necessarily differentiates between family and everyone else straightaway but we must love them as we would love christ himself no we do not nor does the passage you quote even imply that there is nothing about love in there it recognizing works towards the needy as works that honor god since everyone apparently wants to butcher christ calls to love i will happily provide the parable of the good samaritan here in full he answered love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind a and love your neighbor as yourself b 28 you have answered correctly jesus replied do this and you will live 29 but he wanted to justify himself so he asked jesus and who is my neighbor 30 in reply jesus said a man was going down from jerusalem to jericho when he was attacked by robbers they stripped him of his clothes beat him and went away leaving him half dead 31 a priest happened to be going down the same road and when he saw the man he passed by on the other side 32 so too a levite when he came to the place and saw him passed by on the other side 33 but a samaritan as he traveled came where the man was and when he saw him he took pity on him 34 he went to him and bandaged his wounds pouring on oil and wine then he put the man on his own donkey brought him to an inn and took care of him 35 the next day he took out two denarii c and gave them to the innkeeper look after him he said and when i return i will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have 36 which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers 37 the expert in the law replied the one who had mercy on him jesus told him go and do likewise quiz time the parable features a traveler bandits a priest a levite a samaritan and an innkeeper christ was asked who is the neighbor in that parable such that we should love our neighbors as ourselves was it a everyone b the levite c the priest d the innkeeper e the samaritan f the bandits and as a bonus 214 from the compendium of the social doctrine of the church 214 the priority of the family over society and over the state must be affirmed the family in fact at least in its procreative function is the condition itself for their existence with regard to other functions that benefit each of its members it proceeds in importance and value the functions that society and the state are called to perform 471 the family possesses inviolable rights and finds its legitimization in human nature and not in being recognized by the state the family then does not exist for society or the state but society and the state exist for the family every social model that intends to serve the good of man must not overlook the centrality and social responsibility of the family in their relationship to the family society and the state are seriously obligated to observe the principle of subsidiarity in virtue of this principle public authorities may not take away from the family tasks which it can accomplish well by itself or in free association with other families on the other hand these same authorities have the duty to sustain the family ensuring that it has all the assistance that it needs to fulfil properly its responsibilities 472 so much for the csd backing the idea that the family is obviated in favor of everyone eh ,4,CatholicPolitics
Yesofcoursenaturally, i do not think that word applies here even if the equality of love business is incorrect dissolution of the family would certainly roll as heretical it also not incorrect we are told to unqualifiedly love thy neighbor as thyself no matter who they are have you actually read the passage because the whole point of the passage was qualification jesus was asked who is our neighbor and he told a parable which involved bandits a priest a levite a samaritan and a victim when christ asked who among them was a neighbor to the victim the answer was not everyone it was the samaritan if we love each person with this equal standard then the homeless and the criminal and our own blood relatives will be on the same level in our eyes this is the sort of sentiment people take as stirring and noble to their ears and thus it must be christian it ai not so christ does not command us to love all equally nor does he seem particularly keen on doing so himself unless someone going to argue that god loves both the eternally saved and the eternally damned equally in which case we have disconnected love from well being in a way that going to make the original argument even harder to go through we are commanded to love our enemies we are commanded to love our neighbors as ourselves who counts as a neighbor is itself a limited set you are right that our responsibilities are rightly limited but the idea that family is to be dissolved in favor of universal equality is fiction equality a secular idol not a christian virtue ,5,CatholicPolitics

Yesofcoursenaturally, since this article is drawing exclusively from catholic tradition to make it point can you provide any kind of magisterial teaching that supports this claim the article draws selectively from magisterial documents then ignores the parts of the same documents which runs counter to their point i have already provided multiple examples of such i can provide magisterial example to support my claim the historical association of charity with preaching such that if you did not abide by the religious rules the church laid out in granting charity said charity could be and often was restricted charity is not and has never been a blank check if you would like another example 2 thessalonians 3 10 those unwilling to work do not get to eat it takes some cojones to definitively state that a great pope and saint is wrong i have got some serious cojones and pope gregory is wrong insanely wrong since i recall his quote on this matter is that if one has savings and someone else is going hungry a person is a thief that is at best poetic exaggeration to prove a point at worst it stupidity that damns every pope from gregory to francis and likely christ himself as well as a thief the tradition of the catholic church as demonstrated by the church fathers recent popes and the catechism is that giving from one c goods to help supply someone a or b goods is a matter of justice the article above lays out that tradition well the article sets charity apart from justice quoting documents which as i showed go on to connect its exhortations with charity once again thus under the leadership of justice and in the company of charity created goods should flow fairly to all you know why this does not get quoted in the article because it inconvenient and speaks against the author intended conclusion it charity further the tradition of the catholic church demonstrated by the church fathers etc etc is that particularly when it comes to issues of private property and charity the proper region of authority is local that same tradition speaks against the very idea that it just to take from a c who is on the other side of the planet to assist some distant barely connected group of the needy distributism and the principle of subsidiarity both deal a death blow to globalism and grand socialist schemes please do share any magisterial teachings that support your claim already done it is precisely the principle of subsidiarity that will help determine when and how the government can use this authority justly it nowhere mentions subsidiarity or distributism throughout the entire article that one heck of an omission and precisely what is stepped around for reasons easy to see if their goal is to promote modern socialism since said socialism complete with its centralized control of economic and social authority is utterly contrary to the principles of subsidiarity and distributism both pope benedict xvi has gone so far as to say pope benedict xvi paying a compliment to a 19th century esoteric manifestation of socialism caveats and all is not helping you out here it helping me especially once we include necessarily the ultimate subsidiarity and distributism ideals outlined by catholic teaching which lo and behold was contemporary in its honing with those same timeframes that model necessarily emphasizes small government to concentrate power in the hands of the most local as possibly including families primacy of sustaining religious and regional traditions and more to say nothing of the fact that those religious sentiments would not only be overt in the model but for catholics both central and of actual legal precedent and force it rat poison to the left the fact that it would based explicitly on religious principles for religious ends intervene in private property which is heavily emphasized and safeguarded in this same system matters barely moves the needle left and the religious drive and consideration cannot be divorced from the economic model without utterly undermining both its justification and interest to catholics ,3,CatholicPolitics

Yesofcoursenaturally, as far as i can see the only piece of evidence linking clinton to birtherism was some of her staff suggesting that obama foreign upbringing could be a weakness weakness they were playing him off as the out of touch foreigner weirdo who would have been picking up bill coffee a couple years prior notice something missing absolutely no mention of his citizenship or birth certificate did you read the crappy snopes article on this for yucks i will quote in march 2007 clinton campaign strategist mark penn proposed attacking obama on the basis of his lack of american roots and in december 2007 a clinton volunteer county coordinator in iowa was fired for forwarding an e mail making the by then familiar claim that obama is a muslim i note that they emphasize he was fired that would be due to the backlash and it fits well within the lack of american roots narrative they were playing with further down that theory first emerged in the spring of 2008 as clinton supporters circulated an anonymous e mail questioning obama s citizenship barack obama s mother was living in kenya with his arab african father late in her pregnancy she was not allowed to travel by plane then so barack obama was born there and his mother then took him to hawaii to register his birth asserted one chain email that surfaced on the urban legend site snopes com in april 2008 that hillary clinton supporters circulated such an e mail isn t in question but the claim that that s the moment the birther theory first emerged simply isn t true note the last bit keep in mind i am pulling this from snopes which is not exactly biased towards the right they are trying to excuse and exonerate hillary her campaign role in it all but once you are seeing hillary supporters and campaign staff floating that saying but perhaps technically the allegation was in someone head earlier therefore this is false is a bit much ,4,TiADiscussion

Yesofcoursenaturally, if something is unfalsifiable science is not concerned with it this is r debateevolution not r debatereligion this would mean that most popular atheist claims about science have nothing to do with science or are in fact anti science i am more than happy to say that science has nothing to do with religion it just has nothing to do with atheism either it metaphysically religiously for the most part neutral and yes science is what i do for a living that last bit was very condescending you do not like condescending okay then do not snark from the hip i am more than happy to argue calm and cool but that going to require you behaving let be gentlemen ,2,DebateEvolution
Yesofcoursenaturally, think we can distinguish between the two notions a distributism being rooted in catholic social teaching what i acknowledge in the sidebar and b predominant catholicism being an explicit core requirement feature of functioning distributist economies as you seem to be saying no i have actually been trying to say something else that distributivism requires community local power culture and identity being prominent in its implementation i gave an example of an atheist community with values in common as well totally true this falls under my notion a above and your quote from the distributist review do you have a link handy btw supports my assessment that chesterton was not a proponent of notion b i am not saying that distributivism cannot be divorced from catholicism specifically i believe it can but something needs to replace catholicism because what it cannot be divorced from is the idea of community shared values culture identity etc if you remove that and all you have left are economic controls you are not only done with distributivism you are done with the point of distributivism as well edit also pardon me if i seem rather bitey i am truly not spoiling for a fight here just highlighting a part of distributivism that i think is necessary yet recently ignored and it also happens to be the most controversial part of the whole idea trying to divorce the community social local governing aspect from the economics just does not really work neither does running with the assumption that the communities are should be entirely dialed into the same universal culture as if they have the exact same priorities as the standard modern secular big government but they are just nimbler ,1,distributism
Yesofcoursenaturally, i will certainly admit i have not read every prominent distributist writer but none of those i have read ever made exclusionary religious colonies out to be either a goal or a means of distributism read the sidebar the very idea of distributism was tied to catholic teaching and the preservation of communities culture and peoples was expressly the reason for it wide distribution of property was both a moral idea and in part a means to an end i have said that the idea in principle is not necessarily religion specific hence the example of the community of atheists and the community of catholics but it still a community of the religiously like minded who are running their show to promote and protect their values and their people religion wo not be the only factor that makes them gather that was pretty much chesterton style when he wrote on the subject chesterton thought was swimming constantly in religious specifically catholic reasoning moral aims and common goods the understanding of which are heavily formed by religious belief are driving forces of his view let me pull this straight from distributist review though chesterton would argue that a distributist society would be most fully realized if it were based on a catholic worldview he would not insist upon that basis as essential for achieving such a society in fact he would argue that such a society is more congenial to the different religions than any other societal plan freedom of religion as it now supposedly exists under a huge centralized government actually needs to be enforced by that government the result as we have seen is that religion has actually been stifled where the government watchdog is there to guarantee the freedom but local based governments supported by local based economies are more conducive to religious freedom because people of the same religion would naturally gravitate together the main reason that people of the same religion tend to scatter in our society and that people of different religions tend to mix uncomfortably is that our society is not based on the home it is based on the opportunities outside the home the better jobs are always elsewhere it is not their religion that makes people chose a place to live it is their job it is convenience it is not philosophy pretty much what i have said but underlined do you know why local based governments and their local based economies matter at all because they allow for the freedom of the like minded to gather live and run their communities as they see fit and as they see fit is heavily informed by religious beliefs which means that the avowed atheist is going to have to put up with things in that community which they resent attempting to disrupt it will likely be barred and if they want to move into a community like that hoping to promote change that will likely be barred too it really depends on what the local government has to say distributism is not a simple economic theory the end of it is not oh there more distributed property now it also means power distribution and not at the individual level but at the community level removing the community aspect particularly the right of people to actually form communities they care about and not learn to care about a community that has ridiculously little in common with their aims identity or beliefs kills distributism ,2,distributism
Yesofcoursenaturally, sure i agree it makes no sense to claim anything in nature was designed by some intelligent entity this thing in nature was designed by some intelligent entity is every bit as scientific as this thing in nature was not designed by some intelligent entity they are both unfalsifiable claims in an ultimate sense which is precisely the sense which theists atheists care in a proximate sense intelligent design is scientific was this salmon intelligently designed is entirely reasonable to ask and presumably science can go some way in answering that question it better since some salmon are exactly that and dogs and plants and and it not a matter of it makes no sense plenty of claims that science cannot address make sense science cannot tell you whether naturalism is true or false but the speculation and claims are entirely sensible do you know much about science by the way i mean you seem kind of new to the concept ,-3,DebateEvolution

Yesofcoursenaturally,theistic evolutionist here within the context of intelligent design these overwhelming similarities are illogical why should an intelligent designer create so much similarity between humans and mice this is simply illogical and not an example of intelligent design that mere assertion where the evidence asking a question about the designer intentions is not an argument much less evidence against design 2 evidence against design is abundant your evidence against design relies on unspoken assumptions about the designer intentions which are key to your claims further flawed design especially from your subjective perspective cannot reasonably be taken as evidence against design unless good design is taken as evidence for it common designer does not explain vestigial structures but evolution does evolution we are working on it can be used to explain every body plan out there the argument you have put forward relies on the idea that flawed or imperfect design or even would esign similarities indicates a lack of design i can cite tremendously abundant examples of the irrefutably designed yet flawed as counter evidence ,5,DebateEvolution

Yesofcoursenaturally, where how does distributism address this idea because the foundation of the distributist view was social and cultural the distributist model entire point is to maintain a people their culture and their beliefs it community centric and central to that is the ability to determine who is and is not part of the community what scenarios did you have in mind at root the catholic and religious ones are the most obvious examples the amish come to mind as the best extant example of distributivist principles in action in america obviously they have some very specific to them features but not necessarily the ones people would expect but i think in practice advocating any distributist principle worth the name would involve some tremendously counter cultural tolerance of communities and views that are unpopular putting it gently if you want a distributist community to really develop it means the end of a lot of civil rights protections an atheist who wants to move to your little catholic community or the priest who wants to set up a church in your avowedly atheist community can in principle be barred some people try to get rid of this and turn distributism into some entirely economic theory that has no concern for or input on community living or concern but that like taking the battery out of an electric car that the most pollution causing part of the electric car after all it not even a car at that point no matter how pretty it looks ,2,distributism

Yesofcoursenaturally, so in all seriousness are you more of a trumpist than a gop member i think you are going to have an easier time if you do not try to fit me into a neat little political box even trump is just a means to an end if he does something i dislike i say as much also so what its in the platform express commitment to abortion available and pp funding they have lived this out through action they are now out and out saying at the leadership level that pro lifers are not wanted in their party i know some people want to pretend that both parties are equally bad but if abortion is murder then you have got to jump through some serious hoops to keep up that claim anymore i want the gop to do more than defund this and that get rid of roe dammit it is not in their direct power to do so and frankly to have even a chance at that requires scotus members retiring or dying the gop has been until recently flaky on this at the national level that is changing and it is changing under trump i will give credit where it due there too keep up the pressure on them but give them credit where it due i intensely dislike the senate gop but they did what i did not expect and both stonewalled obama on his scotus appointment and then went nuclear for gorsuch i would give the democrats credit if they ever managed to do anything of major import that was not dishonest cynical or actively harmful i have to look more at the local level for that and even then it less about the democrats and more about people whose importance is less so they are more free to act ,4,Catholicism

Yesofcoursenaturally, u yesofcoursenaturally probably thinks any catholic whose not a gop member should be excommunicated or worse not at all and the gop is fairly rotten as well in my view there are pro abortion gop members and plenty who are faking it on the other hand i will bet you there are self described pro lifers who are full of baloney that said i note with an appreciation for the irony that trump is following through on a good share of his pro life promises with apparently more to come i further note the gop has pro life commitments right in the platform it not me saying that there no place for the pro life in the democrats it is the democrat leadership themselves it not even news check their platform check their rhetoric i ask again who did mello support in the 2016 elections i can point at various other pro life democrats who supported hillary that makes them certainly on the abortion topic useful idiots at best who are weakening the pro life movement and introducing all kinds of excuses as to why people can actually support pro abortion candidates at worst they are active fakes who are pro life in pro life areas but who would flip in a heartbeat if their star rose higher we have had examples of that in the past ,6,Catholicism

Yesofcoursenaturally,i would not be surprised at two turns of events eventually someone makes the argument that abortion needs to stay legal because their religion requires ritual human sacrifice at times and this is the afe legal way to do exactly that some christian catholic blogger writes that we should consider this argument carefully and suggests that maybe the pro life cause needs to be abandoned because otherwise it could set a precedent on religious freedom that could threaten christians in the future ,4,CatholicPolitics
Yesofcoursenaturally, the question is do people who are among the most broken poor vulnerable and impaired in our society deserve the death penalty no the question is would o people who rape and kill deserve the death penalty and the answer is yes by church teaching and example yes by philosophy yes by biblical example yes saying wait but what if they are poor is not a counter argument and the idea that poverty means no culpability for going wild with a gun because someone did not have the three bucks to get into a buffet is just wild i also note the unintended irony of treating as vulnerable the people who have been raping and killing others i happen to think their victims turned out to be the vulnerable ones go figure and you did not give an argument you just said it was murder said the date was random and said it was not justice i have at least gestured in the direction of the church historical teaching for a looooong time acts of state execution at vatican city and elsewhere biblical example which pretty much anyone knows and more you just say it not justice it murder and pose no threat to the public two things about that one of the guys slated for death in arkansas killed once got a life imprisonment sentence laughed at the family because y all thought i was gonna get killed did not you then escaped and killed a couple people on the run so much for no threat to the public but oh do not worry if we are really secure they are only a threat to other people in prison you know that place where everyone jokes about all the brutal anal rape that takes place the shivvings and more the idea that people in prison pose no threat is false wildly false so even that lame argument does not have much juice ,9,CatholicPolitics

Yesofcoursenaturally, can you explain what you mean by this distributism particularly as promoted by the church is not and can never be a simple economic system the entire point of it is to safeguard and uphold not just values but communities and cultures insofar as it framed in the catholic system it right wing and given what commitments are necessary for it to function it not just right wing it is extremist alt right case in point under a distributist system community local say over who can become part of the community is pivotal remove that and the entire system is irrelevant people who have no say or part in the community can come in with their own values preferences etc at any time and upend the whole thing so the distributist especially the catholic distributist has to demand oversight of that kind of thing if you are hearing the echoes of we need to build a wall in your head there a reason for that i am using the left right dichotomy in my conversation with you as i do with others as a necessity to relay information in a form that you understand well no you actually are not at least not consistently you switch from my economic views are left wing and would istributism is left wing but when time comes to make the common association your views on abortion marriage etc are right wing you want to stop using those terms and really the suggestion is clear you feel comfortable thinking of yourself as and describing yourself as left wing or having left wing commitments thinking of yourself as right wing or having right wing commitments is something you want to avoid no catholic values are catholic values no they are right wing values in this case extremist right wing values the expression of many being called hate speech you are a right winger sir you want to control women bodies and have say over what they do with them you defend what is now commonly called hate speech heck you endorse a small government traditional morals centric economic model that necessitates strict immigration control if it happens it does so with the express approval of the local community who are entirely free to vote no and in fact must vote no to keep the right kind of people in the majority or put in a way you may accept you are alt right by most standards you may object but not my standard okay but by most other people then which standard do you think people are going to use to describe you ,2,CatholicPolitics

Yesofcoursenaturally,i agree entirely i remember a while ago atheists at the time were snarking at the idea of atheist communists being a condemnation of atheists because communism was a political movement it was basically a religion i agreed happily then and i do now and the conclusion to draw from that is political movements are typically identical to religions especially in the bad ways this was back before the new atheist atheism split since then it just become undeniable ,9,CatholicPolitics
Yesofcoursenaturally, sure but it neither left nor right liberal nor conservative it is simply justice it entirely possible for one political thought to align more closely with justice than the other saying it right wing does not mean it not just it may be that right wing just overlaps with justice here why avoid it give them their due that why i see distributism on the far left of the economic spectrum not at all socialism but much closer to it that most other left wing economic ideas distributism even as you describe it enshrines a system based expressly on traditionalist morals and family structure again insofar as you are catholic far right wing morals we are talking stuff that would make le pen quiver a bit utterly dismantles the lion share of centralized government and rejects any moral right to building it and distributes property among many while ensuring they use it in accordance with traditional morality to support the family you are taking small government conservatism and adding an amish moral dimension indeed the ability to sustain that moral dimension is central to the motivation to begin with where the left wing part again good intentions i fundamentally reject the left right dichotomy i notice you happily cop to any labeling of your terms as left or far left you do so yourself but when it time to label one of your beliefs right or far right you start talking about how those are all just labels can you see why i am sitting here regarding this with utter skepticism and thinking the whole thing comes across as wanting to have your cake and eat it too either they are or they are not espousing catholic teaching alright then hate speech and far right social values are catholic values at this point you are picking between the same object reflected by two different mirrors different angles same object ,2,CatholicPolitics
Yesofcoursenaturally, another concern i have with the term conservative is that it a political term what is wrong with political terms a just wage is thoroughly political and is expressed through politics and you have no problem with connecting church teaching with it i am a distributist but if we imagine distributism as a spectrum i would be on the far left catholic distributism is absurdly right wing in orientation interest required authority and expectation it is not a simple economic system it is a socio economic system aimed at establishing a religious traditionalist society insofar as the church is concerned you have a variety of right wing extremist beliefs as well as some left wing or centrist ones saying it not left or right it catholic seems more like a defensive measure to confuse people rather than accept the necessary political association would you really feel that much better by saying well it not that the church is right wing extremist on these issues it that right wing extremists are just espousing catholicism ,4,CatholicPolitics
Yesofcoursenaturally, the church would ignore the real crisis she faces today if she focuses on social justice issues rather than her basic mission to evangelize cardinal robert sarah warns in a newly published interview the cardinal quoted yahya pallavicini an italian and former catholic who converted to islam to drive home his point if the church with the obsession she has today with the values of justice social rights and the struggle against poverty ends up as a result by forgetting her contemplative soul she will fail in her mission and she will be abandoned by a great many of her faithful owing to the fact that they will no longer recognize in her what constitutes her specific mission ,15,CatholicPolitics

Yesofcoursenaturally,i understand your technical distinction about the church in certain times and places challenging a then extant social convention but insofar as they challenged it they did so based on age old established teaching not innovative teaching it is near impossible to square christian teaching as christ and st paul espoused it even including paul take on slavery with new world slavery practices it not like it took a modern pope to realize there were grave and obvious problems with the treatment of the time the term conservative to define the church is too inflexible if anything it too tame on sexuality morality abortion women reproductive health and more the church is not conservative it far extreme right wing and in fact a formal dispenser of what is termed hate speech by at this point a sizable chunk of the west and it brooks so little compromise or oftening on these topics that even dissenting clergy have to retreat into a fog of vague wording to maneuver whatsoever i mean you could say that the church is a combination of extreme right wing beliefs and centrist sentiments conventionally but i think to do that is to show that trying to divorce the church from political identification just is not going to happen ,5,CatholicPolitics
Yesofcoursenaturally, it has been the driving force behind western history always making things better when reform was needed church reforming has largely been making the world conform to its age old teachings it reformed structures by overtaking and in many ways supplanting them you can tell what the worst decisions in christian history have been because typically they were also the most innovative ,5,CatholicPolitics

Yesofcoursenaturally, there is no evidence outside of contradictory traditions that the apostles were martyred for their faith there another way of putting that all the available evidence attests that the apostles were martyred for their faith you are meanwhile dealing with people saying ure the written and oral and historical records of those closest to the events attest that but a ha here a hypothetical alternate thing that is logically possible therefore we have no way to believe anything okay great what is the worry again the sheer possibility unevidenced and against what evidence we have that there a mistake why would that be a crippling concern you can come up with an alternate possible explanation for any evidence we have first hand testimony preserved perfectly okay well who to say it real maybe it was all made up oh multiple people wrote the same thing okay clearly some group coordinated to fake it all are their accounts all identical then that worrisome because we should expect some deviation in true eyewitness testimony some subjectivity should filter in wait actually there are some incredibly minor differences in the testimony well one would think that if this was true everyone would be in agreement put another way the determined skeptic can be skeptical of everything there is admittedly an element of faith necessary in accepting history not biblical history but history period i think i made peace with that a long time ago i suggest similar for you ,21,Catholicism
Yesofcoursenaturally, the majority view of early christianity seems to paint a dire picture for any believer i am not really concerned with the majority academic view on any subject in and of itself the only value of that consensus is in the form of the arguments they supply and in this case their skepticism tends to be weak at best for instance there the general idea that the gospels are not eyewitness accounts rather they are embellished accounts that come from decades of oral traditions which were changed over time to suit each christian community needs the evidence for this claim these are not eyewitness accounts they are second or third hand they are embellished and they were done so consciously to suit an agenda has entirely little going for it its main avenue of support is ome academics who from the outset rule out the possibility or even consideration that the bible is divinely inspired or documents a divine event make a large number of assumptions about the motivations of people they typically cannot even identify it registers at best as a possibility one that requires taking the evidence we actually have doubting it all and then imagining evidence we do not have and reconstructing a narrative based on hypotheticals what seems to trouble you the most you mention this more than once is a lot of people doubt these things or come up with alternate explanations and the majority of biblical scholars are not convinced christians but neither of these things are surprising or worrying academic culture is christian hostile and the academic approach is to take an utterly skeptical view at the outset i mean you literally link to a scholar who bills himself as an anti christian apologist who himself rubs elbows with out and out jesus mythicists at the end of the day we have got plenty of biblical evidence to form a solid foundation of belief upon is it airtight no but it actually in vastly better shape than the skeptical claims you lay out in terms of fundamentals and since you already believe arguments for god existence are convincing you lack one thing that is key to atheist arguments on these fronts namely you doubt their claim that there is no agent capable of or even potentially interested in intervening in history in the ways that would make the bible possible ,11,Catholicism

Yesofcoursenaturally, our patriarchal culture has established the male unpregnant body as normative and the pregnant body as burdensome and diseased the assumption that one must be unpregnant in order to flourish in our culture is built into many of our institutions no our culture has at least until recently established getting pregnant as omething you are supposed to do while in a stable marriage you know what you call an unmarried woman who manages to get pregnant through her entirely willful acts outside of marriage someone who made a very stupid decision that she should in fact be somewhat ashamed of i notice no one balks when we say the man is exactly that when he gets a woman pregnant outside of marriage also unpregnant body is this the latest bit of academic word butchering catholic teaching however resists this patriarchal assumption by calling for a labor structure which refuses to punish those of us who can get pregnant the catholic church is the patriarchy in all its glory catholic teaching is that a woman does not have the final say over her body or her sexual choices she must do as god instructs and god is he same for the man though fewer have problems with that catholic teaching is that a woman should be married to a man before she even having sex to say nothing of getting pregnant a woman who gets pregnant out of wedlock and a man who has sex out of wedlock is committing a sin they have something to apologize for and ask forgiveness for before god himself and also frankly before the communities and family that must support them because of their easily avoided and often stupid decisions here catholic teaching if you are willfully having sex outside of marriage you are committing a wrong and you should be ashamed you need to in fact go to a priest and ask god for forgiveness the ocial structure which is the norm the one that should be encouraged is a man and a woman being married in a stable relationship having children alternative structures should be actively discouraged culturally tough teaching that it will provoke anger in some and it the catholic teaching on the topic as a baseline ,6,CatholicPolitics
Yesofcoursenaturally,here a real puzzle i think the girl is right abortion is murder ergo she a murderer but what do you do for someone who finally openly accepts this and has remorse what can be done and what can be expected of them to help them atone for what they have done so everyone can move forward the standard response is usually along the lines of utter forgiveness and sympathy but i do not think that appropriate or even all that satisfying there a place for support but it only going to be part of a larger response there no real way to undo this act of all acts but some way to atone needs to be in place exactly what is difficult to answer ,13,prolife

Yesofcoursenaturally,you decided to make dishonest insinuations and accusations against me based on little more than irrational hate i replied with pertinent evidence i am on record as condemning racial superiority claims when i am in conversations and people start attacking people on racial bases including anti asian or anti black i speak up i can do a big of digging and show as much gladly think about that i am the guy who openly talks positively about some aspects of the alt right and condemns others yet between us you have got the bigger track record of racism heck look at your action in this very thread i point out a bit of muslim anti christian behavior in australia first while urging reasonable skepticism and second against someone who apparently a second generation immigrant and you get all animated because australian muslims are likely asian and you do not like any possible criticism of such that some irony ,2,CatholicPolitics
Yesofcoursenaturally, this is stupid of a counter as i have ever heard with this logic by sitting in a church with sinners i am a moral coward no by taking part in a conversation where people right in a conversation you are having start knocking asians for being too white and you bite your tongue you are a coward r keralindia managed to speak up when such filth happened you should follow his example you would be a better man for it ,2,CatholicPolitics
Yesofcoursenaturally, i dont believe in the term illegal immigrants it does not really matter if you believe in it regardless you believe that people who come to the us and display anti white or anti american animus need to go back right deportation those people embracing asian or latino or black identity politics talking about problems of whiteness and such need to be grabbed and marched right out of the country there is no place for them here as you said they need to leave go back to mexico to sweden to somalia to india to wherever they came from if that their view right ,3,CatholicPolitics
Yesofcoursenaturally, i do agree good for you well in that case a suggestion one of your fellow r abcdesis members keeps quiet and tolerates not casual racism but quite active and virulent anti white and anti asians who act too white racism i am glad you can serve as a good moral example to them a counter to their moral cowardice for tolerating racism so long as it from their side racists need to leave first with alt right and people who hate others just for being here they do not hate others just for being here they have a problem with illegal immigration and a good part of that is because quite a lot of people who immigrate are well a lot like the folks at r abcdesis you would agree such folks especially illegal immigrants have no place in this country yes ,5,CatholicPolitics
Yesofcoursenaturally, those people are just as terrible as crapbart i agree with you that members of r abcdesis display a ton of racism and hatred towards both whites and asians who act too white those who refuse to condemn such things even as it happens right in front of them are condemnable themselves you would agree ,5,CatholicPolitics
Yesofcoursenaturally,remember that time people were bashing asians as because they were yellow on the outside white on the inside in a thread you participated in going so far as to describe the phenomenon to you exactly and your only response was moral cowardice and silence i do https rp reddit com r abcdesis comments 5yugbr dinesh dsouza on twitter since preet bharara detci9e your problem with the alt right has nothing to do with racism which you tolerate and accept without argument situationally this is entirely about ethnic self interest in other words alt right for me not for thee the fact that you are agitated because i brought up with skepticism an example of anti christian bullying by the wrong kind of muslim speaks volumes catholics deserve to be aware of this because reports of people being threatened for wearing a cross is a problem that touches on catholicism as well ,8,CatholicPolitics
Yesofcoursenaturally,you cannot get rid of distasteful comments at times regardless of the site i mean have you ever been to r abcdesis it a pack of racists who are perpetually afraid their people are elling out by acting too white they have no place in a civilized country ,6,CatholicPolitics

Yesofcoursenaturally, the sydney based daily telegraph a news corp outlet unrelated to the telegraph media group newspaper of the same name reports the couple were attacked while riding the train through muslim enclaves in south west sydney mike who asked for his surname to be withheld for fear he might be targeted said that four men of middle eastern appearance ripped his cross from his neck stomped on it and rained kicks and punches on his face back and shoulders two women attacked his girlfriend when she tried to protect him as always be a little skeptical of reports like these we have seen plenty of fake hate crimes especially of anti jewish and anti muslim varieties but worth keeping an eye on edit as people are for questionable reasons objecting to this post i note that people getting bullied and threatened for wearing a crucifix is rather a problem that touches on catholicism and catholic culture suggesting that this does not deserve discussion because it was technically a greek orthodox or quite possibly a byzantine rite catholic people screw those up is lame ,4,CatholicPolitics

Yesofcoursenaturally, not defending islam but indonesia is much progressive than the middle east countries sure is i did not deny that and i would not deny it and this shining star is islamic progressivism has blasphemy laws on and off sectarian violence and oh a bit of this when people talk about moderate islam they play up on the lack of suicide bombs but they leave out the best examples are well like this by the way you note that aceh is the only part of indonesia with sharia law stay tuned https www nytimes com 2017 01 12 world asia indonesia sharia law aceh html also remember it was not long ago that turkey nato member turkey was itself a kind of example of great modern muslim culture back when instead of becoming more islamist they had a crazy secular nationalist pseudo religion going on not a popular line nowadays people should keep an eye on what is really happening edit by the way that article i linked is quite a sight my two favorite bits they elected a female mayor see they are a little progressive oh wait she actually is a zealous enforcer of the islamic moral laws score one for feminism also there something pathetic about the observation towards the end with one of the primary points of regret about aceh change is that the discos are gone the fact that changes like these take place should make us wonder not just about islamic culture but the cultures they are managing to supplant ,1,RightwingLGBT

Yesofcoursenaturally,i am taking pro family from the article title which in turn is talking about their marriage stance do they have other faults entirely valid to point out but there hits a point where the purity tests for this kind of thing are an absurd standard especially if the view is if they are at fault they cannot be credited for doing a good thing i think we are better off giving them their due in this case it considerable two gay guys in the fashion world where the amount of pressure to be quiet at a minimum about this is major yet here they are i am gay i cannot have a child i believe that one cannot have everything in life if it s not there it means it s not meant to be it s important to deprive oneself of something dolce said and continued life has a natural path there are some things that should not be changed and one of these is family yeah that pro family it pro family in hostile territory and it seems entirely sincere scantily clad women and waifish men in ads for high fashion do not bug me as much even if there admittedly a cultural issue there and maybe that part of why we are only seeing the most valiant acts of counter culture from fringe figures because the non fringe get held to a purity standard which sets them up for crucifixion the moment a flaw is found which leaves the territory to the most shameless by default not a good situation ,2,CatholicPolitics

Yesofcoursenaturally, we have a lot of sectors that are reliant on those migrant workers which anglos would not take they wo not take them at reduced wages that only people working under the table and typically on government assistance and charity will take them for not only that but i hear there another group in the us which has a jobless problem and which is not made of anglos wait can you tell me about the jobs blacks wo not do if you are going to get into racial stereotypes play the field that wall is going to work deportations will do a bang up job too this is not a it wo not work problem for you and yours it a oh my god he actually going to do it that will work this will ruin everything problem i do not care if the individuals screwed over by a man turns out to be illegal immigrants and the screwing over is deportation and failure to come here maybe you should have cared more about the people screwed over by illegal immigration but you did not and you do not which is why once more when you give warnings and talk about how this or that wo not work fewer believe you now than ever hey you should be glad we are sending productive members of society to poor countries they will improve them ,2,CatholicPolitics

Yesofcoursenaturally, most illegal immigrants come over via legal means and overstay their visas one hell of a lot are crossing the border http www wnd com 2016 10 nearly 1 million illegal aliens crossed border in 2016 the america department of homeland security released data monday showing illegal immigration spiked 23 percent in the fiscal year leading up to the november election but that was only part of the story the dhs report said 408 870 illegal aliens were apprehended at the southern border in fiscal 2016 up 23 percent from 2015 i want that stopped you want to waste millions of tax payer dollars out of spite no it because frankly just like in this very conversation people like you insist it wo not change anything and all indications are that it will that you know it will and that it precisely because it will that you are fighting it you like and encourage illegal immigration you want it to keep happening you want the illegals made into citizens and you want their votes i do not when that wall goes up and illegal immigration drops you wo not say oh you were right that was a good idea you will be furious precisely because it worked welcome to a world where no one even pretends you are sincere anymore ,3,CatholicPolitics
