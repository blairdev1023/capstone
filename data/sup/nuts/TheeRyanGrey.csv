TheeRyanGrey,the entire point of an nba team much like your favorite show and musical artist is to consistently get you to like them for as long as possible until your fandom becomes dogmatic and you will keep spending money on them until you die nostalgically trying to regain a glimpse of your youth championships are only important to establish those dogmatic feelings long enough for you to get your kids hooked so that they can continue the process the celtics have 16 of them their fans adore them even when they suck they really do not need a championship ,0,nba

TheeRyanGrey,a rogue is the one deck where i keep shadow word death in opening hand for that turn four 5 4 or edwin early it also one of the few matchups where i 5 potion kazakus your goal is to make it to turn 10 with deathwing once you do that rogue cannot win if he buffs minions and conceals deathwing he has no answer for it none if he saps you just pop off again b let talk about shaman mid range shaman can not beat this deck unless you get an absolutely garbage opening jade shaman can only win if they draw the nuts aggro shaman is literally a 50 50 toss up i either blow them the fuck out or they doomhammer me to death against aggro shaman save ooze for doomhammer ignore their early weapons unless it desperate c so here the thing with renolock you have to either dirty rat a piece of their emperor t leeroy faceless combo or you have to always stay above 20 health getting double brann on kazakus is imperative you really need that 10 armor one and getting as many 8 8 demons as possible is huge also on netherspite get the biggest fucking dragon possible or get drakonid operative,1,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,right now your dragon choices are not limited which is why i did not put any of them as core outside of drakonid operative i guess ysera is core for the mirror and for renolock i would call deathwing core at this point because holy fuck does it just flat out beat rogue single handedly book wyrm is core it probably a top 5 6 card right now destroys shaman completely whips dragon priest and mirror matches if you save it for opposing book wyrms twilight guardians can stop druid comeback momentum stall by killing 3 6 taunt summon jade eats renolock heals in 3 3 heal 3 and 3 5 heal 4 to each player ,1,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,restricts there no restrictions dragons give priest access to the following an instant removal of 0 3 attack threats thunder bluff valiant mana tide totem early frothings totem golem refreshment vendors other book wyrms twilight guardians a 2 4 2 mana taunt zombie chow a 5 mana flame elemental the best late game cards in the game ,1,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,i was thinking the same thing lol 1 aggro shaman and pirate dragon warrior have taken over the ladder so i took out holy smite and added in potion of madness put doomsayer and ooze back into the deck as well 2 my late game now consists of no chillmaw or holy nova i run sylvanas and nefarian instead 3 ragnaros over wrathion i think this is legitimately the best version doomsayer potion ooze dirty rat evacuated evil pain cleric wyrmrest agent i have the answer for every early game ever then with brann kazakus netherspite historian drakonid operative ysera ragnaros nefarian deathwng sylvanas shadow word death i can answer any late game in the meta this deck lacks card draw but against aggro i have enough tools to stall until reno against control i have enough early mid game to push the tempo ,1,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,nefarian is the easiest replacement and if you have frost giant go ahead and play that or you can tech baron geddon and chillmaw to give you 5 aoes ,1,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,my big greedy slots are filled replaced chillmaw with nefarian amazing value card and every so often straight up auto wins vs renolock replaced nova with sylvanas did not need any more aggro stoppers ,1,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,congrats dude discuss your matchups and what you are seeing ,1,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,i have tried taking out chillmaw for nefarian it works but man does it feel so fucking greedy,1,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,my list is heavily teched to counter the greediest deck on ladder recently renolocks have teched in more early game for aggro shaman pirates so it eased up a lot,1,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,whelp and corruptor are worth the wing one is a zombie chow and the other is a fire elemental one turn earlier from my experience courier is over rated against aggro you hate seeing it drawn and against control priest wants more early game pressure the deck has enough value ,1,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,i have tried things beside chillmaw because he really only good against shaman he not big enough to win control matches and turn 7 is already game over against pirate the problem is not only is he a dragon but the curve from chillmaw into ragnaros into ysera is just perfect alex and nefarian make you too heavy and the 6 6 6 mana guy makes you i dunno it does not really do anything ,1,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,unfortunately you do not get perfect kazakus rng it why i do my best to save brann for kazakus every single time,1,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,drak operative is so insane i do not know where to start is it a 5 6 premium stat line yup is it a turn 5 dragon that is not a weak 4 4 yup does it keep your card advantage yup does it most importantly tell you 3 6 cards your opponent does not have in your deck thus giving you both card advantage and information check check check check ,2,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,i have been over drafting rbs for the past five years there always injuries there always handcuffs someone always breaks out i have two first round byes out of two leagues thanks to this strategy ,3,fantasyfootball
TheeRyanGrey,i have played exactly 3 buff paladins 3 0 none of the games are really ever close not enough data to really call anything though glad you are having success piloting it though ,1,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,i have seen exactly one freeze mage in over 200 games now drakonid operative discovered ice block brann kazukus got me 20 armor an 8 8 demon and 8 damage basically it was control warrior vs freeze mage a 90 10 slaughter ,0,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,yes my list is very teched towards renolock and mirror matches because that what i was facing as you see with my edits i faced alot of aggro shaman warrior lately so i put doomsayer and ooze back in ,1,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,i do not tech against jade druid dirty rat and deathwing just happen to improve the matchup alongside renolock ,1,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,perhaps i was not clear after turn 1 or 2 every single card in reno priest is better and saves more than 4 health mistress of mixtures was my most hyped card coming into gadgetzan after 2 days i had to cut it it just it just does not work ,2,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,i have played against that deck twice one blowout for me one insta win for them at the end i do not have enough statistics to make a call but i would say they are favored in the matchup hell that might be the best version of the deck we will have to wait and see ,1,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,it heal does not trigger when you need it which is turn one after thay there better things for four health heal ,1,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,nah there non spawn of shadows versions that run shadowform for board control check out savjz old vods or some of dogdog ,1,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,it veeery hard i have played over 200 games and i still feel like i am not greay ay it ,1,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,ayyyyeeee,1,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,tried it only good for jaraxus ,1,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,reno priest has four must cards raza reno drak op dragonfire how you build after that is up to you ,1,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,they thing is you can win every single game i am never at a disadvantage and if you draw the nuts it just gg for every other deck including renolock ,1,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,not useless i just have not found the value in it ,0,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,yes it does ,1,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,i removed ooze completely might bring it back for the jaraxus nonsense,1,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,i have never lost to reno mage so i assumed it just was not a good deck ,1,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,vs aggro cleric dirty rat wyrmrest doomsayer if you have some of these tools then keep power word shield or a 3 drop brann can be thrown down on 3 vs warlock i want a strong enough early game to push some tempo but if i cannot get that i definitely want drakonid operative or twilight drake vs druid i need a strong tempo game you want wyrmrest you want talonpriest you want technician you want to create a midgame that druid simply has to spend all their mana and resources removing make them choose between ramp and defending themselves ,2,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,ok,0,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,i have tried it when it works it nuts but so often it leads to dead draws it a weird balancing act ,1,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,mistress of mixtures is bad turn 1 it dies and gives you no health anything past turn one and it just a bad card remove it as for whelp and chillmaw both are cards that i are what i deem cuttable they both hold a very important position in the deck whelp is your zombie chow chillmaw is hard to remove and puts everything in ee nova range but you can do without both ,1,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,does reno mage beat renolock have not heard or seen too much about it ,2,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,yeah you get these really good openings with geode power word shield where you just tempo the fuck out of aggro decks but it so rare and silly and not worth it,1,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,this deck is already slow and greedy i am currently testing out ragnaros instead of wrathion so far 1 0 against renolock but it such a small sample size i cannot say anything yet edit ragnaros is love ragnaros is life i hate over reacting but after 20 30 games with ragnaros he completely improves the druid matchup to a point where i feel safe and comfortable with him in hand and he gives me another threat against warlock he really hurts the rogue matchup because sap is a monster against rag but i think it worth it ,1,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,combo is mislabeling it it protection dirty rat takes a lot of skill and know how to drop properly depending on the class ,2,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,tried that here my two issues 1 with only one copy of each a lot of times they are both dead cards this meta is not littered with 2 4 flamewakers and shaman gets wiped by this deck so the 2 3 taunts and tunnel troggs are not an issue either 2 i have entomb for the mirror reno priest mirror is fucking hilarious it all about who does not play ysera i will often end games with both copies in my hand just so my opponent cannot entomb it back i am not saying it not viable i am saying i personally found it clunky if you can make it work then more power to you,1,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,renolock should dirty rat priest at 2 points 1 when they have siphon soul hard removal and the mana to play it and dirty rat so 8 mana at least this is ysera protection 2 after i have played ysera if they hit drak op kazakus deathwing i just lose ,2,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,double kazakus one of them is getting you 10 armor 40 health is hard to do in one go ,2,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,i can only go off of what we have now but if they continue to make shitty 2 drops for priest there nothing we can do i have tried mana geode it trash ,2,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,you do not play it all one turn if you brann dirty rat you better have 1 immense board control 2 immense removal in hand just in case,2,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,i always tech for whatever the big streamers put out because that the list most people will copy ,2,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,mistress of mixtures was found bad day 1 turn you play mixtures pirate warrior kills with first mate weapon and patches you get no heal against any other deck it a shit topdeck and shit midgame lategame draw it zombie chow without the 3 health which is what made zombie chow amazing ,0,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,k,1,movies
TheeRyanGrey,yeah tried many versions of shadowform it probably going to end up the best version of the deck but it just not for me my entire gameplan revolves around keeping minions above 5 health and my free heal every turn helps immensely ,1,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,1 i am sacrificing easy wins against aggro to pick up wins vs druid warlock i took ooze and doomsayer out of my decks i am supremely confident against aggro 2 this is one of the most flexible decks i have ever seen i do not even think savjz has the optimized list there so much room for variation and teching for your specific meta reynad played renolock to 1 so i saw a shit ton of renolock no other deck really gives me quarrel so i tech for renolock ,1,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,it not easy there a lot of risk involved but i have played over 190 games now with only this deck aggro warrior has been the most popular deck on ladder since i started playing i took ooze out of my deck this is how well i have done against pirate warrior ,3,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,dirty rat is the most important card this expansion because it truly is a god card when used properly but it takes good game knowledge to use properly warrior use turn 2 if they get the frothing 4 3 charge out of it then you are probably going to lose it a risk worth taking shaman never use dirty rat until you have board control once you have board control drop that motherfucker and just clean up their value cards rogue this is the tricky one because they have some powerhouse shit i treat rogue like shaman and save that shit to close out games druid mid game drop dirty rat once you have shadow word pain or book wyrm in hand warlock oh man i could discuss this for hours it all about gameflow i want to say turn 10 11 but sometimes it earlier sometimes it later ,2,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,nah anyone who posted a genuine response being inquisitive has gotten a good response in return go read the comment section you got a shitty response because you came off aggressive an accusatory and your responses showed a genuine lack of experience in the matchup ,-3,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,wrathion is definitely able to be switched out easiest card to remove from this list last night and this afternoon i have been subbing in ragnaros and the results are decent you are forced to put another form of card draw somewhere else though ,1,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,unreliable priest does not have the draw to support it if getting coldarra drake was a 100 or even 50 chance i would run the combo all damn day ,1,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,instant regret talonpriest is fine at 3 mana because you can just throw it down on turn 3 if you have nothing to play turn 6 wasted on a 6 6 is just gross the card is clunky ragnaros worked much better ,9,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,exactly great in theory weird and clunky in play kripp has to run so much fucking card draw that if one of the pieces is at the end of the deck he just boned ,1,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,tried both shadowform version i just could not pilot i can see the value and when it worked it worked well a free 2 damage every turn allows reno priest to just oppressively close out games every minion the opponent plays has 2 health from the start and if they do not put enough pressure you are just going to hunter them to death i freely admit that i just could not pilot the aggressive version of shadowform priest if you can then i try it out justicar is just jade cards really ruined her day that 3 health is such a fucking punish worse now than ever you simply cannot afford to waste 6 mana to change a hero power removing justicar just makes this deck feel less clunky ,3,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,1 hunter not being in the meta is why renolock is 1 with a bullet 2 i can only give you my experiences combolock has not been an issue for me it the fatiguey renolock that been a pain but i freely admit that it could be luck on my part and combolock could be the real deal 3 deathwing takes 1 turn to kill jaraxus if jaraxus is at 15 health by the time you play deathwing the game is already over my friend your goal is to force renolock to play jaraxus too early you are the beatdown deck here and it why i always pick 8 8 demon from kazakus and always select the highest attack dragon from netherspite ,1,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,your opening sentence was very wrong and aggressive so i stopped reading there ,2,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,last night i tried out two pieces of tech for the matchup 1 ragnaros worked very well in place of wrathion it hurts your draw quite a bit and hurts the recovery if you mulligan poorly against aggro but the power it brings against the jaraxus play is immense 2 pint size potion is so fucking good when it works but boy does it draw dead a lot from turn 1 on sometimes i will keep playing around it but savjz cut it from his deck for a reason ,1,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,i have never had an issue with pirate warrior i believe i have pushed this deck to its greedy maximum while still maintaining a good winrate vs aggro if you are having issues then tech in doomsayer and swamp ooze or swamp ooze and 3 mana swamp ooze ,0,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,1 if you are facing more aggro then remove wrathion and add ooze and remove talonpriest and add the 3 mana ooze or remove talonpriest and add doomsayer 2 the shadowform version of this deck lost me countless games i am not saying it bad but i just cannot pilot it the way i want to i believe there is an optimized shadowform version and honestly it might be the best version of priest i simply have not gotten it to work i can never find a turn where it genuinely safe to just burn 3 mana and say fuck it against druid and warlock i am constantly using the raza heal to keep minions above a certain threshold keeping minions above 5 health is essentially the new priest meta above swipe hero power and above fellfire potion ,0,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,chillmaw and wrathion are the most replaceable cards in the deck i run chillmaw because i love putting 3 damage on everything a druid rogue has and then ee or holy novaing it down if you want more single target removal you can sub in ragnaros or some such ,2,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,1 how does rogue handle deathwing double eviscerate with azure drake up there no way they have all that left by turn 10 let alone turn 13 15 i am genuinely curious what you think jade rogue has for an answer 2 right now jade druid is the worst deck for priest because if they draw the nuts you can just get swarmed before you have time to set up your mid game aggression ,3,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,if you are seeing a ton of pirate warrior or aggro shaman where you are at then it simple add 1 ooze remove wrathion hard mulligan for holy smite wyrmrest dirty rat talonpriest always keep twilight guardian if you are still having issues then sub out defender of argus add doomsayer,5,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,1 against warlock i almost always choose two 8 8 demons from the brann kazakus the kazakus battle is one of the keys to this matchup 2 when i get netherspite historian i am always grabbing the highest attack dragon i grab noz just for the 8 8 body a lot of the time ,2,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,sorry for double posting but your comment really sparked some discussion from me here the list http www hearthpwn com decks 699161 raza priest i am currently testing out 2 things replacing wrathion with ragnaros or replacing wrathion with temple enforcer ,13,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,i never play dirty rat against shaman never like i would have to be 1 turn away from death to ever play it against aggro warrior you take the risk trust me it worth it every so often i pull it and it sucks but most of the time it just a game ender try it out dirty rat is a gamechanger ,17,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,1 your first paragraph shows a sincere lack of experience with the deck and the matchup nothing else to really say here 2 your second paragraph does the same thing 3 renolock vary but the ones i am facing use the 4 mana potion and bgh tech a lot no matter what you are facing 4 5 strong removals and their bevy of other tools deathwing and ysera is very greedy but reno priest is so good against aggro you can afford it if you want a less greedy variant be my guest ,-16,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,3 cards is still too many that combo changes the entire face of the deck i cannot state this enough i have tried it it butchers your matchups elsewhere,1,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,twilight guardian can be replaced twilight whelp can be replaced wyrmrest agent is going to be missed dearly you will have to put doomsayer in which fucking blows your early tempo lead ,2,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,1 dirty rat or wyrmrest agent on turn 2 almost wins the matchup single handedly technician into argus almost wins the matchup single handedly talonpriest onto any taunt is gameover i can go on and on unless you mulligan a hand full of 5 6 drops aggro should never be an issue 2 jade druid has shit removal and 2 3 turns of ramp turns where they put nothing on the board their mid game is also absolute trash this is a deck that dirty rat just puts the boots to taking their 4 mana 2 3 or their 6 mana 3 6 or their brann or their auctioneer is just game breaking 3 ysera drak op what comes out of drak op twilight drake chillmaw wrathion whatever comes out of netherspite wrathion whatever comes out of kazakus this does not even cover what happens when you brann netherspite or brann kazakus or brann drak op you throw an absolute fuckton at warlock face deathwing does not mean you auto win but it definitely increases your chances significant enough that i notice all the time ,-6,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,if you see a tiger do you run or do you stop and not generalize all tigers some people are black alot are niggas blacks do not care niggas do that why they are niggas ,1,movies
TheeRyanGrey,dirty rat is not the best card printed this set that raza or drakonid operative but it the most important dirty rat genuinely separates good players from bad ones in the shaman matchup i almost never play dirty rat unless i am one turn away from death and am desperate in the right hands that card is a god card ,1,hearthstone
TheeRyanGrey,man i could talk for hours about the different matchups with reno priest it the single most nuanced and varied deck i have ever seen in this game for instance against warlock 99 of the time unless i am completely desperate i save kazakus for brann the double 8 8 demon or double 6 damage board clear chance is a saving fucking grace then there even more nuance when it comes to which potion you select against each class at each point of the game i will post the decklist in an edit ,9,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,tried it putting 4 useless cards in deck fucks your other matchups badly and puts you further behind against renolock that combo requires an entire deck built around it ,0,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,never dirty rat against any non aggro deck unless you have removal in hand if you pull out something like ysera and do not have entomb you are fucked if you pull out ragnaros and do not have death you are fucked etc etc i will post decklist in an edit my bad ,6,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,man i never thought of that i will test it out but my issue is it lack of versatility deathwing shits on jade rogue and jade druid along with helpings against renolock dirty rat ends every aggro matchup if drawn on turn 2 along with helping against renolock defender of argus same thing they are all versatile ,11,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,justicar problem is jade decks and the 3 health without jade decks you could just justicar and fatigue everyone so many things do 3 damage nowadays that justicar becomes a 6 mana investment that just dies ,12,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,yeah my bad typed on my phone and forgot to add decklist i will edit it into the post ,5,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,1 reno priest is not a casual deck if you like long control games recovering from shitty hands and mulligans switching from beatdown to fatigue or fatigue to beatdown on a moments notice then sure it for you but this deck takes a lot of time if you still want to invest the importance goes raza kazakus reno without reno you are not as safe against aggro and midrange and your winrate against renolock mirror matches plummets honestly you need all three cards in this meta but if you are dead set on playing it then raza kazakus reno ,6,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,1 renolock is worse against aggro than reno priest their list is so fucking greedy they run almost no early game taunts or heals their early game is based around killing themselves hunter was always renolocks counter for this exact reason they have to tap to get to reno but tapping puts them closer to turn 5 6 death 2 combo renolock is worse than normal renolock and is not even an issue i am telling you 35 games against renolock and 30 of those games i am at 25 30 health for most of it leeroy finisher is not the best version of that deck 3 no you can punish jaraxus with deathwing there is no priest combo that does not involve 4 5 cards and saving that many cards gets you fucking slaughtered and worsens your matchups elsewhere reno priest is strong enough to float one dead card for most of the game deathwing is that good this meta warlock can answer ysera and drakonid operative and large twilight drakes and whatever comes out of kazakus they can even answer whatever you pull out of netherspite they can not answer deathwing at the end of games it is priest only counter for late game jaraxus value ,9,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,dirty rat is to renolock what book wyrm is to mid range shaman it does not mean you automatically win but it sure fucks up their plan ,0,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,my favorite win over a renolock is the following 8 game win streak down to last 2 cards facing three 6 6 demons 2 kazakus used by both sides ysera and deathwing killed me down to 1 health renolock down to 7 malygos in hand from netherspite historian topdeck holy smite win game unfortunately this deck does not run enough spells and sacrificing ysera which single handedly wins some matchups is a no go ,0,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,there absolutely no way to cut 4 cards from this list without ruining other matchups you might as well use the combo kripp popularized with spawn of shadows raza shadowform garrison commander sir finley before warlock uses jaraxus you are ahead but it takes every single card in your deck to do so holding 4 cards would put you so far behind you would never catch up ,2,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,i apologize i typed on my phone and forgot to paste the decklist i will edit it in deathwing is only a dead card against aggro which you already dominate against renolock or any jade class at worst you draw it too early and it powers every other dragon at best it wins the game right then and there ,2,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,reno leaving hurts warlock way more no more free taps all damn day without being able to be punished for it by aggro priest can just tech in more taunts or greater heal potion and still shit all over aggro without renolock though i do not see a deck challenging raza priest if i did not have to tech so hard for renolock i could 60 40 or 70 30 every other deck ,8,CompetitiveHS
TheeRyanGrey,dirty rat definitely is a tech card because it drawback is massive if you dirty rat against renolock dragon priest or shaman you could lose the game instantly it a high risk high reward card,1,hearthstone

TheeRyanGrey,ben watson was average did you see what brees did for his old ass ,3,fantasyfootball
TheeRyanGrey,1 did you watch a single lions game after cooter took over stafford did not look on the decline he looked rejuvenated the same way eli did when they changed the offense to a more short readable one 2 the lions defense is a huge reason to draft stafford no game will ever be comfortable there wo not be any blowouts they will always be throwing stafford is a flat out better qb than those around his adp and his offense and weapons are better ,5,fantasyfootball
TheeRyanGrey,cooter offense was not so limited the way the lions were before using riddick on 3rd down because that was the only time a rb was ever seen as an option in the read the lions used passing on first down the way the patriots or packers do as a means of establishing a 2nd and short and forcing an honest defense on 3rd and long or medium you will see riddick for sure but it wo not be as dramatic as it was in 2015 ,1,fantasyfootball
TheeRyanGrey,you cannot ride or die with that mentality the same thing happened with doug martin last year and it foolish anyone who watched the lions previously could see that calvin johnson greatness had become a detriment to the offense he was kobe in the mid 2000s such a dramatic focus that nothing could exist the lions under jim bob fuckin cooter were so much more wildly efficacious with their play calling and spreading the ball around watching stafford use his cannon arm to fit nice timing patterns with gusto was a significant upgrade to watching him try and sling it downfield every play ,3,fantasyfootball

TheeRyanGrey,it quite simple no running back has a higher ceiling than lamar miller with a safe floor to back it up i am a vikings fan i know adrian peterson ceiling at this point gurley is going to get fed touches but his offense is pedestrian and has no one to keep defenses honest david johnson probably has the highest ceiling because his offense is elite but we have only seen a very tiny sample size lamar miller has proven on a per touch basis to be incredibly valuable and now he moving to an offense that features its rb in an incredibly valuable fantasy method you can take peterson and guarantee yourself a nice safe top 5 running back or you can swing and go for the potential 1 overall player in fantasy ,0,fantasyfootball

TheeRyanGrey,i know which one they will do all i am saying is which one is the better option warrior problem is that ghoul and ichor alleviate warriors biggest weakness it would be akin to giving druid solid hard removal or giving rogue healing or giving paladin ways to execute equality make ghoul 4 mana make ichor only work on already damaged minions ,1,hearthstone

TheeRyanGrey,when i play druid warlock hunter i know what deck it is 90 of the time when i play paladin mage priest rogue i know which of the 2 decks is it within 2 3 turns shaman and warrior are the only classes right now where i have to mulligan against the worst outcome aggro for shaman dragon for warrior and then play the game out until i see what is going on that fun that using your brain as for execute it not the problem ravaging ghoul ichor are the issue death bite was warriors best card because it killed a 4 drop and then put 1 damage onto a lot of things this saved you from having to run 2 whirlwinds and taking up deck slots ravaging ghoul and ichor give warrior 4 ways of doing 1 damage making execute a 1 mana kill anything for free while also developing the board card warriors no longer have to run brawl in every deck giving them free reign to be creative that healthy except right now they are the only ones who have such access ,0,hearthstone

TheeRyanGrey,bruh the cavs the lebron james and d leaguers cavs took you guys to the limit you guys struggled with bynum 01 shaq is fouling perkins out in about 10 minutes ,5,nba
TheeRyanGrey,i am taking 2004 pistons over most of this bracket especially the modern shooters that team had so many elite 1 on 1 defenders and big men who could guard the pnr tayshaun prince was kawhi leonard before people realized that was the future of wing play ,1,nba
TheeRyanGrey,lebron is not shaq you guys need to stop this 2001 shaq is known as the most unguardable unstoppable juggernaut ever wilt was playing with people he dwarfed physically shaq made other gigantic men look very very small ,2,nba
TheeRyanGrey,teams in 2001 had 2 3 large centers to throw at shaq they drafted to stop shaq tiago splitter is getting dick all in his face ,2,nba

TheeRyanGrey,there would be 3 very interesting sub plots here 1 how many times zaza pachulia gets shaq dick all in his face 2 klay vs kobe if klay hit a couple early shots young kobe would take it so personally 3 derek fisher trying to guard steph curry it would basically come down to the warriors running shaq through the pnr every single time down the court and the lakers playing like the 15 cavs,2,nba
TheeRyanGrey,bruh it called hack a shaq for a reason the lakers wo not be shocked or caught off guard kobe in the bonus for 40 minutes so you cannot check him or stop his drives to the rim ok ,1,nba
TheeRyanGrey,it crazy how many of these dudes do not understand that every team drafted and spent money with one idea in mind how the fuck do we beat shaq when you see guys like olawakandi going 1 and all these big goofy 7 footers making the drafts and free agency from 99 04 look retarded it because everyone had to answer that question can we slow down shaq it like when you play magic the gathering and shaq is mono red it like playing hearthstone and shaq is zoo if the answer was no then your team had no real purpose 2000 2001 shaq was so unguardable there no other way to describe it take lebron 2013 season and put it on a 300 pound 7 foot 1 inch monster who could knock other 7 footers on their ass every single time never once during the 2001 playoff run did i ever think the lakers would lose when the sixers beat them i literally cried it felt like someone had slapped god or some shit ,75,nba

TheeRyanGrey,and varys and now sansa are the only ones who know just how powerful he is it fucking hilarious littlefinger has more titles than fucking khaleesi and no one ever talks about him ,5,gameofthrones
TheeRyanGrey,it actually the people who truly believe they are doing the right thing who end up committing the greatest evil and doing the most harm when joffrey was beaten for instance when arya had her sword at his face he knew he was beaten he knew he was in the wrong he even told cersei he had lost it tommen who we watch fuck up over and over but truly believes he doing the right thing who ends up doing the most damage to king landing you can recover from a tyrannical leader you cannot recover from a useless one who lets religious invaders make up their own laws ,1,gameofthrones
TheeRyanGrey,shireen baratheon was nice and sweet and wholesome in 999 999 out of 1 000 000 times in television and movies this means the little girl lives shireen baratheon is the rarest of exceptions,1,gameofthrones
TheeRyanGrey,i mean do they need to show everything the mountain did to the tied down septa or can you imagine they showed the sparrows killing gay men in brothels it did not get better from there ya know ,3,gameofthrones

TheeRyanGrey,once again it depends on your view of evil most people if given the choice would let 10 000 000 people die to save the person they loved it the entire focal point of the last of us and what made that game so memorable i for one could not let that many people die for my own selfish reasons joffrey king landing was bloody but it was also safe and welcoming tommen king landing was a religious hellhole where non believers are murdered and publicly humiliated ,0,gameofthrones
TheeRyanGrey,i am a bunk man myself bunk stringer all,3,gameofthrones
TheeRyanGrey, you think joffrey runs the seven kingdoms tywin lannister of course not you do tyrion lannister,4,gameofthrones
TheeRyanGrey,it depends on your view of evil the king landing of joffrey reign was not great but it was drastically better than that of tommen tommen saw evil happening and lacked the courage to stop it he even quit in the end instead of standing up and saying enough you can say but he was just a boy but so was joffrey and this is a story that takes place in the middle ages when men were seen as adults at a younger age ,-2,gameofthrones
TheeRyanGrey,beloved best not to turn this too political but game of thrones is a politically charged book but the common people often do not know what is good for them tywin was king and he did rule through an iron fist and the kingdoms were at peace until littlefinger said yolo ,3,gameofthrones
TheeRyanGrey,margaery got what should have happened to mystique an actress actor begins to outgrow the role and you are forced to make them the star or get rid of them but even in the books i do not believe margaery accomplishes some grand plan littlefinger saw through margaery in an instant olenna still educates her in their scenes together all margaery has done is manipulate 2 very susceptible boys who were looking for anyone to be nice to them and care about them she not some grand schemer olenna is she just not young and hot enough to woo kings so she sends margaery with the instruction manual in the end margaery gave the game away she brought tommen to the high sparrow she gave away the meal ticket ,23,asoiaf
TheeRyanGrey,if tywin main point was just wisdom he would have just said be a wise king and listen to good council he specifically stated much like grrm and the showrunners have since season 1 that soldiers and nice guys and religious fanatics do not make good kings in the end tommen was a worse king than joffrey ,-11,gameofthrones
TheeRyanGrey,he was the exact opposite he let evil things happen which is often worse how many people died were tortured or were driven from their homes because of the fanatics tommen let rule his city because he was too passive to stop them sure joffrey would have made a bloodbath of about 30 40 fanatics but that bloodbath would have saved alot of lives including cersei blowing up a fucking building ,-1,gameofthrones
TheeRyanGrey,i think davos respected jon more for not killing her than anything remember he often had to talk stannis out of not killing people or at least he tried she tried seducing jon with her power the same way she did stannis and he still turned her down he did the right thing without going overboard he not a king which is why he makes such a good king,13,asoiaf
TheeRyanGrey,he more a sadistic psychopath he raped her because he knew it could cause her the most pain her being a virgin and all ,0,asoiaf

TheeRyanGrey,jaime has always along with theon been my favorite book show characters in this episode all within a span of about three minutes jaime lannister was forced to see how the world views himself the way he views walder frey and the way the world views his sister the way he views the mad king he spent all of season 6 trying to regain who and what he was before the war started fighting off reality with everything he had left and his two scenes this episode were the final collapse add in his son falling from a window the way he pushed bran and jaime as we know it is no more ,1,asoiaf
TheeRyanGrey,very simple littlefinger is willing to be king of the ashes as long as it means he king littlefinger started the war of the 5 kings if we remove things like greed and power and humanity littlefinger is the root cause of this entire show ,14,gameofthrones
TheeRyanGrey,you are technically correct the best kind,8,gameofthrones
TheeRyanGrey,yeah that one is always a whoa moment,3,gameofthrones
TheeRyanGrey,in less than 3 minutes jaime lannister got to see how the world sees him and how the world sees his sister ,9,gameofthrones
TheeRyanGrey,tommen forgot everything tywin taught him about what makes a good king literally everything tywin specifically told him being a nice king or a religious king was not a good idea then he went and did exactly that ,14,gameofthrones
TheeRyanGrey,so was joffrey you feel bad for him ,-5,gameofthrones
TheeRyanGrey,you guys have a hard on for the underdogs dating up brienne getting jaime and tyrion getting dany but tyrion is literally the worst marriage match for her imaginable he a lannister dwarf whom everyone still thinks killed joffrey and knows killed tywin genetically and diplomatically he the worst choice alive ,1,gameofthrones
TheeRyanGrey,why we have had 6 seasons of why she been joffrey levels of violent and cruel and tommen levels of ignorant and gullible she has absolutely 0 diplomatic skills this season with tyrion is the first time she ever felt like a capable ruler and that because she was smart enough to realize her weaknesses finally ,-6,gameofthrones
TheeRyanGrey,important to note is that not only does dany believe in him but he believe in her he did all those other jobs for himself and with great malice a well dressed middle finger to the world screaming look what i can do and i do not even like it for the first time ever he a part of something he believes in ,5,gameofthrones

TheeRyanGrey,some savage,1,TheRedPill
TheeRyanGrey,i do not know why everyone expected more from margaery tommen death was all but inevitable either through cersei or the high sparrow and once he was dead margaery would no longer have any grasp over the throne her entire story was leaping from king to king to try and pull her house to 1st from 2nd only for her to fall from the ladder by finally getting a king who loved her and selling him to the high sparrow to save her brother that her story ,6,gameofthrones
TheeRyanGrey,a little credit to emilia clarke she jumps from existential to playful to serious right along with tyrion their conversations have such depth and are so multi faceted she starts out almost shocked in herself discovering leaving daario is not as hard as she thought only to bounce playfully with tyrion about his inability to cheer her up ,8,gameofthrones
TheeRyanGrey,walder frey set jaime straight my friend everything walder said was right jaime was never in a real war he was at king landing when the war was happening his first real war he got captured he not some legendary soldier his pages are empty he a tourney knight his greatest victories have all been diplomatic ones he slew his king and so did walder frey the freys needed lannister help to hold the riverlands and jaime needed lannister help to escape the north jaime got compared to walder frey and it hurt because it was all true ,2,gameofthrones
TheeRyanGrey,he would have been an awful king absolutely awful since season 1 game of thrones has been making a point about who makes a good ruler the entirety of dany storyline is her figuring that out hell tywin speech to tommen was an abridged version of this show entire message tommen was a nice boy but nice boys do not make good kings he ruled for less than a year and was terrible because he had no confidence in himself and was too nice and thought everyone could get along like some disney movie the second he marched his soldiers to the sept and did not come back with his wife he lost everything ,3,gameofthrones
TheeRyanGrey,more of a splatter,1,gameofthrones
TheeRyanGrey,not really any story left to tell tommen has been doomed since the start leaving margaery out of people to marry margaery story was that she king hopped because all she wanted was the throne she was the tyrells path to the top and it all came tumbling down when she sold her king to the high sparrow to save loras the tyrell line dying was the most interesting thing that could happen,1,gameofthrones
TheeRyanGrey,cersei pretty much single handedly ruined king landing since season 1 dany would have died long ago if not for drogo and jorah protection yara is a fucking boss no arguments here should have been made queen of the iron islands lyanna cracks me up but like she cannot defend herself she got the world greatest plot armor little girl in a television show and sansa is pretty much dependent on everyone around her she much better in season 6 than season 1 but let not act like she did anything ,-1,gameofthrones
TheeRyanGrey,that moment where his neck is sliced and she holding back his hair like a boyfriend realizing it time to break up with his puking girlfriend was fucking chilling,1,gameofthrones

TheeRyanGrey,margaery made 2 huge mistakes 1 she pettily kicked cersei when she was down when cersei admitted defeat and walked up to margaery in the garden margaery went out of her way to stomp on her and shit on her which is fine except 2 she did not fuck end her much like ned stark if you are coming for cersei you have to fucking end her destroy her do not give her time to recoup ,1,gameofthrones

TheeRyanGrey,she so smart she sold the king to the high sparrow who then turned around and carved her brother up anyway,6,gameofthrones
TheeRyanGrey,margaery does not get a free pass here she purposely played the game of thrones with cersei the second she thought she won she began fucking with cersei when cersei was at her lowest kicking the dead horse over and over then she sells out tommen to the high sparrow never forget it was margaery who did that she sold him to the high sparrow to try and save her brother she just was not as fucking hardcore gangster bitch like cersei ,1,gameofthrones
