sivsta,stop putting words in my mouth i never said blacks do not come from impoverished areas i am saying there are huge swaths of america that are impoverished that are not black this is a pr move by the ellen show and walmart they could have picked an impoverished rural white or latino area but they did not because of ratings marketing and social media the hypocritical aspect about this is that if it were a bunch of white impoverished kids standing up there you would have groups condemning and complaining that there no diversity on stage while denouncing the ellen show and calling for them to apologise ,19,MadeMeSmile

sivsta,luckily your view is in the minority nowadays people are opening their eyes to the pitfalls of islamic culture it not all bad but it difficult to separate the radical aspects you must have used bigot 10 times in our conversation it often used as a tool to shut down discussion ,2,news
sivsta,yes some people were saying it a little weird to say this to girls doubly so if you are a man i think it all in the context of how you go about it it can be but people have also been preconditioned to think everyone is a bad person in society it a little overblown and then the idea that op almost did not enroll in stem subjects because she was called a model growing up is a stretch imo the op said this occurred in india so the cultural norms are little different than western norms ,0,news
sivsta,agreed after thinking about it a little bit you do not really hear this compliment much and it kind of weird creepy op said this happened to her in india so it makes a little more sense as i rarely heard it growing up i replied because i was wondering how far we will take it in society will i be able to compliment a girl on her athletic skills or will society look different at it the future etc ,1,news
sivsta,that a shame from a medical standpoint rough play encourages bones ligaments and muscle to grow it natural,1,news
sivsta,that makes a lot more sense india is starting to grapple with their social problems but it was swept under the rug for a long time,1,news
sivsta,makes sense and after thinking about what op said again it does sound a little weird or creepy from today standards i think we have moved on a little in society i find it hard to believe people would constantly be complimenting her model looks as she growing up if i were her parent be proactive and have a discussion her and the adults who said it ,3,news
sivsta,i agree with you mostly although you may find an old person who does not care about such trivialities and will give a girl a compliment like this however op original statement was lamenting the fact that other people were asking her if she was a model yet or were making comments like this and this was shaping her thoughts who makes such compliments rarely do you hear the model compliment said to a girl it a little weird even from another woman it kind of disparaging it unlikely this happens as often as it used to ,0,news
sivsta,fair point the beauty model compliments are a little creepy now that i think about it i was bringing this up in the first place because i do not want things to get to the point where you cannot compliment a girl on her athletic skills lest society look down on you,5,news
sivsta,this is how it starts though by saying it unacceptable or wrong ie if i were to give a girl an athletic compliment etc but i generally agree that it a little creepy for a man to give a girl a physical compliment old people might not care though but getting back to op original comment i do not think this happens very often nowadays society knows it kind of rude weird to say this to a college student and weirder for younger ,-2,news

sivsta,should we not compliment a girl on her looks edit after some discussion it does sound a little creepy coming from a man and coming from another woman can be a little disparaging i was bringing this up lest we look down upon people for giving compliments to girls about their athletic ability or w e if pushed far enough these type of things would be taboo next,3,news

sivsta, nope muslim communities like mine have been in the us for decades everyone sees things differently but this statement gives a glimmer into why you do not want to acknowledge that many islamic cultures have serious flaws i would prefer muslims stay in their country of origination instead of migrating in large numbers to the west https youtu be nhnzgim3qhs we can agree to disagree yet for some reason you hold muslims to a higher standard while ignoring stuff like growing racism and recent history where non muslims committed the worst atrocities in human history like wwi wwii and the massive purges of the cold war lets not forget european colonialism that wiped out 3 continents and half of africa i did not realize holding muslims to modern western standards was a higher standard thanks for clearing that up racism is not nearly as bad as it used to be just because twitter snowflakes are getting triggered because someone called them a bad word does not mean racism is on the rise if you want to say partisanship is on the rise i would believe that i work with several different nationalities and interact with ethnic kids in an urban setting all the time people get along just fine if anything people are more understanding than they were 30 40 years ago you are sensationalizing things all of the terrible things that happened in the past i had no part in you are making excuses for people today because someone else did bad things in the past also it kind of a dick move pulling that card i am not going around telling turks they need to check themselves because of the armenian genocide all it does is divert attention from current events hurr hurr do not judge the muslim who shot up a gay bar they are still adjusting to modern society you guys did worse in ww2 ,3,news

sivsta,the rockets and others were interested too so that may have been the going rate ,1,Mavericks
sivsta,it like when you lose a basketball game because you missed shots not because the plays were bad people just get annoyed when things do not go their way look for someone or something to blame if it was not for dirk cuban would have tanked this ship years ago the only thing i wish he would have done different is listen to donnie on the 13 pick with giannis but that situation is also a product of wanting to win now for dirk mentality ,1,Mavericks
sivsta,i wish we could keep him somehow he a high flyer loved his high energy if we did not draft hammons javale could go full tilt for 10mins a night i think javale wants playing time so this decision might be for the best the rockets might take a flyer on him they need some big men it would be crazy if javale has some vintage nuggets games against us in the regular season if he ever puts it together and gets healthy he was a force to watch ,3,Mavericks
sivsta,damn i hope we are not rolling dirk out there for 39mins that says something bad about our bench if so,1,Mavericks
sivsta,lance is a knucklehead rick does not tolerate much of that so it would be dicey and d lee will proably sign elsewhere for more playing time and salary we do not have a lot to offer him besides reuniting with a few former teammates ,0,Mavericks
sivsta,damn he would be good for team chemistry and that veteran coach game and he could step in when rick wants him to show the young guys how it done he has lost more than a step so he would be at the bottom of the depth chart imo ,2,Mavericks
sivsta,carlisle likes to see his pg sg guys as guards he loves it when guys can play multiple positions and it trending in the nba that guys be able to play on the ball and off the ball so i hope he can do both ,1,Mavericks
sivsta,d lee probably wo not sign with us he can make more elsewhere and there would be limited playing at the 4 we just signed powell to a mult year so you would expect him to get bulk of the minutes behind dirk that being said i would love d lee just for the player chemistry all the new pickups know him well ,2,Mavericks
sivsta,d lee probably wo not sign with us he can make more elsewhere and there would be limited playing time behind powell we just signed him to mult year so you would expect him to get bulk of the 4 minutes behind dirk although it was a slap in the face of d powell last year to ride the bench while d lee takes the bulk of the minutes i do not know why the mavs brass though that pickup was necessary,1,Mavericks
sivsta,he played like ass in the finals so following that harden path who played like ass against the heat then went to the rockets i doubt he the next superstar but he could develop a bit more ,1,Mavericks
sivsta,sadly we drafted a big man who has some decent potential we are not carrying a 4th big guy and i doubt we would ditch mejri i wish we could keep javale but it unlikely ,1,Mavericks
sivsta,i do not know if anderson is ready for the 2 he not quite there with the ball handling i see him more like a jae crowder mold we will see if he develops the ball handling more this season it a difficult thing to improve in the short term i agree we should ditch evans guy is so athletic but he is so uncoordinated with his ball handling,1,Mavericks
sivsta,good passer high iq guy inside the elbow paint he faded later in the season we were running him out there for 30 mins a night a little undersized at the 5 but he can body up most bigs crafty pretty good at stripping the ball away when someone posts him up can knock down an outside jump shot likes it around the free throw area he will get feisty down low throw a few elbows if the team needs him to or if another big is annoying him played well in defensive coverage average defending the fast break team first guy wants everyone to be responsible does not like it when guys blow a coverage on d surprisingly good rebounder he boxes out the athletic guys he sets pretty good screens he would probably thrive against a 2nd unit we put him out there against starters and he did better than anticipated it felt like he takes up a lot of space in the paint some guys play taller than they are zaza plays wider than he is rebounds would fall to him because he making the other rebounders work for every possession and he positions himself pretty well under the rim he can utilize his elbows pretty well to create space sometimes it pays off sometimes the ref tacks him with an offensive foul it was cool to see him out work guys for offensive rebounds when he was an inch or two shorter this guy was getting more all star votes at the break than demarcus he barely missed the vote the whole country of georgia was stuffing the ballot box but he was playing pretty well just not demarcus level ,1,Mavericks
sivsta,you really think he will sign knowing playing time is limited we just signed powell to a multi year contract who plays the same position and dirk mostly plays the 4 i mean the player chemistry would be awesome just do not see it happening since we have limited minutes at his position,1,Mavericks
sivsta,sadly i do not think d lee fits into our plans given our depth chart and we just signed d powell to a multi year deal d lee would be awesome for the player chemistry tho,1,Mavericks

sivsta,the knucklehead is strong with this one will give rick fits,4,Mavericks
sivsta,kanter is not a good defender one of the problems with pairing a guy next to dirk is he needs to be good on d it makes up for dirk weak lateral movement nowadays and dirk was never strong on d so yea ,1,Mavericks

sivsta,nobody is saying eliminate child labor laws we have a disproportionate number of people looking for jobs and the number of jobs available sure there have been instances where companies collude to keep salaries down but generally employers have to compete for workers in the job force one of the concerns with raising the minimum wage is that it a good thing and a bad thing it does raise the standard of living for those that have legal jobs but the employer is far less likely to hire another worker because it costs them more than it did before it all evens out in the end,0,technology
sivsta,if we eliminated the minimum wage the labor market would set itself why do people not like this idea then politicians would finally have to account for net immigration more job seekers when the economy is stagnant the reality of the situation is we have too many people out there and not enough jobs competition is only getting worse with the incorporation of robotics and machines ,-5,technology
