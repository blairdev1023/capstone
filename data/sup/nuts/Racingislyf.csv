Racingislyf,something about my age and they just said it two different countries and had to do their test i was 18 with a full motorbike license and i just guess it just did not look good safe i tried a different rta same thing but i did not mind i just enjoy riding any bike ,1,motorcycles
Racingislyf,i had no choice because i moved from new zealand to australia and had to redo my license so i went from a few high cc bikes back to a lams bike i do not mind it though i have a cbr500r and it still fun it always fun to have a smaller bike for commuting though cheaper on gas and easier to lane split ,3,motorcycles
Racingislyf,a track last year was really strict on that i think it was brno and in the last corner you absolutely can not go over the limit of the track or your lap didnt count for qf a few riders done some good times but ran wide and they did not count it and it was only off by a bit not sure how it worked when it was racing ,2,motogp
Racingislyf,what a load of shit ,6,Incels
Racingislyf,im just saying that you could put the worse outcome and riders will still make mistakes no matter what because they are humans yes safety comes first and thats why i do not mind the rules now its not like maverick cut the corner on purpose he just made a mistake like every other human ,1,motogp
Racingislyf,yeah okay but you make it sound like he did it on purpose he made a mistake you put a wall there and sooner or later someone will still make a mistake and crash into it ,1,motogp
Racingislyf,so no one is allowed to be faster and make rossi push hard that he will crash right ,2,motogp
Racingislyf,well i hope he starts doing that again ,1,motogp
Racingislyf,i think rossi looked after his tyres the best out of everyone in that race most of the guys broke the race pace that was predicted and johann zarco was on soft yet still pushed to the end and also went faster than race pace predicted rossi had the race in the bag but that one mistake he made riding a defensive line is what cost him the race he could not help it but push even harder then he planned to win it maverick had to cut the corner because his tyres would have been worse then rossi because rossi made that turn easily but yes in the end rossi decided to go for it but i do think he looked after his tyres better till the very end just before marc crashed he was putting in some fast laps but i think you are right the yamaha were cruising so that means marc probably was as well because he was not really catching up just sucks he crashed out i was hoping for a 4 way battle at the front ,0,motogp
Racingislyf,keep up the good work they are so salty ,0,motogp

Racingislyf,still salty why do you hate honda and their riders such much ,6,motogp
Racingislyf,the attitude was the same as the riders i named in their first year they took huge risks and just want to destroy the field and let them know that they made it to motogp because they are that good rossi still does what zarco done today which is cutting his way through the field as fast as he can before the front pack pulls too far ahead ,8,motogp
Racingislyf,rossi dani lorenzo marquez have all done it when they got into motogp unless you have just started watching then it makes sense ,13,motogp

Racingislyf,well they won in 2007 so they just kept the winning fomula years after while the other factories improved ,1,motogp
Racingislyf,apparently ducati did not want to listen to any rider till recently not even rossi ,3,motogp

Racingislyf,i like the maximum effort ,6,motogp
Racingislyf,tyres and fuel maybe its perfect i reckon i would hate it if it went for to long and had to pit etc you will have the whole field split up and some will be forced to let others pass wo not be many battles happening as well or close finishes ,14,motogp
Racingislyf,le mans 2009 is the only one i can think of the top of my head he was in 3rd then flew past casey stoner and dani pedrosa in the first lap or 2nd and back then it was not easy doing that to dani and casey rossi was 4th but could not go with lorenzo then he proceeded to destroy the field by 17 seconds it started as a wet race then dry ,4,motogp
Racingislyf,just so you know lorenzo use to be just as good in the rain as the other aliens or any condition coming up the ranks and alot of his top class rides he done battle at the front with the best in any condition its only been the last few seasons he fallen off ,5,motogp
Racingislyf,fuck that place lets just replace it with a track that sure to be sunny or we can race in the rain ,8,motogp
Racingislyf,someone will have to make sure maverick does not break away so they will hold him up with a few block passes here and there or the top few can take turns on keeping him at bay but racing is completely different to testing so the others might come out firing and leave maverick for dead i see marquez winning the race pedrosa 2nd and dovi 3rd,1,motogp

Racingislyf,rossi fans need to realise that he is human and he too gets old fuck even logan got old he still crazy fast but just not as physically fit as the younger guys in the press he told them that maverick was braking deeper and opening the throttle earlier then him but comes race day he will turn up just like any of the young guys and make his way through to the front some genius should make something to reverse his ageing so we can see prime rossi vs prime marc n others ,1,motogp

Racingislyf,1 marquez because alien 2 maverick because maverick 3 lorenzo because ducati power ,2,motogp
Racingislyf,yeah that true but vinales riding style is different and most importantly is his mentality he not a world champion yet so he will push that bit extra over lorenzo who already tasted greatness ,1,motogp

Racingislyf,vinales has to get in front early and put down some extremely fast laps and pull away like stoner use to or what lorenzo does now then just break the field with sheer speed but marquez easily got behind him in the phillip island test and had to end his race simulation so i doubt it will happen cant wait for the racing to start ,4,motogp
Racingislyf,he found out real quick that it was a bad idea ,1,WTF
Racingislyf,how crazy is that ,3,motogp
Racingislyf,that the kind of wingman we all need ,1,funny
Racingislyf,most people say the ducati just flew past everyone on the straights yet stoner won on some tracks that did not have much plus loris capirossi was not even in the top five you could see how fast casey was in 2006 because he usually at the front with the factory guys but then always crashes and his starts were insane rivaled dani back then ,7,motogp
Racingislyf,we have rins and jack to join the fun in the next couple of years should be good just the bike difference at the moment ,2,motogp
Racingislyf,that why im a fan of marc as well no mind games off track needed ,1,motogp

Racingislyf,marc does not need to play mind games with rossi he just destroys people on the tracks ,13,motogp
Racingislyf,i watch for the sport especially when you ride a motorcycle and you look at what they do and wish you can have a bit of their skills even the slowest guys in motogp are amazing i did follow stoner because of how fast he was most people find it boring when a rider breaks the pack and disappears but i dont mind it when it happens because that not an easy thing to do especially at that level i remember mugello 2016 and i saw most fans leaving because rossi engine blew and then that last lap happened and they would have missed it that what some people who only follow one rider miss out on ,1,motogp

Racingislyf,shuhei nakamoto casey was very fast on cornering speed casey was very good in acceleration may be he found the correct bank angle or the correct power delivery control or something in the data you could see that he had perfectly under control the limit of the tire grip the point where the tire grip ends and the traction control starts to work cutting power his throttle control on acceleration was amazing always on the edge marc is similar but definitely he uses more the traction control help ,15,motogp
Racingislyf,casey stoner because of his riding style and just how fast he was now it marc marquez for the same reasons both have incredible pace ,2,motogp
Racingislyf,still salty after all these years ,11,motogp
Racingislyf,i thought it would have been lorenzo saying all this if we set up the races for perfect weather the guys that are usually fast in the wet have no chance at glory i thought these guys did not care an that awful lot about weather but more about how fast they can go in any condition they just want to race but i guess not ,-1,motogp
Racingislyf,i think maverick vinales would challenge marc marquez next year he shown alien feats here and there now that he going to be on the m1 hes going be fast as fuck i just hope he adapts to the bike early on and hes got rossi to learn from ,6,motogp
Racingislyf,fair enough,1,motogp
Racingislyf,the corner exit from the hondas was costing them a lot of time those bikes are animals marc is so late on the brakes its crazy and is maverick an alien now ,1,motogp

Racingislyf,cant believe they went through all those years using pit boards and all of the sudden boom someone messes their race up and it changes them comparing lap times and the gaps between front and back rider does not sound good the pits would control the riders pace telling him when to speed up and when to ease off i quite like the way things are especially seeing the pit board guys go nuts as they go by ,4,motogp
Racingislyf,big hero 6 ,2,AskReddit
Racingislyf,i hope this does not happen dont let one guy ruin the sport he will retire in two years and everyone will have to put up with radios and team tactics just keep it old school and race just cause he made the wrong decision a few times does not mean we have to change the system to fit him and to make sure he does not mess up again selfish real,12,motogp

Racingislyf,marc marquez you demon done it again poor pol or whoever it was that left the pits with marc if that rider didnt go down and followed marc he would have been on the podium haha another amazing race god i love motogp ,3,motogp
Racingislyf,i hope stoner does race itll be interesting seeing him go up against all the new guys like marc maverick etc ,2,motogp
Racingislyf,casey stoner might do it if he does a wild card in phillip island i hope he does but i highly doubt it ,1,motogp
Racingislyf,those moves were crazy marc is fearless honda needs to sort there shit out but man that was a great last lap ,14,motogp
