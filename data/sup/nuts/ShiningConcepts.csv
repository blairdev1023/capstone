ShiningConcepts,i fully support abortions i support the idea of your body your choice problem is what feminists opposing fiscal abortion say is your body your choice my responsibility if you want the kid you created to be born and she does not she can kill it and you have no recourse if you do not want the kid to be born or if you do not want to be a part of it life and she births it you have to pay cs and you have no recourse if you have no reproductive rights you should have no imposed reproductive responsibility those 9 months before a kid is born are far more important to it being born than the initial sex sure the initial sex is a 50 50 deal but the 9 months are a 100 0 deal but you are right this is a pipe dream that will never happen our society is eager to keep women from being held accountable to their choices and keep all the blame on men because muh patriarchy ,1,MensRights

ShiningConcepts,come on you know that you cannot compare cancer cells which have no capacity to becoming a human being to a fetus whose whole purpose revolves around it capacity to become a human being fetus do have rights literally every human being in the world started out as a fetus there should be rights and value to these crucial beings ,8,changemyview

ShiningConcepts,this would only follow if transfer to this artificial womb was unambiguously less hazardous and painful than an abortion but since this is a hypothetical device we cannot know for sure also the fetus does have rights the fetus right to life is trumped by mother right to bodily autonomy but it right to life absolutely trumps the mother right to control her own fertility ,7,changemyview

ShiningConcepts,i actually do kind of agree with the idea that a fetus and a newborn are not very separable as a pro choicer i am really not a fan of the whole it not a life argument used to justify abortions because the question of when life begins is way too ambiguous and subjective for it to be a solid position the much more solid and better argument is that the fetus does not have the right to use it mother body without her permission even if the fetus is considered a life she has the right to bodily autonomy the argument you give does not have this distinction the newborn is no longer a parasite to the mother body and killing it is now morally indefensible ,2,changemyview

ShiningConcepts,i just saw a gameplay video of sky and honestly the gameplay looks a little unappealing what prompted me to make this post was how intriguing the combat system looked in the videos i watched for steel i will give some more looks into sky and then decide also other than presumably better performance and graphics do we know if there will be any added features to the pc version of steel ,4,Falcom
ShiningConcepts,i have known about cold steel for a while heard the name it was me checking out some gameplay videos of the combat system which looked dynamic what i love that peaked my interest and prompted me to write this i then watched a gameplay video of trails in the sky and to be honest it does look kind of dated for me ,4,Falcom
ShiningConcepts, you cannot just assume the pedophile next door is a abstinent virtuous goody two shoes because that is something you cannot possibly know regarding your defense there is a rather intriguing bit of irony our current culture of forcibly stigmatizing and ostracizing pedophiles is exactly why you do not know giving pedophiles every reason in the world not to seek help and keep it to themselves is a massive stain on your capacity for threat assessment you may be good and virtuous but they do not know that forget about not knowing if they are good and virtuous you do not even know if they are one in the first place ,2,changemyview

ShiningConcepts, by this logic do people become violent if they cannot get their cs go fix but people can get their csgo fix they are not being artifically blocked from it so idk what you are point is anyway here is my reasoning and no an event condemned by the japanese today that was done decades ago is not relevant to this argument i mean the us has done far worse things against blacks and natives japan has more hentai more lolicon and waited a long time before illegalizing cp so under your brand of reasoning japan should be the sweden of the east and be a danger zone for children but it has way less violent crime including rape than our morally puritarian murica rape porn has become more available with the presence of the internet as has porn in general under your brand of reasoning america not sweden should be the rape capital of the west but violent crime and rape has been declining since 1990 do fictional outlets lead to more crime because they enlarge those urges i do not know for sure do they inhibit crime by inhibiting the urges i do not know for sure but i believe there is enough reason to warrant the trial run besides guess what this is a free country if you want to use a masturbatory aid in private that your own fucking business it not my place and it certainly not your place to tell one consenting adult what they do in the privacy of their own home by themselves using a fictional outlet ,1,changemyview

ShiningConcepts,violent video games and thanks to the internet pornography have soared in usage availability since 1990 but violent crime in the us has steadily declined since then japan has legalized lolicon lolitas and hentais and up until 2014 real child porn was legal there but the crime rate difference is like night and day anyway is there any research which confirms that people who use these outlets will go on to commit crimes ,2,changemyview
ShiningConcepts, the thing about rape porn is that the porn itself contains agents that are able to give consent and video games are not real though there is a slight problem that i will outline just to be clear i am supporting fictional child porn here not live action ones but the issue is if it not there there is no outlet these people have no outlet to let out their urges so with no outlet to peacefully let out their urges they are forced to either contend with unresolved urges for their whole life or actually go out and rape kids fantasy for pedophiles and fictional outlets for them should be legal it not anyone place to tell them what they can or cannot do in their privacy of their own home using something that no children were harmed in creating ,5,changemyview

ShiningConcepts,thanks to the stigmatization these people have no outlets even fictional non live action ones for their urges and they are enormously discouraged from seeking help we should stigmatize them but they should be given help in private ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,i fully agree with this view next to 100 and i am ready to reply to the other commenters in this thread a while back i had a cmv similar to this topic that no one changed my view on i fully sympathize with the virtuous pedophile community online i fully believe and understand that pedophilia is not a choice and that our current treatment of pedophiles in our culture where we do not let them have any outlets and give them every reason in the world not to seek help is a problem we need to do what germany apparently is doing and let them seek help but that said while i do believe more needs to be done to help these people and acknowledge that they exist rather than simply pretend that they do not society stigmatization of them does have some legitimate reasons a pedophile may be no more morally complicit in their sexual orientation than a homosexual but the analogy is not perfect it is possible for homosexuals to manifest their urges with a consenting gay partner however it is not possible for a pedophile to do the same without breaking the law that why society tries to avoid normalizing and encouraging pedophilia in public social circles because it not possible for their desires to manifest in the world ,1,changemyview

ShiningConcepts, and will serve no good purpose in a real world application it will keep our taxes low which is a common anti lps argument if keeping taxes low is not a good purpose then why are you against lps while doing nothing to change the circumstances for those men who would like to be able to surrender those rights even when the mother chooses not to but if you are already anti lps then that does not matter to you,0,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,well if you are a poor father it is better for the welfare state to pay for your kid than it is for your broke ass to pay meager child support foster homes suck and are overburdened having multiple overburdened parents in a group home does not work when the adoption is finalized and the child does have actual parents point 1 is moot because as i said parental child support is waived at that time the government treatment of children is garbage look at all the shitty schools in poor neighborhoods ie in detroit and the terrible water child poverty that current social programs suck at fixing until all of those are fixed i am not buying any of this the state is interested in the best interest of the child bullshit ,0,changemyview
ShiningConcepts, because in the end it is better for everyone involved if the people responsible pay for the child they made themselves are taxpayers counted under everyone are taxpayers responsible for making the child also the state is not paying for it we are when both parents remove themselves they are both violating the child right to support from both parents how is that worse than just one doing it ,2,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,i suppose this is something we both simply disagree on and yes i do think you are a sexist by effect not intention because you are defending a system that offers far more lenience to mothers than fathers and therefore are expressing more of a will to subsidize their mistakes through these social programs than fathers through lps mothers are the people most capable to put their kid up for adoption or a safe haven without the father knowledge consent especially if they are estranged or casual sex fathers are the least capable the system you are advocating is sexist in effect and you can tell me that you are not being sexist by intention and with regards to that i would agree but there a big can of worms that opens up for permitting other policies actions for instance the pro life stance is not sexist by intention it just there for the kid but it is definitely sexist by effect ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts, but i have no issues with it it part of the deal it does not bother me in the slightest then why are you against lps and first of all i support moves that in general reduce unwanted pregnancies sex ed bc etc those are much more essential to fighting all of the issues this post encompasses adoptions abortions unwanted child support dumpster babies etc than what i propose so i am not advocating for it in a vacuum the parents made that child and i am being forced to pay for their bad mistake so then why are you against lps this position is untenable without moving the goalpost if you believe that it not my place for me to decide if i should subsidize the bad decisions 2 parents make than you cannot legitimately say that it is your place to decide if you should subsidize the bad decision a single parent makes with lps ,0,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,it does not subvert the hierarchy it keeps the responsibility where it belongs child support from either parent but it is overwhelmingly men keeps the responsibility where it belongs ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,what i want to happen is that the mother and if available the father has to pay child support to the government if they give up their kid if you do not want to pay child support do not have a kid this is what to said to fathers and what will be said to mothers people are responsible for their children not the rest of society ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,hombre you yourself said why should i have to pay for the military why should i have to pay for the roads in some part of the state i do not use because as a society we all pay taxes to shit we do not want that one of the consequences to living in society you are arguing against yourself okay they are both responsible why should adoption centers absolve them of that responsibility ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,define humourous purposes ,2,changemyview
ShiningConcepts, how much of my taxes go to paying the military or congress or any number of things i may not agree with that part of being in society this is another can of worms argument what if i do not agree with these social programs can i expect a refund on them what if we live in a world where lps is legal can people like you who are opposed to lps demand a refund for it they both made that decision together it was not a one person decision to initiate sex of course both parents should be held responsible but the other parent financial situation has no bearing on your own responsibility ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,and if a man performs an lps then he is paying for that child welfare bills through taxes ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts, fathers killing their children to avoid child support does not change my view respectfully mothers who are holding their babies over a dumpster threatening to kill them if they cannot get a legal maternal surrender do not change mine i am determined to hold women and men accountable for the children they bring into this world you are not that sexism child support is no different than taxes uh no there quite an important difference you cannot be punished for choosing not to work and thereby not paying taxes but you can be punished for choosing not to work and not paying child support also the overwhelming majority of people who put their kids up for adoption are mothers i cannot find any statistics on this but it seems that many of the sites are geared towards women so they can just dump their kids at a safe haven and get on with their lives in your world but men cannot that sexism ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,then where do we disagree if you are a poor father then you for as long as you are poor should pay minimal cs and if you are a poor mother or parent who put their kid up for adoption safe haven then you for as long as you are poor should pay cs relative to what you can afford ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,on top of what the other commenter said firstly it not a human life if it being aborted right anyway it is absolutely true that 2 parent households are the best for kids and it would be commonplace in a functional culture but y know murica however the parents are not always financially capable of supporting a child in any capacity so what if the father is not capable of supporting the child in any capacity should he be forced to pay for it against his will also with regards to what i said in this reply https www reddit com r changemyview comments 6f24uv cmv if you oppose legal parental surrender dieunzg context 3 there are cases of fathers killing their kids to avoid child support ,0,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,what about lps as i said in my previous reply we would have an increase in child deaths for what amounts to a rounding error in the us budget plus while it may be a tiny rounding error in the us budget how big is it in terms of your own taxes i think if both parents agree and neither wants the child it is better for the state to take financial custody of the child why should i be forced to pay for the shitty decisions made by 2 parents or if one of the parents wants the child then the other parent should pay why should the other parent be forced to pay for the decision made by the other parent ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,same deal should apply to parents paying cs to the government,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,so should poor fathers be able to opt out of child support then ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,in my previous reply i serious meant to say legal parental surrender by all means if lps comes pipe dream then a mother who wants to surrender her child to the father should be able to do that as well either they have zero support from their father because he is unemployed or zero support because he abandons them it the same i am not 100 sure what you are objecting to here can you elaborate i mean if the child abandons them and puts them at a safe haven then the welfare state would pay for it so ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,this position is not exclusively with regards to aborted babies it is with regards to children who are born once the child is born the fact that it could have been aborted does not matter it now exists and someone needs to support it can you elaborate on your position with regards to this confusion i have ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,1 then why are you against lps the welfare state would give that child financial support 2 this point feels like it specifically adapted to argue against this position it does not stand well on it own and it moves the goalpost with regards to the typical anti lps argument these points contradict the other parent being unable to contribute is not relevant to your own responsibility for bearing the child ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,because you believe assuming that you support these programs in their current form that the rights of parents to financial freedom trump the child rights to financial support from both parents and you assuming you are against lps believe that the rights of a child to financial support from both parents trump the parent rights to financial freedom ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,1 america foster homes are not in the best shape right now http www childrensrights org newsroom fact sheets foster care plus all those fundings are paid for through tax dollars so why are you against father cs being substituted with tax dollars 2 yes and fathers who do an lps would also already pay for those agencies through taxation 3 i am pro choice as well and i honestly am not too interested in the abortion rate plus women already choose to have abortions to avoid financial difficulty ,2,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,and these same lenient conditions should be applied to fathers if the father has literally no way of supporting a child at all he should not support if he has zero income he should not support but they can mandate that you go find a job to pay for it from this scenario legal paternal surrender is a step up and better for the child and forcing fathers to still pay is impossible and unnecessary ,3,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,i am talking about existent social programs where neither parent is involved i am not talking about hypothetical ones where one parent is,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,google father kills child child support and there are a handful of cases of that happening to ie this https angelzfury wordpress com 2011 02 28 175 killer dads fathers who ended their childrens lives in situations involving child custody visitation andor child support usa also the fact that some parents would kill their child is not reason to allow others to abandon them freely what so the rewards father get for not killing their babies more is having to pay cs the rights of a child to financial support from both parents trumps either right to financial freedom do you agree with this right or not neither parent can opt out unilaterally from what i can find a parent can do it if they cannot present the other one it seems to vary from state to state but the mother cannot foist the kid off on the father and say see ya and not have to pay cs the same way it does not work in reverse true and the father cannot do the same so neither should be able to foist it off on the state and say see ya and not have to pay cs ,2,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,zero birth parents in current family law the courts afaik cannot force you to be a parent they cannot force you to love the child and have visitation but they do require that you at least chip in financially same deal here the child has a right to financial solvency and support from both parents even if it cannot be given visitation it should have financial support from them plus it would bring your guys taxes down which is another reason people oppose lps,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,yes neither parent can surrender but from what i can find the laws do not seem too easy to find online you do not need to provide paternal consent to put your kid up for adoption if you cannot find present him that tangential though even f they both decide to give it to the state then they both should be paying cs until its adoption is finalized because the child has the right to financial support from both parents why are you guys so adamant about this right when a man wants to opt out which would leave the kid with one parent but are so dismissive of it when both parents want to opt out leaving the kid with zero parents which hint hint is worse than one ,0,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,the mother has control over the child during it initial birth she has more breathing room plus it can often require consent from both parents to put it up for adoption that aside you are demonstrating the very hypocrisy i was criticizing the right of either parent to drop their kid at a safe haven and abandon financial responsibility overrides the rights of the child to support from both parents remind me again why are you against lps you clearly do not care a damn about the rights of the child and are so concerned with the rights of the parents to financial freedom ,-1,changemyview

ShiningConcepts,i understand where this comes from i was trying to inquire about how you can differentiate between non consensual sex where an abortion would be viewed as justified and consensual sex where it would not be what should the burden of proof be for a woman to prove she fell into the former category ,1,prolife
ShiningConcepts,yeah i have always wondered about that how does the hyde amendment work in that respect i mean if a woman is raped and then is cleansed or something by her rapist removing dna evidence and there no eyewitness or video or forensic evidence and she goes there asserting she was raped how can you distinguish between her and a woman who changed her mind after having consensual sex ,3,prolife
ShiningConcepts,this is a very honest reply and i can appreciate that because there no easy answer here honestly as i am sure you understand the initial burden of proof is a joke all you need to do is sign a document do not even need a sympathetic male friend to pretend saying you were raped and that it later on if the burden of proof goes up well a big problem with rape and the justice system is that rape often boils down to he said she said ,3,prolife
ShiningConcepts,i would not agree i mean he is clarifying that the premise of my question support for rape exceptions which i explicitly stated myself to believe to be a popular opinion incorrectly is faulty ,1,prolife
ShiningConcepts,that sounds reasonable it would explain why many of the posters here do not support exceptions ,6,prolife
ShiningConcepts,well i learned something today even though it is disingenious i can understand saying it if your goal is to try to maintain a dialogue i would probably extend it to women who obtained positive rape kits or they had a rapist found guilty in a court of law 1 rape kits cannot distinguish between consensual and non consensual sex 2 guilty verdict within 9 months unlikely,5,prolife
ShiningConcepts, but what about cases where a woman is not in good health to carry an anencephaly ridden baby to term ,7,prolife
ShiningConcepts,was anyone else expecting a trump joke ,-2,aww

ShiningConcepts,i honestly do not hate them at all they were born that way or made that way through child abuse insofar as they do not commit crimes i honestly do not hate them at all yet this is a controversial topic it seems so do you hate them why or why not what is your stance on them specifically the ones who are not criminals ,1,AskReddit
ShiningConcepts, but people still seem to stay just as outraged about it as ever people should be getting more outraged at him but the anti trump media honestly feels boilerplate it become a pattern no matter how many times trump does a scandal no political action occurs ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,because i believed before giving deltas that given trump tweet on covfefe as well as how he knew this would give him courage he was trying to sensationalize it deliberately,2,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,what i said in my op that i could not feasibly see how this could be a mistake the deltas i awarded since then have postulated reasonable positions my view regarding the empirical effects of this are as yet unchanged though,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,i still hold that the effects of this being up to stupidity normalization desensitization are the same as the ones i proposed of this being up to a plot but you did provide a feasible reason this could not be left up to stupidity and that does change my view delta,2,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,this is the stupidest one i think it is a special example,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,if he an evil genius mastermind then he would pretend to be making stupid mistakes for the aforementioned reasons,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,well that difficult to argue with this does change my view but i still assert that the effects of it being a ploy are the same in other words whether or not this was calculated or unintentional i still believe the effects i mentioned will occur but you did convince me of a feasible alternative still liberals and others should avoid allowing this to be normalized delta,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,if it helps to clarify i am not saying i know for a fact it a mistake i am saying i believe it is more likely than not given the evidence i provided you do not need to convince me it was a mistake you can just convince me that it was more likely than not a mistake ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,of course kathy definitely made a poor decision it just bullshit that she gets the brunt of the world thrown on her while cheeto illiteracy gets to be potus ,9,EnoughTrumpSpam
ShiningConcepts,that part of this argument i like and can get behind put into perspective that makes sense delta but i still believe that with regards to the other side of the polarization the liberals what i said was true but you did convince me that when it comes to trump supporters and own party these petty tweets are not as meaningful as i thought still libs should be wary of what i said in my post body ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,i strongly support prison reform and believe that prisons need to be humane and that violence and rape within prisons needs to be abolished i absolutely cannot stand the thought of the state deliberately harming or allowing to harm any prisoner no matter how evil but you are just going to encourage crimes if you make them luxurious prisons should be humane but they should never be so luxurious that a lifetime in them becomes appealing that is what luxury means also if as you acknowledged prisons are intended to be a deterrent to others and are failing at being a deterrent in our current system then why do you believe they would suceed in being a deterring in an alternative system ,3,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,i am not saying this goes so far that people outright forget trump real scandals but it competes with them in terms of economy and undermines them and honestly if the best trump can do to control the news cycle at this point is make it look like he a senile old man who does not know how the internet works then what is the real difference he not exactly scoring political points he is not i do not believe trump is trying to score political points by doing this he simply trying to mitigate the damage caused by his real scandals by substituting that damage with damage caused by these petty ones stunts like this would only further the narrative that he an idiot not somehow desensitize us to it but by furthering the narrative that he is an idiot it just strengthens that perception of him and people have inherently lower standards for and less surprise when seeing poor choices made by stupid people there was another john oliver quote which i believe he said in his rnc video paraphrasing trump has said countless awful things any of which would disqualify any other candidate for president he is like the bed of nails principle if you stand on one nail it hurts you but if you step on a thousand nails so single one stands out and you are fine that is how this all works that is how donald trump has been able to get away with all the crazy things he said and done it just a part of his character and it what we have come to expect ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,stupidity is not one scale it comes in many forms some forms of stupidity like this one are a result of low literacy and poor self control assuming this was just a stupid tweet some forms of stupidity like cc denial are born of ignorance and indoctrination look at most of the republican party the climate change deniers religious zealots and pro lifers in there are stupid yet they absolutely can be literate the stupidity that comes from limited literacy is not the same as the stupidity that comes from climate change denial,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,then why did he continue to make a big deal out of it when he posted and has not removed a tweet satirizing his own stupidity ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,guys end the user profile thing,638,announcements
ShiningConcepts,ok,1,pussypassdenied
ShiningConcepts,1 as i explained in the body of my post trump has incentive to make a mockery of himself 2 trump chose to put out a tweet where he mocked himself that really the key evidence for me here if he did not post that tweet and simply deleted covfefe i could probably agree with you but it pretty hard for me to take that position when he trolled twitter and the country by saying what is the meaning of this unreal word i created enjoy ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,the issue with this explanation is why did he then mock his own tweet and sensationalize it on twitter if he did not this comment would probably get a delta assuming i would still have posted this but the fact that he continued to make a party out of it goes against that idea to me ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,yeah it longer worse and still up but on top of not being potus or even a candidate at that time trump anti climate change position actually is a political position that some people mostly in his own party support unlike this latest tweet which is not anything at all ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,true but i am far more willing to believe that trump or someone in his inner circle organized this as a ploy then i am willing to believe that trump legitimately could not complete a sentence also if this was an incidence of stupidity then why did he post up a satirical mocking of his own tweet it strange that he would delete his tweet which implies regret and than satirically make a mockery of himself afterwards ,2,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,if trump makes himself look like a buffoon by posting inexplicably stupid shit like this then there are two effects 1 the media especially the liberal media focuses on these idiotic scandals that not only gives trump roadblock coverage so he continues to dominate the news cycle but it also distracts people from his real scandals every minute of airtime or megabyte of bandwith a media group gives to covering this idiocy of trump is one less of minute or megabyte that can be used to cover trump actually meaningful scandals also john oliver did a good video after trump criticism of sweden https www youtube com watch v qs3tgiy9jqu where he explained how trump stupid remark not only made some stories get less coverage but also allowed him to control the news cycle fairly similar deal here 2 it feeds into the normalization of donald trump as an idiot if people believe that trump is an idiot on top of being a shitty potus then this desensitizes people to his bad decisions and irresponsible rhetoric ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,i believe that trump is insane but i do not believe that he is so insane that he could make a mistake this monumental of a scale i cannot chalk writing a 0 sensical tweet that was then left up for 6 hours up to idiocy i believe that he does have the intelligence to know that he can game his own stupidity ,0,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,i believe that when you do jump on the lighthearted and petty stuff you further normalize people mentality regarding how he is selling their grandchildren futures you turn trump from a corporate mastermind selling off our children futures to a guy who thinks it funny to post nonsensical garbage on twitter honestly those tweets are just examples of my point they have comedized this incident into a meme opportunity that might be good for getting followers and likes but it a distraction whose most ardent followers see him doing post thanksgiving dinner embarrassments like this and then pretend he some super jedi i honestly do not have a problem with the trumpets looking past these kinds of embarrassing things i do have a problem with them looking past his actual scandals that is far more reason to have fear for the future ,3,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,another difference is that arvo did not shoot you get away with it and then ruin your life and was never resolved by the devs,1,TheWalkingDeadGame
ShiningConcepts,i 100 agree that this is hardly representative of the left as a whole but the idea that it is a one off and the left is entirely divided by it the top tweets to her apology https twitter com kathygriffin status 869703678550171648 do not give off that vibe ,6,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,yes neither does a man man opts out of his responsibilities too fucking bad i am not subsidizing your mistakes parent opts out of their responsibilities by putting their kid up for adoption often woman oh poor woman i will gladly subsidize your mistakes how is one crucial component far more important than another crucial component so you are telling me that having sex is literally just as important in the creation of a child than the 9 months required to carry it in the womb you do know that babies do not pop out 1 day after sex right and that conception is not enough to create a human child,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,what i meant to say was that the woman has no child support owed to the government if she puts her kid at an adoption agency without the man there can be no child at all so no he certainly is not 0 responsible but without the woman far more important 9 months of choosing not to abort and providing it her nutrients it also would not exist what should grandparents be forced to pay child support there could not have been no grandchild without them,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,i am not solely talking about the initiation of the pregnancy that not the only thing that a child requires to exist the child also needs 9 months of being taken care of in the womb and it needs 9 months of a certain person choosing not to have an abortion and then it needs well quite a few years for a certain person to not drop it off at a safe haven or adoption agency the initiation of a pregnancy is not the only thing a child needs to exist the following 9 months are far more important and fun fact a certain person is the only one with a choice in how those 9 months go that certain person is not the man ,1,changemyview

ShiningConcepts,never happened to me but i would be completely fine with it if he up and left me i would do the same if i was defrauded like this ,3,AskMen
ShiningConcepts,username does not check out,9,AskMen
ShiningConcepts,perhaps i was being unclear what i meant to say was that if we are going to keep this current system as is and dismiss the paper abortion idea then that should be the case if you want paper abortions to be banned then you should mandate that any form of parental surrender not just hypothetical paternal ones should be banned and similarly if adoption is not banned then paternal surrender should not be banned i did not say that men should cold turkey never have to give cs i do believe the amount should be reduced and the laws should become far less burdensome what i am saying here is that on top of that if a woman ever puts her kid up for adoption the state should mandate she pay child support i will accept mothers being able to put up kids for adoption or at safe havens with no child support mandatory only if men can cold turkey abandon their kids you are aware that giving a child up for adoption is extremely common for mothers that cannot financially support a baby correct ex fucking actly i am absolutely aware that is the root of my criticisms a woman who cannot financially support her child has the right to opt out of her financial responsibilities the man can do the same there are two ways this system can work either one is fine by me the issue here is that you confused my advocation for view 2 in the context of our current system with my advocation of view 1 in the context of an alternative system 1 either parent can opt out of their financial responsibilities the woman has adoption agencies as you acknowledged just now and the father has no enforced child support 2 neither parent can opt out the man must pay cs and if the woman puts it up for adoption she must pay cs to the agency either option is legitimate in my view even though i prefer 1 over 2 but 2 at least works i was not using view 2 to dismiss my advocation of view 1 so which option do you prefer i am guessing you prefer option 3 where only the woman mistakes can be covered by taxpayers but the man mistakes cannot because of how we live in a patriarchy that oppresses women ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,yes you should care for your own spawn but you should not be treated as 50 responsible because you are not you did not have the choice to or to not abort you did not have the responsibility to care for the child within you for 9 months you are 100 right the biological reality is different there is no symmetry in reproductive rights ergo there should be no symmetry in reproductive responsibility that the real truth ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,she 100 had the choice to abort he had 0 the choice to abort the decision to or to not abort a child and the responsibility of taking care of it in your own body and choosing not to get an abortion during those 9 months is far far more important to the creation of a child than the initial sex if the woman had 100 control responsibility during those 9 months which are the most important and the man had 50 during the initial sex which is less important than 50 50 responsibility does not work also imagine if we lived in a world where abortions were outlawed and anytime this was criticized they would simply say she 100 had the choice to pop a pill ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts, the purpose of child support is not for fairness for the parents it for the needs of the child as a pro lifer would say again i am not a pro lifer but this is what one would say using your logic the purpose of pro life laws is not to punish the mother it for the needs of the child also rights cannot exist at the cost of another why does the child right to financial solvency trump the father your rights exist where another begin another pro choice argument exposed as hypocritical cool but if the mother cannot financially provide for her child because she does not have another source of income besides child support and the child suffers from neglect then she gets put into jail for child abuse both parties have the same responsibility the right to bodily autonomy trumps the right to life this is what the pro choice argument is therefore the right to bodily autonomy trumps the right to financial solvency what you think that it is worse to financially deprive a child than it is to kill it what is your point orphanages and foster homes do not receive child support payments they should if you walk out on your kids and put them in an orphan or foster home you should be on the hook for child support this way no man or woman is ever off the hook for the financial responsibilities of their kids that also removes a lot of the burden from the welfare state ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,really so you do not believe the woman has more power she has the power to say i will financially cripple you and i will kill your child whether you want it or not also just to be clear i do not support cold turkey abandonment just a huge reduction in child support amounts enforcement and penalties anyway the father is not saying abort it or i will financially abandon you a much better phrasing is if you choose to carry to term it mostly your responsibility unequal choice unequal responsibility ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,if you were making over 15 then that was coming through tips you were not being disproportionately paid you were being disproportionately tipped ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,perhaps i am not being clear i have not been advocating pro life i am a pro choicer myself what i am saying is that your opposition to legal paternal surrender logically permits pro life i am not saying i believe this i am saying if you disagree with me than you are permitting this what i was saying is that if hypothetically we lived in a world where abortions cannot be acquired than it would be the onus of the woman to know that you are telling me it is the onus of the man to know cs risks so what i am asking you is if we similarly lived in a world without abortions which i am not advocating then what opposition do you have to women seeking abortions since they also knew the risks common sense decides that the child does not need 1000s of dollars for a simple example look at the quality of orphanges but yes those are extreme cases in 2010 the average amount of child support paid per month was 430 how do you know that acquiring 430 a month is less work than childrearing serious question have you ever worked and if you do not pay that child support namely if you choose not to work or deliberately take a lower paying job choosing what do do with your body then you are thrown in jail bodily autonomy violation and nothing you can do about the lifestyle decline you get from that and yeah if a man is making enough money that several thousand dollars a month is a reasonable deduction from his paycheque then yeah i think that less work than the entire process of raising a child no it is not if it were then why are not people who work in orphanages and foster homes millionaires and no man should ever lose several thousand dollars a month to the child against his will at that point the woman is living off of it ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,the initial sex is a 50 50 deal but the 9 months that follow is 100 0 deal the existence of the child is far more her responsibility than his you do not only need the initial sex to make a child you also need those 9 months you also need that body and you need to make the choice not to get an abortion in those 9 months who provides the body the woman who has the power to or to not get an abortion if the answer was the man and the woman equally or if the answer was neither as is the case in a pro life world than yes it would be a 50 50 deal but if the answer as it is now in much of the us is the woman and only the woman than the existence of the child as a whole is not a 50 50 deal this is basic elementary school level mathematics ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,imagine if we live in a world where abortion is pretty much banned given the current administration that world may not be as imaginary as we like to think in such a world someone says you wo not let someone knock you up without choosing to take that risk of never being allowed an abortion at some point the choice must have consequences for women it at the point where abortions are outlawed when the women conceives for men it when the women conceives what matters is that there is a choice you perform the act of having sex knowing the potential consequences and that abortion is outlawed it not someone else job to take care of your bad decision if you get knocked up do not want the child and are forced to keep it then you are on the hook and that awesome ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,i was pointing out the hypocrisy in your stance i was not saying i support that hypothetical world where abortions are banned i was saying that if we live in a world where as you said men do know the risks of birth control than that world logically follows what are you saying here are you saying that men do know the risks of sex in which case what is your opposition to the hypothetical pro life world or are you saying that men do not know the risks of sex in which case you can reasonably be pro choice but you should also be pro lps i believe in the latter i was pointing out that your disagreement with the latter logically permits the former i did not say it was easy or pleasant or made on a whim i was saying that if we lived in a world where everyone can be assumed to know the consequences of sex then the non permission of abortions would be that consequence yes because again child support amounts are made based on the father income i can assure you that derek fisher and charlie sheen had plenty of money left over after supporting their child that backdoor alimony the child does not need that much money to be taken from the father even if the man is paying too much in child support the woman still has to dedicate far more time and energy towards the actual process of raising a child for at least eighteen years why are you neglecting to address that point because you blanketly assume that all childrearing is more sacrifical than all child support which especially in the celebrity cases i mentioned is obviously not the point pulling in 6 9 figures and making enough to keep up with those payments is way more sacrifical then any childrearing sometimes the child support is harder sometimes the childrearing is in your view a man who is paying several thousand a month in child support is doing far less work than a stay at home mom no wonder we disagree on this ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,the existence of the child in general is her responsibility plus since she has the ability to keep the father away from the child if they are not together and she lies or has a secret than she has more of an ability to do those things when the child is young ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,even if they are willing to overlook those scandals sexual assaults xenophobia etc it still reasonable to dislike them because trump has failed on his promises there are so many disastrous things trump has done in office especially in the past two weeks ie leaking national secrets to russia if you are a trump supporter not necessarily a trump voter or a person who still holds he better than hillary than you are overlooking those massive scandals he suffered so in such a case there is reason to be intolerant of you because you support a man whose done all kinds of shit and has failed to deliver on his promises so far ,13,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,because only she had the reproductive rights only she had the right to abort or not abort yes it is not solely the woman mistake the initial sex is a 50 50 deal but the 9 following months are a 100 0 deal in a region that is pro choice and has practically accessible abortion clinics women are far more responsible than men for these situations ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts, yep sorry but there no excuse for ignorance when the facts are so easily available this is exactly what i was talking about in my pro life point they want to abolish abortions because there is no excuse for not knowing the risk firstly there are egregious cases of celebrities paying huge amounts of money for child support derek fisher charlie sheen etc hell will be replete with snowballs before you convince me that those amount to less than 50 of the child secondly you are right it is not quite clear how responsibility is divided it depends on the lifestyle of both parents sometimes the man has more responsibility in cases where the cs is too high and sometimes the woman has more if it too low or if he a deadbeat it never always more a burden on the mom than on the dad besides child support amounts are decided based on the father income they are designed to be manageable if a man chooses not to work then he will be thrown in jail bodily autonomy violation the courts are broken and overworked there very limited way to appeal those payments and if your income drops or if you choose to work less your bodily autonomy you can end up punished the courts are bullshit ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,it fucking does have to do with those things becuase you are saying through them that you will permit paying the cost of women bad mistakes but saying through your opposition to paternal abdication that that you wo not pay the cost of men bad mistakes unless you believe that misandry is no big deal which would not surprise me at this rate then it does have to do with the aforementioned this is about what is best for the kid so orphans and safe havens which hint hint deprive a child of parentage the thing you adamantly criticize are best for the kid ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,no there is not you did not choose it sexual attraction towards children just like a rape fetish has absolutely no immorality associated with it revulsion is natural but describing it as ethically wrong is wrong ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,with all due respect rule 1 i mean are not you conceding that he right by pointing out logically invalid reasons why this occurs ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,so birth control is not perfect and there no excuse other than unexusable ignorance for not knowing this again in the hypothetical penceland that is a reason why abortions are not allowed imagine mike pence saying the following hey it the girl fault if she chooses to be ignorant there are literally warning labels on condom wrappers and birth control tablets lol they explicitly say that when used properly they are intended to prevent pregnancy though they cannot eliminate the risk ignorance is never an excuse if you did not want to have an abortion you should not have had sex period and for that last part first of all women have safe havens adoption centers orphanages etc so none of the parental consequences are imposed like child support is and his parenthood is reduced to some every other weekend bullshit and a child support bill the way you wrote he writes a cheque implying that it no big deal what you think it easy to make enough to support a child if you believe that then you are detached from reality ,0,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,those responsibilities are not 50 50 okay if financial support overtakes agency in creation then i do not see why you are opposed to the welfare state paying for these kids oh that right because your moral goal is super easy to enforce when you do not have to pay for it but when you have to pay for it boo hoo and now you are just giving up eh cannot blame you that only inevitable when you put forth an untenable position ,0,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,how do you know that all men always know the risks are you telling me you believe that sex ed is perfect if you do then i do not understand why you can be pro choice the fact that you automatically dismiss all men as knowing the risks tells me enough things about your perception as men hombre and they support not killing a child not necessarily financial well being plus pence said in the debates that he is pro adoption on the basis of being pro life the man did choose to have sex with her and he knew his risks not his body not his decision exactly not his body not his decision and not his responsibility ladies your body your choice your responsibility you want reproductive rights then you should have reproductive responsibility ,0,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,they promote abstinence only education and that aside the point you said earlier that if men do not want to be baby trapped they should not have kids so then why exactly do you oppose telling women in a hypothetical penceland where abortions are illegal if you do not want to have an abortion do not have kids i believe in equal moral agency and egalitarianism of the sexes and yet i am arguing against feminists how did we get here ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,1 just to be clear i actually do not agree with the op the father is responsible for the child just way less than 50 i believe the system should be reformed in many ways and made far less onerous i do not support a cold turkey abandonment outright 2 fly i take it you despise and are eager to abolish all safe havens all orphanages that are funded by the state and all adoption agencies right i mean those are infringing on the rights of children oh that right those things subsidize the bad choices made by women so they can never be bad but subsidizing bad choices made by men is bad sigh 3 the math you put forth asserted that the father is 50 responsible for the child despite the fact that you presumably believe the mother should have 100 reproductive rights the only way you can believe this to be true is if you cannot understand that 0 50 and 100 are not the same numbers alternative mathematics cannot say i expected better from family court apologism your body your choice your responsibility ,0,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,you did not answer my question you were criticizing a system where you had to pay for the irresponsibile decisions made by the father so i then ask you are you against systems in place right now where you have to pay for irresponsible decisions made by the mother you through safe haven orphans and adoption laws oh poor poor woman i will gladly pay for the child you are responsible for you through opposing paper abortion fuck the father he is responsible for the child,0,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,what i am saying is that if the woman has 100 reproductive rights than any child born is way more than 50 her responsibility i am not saying and do not believe that the man is 0 responsible but if only she had the reproductive rights then it is fucking absurd to assert that she only had 50 responsibility for the kids if only these people were capable of not being absurd ,0,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,it should be way larger than 50 her responsibility your body your choice your responsibility ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,it not in the 50 50 ballpark if the mother has 100 reproductive responsibility and the father has 0 and is only responsible for the pre pregnancy stage than he is nowhere near 50 responsible for the child no fucking wonder this country sucks at math in schools because our legal system cannot differentiate 0 50 and 100 from each other,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,so i take it you revile safe haven state orphans and adoption laws right oh of course not you are so eager to subsidize the irresponsible choices made by women but boo hoo fuck the father he can pay for his own choices ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,the man is not 50 or responsible for the child support he not 0 but if he has 0 reproductive rights he should have way less reproductive responsibility ladies your body your choice your responsibility,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,that what pro lifers say to women if you do not want an abortion do not have sex plus you had agency in creating the dependent child the kidney donation analogy missed the mark,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,pro life laws are not intended to punish the mother they are intended to help the child and give it it best possible future the woman also knew that bc is not 100 effective the man had no choice in abortion but has 50 responsibility for it feminist logic funny by advocating true gender equality it appears that i am the true feminist here,-1,changemyview

ShiningConcepts,slavery and rich people are even worse examples because those people unlike men in the case of abortion have an obvious vested interest in the particular way the law goes and i am most certainly not saying that men are not a part of this conversation not at all i am just saying that given who this issue is affecting men are only indirectly affected there should be women involved in this discussion ,2,changemyview

ShiningConcepts,first off for the record since i found it intriguing and gave it a watch here a clip of the fictional character thing https www youtube com watch v w8i065wznms ahh what a different political time it was back then anyway while i do not agree with and will probably never be able to agreeably understand the things they value i can understand that this makes sense from their pov my op was about the absurdity of this even from their own pov and not to convince me that it is right in my own but if you consider how they oppose bc in and of itself i suppose i can understand this delta,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,this does help complete the point i do not agree with their reasoning as an atheist but this post was not about me agreeing it was about me being unable to see the logic in this from their own pov and this does help me see it however much i may disagree with it delta,2,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,those things are much more expensive and they do not prevent the thing they dislike it is because of how they are against abortions that i call out their bc opposition in particular recent comments cmv on this topic ,2,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,it is that was just one example there are a whole ton of other ridiculous things in the bible that i believe exemplify questionable intelligence on behalf of christians anyway what i was asserting recent deltas changed my view on this is that logically these positions do not make sense and that they are being meagerly argued from an emotional standpoint ,2,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,thank you this was well worded and written i believe that seeing things from different perspectives and holding things on different scales of importance is the fundamental reason why people disagree on so many topics including me and the republicans on this one even though i disagree with this logic you have put forth i do not believe it is so absurd that i consider it untenable it is more nuanced than what i put forth in my op and you have changed my view here delta,7,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,for the first one i guess we are playing semantics i was using the word infamous to refer to how pp is viewed by the majority of people which is negatively what the fuck does being white have to do with anything gah sorry i regret putting that in here i was thinking of some video that described the legislators as a group of old white men and that why i typed in white when i made that description my bad i rescind the white part that was subconscious and a mistake anyway that aside the gender you are is relevant only women can possibly be affected directly by these laws how would you feel if a group of uncircumcised men or a group of women were the only people doing circumcision regulations while i do disagree with that part the rest of your view is sound i suppose if you are anti abortions then being anti bc even though bc is great at reducing abortions is not necessarily key i mean i question the reasons they oppose bc and i think they are ridiculous but if you are a person who is already opposed to bc inherently as some of the religious right is than i can concede that this position makes sense to hold even if i do not think it makes sense if you judge the standpoint but judged from the standpoint it is tenable delta,2,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,i am sorry but are not you reaffirming my point if republicans voted against obama care that only further exemplifies their opposition to bc i probably do not understand what you mean so if you could explain it in more detail that would be nice ,2,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,you have changed my view slightly on this i am not sure if it delta worthy though you have convinced me that the republican condemnation of pp is legitimate from their pov however much i disagree with it but that does not account for how their opposition in general to sex ed and birth control does not make sense frankly if i were the boss of the republican party i would focus on carving the abortion aspect off of the main body of pp into its own separate legal entity and de funding that without touching the other parts but the dems would see that plan coming a mile a way and stop it dead so the same impasse occurs that view would make perfect sense but republicans just seem to outright hate everything pp does by being eager to defund it even though pp is not receiving any federal money as per the hyde amendment ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,firstly would you advocate a class for jews and muslims about how to cook pork i realize this is not a perfect example because eating pork does not cause unplanned pregnancies that worse than an imperfect example there is no inherent danger to society or risk of fetal parental death with that it too abstractly unrelated anyway as to the rest of your point i gotta say it is fairly reasonable only if you consider things from the republican standpoint when you evaluate the standpoint itself which hinges on pious christianism it laughably absurd and deprives any hope there is for the country government but if you judge it from the standpoint rather than judge the standpoint itself then it does make sense and is hard to argue against while this view makes me condemn republicans for their religious insanity i do know see why they hold their views and that does change my view it does not convince me in the least that they are right but it does convince me that from their pov it makes sense delta,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,i like the direction you are going with this i think you are close to a delta but could you elaborate more on how attaching abortion to birth control sex ed is irrelevant and can you explain why it does make sense for you to want both government uninvolved sex ed bc and lower abortions this seems to be a pick one or the other deal ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,sex ed is a form of birth control and it is the most ethical and foolproof one sex ed opposition inherently is birth control opposition and when you are eager to defund pp you are against condoms and birth control pills,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,i am close to giving you a delta on it if you could elaborate just a bit more where does this birth control is satans spawn argument come from from republicans i would be interested in seeing this explained in context ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,it is a good idea to look at it from their pov to this end i have tried to avoid getting into the pro life pro choice debate in this thread and have focused on the logic of their idea rather than the legitimacy of pro life i will not support subsidized birth control as i believe that is the duty of the people choosing to have sex to do so safely this would be fairly reasonable if they did not teach abstinence only education and fight planned parenthood efforts to have sex ed you cannot tell people you are imparting them and only them sexual responsibility and then deny them contraceptive usage and proper sex ed i will not support you killing a baby because you could not use protection against this obvious outcome of sex again this is only tenable in a world where sex ed is perfect and it is not also planned parenthood does not get supported by federal tax dollars as per the hyde amendment,2,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,but they should support it they should not be declaring war on planned parenthood and promoting abstinence only education they should be backing birth control or at the very least being neutral to it if the repubs neither helped nor combated birth control and sex ed you would have a point but they have restricting bc availability is anti bc ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,this is a fairly good rebuttal but i believe it kind of focusing on a different issue my argument is not that you should not be against abortions if you are pro life it that you should not be against bc if you are the study you offers only makes suggestions and does not disprove that bc helps even if the other methods pro life laws do help that does not mean the bc does not help i do not see the reason in this so to summarize they believe that contraceptives are ineffective at reducing the abortion rate as the unintended pregnancy rates have been fairly stable but that increasing abortion restrictions is effective at reducing abortion this theory is logically holed how can you prove the causation how can you know that it was specifically the pro life laws and not the bc that helped that ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts, i have seen estimates that they make up about 20 of the republican party there obviously no stat that can prove this once and for all since piety varies but 20 seems to be a rather conservative estimate http www pewresearch org fact tank 2016 02 23 america religious groups and their political leanings also you would have to differentiate between the christian rightists who secularize the more moderate less pious ones and those who do not the more devout ones and that subjective these are people who do not believe the government should be spending on big governments programs and want to keep taxes low they should support birth control and sex ed the most if you want low taxes then this side of removing all welfare and public service providing free birth control and sex ed is a great idea the republican party is a lot more complicated than the picture you paint which focuses pretty exclusively on the religious right of course it is i am sure there are a few pro choice republicans just as i am sure there are some pro life democrats but when the gop own website is saying it is pro life i believe that that is significant enough to be a fair descriptor of the party ,2,changemyview
ShiningConcepts, do you believe it ok put a gun against someones head and take money to buy birth control okay so it not moral to force people to pay for things they do not like so when can i expect the refund check i am owed for the unaccountable police departments the overblown military budgets the corporate bailouts trump living in his tower etc i would fund birth control over those things any day of the week you open up a massive can of worms with this argument ,1,changemyview

ShiningConcepts,i wo not assert that they wish to outlaw bc but why do i criticize their attempts to defund it and why do i believe the government should subsidize it because republicans are the ones who are against abortions the most fiercely not the dems so they should be more pro free bc than anyone else if you are going to say i do not want to go out of my way to fund assist you in getting birth control and this disproportionately affects poorer women then you cannot say i will go out of my way to prevent you from getting an abortion also if you believe the government should stay out of your sex life then why should they have the right to decide if you do or do not get an abortion and because it is in society long term interest which is the government chief duty to ensure that accident babies are not created paying for a child through the welfare state and public schools etc for at least 18 years is enormously larger than paying for an abortion which is enormously larger than just preventing it all with some birth control finally if the government should not subsidize your sex life then when can i expect a refund on all the things i do not want the government to subsidize that it still does like the overblown military budget or the bank bailouts or the unaccountable police departments ,4,changemyview
ShiningConcepts, it should be noted that very few republicans are against birth control really not the vibe i get from stories like this https www thecut com 2017 01 the senate just voted to roll back womens healthcare html where the republican government votes it down they are often anti sex ed this is because they tend to be religious and they believe that sex should only happen between married couples as such to them the only sex ed needed is abstinence only sex ed it is a very naive position to hold but it is a fully defensible one to hold these are people who believe that the noah ark story is real and that the earth is a 6000 year old piece of land it may be defensible from their standpoint but logically speaking it is insane this is not directed towards you as i am guessing you do not agree with them i am just pointing out that i am not convinced by this defense ,4,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,you did provide some clarification on their relationship with pp but they are against the federal funding of birth control http time com money 4634382 obamacare repeal what happens birth control which will naturally make it harder to get also i have heard that argument used before and it kind of flawed first of all you can make the cases that food stamps and public housing fund abortions because they free up money at some point through some degrees of separation the money will get there at one point or another is the existence of the police rather than private security companies allowing abortion clinics to commit abortions and regarding medicaid it is reimbursed for the services it provides after they are provided https www plannedparenthoodaction org blog how federal funding works at planned parenthood so if pp does not do a service that say costs them 100 they do not lose 100 if they do a service that does cost them 100 that 100 is returned to them this is freeing up money in the bank account of the patient not pp itself,6,changemyview

ShiningConcepts,oh okay my bad i was thinking about the leave you take during after pregnancy i was not thinking of the time after birth first months years anyway who exactly makes the choice regarding who stays home it cannot be the employer it not their business and if the man makes more money than you than that on top of you being able to breastfeed will naturally predispose you to staying home this will create a wage gap but as the op was saying i am not sure how this can be called sexism plus having children is a choice ,1,changemyview

ShiningConcepts,sorry for late reply i have been doing stuff firstly a lot of the stats you have regarding the mental health and psychological makeup of pedophiles since pedophilia is stigmatized there is no valuable quantifiable data on it and some of your points are rather interesting so most pedophiles are not sexual pedophiles just obsessed with abuse reliving and do not enjoy child porn that one surprised me are there any citations you have also you said that legalizing cp has nearly no effect on these people again how do you know that i could not find any studies dis proving these assumptions which is why i am calling for them to occur for the government to encourage their through the sale of child porn which is abuse i am guessing you misspoke here the fictional cp i was referring to is not abuse it harms no one i am by no means endorsing the legalization much less government sanctioning of live action cp it is super hard for children to come out for sexual abuse currently that is why most victims come out as children typo right could you clarify what you mean the worry is if child porn became normalised and was avaliable on the internet then children would be socalisied to believe that the pornography is normal and acceptable this is the same worry we had with violent video games and the prevalence of rape porn and it would be illegal to show this to children anyway also it obviously is not impossible that some people who would otherwise be non acting would become acting by this stuff but i would assert that the number of would be criminals who would become non criminals is higher do i have proof of this no but that why i am calling for the study to occur i think a better view would that people who are diagnosed with pedofillia orientation by a psychologist should be able to have certian materials however this is an incrediably small amount of people so a blanket lifting of child porn would be way to negative because of the stigmatization of pedophiles which does have reason to exist i sincerely doubt a significant of pedophiles would dare tell a psychiatrist about their tendencies ,1,changemyview

ShiningConcepts,if your ideology is unable to handle rhetoric and used rhetoric as a justification for violence than that is a problem with the ideology responding to anti islamic rhetoric not per se actions but rhetoric with violence only rightfully furthers anti islamic rhetoric the rhetoric of a politician you disagree with is not a justification for violence trump is far from responsible when you are using the rhetoric of trump to attack people who had nothing to do with him responsibility falls squarely on you it is a copout to suggest that it on trump ,2,changemyview

ShiningConcepts,i was saying that simply viewing cp is no problem obviously presenting it to a child for grooming is illegal and the laws against it should remain as strict as they are i was not intending to suggest the defense of this in my post your point regarding japanese crime is interesting the wikipedia article on the train car thing was an interesting read https en wikipedia org wiki women only passenger car japan now obviously the stats i presented are not intended to be absolute i myself have been coming to realize that statistics are so easily manipulable and not true also when you consider the god knows amount of unreported child sex crimes in any country both japan and usa those numbers might skew the stats in either direction the point on underreporting crimes that a good eye opening read it is of concern but that article is from 2007 and a lot of it is hearsay it seems it is something to keep in mind but every source i can find tells me that japan has higher violent crime than the usa from what i can find underreporting may be a bigger problem than in america but there would have to be an implausible fuck load of under reporting for that under reporting to cancel out this supposed disparity plus as another commenter stated i believe it is factors aside from the availability of porn related to socioeconomic situations that explain the crime gap ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,video games were just a more abstract reference point to provide an example of similar cases not working the more direct points where the porn and rape porn ubiquities also as i believe and you acknowledged these factors are far more important to the combating of crime than just the availability of outlets also did you misunderstand that statistic you linked to or did i misunderstand what you wanted to say you appeared to say that the crime of rape only applies to victims over 13 but that link appears to say the opposite of what you said with respect to the crime of rape article 177 of the penal code provides that a person who through assault or intimidation forcibly commits sexual intercourse with a female of not less than thirteen years of age commits the crime of rape and shall be punished by imprisonment with work for a definite term of not less than 3 years the same shall apply to a person who commits sexual intercourse with a female under thirteen years of age i agree and understand that this is shitty confusing wording on behalf of the study but i believe you misinterpreted this statement ,1,changemyview

ShiningConcepts, preface i am a pro choicer these are other people views i am regurgitating here the ultimate subjective question with abortion is when does life begin and at what point does the fetus life outweigh the mother right to bodily autonomy there is no clear cut scientific answer to this question because it depends on what you consider to be life not all abortions are created equal a 13 year old rape victim who is not in good health to carry her ancephaly ridden baby to term who wants an abortion at 2 months that entirely morally different than a 30 year old educated woman who had consensual sex and is in good health to carry a healthy baby to term wanting an abortion at 5 months if you believe that a fetus is a life and that it right to life outweighs the mother right to bodily autonomy then it makes perfect sense to be pro life if you believe that a fetus is not a life or that it right to life does not outweigh the mother right to bodily autonomy then it makes perfect sense to be pro choice the fundamental root of this decade old debate is the fact that people do not agree on when life begins or how maternal autonomy balances fetal life it not possible to scientifically prove one point either way because it a matter of opinion banning abortion will just lead to more problems and wo not eradicate the root problem people are concerned about the number of aborted children i do not agree while some would be abortion receivers might just do it unsafely i am quite sure that many would just carry it to term that not regurgitated it something i myself believe ,2,changemyview
ShiningConcepts, a human fetus does not experience senses until later in the pregnancy and does not have a developed brain until later on as well when those later on periods of time comes is abortion still legal the morality of abortion changes based on which stage of the pregnancy you are in it would help if you gave us what you believe the deadline should be should it be legal for anyone no matter how far along the pregnancy is should it end at 6 months ,2,changemyview

ShiningConcepts,hah cheesy of you to repeat it thrice d i did not catch that right anyway now for your first source it already conceded that it failed to find any evidence of a direct link and that why i want to see this done on an experimental basis i too have evidence of indirect links ie the japan crime rates and the falling rape rates despite more porn neither of us have conclusive evidence which is why my belief that we should give this a shot on an experimental basis in order to get the hard evidence that does not exist is unchanged if it helps to clarify my view is that there is enough reason to do this experimentally you can change my view either by convincing me that there is not because it is likely to fail or that i should be significantly less confident than i am that it wo not i actually read a little bit from the second study while it does concede that there are no empirical studies with large scale findings to go to i find it to be flawed the norms and values that circulate in society that define adult child sex as deviant and abusive are wholly absent in pcp pseudo child pornography and in their place is a cornucopia of sites that deliver the message to his brain via the penis that sex with children is hot fun for all he then asserts that this is reason why men can be socialized into being pedophiles this is rather flimsy first of all it not like those norms and values are widely present and not wholly absent in porn rape porn what with the growth of the internet should by his own logic be delivering the message that rape is hot fun for all but despite the growth and ubiquity of porn and by extension rape porn rape rates are going down as is most violent crime he then talks about how this could cause a demand for real cp but i do not support that and there is no way i sincerely doubt that it could ever become legal even if there are more pedophiles as a result of fictional cp i doubt the number of pedophile converts can be so high that it is enough to culturally normalize what our society vastly disgusts now ,0,changemyview

ShiningConcepts,could you provide me the news article or source that explains how pedophilia can be acquired through culture abuse and adverse childhood experiences sure but which one explains how it can be acquired through culture i tried googling some phrases but found nothing even scientists are not sure http www issm info sexual health qa what causes paraphilias skimming over the wikipedia article https en wikipedia org wiki pedophilia causes also is not very assuring even if this never results in abuse it is still not a great thing to play with since it can distort relationships and probably cause distress for that individual firstly you can say the exact same thing about porn secondly i would prioritize the discouragement of pedophilia through these alternatives over the maintenance of being distress free ,1,changemyview

ShiningConcepts,thanks for the reply and information i was not trying to suggest that this would work for sure i was trying to suggest that there is enough tentitive evidence to warrant an experimentation not proof but enough to attempt to get some pedophiles cannot control being abused to me a person who became a pedophile through abuse is no morally different than one who was born with it there is a basis for this as numerous studies have found that orgasming over something can increase the link between that thing and sexual pleasure so not helping people would eal with it but actually growing the association they already may have as well as that seeing something even a fictional something can normalize that thing i do not think that we should make any moves that normalize real cp but that not to suggest that all of those new pedophiles would become criminals firstly i do not see how a person once an adult can become a pedophile if they are not already one are there any studies that show this that a person who is not a pedophile can become one as an adult if they had no previous pedophiliac experiences and on a more general note i believe that child porn would pale in comparison with regards to other causes of child crime people who are abused as children so i would say having more social services workers better education better opportunities and schools if need be and trying to improve the quality of life for kids is a more pressing issue i believe that that is a key reason why japan and the us have disparate crime rates also if i may inquire can you be more specific on what you mean by normalize in this context i am sternly not advocating any real cp that should be illegal and still punished harshly ,-1,changemyview

ShiningConcepts,men going their own way the actual subreddit on it and many of it media figures on the web are misogynists and i avoid them that why i do not associate with the ideology but i do live the lifestyle the lifestyle is basically being childfree for life because too many problems with marriage onerous subjectivist family law in the us makes marriage too risky a decision and it a risk i have chosen not to take aha it has nothing to do with missile launchers i am a direct experience of a split family with a lot of trouble especially over divorce the goal of marriage in theory is to prevent this situation from happening it to encourage the parents to stay together so that no offense children like you grow up in stable two parent households because that what is best for them unfortunately in a culture like ours where divorce is not frowned upon too much this largely does not work the point for me was why should one marry if love is there if you plan to have kids marriage is a social contract that is designed to keep the relationship stable for the benefit of the children it is a social proclamation and ceremony unifying two parents which offers them more security for the sake of the children again this has diminished in our culture that tolerates divorce but it still there so if you do not plan to have kids i agree with you but if you do it better to be married and stable not necessarily for the parents but for the children ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts, scientists have known a long time that sexual fetishes are a result of association related to very early development which is why many feel they were born that way can you blame them no one chooses their parents or the environment they are born in to me it is no different at all from actually being just born with it ,1,changemyview

ShiningConcepts,there are many celebritieis who have been given egregious child support payments which are really just backdoor alimony the system is bulslhit avoid dating anyone who makes less money than you it is the greatest threat to financial solvency the family court system is broken ,-5,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,to be more specific child support should be set to a fixed amount that is based on the standard of living for the area or a portion of your income whichever is lower there have been egregiously high child support costs over the years for celebrities that money is not being spent on the child it being spent by the parents child support is backdoor alimony ,2,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,18 is a long ass time and what i meant to say was that if they get a high amount of support if they baby trapped divorced a rich guy then there no restriction on what most of the money is spent for child support should be a fixed amount that is only charged if affordable the current laws where it an arbitrary percentage of income open the door up to exploitation ,-4,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,ahh sorry i meant to say that child support is untied to marital status custody visitation probably would be anyway yeah the fact that common law marriages are identical to legal marriage that is the point i was going for ,1,changemyview

ShiningConcepts,but the government already enforces the latter through palimony and child custody support visitation is independent of current previous marital status anyway,2,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,i believe you are actually agreeing with his point that legal marriage is unneeded apart from religious marriages the main thing that marriage is in the us is a financial and legal contract that outlines the division of property upon divorce since the family court system palimony and child support being untied to the marital status enforces these things on common law couples there is really no benefit to non religious marriage in the us because the government interferes in your life either way breadwinners beware ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts, and your fact that you see child support as a negative means you are of a mentality that is poisonous in my opinion child support is a negative because it marginalizes your parentage by reducing you to some every other weekend bullshit and a bill that is a fraction of income if you can provide a better lifestyle than you should have custody you get imprisoned if you do not pay it or choose not to work and pay it so it is a bodily autonomy violation and in states where you do not they just make it even harder for you to pay it ie taking away your driver license which just continues the cycle child support has very little restrictions on what the other parent uses it for so if the other parent is rich then you can use it as your own meal ticket 4 life ,-3,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,i am a fervent mgtow by lifestyle not ideology and i do agree with your post to the core but there are some things to point out there are tax breaks given to married couples additionally i believe one of the original main benefits of marriage and the key one today is the betterment of the children and to secure stable two parent households and that marriage is a social institution that offers more security than just living apart or a non legal marriage i agree that government involvement in marriage as it always had has completely fucked it up 100 for breadwinners which are by and large men but if you marry someone who makes as much as money as you and are ready to commit your life to them then it is the best option for having kids marriage is great for the children honestly i do not see the reason to do it if you are not having planning kids but if you are then it better to be married than not i believe studies show that children with married together parents do better than those with split parents ,1,changemyview

ShiningConcepts,in a society with free and public abortions a child birth is the consequence of not getting an abortion the mother has 100 choice and if you believe in the capacity for women to be responsible for their actions i doubt you do then you then assert she has 100 responsibility if the mother is 100 responsible for whether or not the baby comes to term then guess what the father is no longer 50 responsible for the child you are telling women you have 100 choice but only 50 responsibility and telling men you have 0 choice but have 50 responsibility if only people as sexist as you against women and men had the capacity to understand that 0 does not equal 50 then perhaps you would not be so sexist oh that right you just love sexism when it benefits you,1,childfree

ShiningConcepts,so while you do not contest the jail sentence you also believe that it is not immoral that a little confusing i mean if someone was sent to jail for something i consider not morally wrong i would contest that sentencing how can you explain this it does not follow that you have no moral apprehensions about this case if you also do not have apprehensions about the sentencing ,4,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,i legit do it not that i agree with you oh god no not at all it that i can appreciate the fact that you are not being a hypocrite and she chose to get pregnant and was making her own decision in your scenario she chose that pathway so you cannot blame him for it unless you are saying the sympathy is only being awarded because she pregnant and independent of the fact that she was the victim of statutory rape ,2,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,no it was the woman choice to be a homemaker she is responsible for that choice for fuck sake with abortions both parties made the choice to get the woman pregnant and we would not call the man half responsible for the child basically it seen that like the money made during the marriage the skills career the bread winner developed while being supported by the home maker are actually belong to both parties similarly the homemaking skills the homemaker developed while supporting the breadwinner belong to both parties or at least that how it would work if there was a single functioning non defective brain in the family court system and is not allowed to decide not to work so their ex does not get money funny these people tell me that bodily autonomy is the fundamental most important right a human being has oh that right they do not give a shit about bodily autonomy they are merely peddling their eugenicist program so one less kid on welfare if you are going to be imprisoned for not working you are bodily autonomy is being violated no different than imprisoning a woman for deciding to get an abortion ,9,MensRights

ShiningConcepts,everyone else is probably roasting you for the obvious reasons why this is moral so let me bring a new topic here double standards imagine a hypothetical case in which a 34 year old male teacher has a relationship with a 12 year old girl he teaches his plea agreement called for six months in jail with three months suspended and no contact with the girl for life later the girl revoked the order and she married her rapist be completely honest with me would you be willing to say about this case the case of this teacher is not morally wrong i personally do not see his relationship with a 12 year old female student morally wrong per se judging by how it ended up even without knowing what the relationship would have been like i would only fault the teacher if there was evidence of emotional abuse or perhaps physical abuse otherwise i believe that she was capable of making a decision herself and there were no consequences with it while i am not advocating for laws of pedophilia or whatever it called to be flexible as a rule i understand why it such like i stated before and the exceptions should not influence such a delicate matter i personally do not see this as rape nor so i see anything wrong with it the only wrong thing i see about this entire situation was how dumb the teacher was for having sex with a student and then begging to be a teacher later after he was registered as a sex offender i think he knew well in advance what this meant to her teaching career in regards to the girl i do not think she was coerced at all manipulated in any way physically or emotionally nor should i necessarily give my sympathies to her or feel bad for her as she made the decision herself i do think the relationship is odd but i disagree with the sentiment in this regard that he was unable to make a decision in right mind ,3,changemyview

ShiningConcepts,i was not trying to suggest that it was falsely solely because i said so since there are a variety of sources peddling these 1 in 5 1 in 4 1 in 6 etc stats can you show me which specific government report you are referring to there are 100 something million women in the usa you have got an extreme burden of proof regarding sample size sample selection bias and sample diversity for a study like this and stanford brock turner is a bad example 1 stanford is already a prestigious university 2 the criticism in the brock turner case was directed at the courts not the university itself ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts, sigh i cannot believe i did not think of that earlier i do believe that it should be subsidized by society else that will just create more workplace discrimination if employers would foot the bill but it something every other country has and it encourages reproduction and our population pyramid is looking a bit thin lower down delta,2,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,even so feminists talk about the issue childishly you are bringing it up in a very thoughtful and analytical way and i appreciate that but i do not see feminists doing the same anyway the problem is that those larger factors at play are not being addressed it being framed solely as a result of toxic employers rather than addressing the root of that toxicity ,0,changemyview
ShiningConcepts, firstly i call out your source credibility because it peddles the 1 in 5 women get raped statistic just because obama said it does not mean it true anyway really there are a significant number of people who legitimately do not understand that a person unconscious from alcohol or a drug is not capable of consenting i am actually legitimately interested can you cite this anyway here what i would assert campus rape should be dealt with privately it should not be reported publicly with a lot of flare imagine you are a fourth year student you have worked so hard for the past 1 6th of your life trying to get this coveted degree you have finished a paid internship your ready to go into the real world it all good then some first years get involved in a rape case that you had nothing to do with do you want your name to be tarnished do you want employers networking people friends and family to have a subconscious negative opinion about you because you went to that school with a rape case colleges should take action but it should not be pronounced as you are suggesting ,-1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,so i actually found the source http www npr org sections money 2014 10 21 357629765 when women stopped coding for you stat and i was really surprised really i was surprised to see progress actually stop overtime anyway i honestly do not know why this drop happened it rather interesting to be honest but i do not see feminists actually confronting it either way ,2,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,but i do not see how it is improving public safety for them when the oft shouted down victim blamers are trying to improve it for them i do not see why feminists dismiss them and i sincerely doubt that there is a significant number of people smart enough to attend a college who do not realize that violence is a crime plus if they do not realize that it is then why would they be cognizant of the poster or psa in the first place ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,i think that the whole matter of proof accusations is a complex tangent let focus on reduction and preventative ideas what can i do to help them tell women that they should not protect themselves because it is victim blaming ,-1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,firstly there is also an education gap regarding men going into uni less than women anyway that article is from israel and israel does not appear to be a secular country and given what judaism https en wikipedia org wiki women in judaism women as witnesses has to say about women https en wikipedia org wiki women in judaism rules of family purity i think the problem there stems from religion i was interested in american women in this post just like muslim women i do oppose religion backed mistreatment of women in foreign countries ,3,changemyview
ShiningConcepts, what does that have to do with you being indifferent about it to clarify i am not against and indifferent the goal of equal pay i am against and indifferent to the way it is being approached i believe that the way mainstream feminists are approaching the issue is not helping the cause and perhaps i am using the wrong words when i say indifferent i generally mean to say do not support not do not care enough to post to cmv sorry if that was confusing,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,i was not trying to propose that i have a better way i was merely pointing out i disagree with the current one what i find questionable in descending order of importance is 1 they do not do anything that i believe helps victims substantially 2 they shut down people trying to help them by telling them how not to be a victim and 3 they use patently false statistics about x of rapes going unreported that not possible to determine which damages the cause ,1,changemyview

ShiningConcepts,i am indifferent to their attempts to fix it due to the current way they go about it the attempts of feminists to get my hypothetical wife to bring in more money are sidestepping the issue by putting all of their attention in the wrong place programs like the one the person i delta would mention do help my wife these people including obama who criticize the wage gap are not ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,ahh there we go that exactly what i was looking for true these people are not as visible as the feminists i cite and imho do not have as much media attention as them but i do stand by their causes i cannot say i fully stand by the gendered scholarships but i do stand by the educational and assistive help helping women and girls enter stem fields and actually close the gender wage gap is a cause i fully support delta you did change my view since i can now sympathize with some feminist causes beyond reproductive rights but with regards to mainstream feminists the ones that have the big media profiles i am still unconvinced ,2,changemyview
ShiningConcepts, there a lot of confusion over what consitutes it i believe you may be referring to a study i questioned before i do not wanna debunk it if i am mistaken so can you show me where the evidence of rape confusion comes from there also a problem on college campuses where rape victims are not taken seriously so that the college does not have to report rapes on campus well colleges and police departments should investigate with due process in mind rape accusations to the fullest they cannot be expected to report crimes if there is no credibility if there is credibility then it should be prosecuted but what do you mean not reported i mean i would not want fourth and fifth years to have lowered employment prospects because they come from a university that got a bad reputation due to reports of sexual assaults they had nothing to do with ,0,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,that was more of a mid 1900s goal and that was definitely supportable i am referring to contemporary feminism and if it was a key feminist goal to get women into those fields rather than criticize the fact that they are getting paid less for choosing not to do so i would support them ,2,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,no worries you encourage me to edit the post and make it clear for others in the future by doing so regarding the pay gap the problem is that feminists discuss the issue unproductively if they acknowledged that the work that needs to be done in fixing the gap lies on women to make different choices rather than suggest the end goal is fixing employer culture then i would stand by them but the way they do it now deters them from the cultural discussion you mentioned they are focusing on the wrong goals i think it a rather big thing to assert that mansplaining is fundamentally rooted in sexism because the term itself is inherently so ambiguous and open ended ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,i am not and do not personally know a person who is sexually violent i can vote for pro choice people in my state country also it may help to clarify since it may have come off as unclear in retrospect i do support the goal of reducing rape and dv but i do not support the way feminists currently go about it that a better way of wording it post edited ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,edited my post i realized that i was wording poorly if it still not clear then think of me as saying i neither support nor oppose any feminist causes other than reproductive rights could you elaborate on your point i do not fully understand how you are applying it as a counterargument i am not sure how it rebuts my point that the causes are not of interest to me ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,serious question how can your view be changed if simply pointing out the good reason there is to lie does not change it it seems that the only way it can is to present you with physical dna evidence but since these assaults were not reported until years after the fact and a lot of it court proceedings are happening behind closed doors that not feasible so let me ask what do you think might help you to change your views ,2,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,do you believe that all of them are telling the truth if not which ones do you single out as false true 50 plus testimonials is compelling evidence bill cosby is a rich man who is a prime target for predatory lawsuits because of how he is vulnerable to civil suits and how being victimized by him would be great for an attention seeker to me that is compelling evidence to wait until tangible evidence comes in the fact that 50 people so happened to accuse him is not proof to me if this was just some poor bloke who was not famous and rich i would believe you to but here when you combine rich and fame there is more than enough reason to lie and ergo more than enough reason for me to be suspicious ,3,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,but going by top just tells me it has more upvotes than other posts it does not tell me how much more it has or even what the number is in the first place i do not believe it should be known immediately because some controversial comments do change radically but i do not think it should be as long as a day 6 hours sounds good ,1,ideasforcmv
ShiningConcepts,i believe it is inherently valuable to know what the dominant popular opinion on a topic is i am interested in seeing what an entire community thinks of a post not solely the comments that get a delta ,1,ideasforcmv
ShiningConcepts,we will never know whether or not bill cosby is innocent or guilty all of these stories are unverifiable he said she said and of course they are going against a celebrity with lots of money so i do have to consider the possibility that these women are gold diggers because with celebrity rich men there is a lot of reason to lie a lot of women accused him that is not proof that any one of them is telling the truth hell it could be that a lot of women are gold diggers or attention seekers the reality of the matter is that short a confession given voluntarily no plea deal bullshit we will never know which of these stories are true which are false and which are morally complicated so while i believe in innocent until proven guilty i am assuming you had a typo here and i switched them mmhmm you believe that but you say literally in your next sentence i have realized that i have not really heard any compelling evidence for his innocence i ask you have you heard any compelling evidence for his guilt if you as you say believe in innocent until proven guilty then you should be seeking compelling evidence for his guilt before you seek compelling evidence for his innocence imagine if a judge said i have not heard any compelling evidence for your innocence therefore you are guilty sentenced to prison that is wrong the judge needs to hear compelling evidence for a suspect guilt to sentence him ,7,changemyview

ShiningConcepts, despite refusing to acknowledge men issues as well i am not a feminist and am in fact an mra but many feminists do care about the rights of men they focus on women but that because there reason to compartmentalize when you have different goal sets i do not consider them focusing on the rights of women to necessarily mean that they are hostile oppositional to the rights of men most feminist causes are not oppositional to mra causes and vice versa ,14,changemyview

ShiningConcepts,no the family court system is the problem the only way to ensure that the family court system cannot affect society is to demolish or reform it you do not need to strip away women right to work to do so this guy was specifically criticizing the government role in cultivating what they consider to be a toxic part of female nature ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,i am guessing that you are referring to the comment that said the end game of female nature is pure destruction society cannot thrive while hardworking men like this guy kill themselves because the government puts a gun to their heads and forces them to pay usurious amounts to women western civilization is not about to drive off a cliff we have already driven off the cliff i cannot wait to hit the ground so we can begin to rebuild im going to pass down all of knowledge to my children and make sure they do not repeat our mistakes of course the mgtows want to rebuild they want to demolish society where men get cucked in the courts that is not necessarily saying he wants to build a society where women cannot work it a big leap to go from rebuild society and end this culture to reset society and take away women rights ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,lurker here is this serious ,1,MGTOW
ShiningConcepts, there is because it demonstrates that this is viewed as a punishment it the utility of not associating with women that mgtow intend to have they do not intend to end street harassment they intend to regress society to a more male dominated one they view it as a benefit to themselves not as a punishment to women i do not think they intend to regress society to the 50s that would just epitomize all the gender roles they so vehemently condemn but mgtow wishes it was the 50s their manifesto is written from the perspective that women are innately seeking male attention as well as seek to destroy them along with society is this a belief or can it be proven how can you prove that mgtow is seeking to put men in a position to be dominant and free to abuse and not seeking to keep men liberated from in their eyes the financial insolvency and legal risks of romance mgtow does post a lot of insane rhetoric but women should not be allowed to work is not something i can recall seeing afaik and i will concede i have been fooled if i can be proven wrong the mgtow dream is to be rich and single forever it not to end up in a society where they can abuse women and get away with it ,3,changemyview

ShiningConcepts,women have lots of powers independent of romance they can now work and are no longer required to be homemakers it a rather big leap to go from do not date women to make society male centric ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,there is nothing wrong with the double edged sword statement benefits women because mgtows wo not engage in negative behavior with them non beneficial to women because mgtows wo not give them free dates it is a double edged sword but in reality one edge is longer than the other because not harassing someone is more beneficial to them than it is non beneficial to not gift them i think the bigger problem with the double edged word argument than the misogyny within is the fact that it silly there are way too many liberal men for the average women to give a shit about what this internet counterculture has to say this is obviously a statement from mgtow about putting women in time out for falsely accusing men of rape so they cannot ride on my motorcycle or get free date dinners this is not the 50s it not like women need men in order to get dinners or ride motorcycles so the idea that they are disinterested in gifting women is not a big deal at all it a personal decision to put themselves out of the deal because they think it is not beneficial and what exactly does time out mean in this context its a forced segregation as a form of punishment and that clear by the use of the term double edged sword call me crazy but not engaging in romantic relationships with women is not the same as avoiding all contact with women much less segregation regarding your response to my analogy do you believe that every women should fully know the risks of rape and violence before they decide if they wanna date a man that a perfectly rational position a counterpart to mine which is that every man should fully know the risks before they decide to date the mgtows just cold turkey advise against doing it at all which is where i diverge from them another reason is that the rates and long term effects of the family court system injustices far outweigh the rates and long term effects of sexual violence in aggregate while your analogy is functional in principle it does not fully work with respect to magnitude and no it does matter that the law sanctions it because the empirical effects are influenced by the law decision to or to not sanction it the law and culture will generally help you if you are involved in sexual violence but it will largely not if you are divorce raped you say you care about the empirical effects that exactly why i bring up the law sanctioning ,1,changemyview

ShiningConcepts,the reason black people commit more crimes is because of racism black people have more negative influences and environment than white people that is why black crime is disproportionate if black people did not have those shitty environments or if white people also did on a proportionate level then i am 99 9999999999999 sure that the gap would close the hell up right away not that the religious idiots in the kkk know much about science but in science when you do experiments you have to control for factors that may confuse the determination of cause and effect same deal here when you are going to start comparing races you have to control for influences it is because of these influences that black people commit more crimes if there were no negative influences driving black crime then yes the concern would be legitimate but it is not black activism is seeking to help address these influences which will not only reduce police corruption but also hopefully reduce black crime the kkk has no legitimate concerns in my view the very fact that they chose the name kkk is enough to tell me that they are all bullshit they could have picked a name that had less negative history but i have lost any interest in their concerns if they are going to use that name of all names ,0,changemyview

ShiningConcepts,what did eleanor do to piss you off in my playthrough there was not anything but yeah fuck arvo that reminds me what happened to arvo or lily or molly or any of the other characters here is a spoiler filled http walkingdead wikia com wiki video game characters link to the list of video game characters on the wikia there are a hell of a lot of characters in blue boxes and on this page being in a blue box means status unknown will these characters ever return telltale i would really like to see lily and arvo updates i mean lily cannot be killed or taken care of in the game if they did not plan to bring her back they would have made her killable to milk the most out of her character by injecting variation they are definitely planning something she might return in e5 also anyone else remember the huge hype on the telltale forums back in july august 2014 and that time lily actor nikki rapp iirc posted a cryptic tweet that made everyone think she would be returning in no time left ahh good times with that hype ,5,TheWalkingDeadGame

ShiningConcepts, because there are fundamental roles we have to play as men and women no they are roles people choose to play not have to i would not force myself or anyone else to take a gender role if they did not want to first off this is a very strange analogy for one thing unlike back in the day there is technology security systems firearms police etc you can use to protect yourself for another thing if you are working all the time then how can you protect your house less and less jobs demand the physique that men have over women so the rationale for tending to hire men has gone down you can pump breast milk breastfeeding is not everything in upbringing you do not need to be home 24 7 to breastfeed people are having less children back in the day gender roles made a lot more sense because we did not live in the kind of world we did most jobs were laborious and preferred the strength of men plus people had many kids back then because mortality rates were higher so what exactly would we gain from abolishing gender roles freedom ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,i guess i should probably try to be fully awake when i play story games aha,1,TheWalkingDeadGame
ShiningConcepts,as the other commenter said you die i actually chose to let the timer exhaust thinking that javi could scream something to bluff her out ie i wo not play your games but you gotta make a choice anyway ,1,TheWalkingDeadGame
ShiningConcepts,i miss the classic episodes season 1 was the best season so far season 2 felt rather underwhelming before s2e5 will never forget my anticipation for that one and season 3 did better but it still pales in comparison to season 1 i miss lee he was a good and relatable character ,5,TheWalkingDeadGame
ShiningConcepts,i just finished the ep did anyone else refuse to inject thinking that that what clementine wanted so that she could get the info when i first got to the scene i legitimately did not know he was making an offer of kill me for info they did not say it alright when i saw clementine reacting negatively to a choice i thought was helping her by giving her the info she needed i thought what the hell and had to reset ,12,TheWalkingDeadGame
ShiningConcepts,come on that not the cyoa spirit unless you legitimately did not understand the choice like i did with the lingard one to be honest and made the wrong one you cannot just replay a part you gotta stick to and see through your decisions else what is much the point ,3,TheWalkingDeadGame
ShiningConcepts,honestly given how my mind drifts as i am playing multiple other games and engaging in other sorts of media i too wish i had waited until all 5 or at least 4 episodes came out but i was too curious and it is a great season just that it would be easier to understand if all played at once ,1,TheWalkingDeadGame

ShiningConcepts,he was a perfect pick for the writers a disposable forgettable face we did not get to know whose reveal does not shock the audience and no major change to the characters storyline dynamics needed so the main cast roles stay the same ,8,DesignatedSurvivor
ShiningConcepts,i knew he was that guy from earlier in the ep but i completely forgot his name and i could not recall seeing him in the past that how unimpactful it felt ,2,DesignatedSurvivor
ShiningConcepts,i believe what u jerseydvl was trying to say and i 100 agree is that he was expecting a more dramatic reveal a character we loved and got to know and remember not a character we barely know whose name i legit could not recall when i saw his face it what the trailer primed me for ,66,DesignatedSurvivor
ShiningConcepts,i thought a conspirator was going to use it to remote start a car that would ram into them or do something did not immediately realize hannah was wearing those gloves ,1,DesignatedSurvivor
ShiningConcepts,ford cars fix or replace daily ,8,DesignatedSurvivor
ShiningConcepts,you gotta wonder did they really expect this product placement to make a return like how many people who were not going to buy a ford before are going to drop a helluva lot of money on one now just because of this show i do not get advertising ,5,DesignatedSurvivor
ShiningConcepts,perchance did anyone else get confused and think that that was someone remote starting a car to assassinate hannah i was expecting a car to zoom away and try to ram them before i realized it was just hannah and yeah it jarring ,8,DesignatedSurvivor
ShiningConcepts, do not listen to those creeps nothing they have to say is worth hearing regarding biology i agree but i would say that it is always in a man best interest to know about the family court system before getting involved that something sex ed does not teach you but should in and of itself that is enough for me to sympathize with them ,-1,changemyview

ShiningConcepts,certainly i am not but everyone who smokes even one gets the risk some people smoke for decades without major trouble some smoke for a year with them i mean it a chance but still it in the interest of public safety to not smoke it not as much in the interest to be anti marijuana and when i said i disagreed i meant i was disagreeing with it with regards to it hypocritical marijuana treatment but given what the delta earner in this thread said that is closed off ,1,changemyview

ShiningConcepts, but not everyone needs the hallucinogenic effects but who does need lung cancer and death believe it or not tobacco also has some limited health benefits the article itself conceded that those benefits are insignificant relative to it risks i do not think you can make the same claim about marijuana and for the last point i disagree i believe the line of legalization should be public safety but as the person in this thread who changed my view pointed out that not exactly a reasonable expectation since the backlash for tobacco outlawing would far outweigh the one for mj outlawing ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,but nicotine is far more addictive so it is inevitable that people chain smoke it more so it is reasonable to make those comparisons with not exactly proportionate amounts ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,it most certainly does impair your lungs and other parts of your body and your lifetime viability but i will concede that driving impairment is one thing tobacco has over marijuna but it outweighed by the advantages marijuana has over tobacco like not killing you ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,by untenable i meant no good reason i suspected some of the reasons for this were because governments did not like marijuana because it was competition for other companies or because of it how kept the prison industrial complex going but those while they are reasons are not tenable reasons as they are not for the good of the society ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,fair enough that certainly rational i mean probation was a failure because alcohol was really popular and not impossible to make at home i am sure probation would have been much more successful if at the time alcohol was as popular as mj is today it is important to pursue feasible and practical goals i cannot see a way to argue against that delta but surely the number of people doing tobacco would go down once you raised the barrier of entry of doing it to criminalhood there is no real barrier of entry other than some money and an age limit to being a tobacco user but if it were banned the barrier of expand to become willing to be a criminal so yes there is reason it is not enforced as much thanks for changing my view i am less bitter about this topic now that i understand the reasoning ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,what is worse for you an alteration of conscious perception which is considered recreational and does have some health benefits or the risk of death and cancer i would take the former over the latter any day of the week plus those other drugs like mdma cocaine alcohol etc they do not just have those hallucinogenic effects but they are also dangerous mj has just the hallucinogenic properties ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,lemme just summarize your argument so i make sure i get it is what you are saying that people who want to ban marijuana also want to ban tobacco and alcohol but do not do it simply because the backlash relative to marijuana would be much greater if that the case then i will concede that you have convinced me of why this is how it is but i am unconvinced that that is a good reason for it to be ,1,changemyview
ShiningConcepts,it is terrible for you but it is far less terrible than smoking cigarettes so if you want to ban marijuana because it terrible for you then there is no reason you cannot support banning tobacco for exactly the same reason ,1,changemyview

ShiningConcepts,19 and i have never dated and am childless yah my view does come largely from reddit but it the truth i would entrust the mafia with my finances long before i would trust the family court system after everything i have seen and read i will not ever run the risk of having to put a penny into that system i know it all maybes and nothing is for certain it a risk some risks are worth taking some are not the trick is to know the difference and for me the difference for marriage is as clear as night and day ,1,pussypassdenied

ShiningConcepts,well i suppose it not theft if you consent to having it taken from you so in other words you expect her to reap the benefits of her decisions after marriage but you do not expect to acquire the same you want a homemaker and someone who raises your son in a stable environment you divorce she gets all the benefits of marriage long after it over and you get no benefits only the costs i mean if you are okay and think that this is only fair then that your choice but i cannot imagine me ever wanting to take the risk of such a shitty raw deal at the very least help her get a job when your son is old enough to start going to school or something or hire a nanny if you have a trusted sibling who could use the money if she is entitled to the lifestyle she lived in during the marriage so are you she better continue making you dinner and respecting your fatherhood then again why would she the way the family court system is set up now ,5,pussypassdenied
