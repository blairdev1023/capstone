Wintjoin,you are wrong at least on the federal level i cannot speak for all states you can sell a home made gun but you must mark it the same as a professional manufactured gun including adding a serial number you can not produce the gun for the purpose of selling it though if you get bored of it and decide to sell it that fine but you cannot produce with the initial intent to sell that unlicensed manufacturing this all assuming of course that the firearm is in a legal configuration and does not violate the nfa or some such atf has switched everything up on their site in the last two three years and i cannot find things anymore but here a capture of the old site https web archive org web 20150212035507 http www atf gov firearms faq firearms technology html commercial parts assembly see the paragraph under question 4 individuals manufacturing sporting type firearms for their own use need not hold federal firearms licenses ffls however we suggest that the manufacturer at least identify the firearm with a serial number as a safeguard in the event that the firearm is lost or stolen also the firearm should be identified as required in 27 cfr 478 92 if it is sold or otherwise lawfully transferred in the future ,5,weekendgunnit

Wintjoin,does not matter of trump thought it was a false flag if 90 of the world says it is not it effectively is not unfortunately he had to respond to what everybody believed rather than what was true i think it was caused by assad bombing a rebel gas storage site but even if trump did as well he had to respond like assad did it because that what the world said happened i think that a big reason why he gave advanced warning to minimize casualties do what the world wanted without really putting the hurt on assad ,2,The_Donald

Wintjoin,okay yes yes yes yes we are on the same page now i do belive everyone who i have seen who says anything at all doubting the syria strike has been called a shill now there are some centipedes who are pro strike but anti war however they are unwittingly falling right in line with the pro strike pro war shills ,1,The_Donald
Wintjoin,okay huge apologies for skimming your post and not reading clearly what you said i must have missed a news cycle because i had not seen the cernovich report i do believe cernovich and i do believe him that mcmaster was manipulating reports now that i have read his evidence what is it people are getting all disagreeing about i know there still some on the original syria strike but that no big deal did people think trump would actually put boots on the ground that what i thought you were saying and i know nobody here believes potus would do that ,0,The_Donald
Wintjoin,we have had policy discussion since this sub was made there have always been disagreements why is it we are just now being told to shut up and get in line that has been for more dividing than anything and the dozens of threads on it prove it if you repeat a lie often enough it becomes the truth that is what is happening the real discussion that needs to be shut down is all the people saying we are divided hop over to ets or enoughtrumpspam they are quoting thread likes this as evidence we are falling apart ,1,The_Donald
Wintjoin,edit apologies to cuckedbytrump for the below i misunderstood his reply and thought that he was saying people actually believed president trump was going to send in 150 000 troops which we know he would not after reading the cernovich report i see that the issue is the veracity of the mcmaster manipulation hint he totally was trying to pull some shit however i stand that the majority of troll and shill accusations i have seen are of people who are anti war if pro war shills are the concern why is it that people who are being cautious over the syrian situation getting reported there seems to be a concerted effort to memory hole this whole syria situation and that is concerning as it would benefit the opposition more than if we picked it apart in the open end edit op is on it about the missile strikes still everyone here who is not a shill knows the 150 000 stuff is complete shit but everyone i have seen called a troll or shill was making anti war viewpoints anyways i have not seen a single pro war post but if they exist please point me to them so i can deport nobody here is pro invasion but i do not think any real t d user thinks that invasion is anywhere in the realm of possibility we are not losing shit if this is divided this sub wo not last through eight years of real challenges i believe we are a lot stronger than you think ,1,The_Donald

Wintjoin,the information the obama admin had said syria had no more chemical weapons but apparently that not true anymore i did not take the government at face value for the last eight years and i wo not now i voted for president trump and i support him but i want concrete justification before we commit acts of aggression against a sovereign state just trust us is not enough for me to be 100 behind the action i need more than that if they have got more information i look to it being talked about in news reports in the coming days until then i will maintain that the gas attack reeks of false flag i wo not change my opinion just so i can say i support the president more than x person ,2,The_Donald

Wintjoin,guns are common in pretty much all of the united states but many criminals even on breaking and entering do not carry them case in point the three that got shot by the kid with the ar 15 not long ago had knives and brass knuckles do not know why criminals do this but they do and it not uncommon for a breaking and entering criminal armed with a knife to take a bullet ,4,CringeAnarchy
Wintjoin,and in that regard it was a success thing is now we cannot say it was false flag it would make us look like we acted irrationally without complete intel any investigation would have to say syria did it and saying that would increase calls for us to intervene in their situation ,1,The_Donald
Wintjoin,and that certainly the case but for the sake of transparency i would like just a bit more info before i completely change my thoughts on the situation just trust me is not good enough after coming off of eight years of the least transparent administration in the history of the united states an administration that still has plenty of its people in our government and likely many in the chain of command that led to this strike a video or picture or even just a radar tracking of the aircraft that is said to have dropped the gas is all i am really asking for simple stuff that would not make any opsec difference now that the situation is supposedly dealt with and it may be released in due time the situation is still fresh and i am sure tertiary decisions are still being made in regards to it they might just be deciding what can and cannot be safely released to the public asking for justification before launching attacks on a sovereign nation is something we should be doing even if the attack is low casualty for the nation targeted ,10,The_Donald
Wintjoin,so i had not heard of agorists until now am i understanding they think the way to a libertarian world is through subversion of legal markets why not just campaign to make all markets legal it sounds like a philosophy that would only be able to exist if you practiced it with your right hand and propped up big government with your left ,2,Physical_Removal
Wintjoin,i wonder if the reds will be celebrating this october november depending on what calendar they decide to use would be a great chance to have a counter protest ,3,Physical_Removal
Wintjoin,not convinced the assad regime launched the gas attack and even with no casualties bombing a sovereign nation over a false flag is not okay even if it sends the world a message that is within our national interests the president has more info than i do so if there is that smoking gun that says the assad regime did it i hope it is released in due time ,4,Physical_Removal

Wintjoin,only good news is it sent a message to the world that we can bomb the shit out of them at a moment notice we will ride that wave for a while i want proof that the assad regime was behind the chemical attacks though ,3,The_Donald
Wintjoin,it is a very big power move on our part it certainly shows our nation is capable of resolute swift powerful action the majority of people in the world say assad did it and this certainly put us as the winners in that regard however i am hearing there were casualties and i just want to make sure we did not kill people to send a message over a fake attack this puts us in the forefront of world power that for sure but i want us to get there without losing our way morally we will see in a few days probably there are reports of no casualties and reports of a handful i would like to see the record set straight there and i am hoping that if syria dropped the chemical weapons that we can see just a bit of evidence of that ,8,The_Donald

Wintjoin,the breed is nureongi and the practice of eating it is gaegogi or kagogi ,5,BeforeNAfterAdoption
Wintjoin,apparently though asking any questions about if this was the right action or not are concern trolling we spend eight years complaining about a president with zero transparency making backroom deals 24 7 and now asking for just a bit of justification is somehow disavowing we are all here to support president trump but we elected a president as much as we joke about the god emperor he is not a god and he is not infallible as voters it is our duty to always ask if our nation is doing the right thing we have got a commander in chief for the first time in years that will listen to the people and now we are supposed to be silent ,0,The_Donald
Wintjoin,agreed yesterday the forum was all behind it being a false flag and said trump was playing along until it could be proven now most everyone is saying that intervention was the right thing to do and assad was the one that launched the chemical weapons we are all here to support president trump but i feel like people are changing their viewpoints on the situation just to be able to say they 100 believe him on everything and from the standpoint of critical thought that just not the path we need to be taking ,18,The_Donald
Wintjoin,there are not supposed to be any more depots and plants we had them dismantled under the obama administration and kerry rubber stamped it as mission accomplished if it can be proved that the assad regime was behind the attacks there are obama admin officials that need to explain how exactly they failed ,13,The_Donald
Wintjoin,a day ago everyone here was saying false flag and asserting trump was playing along temporarily now everyone is backtracking on ever having believed that and saying trump just took a measured response to assad using gas the tone took a complete 180 in the matter of a day and i do not like it ,26,The_Donald

Wintjoin,a good critical thought the target appears to have been largely civilian why would assad target civilians if assad did it i think the question becomes was this a civilian target or was it a rebel held target and the scene has been altered to appear civilian for propaganda purposes in addition assad knows the world is watching and that a chemical attack is sure to bring about world anger as well the syrian forces are turning the tide of war if conventional weapons are proving effective why use chemical it would be the desperation of a failing regime when the syrian government has more ground now than it has in several years no matter how it is sliced the assad government intentionally dropping nerve agents on a civilian target just does not add up some claims are false and it must be determined which those are ,6,The_Donald

Wintjoin,syrian government reports are saying that this was caused by the bombing of a rebel chemical weapons dump this would be consistent with earlier reports saying that the casualties were suffering from chlorine gas exposure and would be consistent with the ability of the white helmets to be on scene in such a short period of time the rebels would have the capability of producing and stockpiling chlorine gas based munitions http tass com world 939351 russian news agencies are picking up the syrian government side in this ,14,The_Donald

Wintjoin,read the research sherman bell did in the double gun journal damascus is not as dangerous as portrayed in firearms myth he took a few dozen damascus barrels of different qualities some perfect specimens from high end makers other the lowest grade offered with holes literally rusted through the barrel the only way he got any of them to burst was with powder charges wildly in excess of even modern pressure recommendations or more easily with a bore obstruction blackpowder and mild smokeless loads are still the safest option and easiest on the gun but tales of a damascus blowing out from a standard pressure factory shell being fired likely had a secondary cause behind them such as a stuck wad ,2,weekendgunnit
Wintjoin,check wall thickness if that is fine you will be fine with low pressure loads the vast majority of damascus failures were due to gross over pressure loads in the early days of smokeless or barrel obstructions did not help that post wwi manufacturers started saying damascus was unsafe in order to increase sales of the now much cheaper fluid steel barrels check into the research of sherman bell in the double gun journal ,3,weekendgunnit
