tallwheel,i would like to think so the larger problem is that as companies get larger they almost always tend to become less efficient the people closer to the bottom in management who make the seemingly small decisions regarding who to hire or what kind of chairs to buy are further removed from the money so they waste it on stupid shit the company does not really need hell the company paying right same thing happens with diversity the company can afford to have some employees who do not pull their weight so they continue operating despite wasting money on sub optimal employees ,3,TheRedPill

tallwheel,even the 60 can often have what feels like obligation free sex at the start of an exciting new relationship but it will usually become gradually more transactional as the relationship plays out she realizes she can use sex to get what she wants from him he goes into pussy pleasing mode and becomes desperate to keep her happy so that the sex does not dry up it what happens in the vast majority of relationships for the typical beta male ,2,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel, but it does not mean we should say this female strategy is great because i get a lot of cheating whores no one is saying that this is why you and others are misunderstanding the post the only level you are capable of understanding on is either women bad or women good it not about good or bad ,1,TheRedPill

tallwheel,of course she will women do not necessarily do what they say they will say they do not like studs who fuck around a lot but we all know they will still fuck them anyway if they are attracted to them ,1,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,it goes without saying and i am sure you do not need anyone to tell you but you should have broken up the moment you learned of her cheating at least next time you will know better than to ever give a cheater a second chance ,5,TheRedPill
tallwheel, think of it this way a women enraptured with a man does not even see other men while a man similarly transfixed will still want to fuck everything he sees so whose love is deeper that very true the difference is that a man can still be attracted to other women while continuing to love his original woman a woman cannot when she finds another her love for the previous man pretty much dries completely up so it a tradeoff which is deeper i do not know ,1,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,hmm corrupted politician vs complete retard actually not sure which is worse ,1,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,this really feels like it is not intended for me it intended for some insecure guy you have in your head why do not you go find him and send it to him the above sounds a lot like just a bunch of typical shaming of guys acting in their own best interest to me though to paraphrase your shaming man up and marry a slut what are you afraid of are you insecure you are trying to get men to act in women best interest not their own ,0,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel, believing that all women are out to cheat on betas with alphas is just not realistic at all not all will but all women married to betas will have a desire to fuck alphas it all a question of whether she can control that desire or not some can but in our current society women are pretty much told that they do not have to control it bottom line from a man perspective being a beta in a relationship to an attractive woman is not a safe bet if you want sexual loyalty ,1,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel, also develop a drug maybe mixed in with bc or something that would significantly increase womens thirst we need to figure out how to make women want most men like men want most women lol this would fix so much of the imbalance imagine if on a thirsty night big beta bob dick would start to sound awfully tempting to a higher smv woman then women would finally know what it like to be a guy ,1,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,sounds like enjoying the decline to me enjoy the decline ,3,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel, the fact that you feel you cannot measure up to a woman prior partners is sad dude that not the reason i do not want to partner up with a slut i will gladly fuck them if i was afraid of measuring up why would i be willing to fuck them would not i be afraid of doing that your argument makes no sense you just want to believe that we are insecure you need to believe that ,2,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,ok let me spell it out for you in the exchange above we were talking about two different mating strategies for women you were referring to the alpha fucks strategy woman wants an exciting alpha and i was referring to the bet bucks strategy woman wants a stable beta to marry in my comment above that what you brought up is the alpha bucks fantasy woman wants an alpha she can tame into a loyal provider bringing this up really just confuses my original argument which was simply that women will also often verball complain about men who sleep around too much but yeah they will still fuck them anyway ,1,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,those men are acting in their best interest society allows them to have a job and enjoy their childish hobbies and they can still get a gf if they are decent looking so why would they grow up when they know it just going to make life less enjoyable for them why would any man want a marriage and children that could just be taken away at any time and which would just mean more work and responsibility for him when he could just continue being a dude with a gf who also loves to drink and play video games of course he will continue to do what is best for himself and his interests and when guys interests do not serve women and children and society shaming articles like this one are the predictable response ,3,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,no one has ever claimed that all men accept all sexual advances from all women the difference is not only that men are more willing to have sex with lower smv women it is also that even when men refuse the offer they still do not feel as off put as women do when doing the same for women an unattractive man making an advance is creepy and threatening and borderline rapey even sometimes for a man an unattractive woman making unwanted advances can still be kind of flattering at worst it is funny or kind of annoying at the absolute worst that is the important difference imo ,2,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel, sigh have you not heard of the dual mating strategy sure it possible that a slut may become a faithful partner but it about as likely as a stud being transformed into one women love that fantasy we know but it a fantasy for a reason studs are not likely to settle down with one women without cheating on the side ,2,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,it simple the current smp is better for chads the old smp was better for beta bobs ,1,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,women say the exact same things about studs you know it not rocket science that a man or woman who likes to sleep around is probably not that likely to be a faithful partner ,4,PurplePillDebate

tallwheel,how could anyone know that for sure without experiencing it not sure whether i would prefer to be a woman back then constantly pregnant working on the farm keeping the house and raising kids or a man doing back breaking labor in the field or in a mine or on a battlefield all day both sound pretty damn awful to me but both were essential roles and neither could have existed without the other both roles existed not because men subjugated women but because of biological reality it was the most efficient and logical way to live in the harsh environment they were in at the time you can either adopt a nuanced view like mine or just keep on harping about how men were assholes and subjugated women throughout history just because they were big bullies and hated women ,2,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel, what difference does it make if someone does something 8 hours at a time vs doing 4 hours during the day and 4 hours in the evening that would be assuming that women can do the same amount of physical labor as men if they just split it into separate intervals which they cannot there were condoms the rhythm method and the pull out method there were also alternative medicines that the mainstream medical establishment tried to discredit while they sold their quack mercury and antimony cures sure so some contraception methods did exist but obviously not as reliable as what we have now that has no affect on my point that poor families usually gave birth to a lot of babies and many of them died in infancy most adult women were pregnant damn near most of the time even if they could do physical labor throughout most of the pregnancy it would severely diminish their stamina and ability to do so no way for them to compete with men in the physical labor market ,1,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel, most jobs were not hard physical labor historically false this should be patently obvious women also worked on things like farms you could milk cows pick crops plant seeds and stuff as a woman of course they did historically women worked their asses off and had to do whatever they could but again men could do all of those jobs too and many of them picking crops planting seeds they could do better and for longer intervals of time without rest another reality of the past that many fail to realize is that most women of a fertile age were almost constantly pregnant with no birth control and the infant mortality rate most families needed to have lots of babies in order to ensure that any of them would even survive to help out on the farm pregnancy was not a temporary state that a woman would experience 0 3 times in her life like today most women could expect to be pregnant throughout much of their adult life and this would constantly interrupt their ability to work ,1,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,you seem to have a hard time getting your head around a simple concept 1 women bodies are less well suited for physical labor than men 2 throughout most of history the majority of but not all jobs were hard physical labor,1,PurplePillDebate

tallwheel,this is not registering within my sphere of empathy ,1,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,throughout most of history the number of women who could be employed in such jobs or even make ends meet selling things they made on their own was limited that why most chose to get married financial support and protection in exchange for reproductive capability duh many women worked in the factories during the industrial revolution and they should have been paid far better wages it was a crime they were not ah yes women have always earned less and it all because of muh discrimination right it was mostly because of economic realities what percentage of the other jobs available were those women capable of doing construction mining they made less because they had less options factory owners could get them to work for them without having to pay more ,2,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,well yeah it was most women were not capable of financially supporting themselves that why they could not be held legally responsible for loans and property liability they needed a husband to take that responsibility for them in that environment yes women outside from a few outliers who were very enterprising and never bore children were incapable of this ,4,PurplePillDebate

tallwheel, if someone paralyzed you on purpose no one paralyzed women on purpose they were born that way in those times women needed real protection because they were physically weaker and especially vulnerable while pregnant the majority of people needed to physically abuse their bodies in order to make a living and few women could get by on their own those who could get by on their 150 iq were a lucky few even if they really did really have a 150 iq no women were not kept down by men throughout most of history women were kept down by their biology which was not suited to survival on one own in an environment harsher than the one we live in now ,7,PurplePillDebate

tallwheel,oh excuse me for not mentioning behavior along with looks and money my bad did not mean to imply that behavior is not important too now go find some other post to nitpick hotshit ,2,MGTOW
tallwheel,sounds like a shitload of assumptions to me i cannot speak for everyone here but i am very happy with my life and it has only improved since finding mgtow technically i am not mgtow anymore since i now live with a gf but i still lurk here and try to live by the mgtow mentality i am not bitter about women and do not hate them i live with one marriage and children are very much off the table though and if she ever does anything to make my life worse than it would be as a bachelor she gone immediately would be very happy to live as a bachelor again but i am pretty happy now as well mgtow has gotten rid of my former problems with oneitis and has taught me that singledom is nothing to fear changed my life for the better hope you can learn to see the positive in mgtow as well all i can see now is someone being negative and bitter and that someone is you not us ,5,MGTOW
tallwheel,meh i am probably a fairly attractive dude some women do check me out but it nothing compared to the attention that attractive women get guys are still expected to do the approaching and even attractive guys often get rejected when they do for various reasons even attractive guys still have to deal with the reproductive reality that eggs are more valuable than sperm it just not the same only way a guy is getting a harem is if he is top 5 alpha attractiveness or is fucking loaded ,2,MGTOW
tallwheel,so your problem in your original post above was that someone was making assumptions about the woman in the op which i do not think he really was since he said they not she btw and you respond by making assumptions about all the men here in this subreddit do you not recognize the irony in that at all ,5,MGTOW

tallwheel,true popful mail sounds fine on sfc no idea what happened with ys v ,1,Falcom
tallwheel,favorite ys iv the dawn of ys for the music and overall nostalgia factor least favorite ys v was too different from previous ys games in its time did not feel like an ys game and the music arrangement does not sound especially good on the super famicom ,3,Falcom
tallwheel,i would only really recommend it if you understand japanese and can play the originals by falcom on either pc 98 or windows the graphics and music are beautiful i personally think that iii and v are kind of strange rpg they are so light on battle and dungeons that it seems almost comical at times i recall a big build up to entering a cave to obtain an item in v only to find that the cave is literally one room with a treasure box and nothing to explore lol only in the last dungeon or so do either of these actually feel like traditional rpg you pretty much literally just waltz through the game while enjoying the story graphics and music luckily since they are so good i still consider both of them to be quality games for me at least iv is the odd one out of the bunch it heavier on battle and dungeons so it feels more like a normal rpg though the graphics music and story are still just as good as iii and v it my personal favorite of the three especially the pc 98 version the windows version was changed a lot and served as the basis for the psp version both the pc 98 and windows version of iv are worth playing through since they are so different from each other ,3,Falcom
tallwheel,coffee has actually been great for weight loss for me i do intermittent fasting from 9pm to 1pm the next day every day the only thing i have for breakfast is black coffee satisfies me a bit since i enjoy coffee for some reason i have very little trouble making it to 1pm even without bullet proofing my coffee the caffeine can supposedly speed up your metabolism too not to mention that lots of people on this forum have recommended caffeine for productivity at work sometimes taken with theanine ,13,TheRedPill

tallwheel,depends on what you mean by install you mean your phone is still in factory state with locked bootloader then you are probably going to need usb in order to get there but it completely depends on your phone and the available methods to unlock the bootloader and install twrp if you are already unlocked and have twrp then it simple just download the rom directly to your phone use wifi or bluetooth or whatever to get the rom on your internal storage wipe your phone and flash ,1,LineageOS
tallwheel,try flashing miui with zcx twrp or any version of twrp that automatically patches the boot img cofface twrp safe twrp alka twrp like another user said it might not work but it worth a try make sure you take a full backup before you do anything and keep a copy somewhere other than the phone if it does not work then do the edl method ,1,Xiaomi
tallwheel,i am sure some do sometimes here what i do not see about your point and i see people trying to make the same point as you about mgtow all the time btw what would you expect people to talk about on a mgtow forum if not women the whole idea of mgtow is men living without women how can we talk about that without talking about women you want us to talk about self improvement hiking cycling instead i do see these things mentioned here from time to time by mgtow who happen to like these things but the reason there is not that much discussion about these things is that there are already better forums about those things out there if someone wants to talk about hiking with other people who like hiking then of course they go to r hiking and talk about it there mgtow are people and of course they all have various interests and hobbies besides complaining about women you just do not see them talking about those other things here because this forum is about men who are fed up with women and want to live without them complaining about women is on topic here ,1,MGTOW
tallwheel, it obvious they want a man woman but their standards are unrealistic or unattainable they may think they want a man woman but people quickly forget the reality of what having a relationship is like many people will be much happier on their own and it is a real shame that we all feel pressure to have a partner and start a family from society mgtow and women separatists exist because people need to be taught that they do not necessarily need to be in a relationship to be happy sure some people are intraverts and probably would be better off in a relationship but lots of other people are not besides marriage is pretty much broken as an institution in western society many men fail to understand this and it is for their own good that they do ,1,MGTOW
tallwheel,i am perfectly fine with women who want to avoid men actually if that what makes them happy then more power to them if they want to have a forum where they talk about how much men suck and all the bad experiences they have had with them fine i have seen a few forums like that never been to an aa meeting so i can only imagine from what i can see on the subreddit they talk a lot about how alcohol has negatively affected their lives and share stories as well as talk about what they are doing positive now in their lives i am sure if there were more articles and memes talking about how much alcohol sucks they would be sharing those too they are really not so different from us ,1,MGTOW
tallwheel,agreed even natural alphas and top 5 ers cannot always get 10 without at least having some game most of them do naturally though since they are used to lots of attention from women this can red pill them to some extent ,1,MGTOW
tallwheel,thus mgtow ftw ,1,MGTOW
tallwheel,blazing world is great for a regular and can be amazing if fresh any of their ipa are great try orderville or city of the sun if you can get them their new pale ale dymaxion is great too and if you want something dark and thick monster park is solid especially the barrel aged versions one of my favorite breweries for sure ,2,beerwithaview
tallwheel,this idea that they are angry because trp does not work is a weird idea you just came up with i have never heard this theory before and i think it is bullshit most of them seek trp in the first place because they are angry and frustrated with women so even if trp makes them angry it not much of a loss for them i think if you asked them almost all of them would answer that they are more happy after they found trp there is definitely a case to be made that the anger phase can make newbies more angry at first after finding trp but i would still argue that they are better off at least they understand better why they have been having problems with women give them time and most of them will be happier they will either become more sexually successful or give up and be mgtow they are better off that way imo though you will no doubt disagree ,1,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,well for one thing obsessing about a particular person is certainly different than obsessing about an entire sex but i should not really need to point that out i often explain it this way mgtow is a support group for guys who have had problems with women just like alcoholics anonymous is a support group for people who have had problems with alcohol would you blame aa for talking about alcohol all the time i mean jeez those aa losers say they are totally done with alcohol and yet that all they talk about they are totally obsessed with alcohol where are all the real aa members who do cool stuff and not care about alcohol instead of fake aa members who only complain about alcohol s,1,MGTOW
tallwheel,well if you have not heard that one before then you have obviously never been to trp ,2,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,oh yes they are totally angry because what they learned on trp does not work it could not possibly be because they spent years trying to attract women the way the bp world told them and it did not work for them nope could not possibly be that using trp made them angry and this anger makes them gravitate more toward trp which makes them more angry it a total circle of anger s,2,PurplePillDebate

tallwheel,cannot really relate much i usually like fapping to nice clean pink pussy but if i go without fapping for a few days i start to even be turned on by big disgusting vagina hair and meat curtains and all you probably have low testosterone levels if you go without fapping at first your testosterone goes up but if you go for too long it actually starts to go down and you start to lose the urge entirely ,0,MGTOW
tallwheel,well said i say read both mgtow and trp and take and apply whatever benefits you and your own goals while i agree that the content on trp is generally a little more useful both are full of shitposters and one time would be much better spent reading listening to the greats like rollo trp and stardusk mgtow ,1,MGTOW
tallwheel, see my latest comment on r theredpill dude telling me i had to work for a woman approval that dude was an idiot but you kind of looked idiotic too when you said you should be banging 10 instead of jacking off the dude is right to the extent that you cannot expect to bang 10 unless you are a 10 or at least a 9 yourself i agree with you that you should do it for yourself not for the women though ,1,MGTOW
tallwheel,i am glad that is working for you but it wo not for the majority of men the thirst is too real most male virgins are going to always be wondering what if at least that was my experience and i was a virgin until an age older than you are now i doubt my thirst is atypical good luck to you though my friend i hope the thirst never gets to you like it always got to me ,1,MGTOW
tallwheel,to be fair i have seen him state that even though he is married he does not recommend marriage for most men for the same reasons that we mgtow choose to avoid it ,1,MGTOW
tallwheel,congratulations you have discovered game social manipulation ,0,MGTOW
tallwheel,spoken like a natural alpha unfortunately for the vast majority of men getting laid requires effort women are the gatekeepers of sex and they do not open the gate easily unless you have something they want looks money the average chump has neither thus he cannot wet pussies the gates remain closed to him ,2,MGTOW
tallwheel, whenever you need a full drawn out battleplan to meet a chick over coffee you are not being yourself and betraying yourself by pretending to be someone you are not to be fair a more seasoned member over at trp would tell you that if you have to overthink things that much then you have probably lost already you have to be able to think and act naturally even when you are gaming a chick not acting out a script i understand your overall point and agree though have an upvote ,1,MGTOW
tallwheel,it not even a secret if you are a single guy with married friends you can see your friends complaining about their wives all the time and you can see all the life has been sucked out of them compared to how you knew them when they were single for some reason these same single guys usually look the other way find their own woman who totally not like that and proceed to make the same damn mistakes as all their married friends ,6,MGTOW

tallwheel,sounds good to me i love mgtow spaces for always reminding me of how shitty women can be when you spend so much time away from them it can be easy to forget why you broke up with your last gf or why you decided to go mgtow in the first place having the reminders here helps me to keep my resolve and to realize how lucky i am to not have to deal with a woman in my life so that i can continue to enjoy my awesome time on this earth to the fullest hope that can help you understand ,2,MGTOW

tallwheel,do not know where you are getting that i think you are misinterpreting op he was not talking about punishment either ,4,TheRedPill
tallwheel, but if she finds someone attractive who willing to do what you are not then i would not be surprised if she picked the person that is willing to satisfy more of her needs tbh like i told the other commenter i actually wish exactly that would happen if she cheated my decision would be so much easier but nope she has been super dedicated to me so far no matter how little i do for her most women actually love men who are not very invested in the relationship there is another top post right now on exactly that ,2,TheRedPill
tallwheel,a very long explanation for a very simple concept newbies if you can only remember one thing remember the title just as op said 99 of your game problems will be solved ,1,TheRedPill
tallwheel,never said anyone should punish anybody it all about your own needs and weighing the pros and cons yourself we are in agreement ,3,TheRedPill
tallwheel, if someone the woman rejects sexual advances for some personal reason such as being on her period the op is essentially arguing he can withdraw affection as a punishment because he owes her nothing sure he can withdraw affection he owes her nothing does not matter the reason the bottom line for you is whether you are satisfied or not if you are constantly adjusting your expectations in order to accommodate her needs regardless of whether these needs are legitimate or reasonable or not you are not going to be happy let take the being on her period example first of all being on one period is kind of a shitty reason to not have sex anyway lots of people in relationships have sex on their periods as long as both partners are comfortable with it so anyway for the sake of argument let say she is not she hates having sex when she on her period but the guy does not mind and wants to have sex anyway regardless of how legitimate her need to avoid sex while on her period is one person in the relationship is not having his desires met so if this is a big issue for him maybe he really should consider looking elsewhere for a woman who does not mind having sex on her period this is what society seems to discourage men from doing and what i think op was trying to get at ,3,TheRedPill
tallwheel, not my ex my current wife of more than 20 years lol whoops well excuse me there there really was not any good time to end it was there i really feel that i would not be happy married to my gf with kids though i cannot imagine myself happy that way probably not i had maybe seven women be so attached to me that i had that same thought they were all fine two stalked me later a minor inconvenience it good to hear that no matter how much rp theory one reads there always that nagging voice in your head that says that just a bunch of stuff people wrote on the internet how do you know she not different be more of an asshole be more dismissive be less tolerant of whatever you consider bad behavior since i have been reading trp for longer than i have been dating her of course i have done this in fact this is closer to what i was doing early in the relationship predictably that sort of behavior just makes her more addicted to me and my attention so i have also tried to beta myself out of the relationship act needy and nerdy unfortunately this is pretty hard to do initially she seems to like it i have never been able to follow through with it long enough before i get tired of doing it and start accidentally being an asshole again when i feel like it i suppose the fact that i am even trying to beta myself out of the relationship in the first place shows that i want out so you are right there really is no way out other than to just break things off the hard way it never going to be a good time to end it i cannot quite hate her enough and i will regret it either way when i think about it logically i believe that i would probably regret breaking up with her less than i will regret not breaking up someday when i am married to her ,3,TheRedPill
tallwheel,none of what you said is wrong but i think it is still missing the most important point that i and i think op want to emphasize here that these things would not happen to men if they would just stop settling for less than what they want if you are with a person who withdraws sex as punishment then of course they are a shitty person but if you choose to play along with that person game then you are to blame as well men need to believe that they can do better and be willing to leave when a woman is playing games that they do not want to play ,6,TheRedPill
tallwheel,thanks for your advice your situation with your ex resonates with me i am also oftentimes trying to get some work done at home or lately i have been trying to do some video editing to make some quality youtube videos but she demands attention and quickly starts to feel sad and lonely while i am doing things which do not include her i was going to suggest just spending more time away from her which was my solution but if you do that she may very well find somebody else to hug and kiss and whatever else i would actually be sort of happy if she did that that would make the decision to break up so much easier it would also be nice to know she has someone else to give her attention when i am gone right now she so attached to me i would be worried that if i broke up she would go kill herself or at least be a total wreck for quite a while afterward ,2,TheRedPill
tallwheel,my situation is that i am getting all the sex i want however the amount of attention and affection my gf demands is more than i am usually willing to give she has some serious abandonment issues and demands constant hugging kissing and attention in the end the relationship is not satisfying for me if i feel the amount of attention i am giving is not worth the sex i am getting the relationship is not reciprocal if i feel there is not a balance between each other needs i have felt for a while that i should end it on the other hand i cannot help that feel like i might be throwing away the best thing of my life i have never had a woman who worships me to this extent she cooks and cleans too ,9,TheRedPill
tallwheel,if that what you want in a relationship then that fine for you the majority of men get into a relationship with the expectation that there will be sex if a man is not getting what he wants out of a relationship then he is wasting his time and commitment in a relationship which is not satisfying him our bp conditioning is telling us things like you should wait to have sex be a good friend first sex will happen when you are both ready these are precisely the messages which are causing men to do the right thing s and put a bunch of effort into a relationship that is not going to give them what they want men as a whole need to begin demanding what they really want and not accepting any less this is what trp is all about ,7,TheRedPill

tallwheel,yeah maybe true i have not listened to it in a while but i recall hearing more of the style of the first album still remaining on the second though it was definitely a lot more poppy when i heard the ep and meliora though it felt like the band from the first album was just gone ,1,Metal
tallwheel,i know that it sounds like that but sorry it true i liked them as a sort of a part of the nwothm movement in sweden whereas other bands were usually doing a new take on 80 metal ghost was doing 70 metal that was a good idea and it was nice to have a band filling that niche plus the costumes were genuinely spooky and interesting though maybe a bit cheesy and i really liked the songs on the first album now when you look at the 3rd album and also 2nd and the ep for that matter it is not really very 70 metal anymore like i said the music is still not bad but it lacks the cohesive idea that the first album had which was we are doing 70 metal to me anyway having that sort of cohesive theme is important once a band loses that it sounds confused to me does not make the music bad necessarily but i really like having that all out theme of we are 70 metal ,1,Metal

tallwheel, guys who neg and such or try to manipulate women into having sex with them beyond just being attractive and fun to hang out with will definitely repulse many women you should have said guys who intentionally try to neg if you pay attention you will notice alphas negging women all the time it just that they do not have to think about it they tend to treat attractive women the same way they would their little sister ,1,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,first album was pretty cool i saw them live in the early days and it their music was a lotta fun though maybe a bit lacking in originality meliora is ok imo but i miss the ghost from the earlier days ,5,Metal

tallwheel,no definitely do not do this someone on the los subreddit softbricked their phone that way that zip file is for los rr now comes with magisk preinstalled for root it is completely different from los ,1,Xiaomi
tallwheel,lots of confusion in this thread here the deal rr recently comes with magisk pre installed for root try opening the magisk manager app it should be installed if you are running one of the recent builds of rr i am hearing that you may have to enable root in developer options if magisk manager shows you are not rooted even after that try restarting magisk manager or the phone ,2,Xiaomi

tallwheel,probably mostly a kernel firmware issue if you look on xda you will notice there are phones where all the custom roms seem to stop at a certain version of android this is because there are no sources available to develop android for that phone over a certain version sure even without these sources it is still technically possible but extremely difficult ,1,LineageOS
tallwheel,there an unofficial cm12 on xda if you want otherwise if you can still return your phone you should do so and get the qualcom version it is usually labeled redmi note 3 pro by most vendors check also in the details that it says either qualcom or snapdragon ,1,LineageOS
tallwheel,this is actually not the case on a lot of phones on some it is though but yeah definitely do not try to lock the bootloader op it a bad idea ,2,LineageOS
tallwheel,why on earth would you want to lock it it wo not make the phone any more secure ,2,LineageOS
tallwheel,of course the device can read the data after boot how would it run otherwise do not worry you are safe there pretty much nothing a hacker can do without getting past the lockscreen and no a hacker cannot easily read the key from somewhere it is encrypted obviously encryption is not 100 foolproof but it would take so long to decrypt a hacker probably is not going to bother trying bottom line is encryption is working on your phone the way it is supposed to you are pretty safe ,0,LineageOS
tallwheel,go post this in some other thread this one is supposed to be about the franco kernel ,1,Xiaomi
tallwheel,why should we care i realize that this is pretty much the most popular custom kernel for all phones but this phone already has so many custom kernels already agni and radon work great ,1,Xiaomi
tallwheel,the difference between rr and cm is that rr has a lot more features and options rr basically just takes cm as a base and adds a whole bunch of features to it go with cm if you like a light simple experience rr if you like to customize everything and will be disappointed if you are missing a feature ,2,Xiaomi
tallwheel,yep it this the only way to get rid of the pin lock in twrp is to completely reformat the data partition and keep it unencrypted ,1,Xiaomi
tallwheel,honestly i have to agree add to those complaints the number of vendors who put their own rom on a phone with locked edl and you have a clusterfuck what the vendors do may not be xiaomi fault but they should know how common it is for vendors to install a shitty vendor rom and make sure users have an easy way of installing official xiaomi os ,16,Xiaomi
tallwheel,it seems that after their experience with cheaters on pokemon go nintendo has just adopted a company policy of not allowing root on any of their apps ,1,LineageOS
tallwheel,i can understand that when talking about huge breweries like rogue or brew dog but this thread is about a micro brewery a brew pub basically that has less than a hundred checkins on all their beers ,1,Untappd
tallwheel,pineappled shrimp lemoned shrimp coconutted shrimp ,1,keming

tallwheel,just have all of them over for a threesome ,5,japancirclejerk
tallwheel,maybe a firmware issue either find a zip of the latest firmware that can be flashed in twrp or return to stock before flashing ,1,LineageOS
tallwheel,it could be this check permissions in the music apps ,2,LineageOS
tallwheel,it will probably work without flashing miui in between here what i would do in this order 1 take a complete backup in twrp and store it somewhere off the phone 2 try dirty flashing to lineage 14 1 maybe wipe system before flashing make sure to also flash nougat gapps immediately after before you try booting wipe dalvik cache of course this will probably give you a bootloop but it worth a shot anyway 2 if the above gives a bootloop wipe data and system and then flash los14 1 and gapps again wipe cache dalvik this will probably work 3 you probably wo not need to do this but try flashing stock miui as a shortcut you might be able to find someone on xda who has made a firmware zip for ido which you can flash in twrp this will do the same thing and is much faster than flashing miui then try wiping and flashing los again ,2,LineageOS
tallwheel,just go into advanced wipe in twrp and wipe system before flashing an older build it will probably work if it boots you might get some slight disagreement from your data partition at worst minor issues can usually be fixed by reinstalling the apps giving you issues ,2,LineageOS
tallwheel,nope mine got revoked twice once after never using it for a few months then i reapplied and was approved again unlocked my redmi 4 prime then after about another month or so my unlock permission was revoked again ,1,Xiaomi
tallwheel,probably go with rr or nitrogen both have the camera fix incorporated while apparently los does not yet it says in the xda thread that los will have the fix next weekly update personally i am using slim 7 1 and i think the latest update finally works great camera fixes incorporated and all slim is very unpopular right now over some controversy that happened with their theming engine i do not care about that though i am happy with the current build as for flashing instructions go to advanced wipe in twrp wipe only system and data then flash the rom and wipe dalvik and cache you wo not lose your photos videos music etc but will have to redo all your apps and settings ,1,Xiaomi
tallwheel,you might want to if you are moving from mm to nougat if you are already on nougat then no you will probably be fine just wiping system and data and flashing rr you can go ahead and flash firmware though if the dev recommends it personally i usually do not bother updating firmware if the one i am already using is working fine newer is not always better there was one version of the rn3p firmware recently that caused serious bugs lots of people regretted updating ,1,Xiaomi

tallwheel,i agree that elliot probably would have fit in and liked that sub a lot more than this one when he was alive ,1,MensRights
tallwheel,for me the answer is somewhere in between these two opinions like you i use untappd mostly as a personal record for myself but still i think u tito1490 is also right that it kind of a dick move to give a perfectly reasonable sour a 0 25 just because you do not happen to like sours personally if i had a weizen which i am not a fan of and it just tasted like a completely run of the mill weizen to me i would give it an average rating and move on unless i tasted something really offensively wrong about it ,1,Untappd
tallwheel,i kind of agree i would not call it abusive so much as just the brewery making themselves look really petty and annoying disrespectful maybe for pestering someone about their honest opinions on their beer ,3,Untappd

tallwheel,that was exactly the point you just failed to prove i just explained why above ,1,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,just my recommendation but try magisk instead of supersu it a much more modern root app it allows you to easily hide root you can even pass safetynet with it installed so you may even be able to use android pay pokemon go and mario run magisk is getting a lot of new fans lately i used to be a supersu fan but the development passed to a new dev a couple years ago and it not open source anymore ,1,Xiaomi

tallwheel,i can understand why this thread is getting downvoted but honestly i think there is a kernel of truth to it the more attracted a woman is to a man the more she will want to feel his bare skin against her inner walls this is a humblebrag but yes i have had hookups beg me take off the condom please take off the condom ,2,PurplePillDebate

tallwheel,well i do not personally own an se kate but i have always directed kate users to this text below from xda forums regarding flashing custom roms to kate roms and kernels for kenzo are working on kate you may have to flash the non hlos bin from a rom for kate the non hlos bin file should be located inside a miui rom in the firmware update folder just extract this file and flash it with twrp otherwise i have extracted the file from the miui v8 0 4 0 mhrmidg rom for kate source http en miui com download 301 html 449 download https app box com s jntyjt8pam5375bvm7qxuoapkv53u6ys if you stay on cm aosp caf based roms you have to do this just once regarding your second question yes you can make a twrp backup of miui before you flash a custom rom and it is absolutely recommended yes you should be able to restore it ,1,Xiaomi

tallwheel,of course that is true but again that is not what we are talking about here ,1,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,will this optimize my rom ,5,xdacirclejerk
tallwheel,1 and 2 are false 3 is kind of a grey area it fine for attractive guys to be nice but they still have to demonstrate high value and not be so nice that it is supplicating the main point i disagree on is that ugly girls cannot be more attractive by being nicer i believe they can they may not ever be hot but they have a better chance of attracting a guy by smiling and being nice than they do being a bitch you are just trying too hard here to defend a viewpoint that is clearly inaccurate ,1,PurplePillDebate

tallwheel,that not entirely accurate when they launched pokemon go soon after they incorporated a way to block gps spoofing so the next thing cheaters did was used xposed to hide gps spoofing eventually they just changed pokemon go to not run on rooted devices at all so yes for a while root privileges did give an advantage ,5,LineageOS

tallwheel,do not try to gloss over the difference by claiming it is the same men and women are a little different dear men are viscerally attracted to nice girls they will accept them either for sex or relationships if that what they are looking for because nice girls are always preferable the only thing stopping men from banging nice girls is the fact that nice girls are not as sexually available as bad girls the same is not true for the type of men women are attracted to at all tl dr not the same ,3,PurplePillDebate

tallwheel,netflix could just download the quarters from the box silly ,1,RetroFuturism

tallwheel,wtf i think you replied to the wrong comment ,3,pussypassdenied
tallwheel,do not ask me why lineage su does not have those things i am not a dev you do not need the app because the app does not work with lineage os su addon it for people using supersu not the lineage su addon they are two different things anyway what i would recommend you do is reinstall los without the su addon then install magisk instead of the los addon or supersu magisk has the features you want and is a much more modern approach to root access it can even hide root on some devices best of all it usually works fine with los without the los su addon installed supersu is no longer recommended by most flashers nowadays it was taken over by a new dev in china and it is no longer open source for that reason most recommend not using it anymore ,2,LineageOS
tallwheel,in case the other folks replying did not make it clear enough here what you did wrong the su addon on the los site actually has nothing to do with the separate app and binaries known as supersu made by a chinese dev for los you just want the official los su addon and nothing more the supersu app actually has nothing to do with the su addon for los you do not need the app for anything and worse yet the app will detect that you do not have supersu installed because you have the los addon not their version and ask you to download the binaries for theirs downloading this will cause problems as it clearly did for you the only way to fix your phone now without restoring a twrp backup is the method that u titokhan explained in his first reply ,1,LineageOS
tallwheel,you mean ex gf ,2,Xiaomi
tallwheel,yes it possible but not recommended it can cause all kinds of problems most people in the rom flashing community strongly advise against re locking bootloader i think what you want in order to prevent theft is encryption not a locked bootloader find the encryption option in lineage os you wo not be able to mess with the phone even in twrp without the encryption password ,1,Xiaomi
tallwheel,there are other official roms besides lineage look for the thread titles which contain official on xda resurrection remix and nitrogen os are two of the most popular ones for this phone besides lineage they are both a bit more feature rich than lineage ,2,Xiaomi
tallwheel,unofficial resurrection remix mm runs quite well on this phone for me most seem to prefer the unofficial lineage mm build though i use rr for the features like slimrecents you might get better performance battery on a different rom the source code for this phone was just recently released so you might want to wait until development for this phone picks up and we get original nougat roms instead of just the marshmallow ports available now ,6,Xiaomi

tallwheel,you are using miui now honestly nothing gives better battery life than miui all custom roms drain the battery faster you will get about 3 4 of the battery life on any custom rom but it worth it to me i have seen people reporting battery improvement with custom roms over miui but they are definitely either imagining it or they are full of shit miui always gives best battery ,3,Xiaomi
tallwheel,that not really a nougat issue though it an issue with kenzo custom roms in general lots of mm roms for kenzo do not support goodix either for now there is a goodix patch which i hear works on most nougat roms if installed correctly there are also roms like nitrogen os which support goodix by default honestly i do not think this is an issue that will ever be fully fixed goodix users are always going to have to take extra considerations to make sure their fp works in custom roms unfortunately ,6,Xiaomi
tallwheel,yep just saw it working great for me in slim 7 1 for people who do not want to have to flash this themselves do not worry new builds of nougat roms will come with this from now on give it a week and almost every nougat rom will have it in the latest version nougat is damn near perfect now on this phone if you ask me all those who stuck with mm due to the camera issues time to think about making the jump to nougat only thing missing as one user pointed out is xposed and this is because xposed still does not support nougat in general so if you need xposed then maybe you still have a good reason to stick with mm i assume xposed for nougat should be on the way soon though ,1,Xiaomi
tallwheel,and that an issue with xposed not this device specifically hell kenzo nougat is damn near perfect now if you ask me ,3,Xiaomi

tallwheel,want my advice do not do it i was in your position and i went ahead and moved in with her i had the exact same hesitations that you do that i would lose my time alone and the freedom to do whatever i want with my time at home everything i thought would happen came to pass no matter how much you try to keep things the same to insist on your alone time or to do whatever you want living with another person is just different you can do what you want but you will always have to worry about the other person needs and how it will affect them to some extent for example even if your gf is not very emotionally needy and demanding of your attention you will still need to consider things like sleeping time you cannot watch tv into the night if it will keep her up also food and mealtimes are something that will be hard to get away from coordinating together the fact that she has a problem with you drinking another beer or playing video games is a giant red flag for me my gf is bored by video games too i just spent a sizeable portion of yesterday playing games and even though she cannot make me stop she made it very clear through her actions that she wanted me to quit and do something with her the whole time living with another person is great for most people we are social animals after all but there are also plenty of people like us who value our alone time too much to give it up i think the whole idea of living with a significant other is way overrated you do not need to feel bad about living alone indefinitely if that what makes you happy maybe this is grass is always greener talking here but i will probably move back into my own place again someday and i will just live alone for the rest of my life i just prefer it that way i will still date but no more cohabitation and definitely no marriage ever ,1,confession

tallwheel, this and the waw effect stem from the same belief that women should be chaste kind angels who could do no wrong yes of course this is true when a female ceo has a temper tantrum people say bitch this is a common feminist and bp talking point and i am saying that it is incorrect this post should really make you question that belief like i said i do not think that belief is accurate anymore we now have the you go girl mentality to counter the bitch reaction so nowadays it is often the reverse of what you are claiming and again if you do not believe me just look at the experiment done in op the results seem to show the opposite of what you are saying a real life election spans more than a year of campaigning it different well yeah obviously this is the best one can do in an experiment and the fact that the results show the opposite of what a lot of people like yourself assumed says a lot of course i would love to see what a full election between a bitchy woman and a smug man would look like though i think the result would surprise you and your naive bp world view a lot ,1,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,this is a brilliant experiment and i hope the author goes through with the full production and puts it on youtube so that we can all experience it fully i could have easily predicted the outcome the waw effect was in full force for hillary if she were a male she never would have gotten as far as she did female trump would have done even better than male trump nobody would even bat an eye at some old recording of her bragging about grabbing guys in the dick and lots of people like or at least tolerate aggressive women this just goes to show you how blue pill the authors of this experiment and most of the audience were hillary lost because of sexism well i am fucking glad they decided to test it and find out watching the results unfold should have been a giant red pill for all of them i hope they damn well rethought their assumptions about gender hell yes women can get away with a lot more than men can the blue pill is strong medicine that blinds everyone to this obvious truth ,3,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,i agree on 2 1 ehhhhh there are plenty of male politicians dumb enough to do what hillary did ,1,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,nah if she were a man i think she would have lost by even more all the guaranteed votes she got from people who voted for her just because she was the first woman many of those would probably not have voted or voted for the opponent instead and as this stage experiment demonstrates a lot of people would have disliked clinton personality even more if she were a man ,1,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,well i guess what we can at least say is that it does not appear that their bias skewed the result they way they were expecting very much guess they did a pretty good job of being neutral ,1,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,got her in the door but image wise nah most liberals did not want to vote for someone born into privilege i think if she had been from the ghetto and had worked her way up somehow that probably would have played better but yeah such people rarely get to the point where they can be a presidential candidate so it kinda a moot point i guess ,2,PurplePillDebate

tallwheel,it sounds like the reactions people had to the performance disprove all of the suppositions you make above hopefully the creator will go ahead with making the more full fledged production available on youtube so that you can experience your own reactions for yourself also you are trying to use the women as wonderful effect in reverse it does not work like that people see women as more wonderful even when they are asshats it does not mean that women are expected to always smile and be wonderful though the majority of people say that as well that not what waw is i find that nowadays even when women do not smile and be pleasant people general accept them it not the 1800 anymore people are even less accepting of men who do not smile and are unpleasant and that exactly what waw is waw is correct you are incorrect ,1,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,but there is so much more they could still do with the modern day story they could have at least tried introduce an interesting new protagonist give us a reason why what he does matters give us chances to find out more about the first civilization give us more insight about why desmond had to die and maybe even bring him back in some capacity if it was done well i would play it and i am sure i would be intrigued instead it seems they just gave up they listened to fans who did not like the modern day parts and turned it into an uninteresting scenario where you are basically a faceless employee at a game company and the animus and its incredible experiences are nothing more than a game that pretty much anyone in the world can play rather than the unique and rare experience that desmond had discovering the memories of his ancestors and from unity on they turned it into even worse than that short cut scenes that do essentially nothing to advance the story and are hardly even interesting to the same people who were intrigued by the modern day story in the early games rather than striking a happy medium they just fucked it up and made it meaningless and then fucked it up more and made it even more meaningless i agree to an extent that it is hard to keep a series interesting after the honeymoon phase but it could have and can still be done it not that ubisoft literally could not it that they did not even try ,8,assassinscreed

tallwheel,well if you consider yourself an mra then i am happy to have you on the team because we need all the help we can get i see where you are coming from but imo you are expecting too much from reddit in general people go to reddit mostly for entertainment not genuine activism is the feminism subreddit focused on activism i would say not it a place to share news stories related to women rights at best that all one can really expect after all that what reddit was originally designed for i think you do men rights no favors by just continuing to propagate the idea that mra are just a bunch of woman haters on the internet i know what your comeback here would and should be that we are doing that to ourselves by posting this kind of shit here but look wtf do you expect it a subreddit fucking highschool kids come on here to burn time as well as middle aged guys in the middle of custody battles who are desperately looking for help i honestly think the current subreddit is about the best we could hope for in the current climate men rights has made a lot of progress within the last 5 years but we are still very much in the awareness building stage even having a sub full of kids posting memes is better than having a near dead sub of adults focusing exclusively on serious activism you say this makes us look like a bunch of manbabies who do not have serious problems to who to people who see this sub occasionally reach r all and other onlookers like yourself fine but imo if we can at least reach some of those young men and bored adult men who come here to kill time that men have serious issues worth considering then we are making progress we need more people especially young people who question the common blue pill narrative of the world so imo this subreddit is doing it job just like it always has i have been here for years and it really has not changed much it great that men rights has a sub that is popular enough to even reach r all every once in a while i am happy about that if you want to just keep pointing haha look at all the misogynist manbabies then fine you have plenty of people who will agree with you but imo you are not helping men rights you are hindering that is where we will have to disagree ,2,MensRights

tallwheel,is not that because the google play store sees you have an s3 and then assumes you are running the stock os which was only updated to a much older version of android i had this issue sometimes when using an older phone with latest cm too only way to get around it is to edit the build prop or get an apk like the other poster said google play actually judges compatibility mostly based on your device name it mostly does not care the actual version of android you are running ,1,LineageOS

tallwheel,you should definitely try a newer version of twrp in fact that the first thing i would try https dl twrp me d2spr twrp 3 0 2 0 d2spr img tar html you can flash the new twrp either in fastboot fastboot flash recovery filename or by going to install in your current twrp choosing the img file extracted from the above tar and then choosing to flash it to recovery ,1,LineageOS

tallwheel,those instructions look pretty good just a couple things 1 which version of twrp are you using 2 yes you should flash gapps immediately after flashing the rom without booting in between the gapps you want are arm 7 1 you can choose which variant depending on the amount of google apps you want 3 make sure that you are going into advanced wipe and wiping everything except internal storage every time before you try to flash a new rom ,1,LineageOS
tallwheel,i had this issue recently additionally my music player was sometimes skipping tracks or adjusting volume too without me pressing anything it an issue with either your headphones or the jack on your phone plugging in headphones is triggering remote features the phone thinks you are pressing buttons on a remote control on a headphone cord two ways to fix 1 uninstall or disable the google app you will lose voice assistant and all google app functionality 2 what i eventually did was give up and use different headphones does the plug on your headphones look like the one on the left or right in this pic https ae01 alicdn com kf htb1jo1rkvxxxxcwxfxxq6xxfxxxx poyatu 3 5mm universal aux replacement font b headphone b font audio cable with font b jpg look at the number of black lines the one with 3 black lines is required to have remote functionality if you get headphones without a remote that have only 2 lines then you wo not have remote but the headphones will be less likely to trigger unwanted button presses ,3,LineageOS
tallwheel,i am a xiaomi user in tokyo so i will throw in my two cents although i do not have that particular phone i have two different xiaomi phones and they both work great with docomo mvno freetel i have never used i have nifmo and dti although all three are docomo based sims the speed difference between the different mvno is enormous nifmo is super fast and dti is almost unuseably slow again no idea about freetel specifically coverage wise personally i have never had any problem with nifmo even in some incredibly remote rural areas so i would not recommend bothering with a wifi rental like the other poster said honestly you really do not know what kind of coverage you are going to get everywhere until you actually try the 3 main carriers can go no service pretty easily in ski areas too i would say it not worth it just rent the sim ,2,Xiaomi
tallwheel,by firmware do you mean the rom or the zip file which people are calling firmware slang which affects the bootloader radios etc if the latter honestly i think you should be careful i doubt the cast issue is with the firmware and lots of people seem to be bricking their phone even if the zip file has the emmc appsboot mbn removed it not very safe to flash unless you are prepared to possibly have to reflash miui in edl my personal philosophy is to not touch the bootloader if everything seems to be working okay you can try it if you want though ,2,Xiaomi
tallwheel,my understanding is that it is because there is no nougat miui for the phone so therefore there are no official camera blurbs for this phone for nougat from xiaomi therefore the custom rom devs have to improvise using bits and pieces from mm and other phones the end result in this case is not always very stable that my understanding as a frequent rom flasher who does not have any dev experience so this might not be quite technically correct ,5,Xiaomi

tallwheel,men are stronger and women are weaker women need more time off to rest men are expected to take care of themselves women are expected and encouraged to get help this is fundamental it is patently obvious that men have to shoulder a higher burden of performance in almost all areas the flip side of this for women is that that lower expectation can also keep them from reaching their full potential this is an egalitarian viewpoint not masculist if you feminists cannot even agree to simple gender balanced concepts like that then you cannot even begin to debate your only argument will always be women are oppressed and men are privileged end of story you should not even be on ppd because you are not going to win over any reds or purples with those sort of one sided views see my red flair i think it pretty clear which side is more egalitarian ,1,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel, we have strayed so far from the original topic this is not even interesting anymore agreed bye ,1,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,feminist fantasy they cherrypick a few examples where this appears to be true and then claim it is thus in all areas it is clear that men have a higher burden of performance in almost all areas this is a pretty fundamental gender difference ,1,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,lolwut show some examples i see a helluva lot more buckets tipped toward helping women issues ,1,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,people in general see men as more likely to cheat i think that pretty obvious people are more blindsided by women because they see women as being good and nice ,1,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,i have seen a very good study which shows the opposite but it appears to have been deleted honestly i think we on the rp side are at a bit of an inherent disadvantage on the research front studies that deviate from the standard narrative seem to get often get either blacklisted by google or deleted by their organizations we do at least have the study showing female teachers bias against male students though i cannot find the full text of it female teachers did on average award lower marks to boys than unidentified external examiners male teachers by contrast awarded them higher marks than external examiners https winteryknight com 2012 02 20 new study finds that female teachers give male students lower marks i think it a bit of a separate issue when we are talking about young school children though girls are thought to be better behaved and better listeners than boys it not much of a wonder that girls tend to excel at most subjects i think that we can agree though for things like physical strength and toughness more is clearly expected of boys in the vast majority of cases ,2,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,personally i think in the natural state of things gender advantages disadvantages are actually pretty balanced out even if you are right that the male advantages outweigh the female ones we have a big problem in society right now that people only recognize the male ones we have done our best to educate and legislate away as many female disadvantages as possible meanwhile men remain shouldering almost all the same disadvantages they always have this is why the mrm exists and you see a lot of men who are fed up with the current system ,1,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,all just an extension of the same concept ,2,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,first of all i am not really talking about pedastalisation specifically here anymore however yes i think pedastalization can also lead to over protection women have a higher burden of performance if they want to be treated equitably that an interesting point of view to bring up here and one i have heard from feminists but i disagree yes it is unfortunate that if you screw up at your job or take a lot of time off people might blame it on your gender however i have to contend that the burden of performance for women in general is indeed lower when you have a female coworker who is as capable and non complaining as her male peers in my experience she will be praised more heavily because of her gender just last night i was watching a youtube video of someone repairing arcade boards when i heard her high voice at first i thought it was probably a young boy or a man with a very high voice but looking closer at the channel and eventually seeing her face it was indeed a woman i must say i was very impressed to see there was a woman so knowledgeable in field that is typically more interesting to men really i was so impressed and happy to see a woman who was so skilled and knowledgeable about such a subject cause i am sexist to some extent like everybody else the overall point i was trying to make above though is that men are seen as stronger and women as weaker and both have their advantages and disadvantages if you cannot even agree to that simple concept then you are not an egalitarian you are a feminist ,1,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,argh yes i agree but that is not the point right now however it is caused by the same root issue can you not see the overall point i am trying to make ,1,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,that is a possible reaction as well and the root cause is the same take another simple example then domestic violence men are more likely to be arrested on a domestic violence call even if both the man and woman are being violent or even sometimes if the woman is the aggressor this is because men are seen as strong and women as weak in that situation clearly it is possible that being seen as weak can be advantageous really all men rights issues arises from the fact that sometimes men being seen as stronger can be a disadvantage if you cannot understand that then it is no wonder if you cannot understand the mrm me both men and women have advantages you men have all the advantages which is closer to an egalitarian viewpoint ,1,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,nowhere did i say that it is an overall tendency as are all gender expectations maybe you need to work on your reading comprehension you seem to have very black and white thinking when it comes to gender ,2,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,and as i said in the comment to the other person it does not matter which is worse in fact i agree that fgm is generally worse but all genital mutilation should be illegal in principal natural is best any form of mutilation is barbaric to me however the biggest travesty is that male genital mutilation is still considered so acceptable in developed countries that should know better ,3,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,one sided thinking again what about a situation where someone is expected to lead as a man but he would prefer not to that sucks for the man there are times when it is preferable to be a man and others when it would be preferable to be a woman both male and female privilege are real ,2,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,if you are not understanding it yet then i am not sure i can explain it to you let take an example man i feel kinda sick maybe i should go home sexist boss what is the matter you have a mancold you will be fine woman i feel kinda sick maybe i should go home sexist boss are you okay take the afternoon off maybe you should see a doctor of course this is not how bosses will always react to men and women in the above situation but the point is that people are generally more helping and caring to women who need help than they are to men you can see this in larger trends such as the criminal sentencing disparity ,2,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,cannot say how likely but the likelihood seems higher than men estimate why because you hear stories from so many men saying i never imagined she could do this to me so many do not see it coming ,1,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,i would not say they are i would say that they do however overestimate women will power and loyalty they underestimate how likely women are to actually take a better deal when they are dissatisfied and they see something much better come along ,1,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,no i agree with you on those you are missing the point you are only seeing it from one side men who have the burden of performance get insulted by being accused of acting like women who do not have as high a burden female privilege comes in when someone needs help and cannot live up to the male burden of performance to put it another way people expecting less of you because you are female is both a privilege and a curse but feminists will only acknowledge the curse part ,2,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,some people would prefer to be taken care of than always have to take charge what is so hard to understand about that even as a man there are plenty of situations where i am happy to let someone else lead you think i want to be the leader of every project i am on at work no way sometimes better to let someone else steer the ship ,3,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel, and not being insulted for being weak is nice too it goes both ways being expected to be capable male privilege having a lower burden of performance female privilege this should be like gender differences 101 instead feminists have poisoned the bp narrative so that women are pretty much always considered the victims ,1,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,one woman misogyny is another happiness some women enjoy being in a copilot position to their man who are feminists to question their preferences ,2,PurplePillDebate

tallwheel, is it do they circumsize boys in those cultures i did not know that not all of them of course but many do there are other cultures of course where the opposite is the case they circumcise men but not women i know there are countries in africa and the middle east where both male and female circumcision are practiced i actually agree that fgm is worse but i think all that really matters is that both are bad both should be outlawed natural is always best modern trends in diet and other areas have shown us that natural is usually best it is foolish to remove skin that all males are born with due to millions of years of evolution and assume that there are no negative ramifications even if the current evidence is not very strong http thecircumcisiondecision com male vs female circumcision ,1,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel, men having more rights does not mean women have to have less i and the majority of people here are reasonable and would agree 100 with this that is most of what i see when ever this sub pops up disagree the majority of posts here are not about taking women rights away at all and once again the meme in the op of this post was not actually about taking away women rights it was just to point out certain disadvantages that men currently have and what it would look like if women also had to deal with those same disadvantages the person who made it is not advocating for actually doing any of those things what they want is for men and women to be equal and in cases where women currently have an advantage of course it would be preferable to bring men up not bring women down ,1,MensRights
tallwheel,this resonated with me i think i tend to focus too much on women pleasure too i never have any trouble orgasming so it always becomes a game of pleasuring her for as long as i can resist sometimes sex goes on for over an hour but occasionally this seems to make women wonder whether there is something wrong with them that maybe they are not pleasuring me as well you are absolutely right most women want to be taken completely by a man she wants and to feel like she is so attractive that he just cannot resist but to use her for his pleasure thus it can be difficult to find the balance of pleasuring her but also making sure you are enjoying it just as much i am beginning to think that you are right women who have little trouble orgasming would be much happier for a man to just have his way with her and not worry much about her pleasure at all she will be excited and probably still have an orgasm the sex just wo not go on for as long as it otherwise could have ,2,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,they are as similar as they could possibly be do not forget that in those countries where fgm is practiced male circumcision is also typically practiced in the same rudimentary and unsanitary way also would you be more okay with fgm if it was practiced in western hospitals the same way as male circumcision is cause i would not be you cannot compare western hospital practices to traditions carried out in third world villages both are still mutilation and genital mutilation of both sexes still occurs in the latter if anything male circumcision should be considered a bigger issue because it is so commonly accepted even in places where we should know better and do away with outdated traditions ,3,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,this is completely false equivalence entitlement has nothing to do with it the issue is simply that bp men were not told the truth about how to attract women as soon as you use the word entitlement you make these bp men out to be the bad guys but the simple truth is that they just want a sexual partner and to be loved by someone every person of any sex has this same desire it what propagates our species it totally disingenuous and cruel to frame that as entitlement ,5,PurplePillDebate

tallwheel,anyone who has sexual desire for people other than their partner has a latent urge to cheat that all i was saying you may say that just because someone has desire does not mean they will cheat and i agree but the latent desire is there all that needs to happen in order for that latent desire to become a prime desire is for someone to meet the right person at the right time of course it does not always happen and i am not saying all women will cheat but yes my personal belief is that most married women will eventually have at least some urge to cheat it more visible in men since the desire for multiple sex partners is pretty much men default setting it manifests differently in women because women tend to focus on only one man at a time when a woman happens to be in a period when she is bored or upset with her husband and meets a guy who she perceives as an upgrade the conditions are prime for cheating the only thing stopping it at that point is her own will power and yes i do believe women have the capacity for will power and controlling their urges to varying extents that why it true that not all women will cheat ,1,PurplePillDebate

tallwheel,when you think about it the woman being likely to be unsatisfied by her marriage is pretty much included even in the flattering definition above notice that it calls the young flings exciting that implies that while her marriage partner may be a good man and a smarter choice he will not however be as exciting as her younger flings were it fairly common blue pill rhetoric that marriage is not necessarily supposed to be always exciting but it is that excitement that people inevitably start to miss at least occasionally after they settle down this is the beginning of the inevitable urge to cheat now we all know that not all women or men will cheat but i think it is very important for men stuck in the bluepill world to know that the urge is almost always there because so many of them are under the false impression that few women even have the urge to do that the typical rp description like the one you wrote above may be hyperbolic but this is the kind of language that tends to get men attention and make them understand of course it is an unflattering generalization of women behavior and that is the main thing that people take issue with ,3,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,no idea what you are referring to why would anyone on trp deny that the issue is about preconceived notions of race that obvious no argument there what seems to be missed on you and so many others is that the two are not mutually exclusive one can be all for speaking out against racism while still understanding the current reality of it and doing what they can to improve their lot under the current reality of the smv that what i would do if i were an indian dude in the america likewise terpers telling them to lift and would eal with it is not necessarily the same as terpers denying that racism and prejudice exists as a manosphere unificationist i see the same type of misguided claims of mutual exclusivity between trp and the mrm all the time there is no reason someone cannot be simultaneously all for changing the current social and legal situation of men mrm while also doing what they currently can to improve their own lives as men under the current conditions trp mgtow ,1,PurplePillDebate

tallwheel,no they are not available directly from google go to http opengapps org and select your desired package yep just make sure you drag the zips you are flashing to a folder you know you can find in twrp go to install find the zips on your phone install the lineage zip then the gapps zip immedately after without rebooting in between ,3,LineageOS
tallwheel,so you have already got twrp too then maybe all you need to do is 1 sync everything you can with your online accounts 2 optional take a complete backup of your phone with twrp just in case you will probably need a usb otg cable since your phone does not have the space 3 go into advanced wipe in twrp wipe data system cache dalvik make extra certain you do not wipe internal storage 4 flash the latest lineage zip and your desired gapps 5 boot up login to google make sure restore app settings from playstore is on reinstall apps ,1,LineageOS
tallwheel,it is easy to install but i do not know if it is possible to uninstall without completely wiping lineage and reinstalling can anyone answer this is there a way to unroot lineage ,2,LineageOS
tallwheel,hmm well one consideration is that it looks like in order to unlock the bootloader on the nexus 6p you need to factory reset if your bootloader is still locked you are going to have to just copy your important files manually to a pc or something using usb if you are already unlocked though you can just leave internal storage intact ,2,LineageOS
tallwheel,yeah just sync everything before you install lineage make sure you do not wipe internal storage unless it required for your bootloader unlock and do a fresh clean install of lineage with gapps make sure you have restore apps settings from playstore turned on and reinstall your apps if pokemon go is important to you then you would better give up on having root and that means you wo not be able to restore any apps or settings using titanium backup ,2,LineageOS
tallwheel,not anymore it used to work but now pokemon go will not run unless you have an os with absolutely no capability for root same goes for a lot of banking apps which is one of the main reasons lineage decided to make root a separate addon rather than being built in like it was in cm ,1,LineageOS
tallwheel,reportedly pokemon go works but only if you do not install the optional root package for lineage ,2,LineageOS
tallwheel,no an adb backup is similar to twrp both are generally used to take a complete image backup of your phone in order to restore it to the exact system state it was in before it cannot be used to move your current apps to a different rom basically titanium is the only tool that does this and only semi reliably honestly i recommend you just sync everything with google and then reinstall everything from the playstore after you install lineage things will go much smoother that way unless you have any apps that you really really need to keep your data exactly as it currently is edit sorry thought you were op this was more advice for him ,2,LineageOS
tallwheel,actually it is not supersu he is referring to there is a special zip you get from lineage which will enable the root option but do not install this if you want pokemon go to work root has nothing to do with cool effects etc root usually refers to the ability to grant apps like titanium backup root access ,2,LineageOS
tallwheel,yes ,1,LineageOS
tallwheel, 3 you just choose install from twrp and choose your backup zip that wo not do what he wants he wants to move his data across roms he should use titanium for this ,2,LineageOS
tallwheel,i assume that by backup your stuff you mean you want to keep your data currently on your phone and continue to use it in lineage if so there are a couple of considerations you do not need to wipe your photos music and other personal files in order to install lineage just make sure you do not wipe internal storage in twrp and you will still have your stuff you just need to go into advanced wipe in twrp and wipe system data cache and dalvik before installing lineage if you want to keep your apps and or settings too that is something that you cannot do in twrp across different roms titanium backup is the app you can use to do this ,2,LineageOS
tallwheel,similar thing happened with my old htc phone hope this does not happen to my redmi note 3 pro too i am a heavy headphones user inserting and removing headphones frequently seems to gradually weaken the sensor in the jack on a lot of phones ,1,Xiaomi
tallwheel,have you tried installing different drivers on the pc ,1,Xiaomi
tallwheel,probably technically illegal but everyone does it anyway kinda thing ,1,Xiaomi
tallwheel,i am glad you are happy with it would be even better though if someday it is improved to not have random reboots anymore ,1,LineageOS
tallwheel,yeah obviously so ,1,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,xda really needs to make a real redmi 4 prime forum soon it so disorganized now anyway the rr i am running is different from the one snorlax linked it by the same dev as the los which is 13 not 14 1 by the way there is a cm14 1 but it was very much a work in progress that the dev seems to have dropped and does not recommend flashing you can find the rr build i flashed on the dev server which he links in a few of his replies in the los thread on xda there no separate thread for it ,1,Xiaomi
tallwheel,i am actually not sure if that the same one or not mine is the one that is buried in the los thread on xda and is dated 20170121 runs great though edit looking closer at the thread i think it is a different build and it says it has a lot of bugs i recommend the one which i am running which i believe is by the same dev as the unofficial los for this phone you can find his rr builds on his file server which he links to in a couple of his replies in the los thread on xda ,1,Xiaomi
tallwheel,i understand but i do not think mra will get very far with that as a major platform issue if they try to argue that women need to carry a child to term when they had a prior agreement for her to do so you are just going to go up against a wall of her body her choice i do not think it realistic to demand probably why i seldom see mra arguing for this ,3,MGTOW
tallwheel, she cannot get an ltr because she not attractive enough vapid inept selfish and or vile k then should not she just be lonely and single instead of settling for casual sex with guys who do not want a relationship with her there a word most people use for women who do not value themselves and give out sex easily but it escapes my mind at the moment could you help jog my memory nothing i said about the girl that settles for being a plate because she cannot get an ltr makes her a prostitute harlot immoral dissolute dirty or slovenly k but you did say and i quote that such women are likely inferior in quality i would say that at least as bad saying some people are lower quality than others that pretty elitist are not we all supposed to be equal ,1,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel, all vendor roms are dangerous luckily you do not have one ,8,Xiaomi
tallwheel,it number 3 archaic no it should say slang this usage is clearly still in common modern use calling it archaic is wishful thinking as in people should not say this anymore it not pc lol and do not try to pretend you were going by any other definition we both know what slut means in common usage ,1,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,women aborting without the father consent is not usually considered a major mra issue i think most agree that women should be able to abort a fetus if they want to forcing a woman to carry a baby to term because the husband wants it would be pretty ridiculous course this all goes out the window if we are talking about pro lifers mra are more concerned with being held financially responsible for children they did not want the above sounds more like a strawman false flag if she serious then she should probably try becoming more familiar with men issues before organizing a march oh yeah and penis costumes are stupid too ,5,MGTOW
tallwheel,honestly i cannot believe there are still people who are okay with random reboots i only ever encountered such a thing when i had a very rare variant phone with poor dev support and had to install a shady unofficial build of cm even with that phone i eventually found a custom rom that never randomly rebooted and have never had random reboots ever again with any custom rom on any phone since then if i ever had random reboots again i would be concerned because it means something is wrong i would probably try a different kernel or do a clean flash or try a completely different rom entirely actually i do not accept random reboots anymore ,3,LineageOS
tallwheel,same difference no matter how you word it you are just saying that those women cannot get the ltr they want so they degrade themselves to accepting something less permanent that is pretty much the literal definition of slut ,1,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,as far as number of features goes the heirarchy between the three is rr nitrogen los this is assuming that lots of features is something you want though look at the features list for each rom to decide if the features are actually things you want or not if you want as light an os as possible then the opposite order would be what you want another consideration is whether you have goodix fp scanner on your rn3p or an fpc one if it goodix nitrogen might be a good choice because the dev for that rom has goodix on his device and designs the rom primarily with goodix devices in mind all other roms will require a separate patch to be flashed if you want goodix to work ,2,Xiaomi
tallwheel,resurrection remix but if i can only choose the two in your title then i guess nitrogen it has more features i want ,2,Xiaomi
tallwheel,anything that means we will be drinking more beers can only be a good thing ,2,Untappd
tallwheel,i would not call it standard procedure but it is a good idea nonetheless los has no official connection to xda obviously and i am only recommending it because xda is typically the most active device specific forum for custom roms including official los any other forum including here that has enough users who have flashed a particular build for a particular device will do ,3,LineageOS
tallwheel,i probably could have done that at 20 too but not in my 30 metabolism usually goes way down with age i was skinny as fuck and eating whatever i want until about 23 then i suddenly started ballooning if i did not make sure to limit myself ,2,MGTOW
tallwheel,unfortunately i do not remember too well since i was only on miui long enough to immediately unlock it which i already had permission for all i can say is that i do not remember anything particularly wrong with it the question here is whether your issue with the display is hardware related or not and unfortunately i could not really tell you maybe you just have a more discerning eye for color than i do ,2,Xiaomi
tallwheel,not running miui resurrection remix ,1,Xiaomi
tallwheel,xiaomi redmi 4 prime or redmi note 3 pro,2,LineageOS
tallwheel,go to the official lineage thread for your device on xda developers check if a lot of people are complaining about the latest nightly if not flash if it works well for you then stay on that nightly for a while maybe even up to a few months unless any major android vulnerabilities are found update to newer nightlies infrequently find out as much info about the stability of the particular build before each flash also backup in twrp before each flash do the above and you will be pretty safe ,2,LineageOS
tallwheel,the display looks great on mine ,3,Xiaomi
tallwheel,custom roms https forum xda developers com xiaomi redmi 3s development,3,Xiaomi
tallwheel,because it a super cheap phone that how you sell a lot of units great buy for the money of course ,3,Xiaomi
tallwheel,oh come on that is just being overly strict plenty of people in the eu are using electronics without the ce mark every day there are people right here in this sub using xiaomi phones there right now they have a similar mark for electronics which send radio signals here in japan and my xiaomi phones do not have that mark either i am using them to scramble the government radio signals now bwahahaha jk ,5,Xiaomi
tallwheel,stop dude owwwwwwwwnnnnn it you know you want to the ones that do put up with the plate spinning and do not run off they are probably the inferior in quality to the ones who ran off they are low quality because they are okay with having non committal sex or being pumped n dumped that what this means ,1,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,that source looks extremely reliable so til you are right i heard differently from a manosphere source still you are going to have a hard time convincing me to feel sorry for someone in poverty who is receiving free money from a working man merely for having a child with him if she still in poverty after receiving child support and even possibly alimony she would better figure out how to start making some money on the side or better yet go back in time and make the wise decision not to have children she cannot afford in the first place yeah i know low income birth rates etc ,1,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,elitist then why were you implying that these are the types of women who most terpers have as plates do not run away own it you were implying they are sluts ,1,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,was not meant to necessarily be addressing you personally but this does highlight one of the reasons why there are so few women in such positions ,1,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,agreed ,1,Xiaomi
tallwheel,no you are quite wrong if you think that those studies are taking child support into account there is a reason why single mothers make up such a high number of the impoverished ,3,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel, the idea that women must be wary around strange men has nothing to do with feminism you are right that this is a very old thing that was also very strongly believed in traditionalist cultures but nowadays the people who are most vocal about this issue are feminists ,1,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,that what they always say however child support is not counted as income by the government so you might want to take that into consideration a single mother receiving more than enough child support to support her and her children still counts as living in poverty ,5,PurplePillDebate
tallwheel,and women now have equal access to become any of those things and the majority of the voting public is also female so women only have themselves to blame for not holding an equal number of any of those positions if you are a woman and do not like it why not run for office ,1,PurplePillDebate

tallwheel, the spouse leaves their career reluctantly at the other urging actually stop and think about this scenario for a second and see how it 1 does not make sense and 2 is a false narrative who decided to have the kid s only two options both of them the wife unilateral decision scenario where only the husband decided to have the kid does not exist who has the ultimate decision power in deciding whether the wife quits her job or not the wife even if the husband urges or even demands that she quits her job the decision is ultimately hers even if both refuse to quit their job then they have the option of hiring daycare the narrative where mothers are the hapless victims who are driven out of their jobs against their will is one that has been propagated by such mothers for their own benefit the thing is both men and women tend to see women as having less agency female hypoagency let not do that she is very much responsible for her decisions including the decision to have children or to quit her job her husband may urge her or pressure her to go a certain way they may even have a mutual verbal agreement between each other but that does not change this in the end the stay at home mom is the one who gets to quit her job and focus on her family be supported by someone else income see her children who are nearly universally considered the most important priority to both mothers and fathers grow and have a major influence in raising them it the equivalent of being supported by one spouse while you get to start your dream job from home and if raising kids is not your dream job do not have kids or get daycare to do otherwise is damseling ,5,MensRights
tallwheel,hmmm nah it her problem now should have thought of that before starting the dream job of being a full time parent yep i am serious that it a dream job you have no boss and you get to dedicate all your time to something which you created which you desired to create and was entirely your decision to do the husband is the one who had to work to make this possible i know this may seem like a radical position but she can suffer for it now for all i care ,5,MensRights

tallwheel,kate is preferable to kenzo in canada i believe as it has one additional lte band available kate is not officially supported by lineage but there is a relatively easy process to use kenzo roms on kate the biggest issue for me with this phone is the size my kenzo does not really fit in my front pocket very well kate is actually even slightly bigger than kenzo overall still a very very good and powerful phone for the price if you are looking to save money then it a good buy regarding warranty what warranty it a cheap disposable phone if it breaks you buy a new phone ,1,LineageOS
tallwheel,read u razorloves comment in this thread this seems to be the solution ,1,LineageOS
tallwheel,you used the term root when technically what you want to do is not root but to unlock the bootloader and install lineageos root refers to having root access to the phone os there is an addon for los that will allow you to grant apps root permission that is what the above user was explaining how to do if you do not know what this does then you probably do not need it ,3,LineageOS
tallwheel,it would be fine if it always went smoothly i had no problem myself so i cannot complain but i am sick of looking at all the users on the xiaomi forum saying it not working for them they could certainly improve on the process to make it more fast and reliable ,1,LineageOS
tallwheel,you can try i wonder if the updater will even work ,2,Xiaomi
tallwheel,i currently have both and personally if i could choose to buy only one or the other today i would get the redmi 4 prime why biggest reason is size rn3p is really a larger phone than i would prefer r4p fits much better in a front pocket and still has the 1080p screen camera quality is similar on both but it seems to me in actual practice that the rn3p is maybe a tad better it negligible though i would take either rn3p may currently have better custom rom support but i am expecting the r4p to eventually have an ok selection of custom roms for it once the kernel is released rn3p will probably always have more but there will be enough on r4p to satisfy currently there are some ports of marshmallow roms available for the r4p and for me resurrection remix runs great on it it will hold me over ok until the nougat custom roms come ,4,Xiaomi

tallwheel,most of those are valid complaints but the real problem with unity is the overall flow of the game those side missions especially the nostradamus enigmas god damn the multiplayer missions were fun but they were not required and had nothing to do with the rest of the game the main missions were mostly all right i guess but something just felt off most of the time i did not like the way arno moved or leveled up say what you will about syndicate but it put lots of things back for the better the side missions may be the same laundry list of stuff to do on the map that people complained about in earlier games but at least they feel like you are making a positive progression they focused on taking control of sections of the city and i liked having that back syndicate still had a few issues i did not like but overall the game was a much more pleasant experience to play than unity and that the important thing ,3,assassinscreed

tallwheel,if she not tech savvy then leave the global rom on it it not that miui is better or worse than a custom rom it all a matter of preference people have different reasons for preferring miui or custom roms i would say maybe if she complains about any of the features or functionality of miui then maybe consider installing a custom rom for her and unless you are planning on being the permanent maintainer of the phone for her preferably you will want a custom rom that has ota updates ,3,Xiaomi
tallwheel,do not be fooled by the higher model number newer is not necessarily better especially when you are talking about xiaomi i have my rn3p and would not trade it for a rn4 if you offered it love your kate that a great phone you have got there ,3,Xiaomi

tallwheel,generally they say you should not flash a snapshot over a nightly because snapshots are based on much older nightlies than the current ones so it is like trying to downgrade which does not work well you can try it if you want but it probably best if in the meantime you stay on as old a nightly as possible as long as you are okay with the functionality of the current nightly rather than a straight on dirty flash you might want to try wiping system but not data before flashing the snapshot ,1,LineageOS

tallwheel,i am pretty certain it wo not work you can try it if you want i would wipe system completely and leave data intact before flashing if i was going to try it my best guess is you will get a bootloop you can then go back into twrp and wipe system and data and do a clean flash instead so there no harm in trying even if it boots rr settings and launcher i think are completely different so all your apps and settings should not carry over properly thus there no point in dirty flashing ,1,Xiaomi

tallwheel, this is faking something he does not have so is faking good complexion and attractive facial contours tbp does not have a philosophy i know i just changed trp to tbp there to make it more similar to the original but when it comes to looks if a woman puts on makeup she has the looks looks is what she looks like if she wears makeup she has the look that she has with makeup on same argument would work for hair pieces girdles or even extremely far out things like inflatable biceps the only difference is that makeup is considered more socially acceptable ,1,PurplePillDebate

tallwheel,yep i am familiar with that statistic thing is they also tend to spend more i have dated women who make a lot more money than i do and somehow they all seemed to have a lot more problems with money than i did they live beyond their means or at least as lavishly as they can possibly afford few think seriously about saving for the future sure this is true of plenty of young men today as well but i know far more men who are comfortable living in a cheaper place owning less things and saving for the future that is my overall impression and it also born out by statistics the fact that women tend to spend more than men is pretty well established by several studies ,1,PurplePillDebate

tallwheel,so are you saying you are able to install and boot other cusom roms not based on cm ,1,LineageOS
tallwheel,there pretty much no risk of bricking if you unlock officially i did unofficial and managed to soft brick twice once trying to do the unofficial unlock and once much later when i stupidly tried to flash firmware that relocks the bootloader both times it was fixable with miflash though the testpoint method or a deepflash cable should never be necessary on the rn3p ,1,Xiaomi
tallwheel,if no one has reported that they successfully unlocked band 4 on the phone i would not be too hopeful if you are right though it should be possible if others have managed to do it with other phones with the exact same chipset with all the minor hardware variations existing between even the same exact model of xiaomi devices i would not be too surprised if not all snapdragon 821 are exactly alike ,1,Xiaomi
tallwheel,well i have to admit i do not know everything about this either all i know is that i have owned qualcomm devices which could not support certain bands there was one htc phone i hacked to support one additional band but there was no way to unlock all the bands i needed most of which were readily accessible by other qualcomm based devices from everything i have heard you cannot just hack any device to support any band you want ,1,Xiaomi
tallwheel,it hidden in the xda forum there is not a separate thread for it i am not going to direct link it here out of respect for the dev bandwidth but you will find it on the server link from the dev of the lineage rom https forum xda developers com t redmi 4 prime i will go ahead and shoot you a pm with the direct link anyway though ,1,Xiaomi
tallwheel,my pick would have to be resurrection remix it has all the features you could possibly want i cannot live without slim recents lockscreen shortcuts and quick unlock ,1,Xiaomi
tallwheel,yeah seriously though if no one can answer your question on xda or a similar place you could probably just go ahead and try flashing it if you want most likely you will just get a bootloop and you will be able to go back into twrp and clean flash the unofficial build instead the official los zips do not affect the bootloader so it probably not going to hardbrick the phone i have tried this exact same thing with two different japanese variants of phones which had american counterparts with official cm support tried flashing the official and yep bootloop ended up having to use unofficial versions which were intended for my exact variant instead ,1,LineageOS
tallwheel,factory reset whoah whoah hold on 1 if you are all right with losing your data then there is no need to dirty flash from cm to los 2 how are you factory resetting and is a factory reset really what you want if you want to do a clean flash you need to wipe system and data in twrp before flashing be sure to also wipe cache and dalvik before first boot 3 if you do not need to keep your data from cm then you do not need the experimental build just clean flash the latest lineage build as long as you do not wipe internal memory you will still have your photos and personal files and you do not need to wipe internal memory in order to clean flash to the latest los ,3,LineageOS
tallwheel,if there a thread about the unofficial build on xda i would ask there instead ,2,LineageOS

tallwheel,i am on nougat on my rn3p and i will offer a slightly different perspective from the other posters yes nougat is pretty useable but i recently got a redmi 4 prime for my girlfriend and installed marshmallow resurrection remix on it and you know what it made me kind of realize again how stable marshmallow was the camera works every time and the mm custom roms especially rr have a lot more features many of which they have not gotten around to implementing yet on any of the nougat custom roms on the positive side for nougat multi window is much better integrated and i like the way they changed the pull down menu that might be about it actually and on the negative side there is still no end in site for the camera and torch issues everyone is waiting for the lineage developers to figure it out and then it would be merged over to all the other custom roms but they have not made any progress at all so far if i recall correctly mm roms for this phone had the camera working much better by this point i have given up on expecting the camera to work well on nougat anytime soon so while i will continue using nougat on my rn3p and up until recently i was recommending others do so now i have kind of changed my view if you really want stability and you are happy with your current rom then it might be a good idea to just stick with marshmallow for now edit oh yeah and what network speed issues i have heard a few complaining about that on official los but i am not sure if the complaints are legitimate or not i think that issue is limited to official los only i am on slim 7 and network works perfectly ,3,Xiaomi
tallwheel,most likely what he did is try to flash firmware that includes the emmc appsboot mbn like one from the strix if you use psy man firmware linked in the guide in op you wo not have this problem but people do still need to be careful that they know they cannot just flash any firmware zip out there ,2,Xiaomi

tallwheel,i dunno i was in the same position when i bought my rn3p ended up getting the 2gb model since i was in a hurry i am pretty satisfied with it but there are definitely times i wish i had the 3gb model sucks when you are in the middle of writing a post in one app and you end up having to switch to another app or two before coming back to finish writing the post only to find that the app is no longer stored in ram and resets back to the startup flash screen and your post is gone some apps have built in protections to make sure your posts in progress get saved but not all ,1,Xiaomi
tallwheel,with a little tweaking it is possible to take a twrp backup of your current phone and then restore it to a new phone if it is the exact same model just need to make sure the backup folder has the right name for the new phone instead of the old one ,1,Xiaomi
tallwheel,someone may want it for parts but it probably wo not fetch you a lot of money i would still give it a go ,2,Xiaomi

tallwheel,i am pretty happy with resurrection remix marshmallow on this phone so far there are marshmallow rom ports of lineage rr mokee and sudamod hidden in the threads on xda if you know where to look ,2,Xiaomi
tallwheel,yeah same here my silver white version looks fine to me i guess i can see how it might bother someone else though ,2,Xiaomi
tallwheel,the info about these roms seems strangely well hidden learning of their existence is what threw me over the edge when i was sitting on the fence like you figured i can get by with marshmallow until the kernel is released one thing you should be careful of though is that some of the roms contain some chinese bloatware read the threads for the accounts of the people who tested the roms lineage apparently comes with some but you can uninstall them with root rr apparently does not come with any ,1,Xiaomi
tallwheel,from what i have seen so far with the phone it looks like there are lots of ways around using a deep flash cable however i am lucky that mine came with the latest global rom already installed so i never needed edl mode i was able to officially unlock on the included rom then i flashed twrp in fastboot and now i can do whatever i want ,2,Xiaomi
tallwheel,you are mostly right kernel not released so the real rom development for this phone cannot begin yet however now we do have some marshmallow rom ports from other phones made by some shady chinese developers if you go to xda there are a couple of threads about them https forum xda developers com t redmi 4 prime rom markw 6 0 1 unofficial lineage os 13 2017 01 03 for redmi 4 prime cm14 1 for redmi 4 pro welcome now we have cm13 port in those threads there are links explaining how you can download and install resurrection remix lineage os mokee and sudamod most people seem to prefer the lineage os or mokee i chose rr because it has some features i practically cannot live without so far it is honestly running great only issue might be battery life looks like it can probably go for about two days of regular use but i am sure i could do much better on miui ,2,Xiaomi
tallwheel,i have heard that actually you cannot on this phone but did not end up actually testing on mine with the original recovery you can boot into with power vol up it brings up a menu where you can select download mode this might not be the case however for phones that come with a vendor rom which luckily mine did not ,1,Xiaomi
tallwheel,mostly i am upset because most likely sexual pleasure could probably be better if it had not been done i mostly get by all right with what i have got but from what i have read it could be a little better i guess other than that it the principle of it yeah i would like my body to be natural instead of modified because of some outdated tradition i do not think about it every time i look at my junk but sometimes i do i think overall most circumcisions are not so debilitating that most guys who have had it done would ever miss their foreskin that much i think that part of the reason why male circumcision wo not seem to completely die ,2,MensRights

tallwheel,on the other hand transgender mtf is more common than ftm so while you hear more women talk about wanting to be men among people who actually take the plunge and transition it is the opposite trend also an important factor i think you need to consider is that a typical man would be completely ostracized for saying that he would prefer to be a woman no one respects a man who does not want to be a man ,3,PurplePillDebate
