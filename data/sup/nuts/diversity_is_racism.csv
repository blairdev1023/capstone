diversity_is_racism,first let us look at the original paper by garrett hardin http www garretthardinsociety org articles art tragedy of the commons html the tragedy of the commons develops in this way picture a pasture open to all it is to be expected that each herdsman will try to keep as many cattle as possible on the commons such an arrangement may work reasonably satisfactorily for centuries because tribal wars poaching and disease keep the numbers of both man and beast well below the carrying capacity of the land finally however comes the day of reckoning that is the day when the long desired goal of social stability becomes a reality at this point the inherent logic of the commons remorselessly generates tragedy as a rational being each herdsman seeks to maximize his gain explicitly or implicitly more or less consciously he asks what is the utility to me of adding one more animal to my herd this utility has one negative and one positive component 1 the positive component is a function of the increment of one animal since the herdsman receives all the proceeds from the sale of the additional animal the positive utility is nearly 1 2 the negative component is a function of the additional overgrazing created by one more animal since however the effects of overgrazing are shared by all the herdsmen the negative utility for any particular decision making herdsman is only a fraction of 1 adding together the component partial utilities the rational herdsman concludes that the only sensible course for him to pursue is to add another animal to his herd and another and another but this is the conclusion reached by each and every rational herdsman sharing a commons therein is the tragedy each man is locked into a system that compels him to increase his herd without limit in a world that is limited ruin is the destination toward which all men rush each pursuing his own best interest in a society that believes in the freedom of the commons freedom in a commons brings ruin to all my solution to this is to make sure that every resource is owned either by a responsible force or by an inert force that simply prevents its exploitation national parks are one example of the latter perhaps the best example was the european aristocracy which set aside giant hunting parks that preserved pristine forest until relatively recently when they were torn down to enable the building of more housing for the new mostly immigrant population ,1,askaconservative

diversity_is_racism, i would not be surprised if it is the opposite of that you are here to understand conservatism correct let me debunk a myth that has taken root in your mind the average iq in this country is about 100 that means that you have a few people over 120 iq points where college education or the ability to do it starts a lot of people in the middle and a few people who are too dumb to do anything but breathe the same distribution of traits applies to any ability including whatever it is that makes some people able to handle drugs and some not most people cannot handle drugs because they have poor impulse control in the first place are not as bright as william s burroughs and generally have lower willpower what you are saying is that you think a small group of people are more troublesome than normal on drugs that is a different question some people who are personal disasters are also personal disasters on drugs alcohol is legal and ingrained into our society but causes the most drug deaths and negatives to our society next to or behind tobacco use i consider this to be nonsense no amount of regression analysis can separate out whether it was the cheeseburgers the sitting on a couch for eight hours a day for thirty years or the menthol cigarettes that killed someone and as we are finding out now genetics and lifestyle including exposure to pollution matter more than habits in addition the deaths we attribute to alcohol are often exaggerated it a drug of apathy then we need to see what is causing that apathy normal people generally do not use drugs they are happy enough with beer and wine at parties or dinner but when life is futile because leftism has taken over our society and is slowly running it to ruin people turn to drugs in greater numbers i am not saying make alcohol or opiates illegal that would not work successfully why are we even having this debate in the first place let me offer this people cannot eject troublemakers from their local communities this leads us to target their habits instead of simply throwing them out we support people through social welfare and healthcare so we have an interest in who does what to their health we have a struggle with diversity which makes enemies of all groups in which having drugs illegal makes it easier to catch criminals our civilization is crumbling and so people despair and turn to drugs and drink daily life is boring and pointless so others are looking for a way to escape the tedium these are things we can fix and should before worrying about drug policy most people do not understand the true conservative view of drug use we by nature tend to be accepting that it is not the place of the law to crack down on it so long as we can eject people from our communities for any reason and that if they do drugs and run into trouble our answer is that darwin and god have both spoken and it is time to let them die most people seize on that first part and forget the rest conservatives are the party of nature including natural selection we are ok with anarchy so long as no one else bears you as a burden and we can let you die when you screw up which makes humanity more competent through natural selection ,2,askaconservative

diversity_is_racism,let see almost half of all federal revenue 47 percent comes from individual income taxes the income tax is generally progressive higher income households pay a larger share of their income in income taxes than lower income households do another 33 percent of revenue comes from payroll taxes which are assessed on the wage or salary paychecks of almost all workers and used to fund social security medicare hospital insurance and unemployment insurance by law employers and employees split the cost of payroll taxes but research has shown that employers pass their portion of the cost on to workers in the form of lower wages http www cbpp org research policy basics where do federal tax revenues come from that puts us at closer to 80 so i was off by 5 remove other government programs which make the military more expensive like affirmative action and improve other forms of government revenue such as weapons sales and this could bump us up to the 40 required to run the military ,1,askaconservative

diversity_is_racism,we have softened the death penalty to the point where it is barely even a penalty it takes twenty years after conviction to get executed in most cases if we want to avoid killing innocent people the best way to do this is to provide strong incentive for criminals to avoid killing innocent people and then to strengthen our justice system instead of sabotaging it prosecutors need to know that an overturned conviction made on dubious grounds is a career ender on the other hand we need to stop believing the leftist press who continually claims that the guilty are innocent ,1,askaconservative
diversity_is_racism,deterrence is hard to gauge because many criminals are delusional or uncaring about consequences entirely to them it is a shock and an injustice when they are caught this is classic sociopathic behavior however having strong signals does work in that it sets a clear line and incentivizes all people stay strongly away from it if murder does not result in death the punishment is not proportionate to the crime and that sends a weak signal ,1,askaconservative

diversity_is_racism, diversity is a good thing by diversity this sjw means internationalism or multiculturalism all three terms refer to the same thing which is a multi ethnic society as a means of not having an ethno cultural or nationalist society diversity multiculturalism and internationalism are not in fact good they are symptoms of dying empires where tyrants import foreigners as a means of controlling the domestic majority plato they are usually seen in the end stages of a republic they cause a loss of social trust and group cohesion putnam they lead to erasure of the original population a form of soft genocide http www genocide org about and ultimately its replacement with an entirely different culture which its leaders naturally hope will not be culture at all but ideology diversity was popular in the soviet union and a struggle there too never in recorded history has diversity been anything but a problem look at ireland with its protestant and catholic populations canada with its french and english populations israel with its jewish and palestinian populations or consider the warring factions in india sri lanka china iraq czechoslovakia until it happily split up the balkans and chechnya also look at the festering hotbeds of tribal warfare i mean the beautiful mosaic in third world hellholes like afghanistan rwanda and south central l a diversity is a difficulty to be overcome not an advantage to be sought true america does a better job than most at accommodating a diverse population we also do a better job at curing cancer and containing pollution but no one goes around mindlessly exclaiming cancer is a strength pollution is our greatest asset http www anncoulter com columns 2009 11 18 html seems brutal but it is true as others have said cognitive diversity can be useful but to my mind this is a proxy for people being able to speak their own minds without fear of reprisal even if they are speaking nonsense a sensible educational institution requires them to articulate their ideas to a level where nonsense is revealed and has people who can point out their flaws and banish idiocy when necessary for example a teacher might write all contributions must be civil fact logic based and informative and dare we add in full essay format people in diverse areas are more tolerant to others the idea here is simple if you erase race and ethnicity there will be no conflict this idea is derived from the fundamental idea of the left equality which is a type of pacifism that states that if you erase class and hierarchy you will have no class warfare even though that erasure entails class warfare the problem with this pacifism is that it creates a collective mass which is prone to hive mind thinking group think echo chamber and committee mentality behavior bigger is not better it is less precise in that capacity it drifts away from being more accurate and eventually becomes entirely self referential and reality denying much as our republic has since the 1820s or so the idea of selecting people based on race frustrates me get frustrated because you will do it one way or another your options are 1 a multiracial society where one ethnic group will inevitably appear more successful than others and be resented you can either subsidize this problem with affirmative action styled policies or ignore it and have constant racial conflict like the la riots christian newsome murders ferguson or any of the other dozens of race riots in america history the leftist solution is to blame the majority but history shows that it is not the majority or the minority but the situation diversity which is to blame 2 you can have a homogeneous nation this is the idea of nationalism the origin of the word nation and throughout history the most stable type of society here in america we were once a western european wasp is the polite proxy society but then diversified with other white people and shortly after had a civil war and our society has been divided on race and class warfare since i hear this a lot to support affirmative action but i do not believe it a good argument affirmative action is a disaster because someone can be both from a protected group ethnic minorities religious minorities sexual minorities women and incompetent but the law only recognizes disparate impact or the idea that if people from a protected group do not achieve the same results as the majority the employer is to blame this leads to an indirect tax where every company must hire some people it knows to be incompetent and cannot assign them anything important so creates make work jobs for them and farms them out how many fake jobs were passed along to you in added cost on your daily food gasoline products or services quite a few since affirmative action lawsuits are devastating when you think about it affirmative action is logically doomed either minorities are not equal in ability and therefore require subsidies or they are equal in ability but suppressed at which point they would simply have started up their own economy as countless groups have done in america over the ages it is simply a nonsense policy that like welfare and civil rights was enacted by panicky voters as a vain hope that paying danegeld to the angry minorities would end the constant ethnic warfare diversity may well be the issue that ended america first through irish and eastern europeans who introduced machine politics to our cities and next through the huge amount we siphon off from the productive to subsidize ethnic and religious minorities who hate us for being so condescending and rightfully so we have sabotaged our education system to be inclusive ruined jobs in order to support make work and equal hiring which employers sensibly try to avoid made race the central issue in most politics and crushed our sense of identity and culture and what have we gotten out of it probably best to revisit the ann coulter quotation above ,5,askaconservative
diversity_is_racism, kill affirmative action and griggs vs duke power co allow freedom of association put smart people in high places and demote those holdin all back this would be an excellent start if we got rid of all disparate impact style laws including affirmative action we would be a lot farther ahead than we are now and would have set the groundwork to more in the future ,1,nojobs
