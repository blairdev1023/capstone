existentialhack,body language lol toxic is how they are viewed by 99 of reddit users no specific meaning re you i do not feel you are replying to me or any of the points the 80 20 theory is about physical attractiveness only so much of what you and others are saying is superfluous unless you are insinuating that women de prioritize looks as a matter of course in which case it worth examining why i would speculate that firstly that way overstated women tend to be less honest about that their shallowness re physical attraction due to social pressures and expectations etc and secondly the fact they compromise looks for other traits only evidences the fact that the bulk of men are less attractive than their female counterparts so slim pickings fyi i have been both unattractive and attractive top 20 so have a pretty balanced first hand view also your views on gender do not really matter if you are hot lol if you are jared leto you can approach women in an elliot rodger t shirt with eminem kill you blaring out of your headphones and open with a patrick bateman quote and she will swoon ,-14,TrollXChromosomes

existentialhack,the 80 20 theory is primarily about physical attraction so again you are re affirming its premise you are stating that your female friends are more attractive than their boyfriends ,-55,TrollXChromosomes
existentialhack, both sexes have to put a decent amount of effort in to look attractive a guy does not have to be completely ripped to look attractive to 90 of women they just need to have a reasonable bodyweight and a decent personality lol how do you look like you have a decent personality both sexes put effort into their appearance obviously equally there are lots of women who put in minimal effort and just happen to be in that sweet age spot where they naturally look great so long as they maintain a reasonable body weight just as there are some guys likewise who happen to have been born with a handsome face but you cannot work out a face which is where the bulk of a guy attractiveness is if you do not think guys fixate on their apperances as much as girls visit some of the toxic subs you probably do not want to they are the thin end of the wedge in that respect ,-15,TrollXChromosomes
existentialhack,1 in 4 people have a mental illness are you suggesting that 25 of the population is immune from personal responsibility ,2,JusticeServed
existentialhack,not really it simply saying that the average woman is much more attractive than the average man which is a huge advantage privilege a guy attractiveness is centred on facial aesthetics and the of faces which tick all of the boxes is small whereas for women there much greater emphasis on the body so essentially if you are young and slim and do not have a bad face as a female most guys will find you attractive if you are a young slim guy and do not have a bad face most women wo not find you attractive fairly simple then there the makeup and filter effect which can turn a woman from a 5 into an 8 in 10 minutes men do not have that either 80 of men are capable and will get a date and get laid but it harder for them than the average woman and it takes more effort and more rejection ,-19,TrollXChromosomes
existentialhack,men spend much more time energy and money on their appearance than you would believe men put in many more hard gym hours than women it takes much more effort for a man to achieve an appealing physique than a woman in terms of makeup and dolling up your photos it a two sided coin you can complain about the effort it takes but it just is not socially acceptable for men many would love to be able to add two points to their appearance in 5 minutes but it just is not feasible no matter how much effort they are willing to invest ,-38,TrollXChromosomes

existentialhack,not necessarily but they are what people wanted at least the free movement of people labour part is that why this soft hard brexit stuff is such nonsense there is no negotiation to be had is there to maintain access to the common market in any significant way we will have to accept free movement which undercuts brexit entirely and if that happens people will be unhappy and some manifestation of ukip will resurface ,0,ukpolitics

existentialhack,i have the same problem because i am overweight i am ashamed of how i look that why i stopped going out about 4 years ago i remember one time i walked past a neighbor who i had not seen for years and he saw me and did a double take yeah summer is more daunting but there also more daylight so you can go for a walk early in the morning when it quiet and light out whereas in the winter you would have to go out when it dark which is depressing as fuck how underweight are you imo it preferable to be underweight than overweight providing your are not really underweight but i would think that i would suggest getting some high calorie high protein nutritional liquid supplements it much easier to drink calories than eat them i have not tried anxiety meds i am on anti depressants sertraline which i have not taken for a couple of months but they work they work immediately for me i should take them but i have given up on recovery so i just take them when i hit really low points where it kill myself or pop some pills if i were you in america with your murderous healthcare system i would buy some anti depressants online i am not advising you to do that but that what i would do it interesting that you cannot sleep when you live alone and do not leave the house i sleep like a baby the only times i cannot sleep is when i have something to do the next day a doctor appointment or a necessary conversation with my mum or something anything then anxiety kicks in feel free to pm me if you want to talk i suck at it but yeah ,1,depression
