ojchahine6,on the contrary i worked in a deli in a grocery store and we were more than willing to give free samples most people are timid about sampling it can actually be difficult to convince them that the employee do not hate them for sampling as a business you want your customers to know what products you offer and you want them to go home happy so that they will came back looking to repeat that positive experience sampling is a good way to better ensure both these things happen the amount it costs the business to sample out a product or two is trivial compared to the potential upside of having a satisfied customer it also trivial compared to how much food the garbage cans get to sample at the end of each week like with the welfare argument there are certainly people out there that will abuse the system but those people are so few and far between that they should not detract from the bigger picture also again it will take more than a 1oz cup of tabouli to take down a business there is no pressure to buy either just because you got a little something for free does not mean you owe me or the business anything you can dislike and not buy you can like and buy you can like and not buy but you should never dislike and buy just be courteous ,3,LifeProTips

ojchahine6,i agree but of you look at tesla as just an auto maker you have a company that has very little relative market share low production numbers and is valued greater than the leading auto makers if the story ended there than tesla would be grossly over valued so that must mean the rest of the business can be attributed for the valuation what the rest of the company is is nebulous it part solar company part boring company part whatever elon feels like doing that day i do not know how profitable any of those other portions are or will be tesla is ambitious and daring company which means there a lot of upside to the stock however because of its lofty ambitions tesla is burdened with having to prove itself profitable in at least 3 different ways ,1,wallstreetbets

ojchahine6,the whole grain bread is the better option than the white varieties but if your goal is weight loss the bread is only hindering you part of the reason is that your body converts carbohydrates into glucose which is a form of sugar diets high in sugar lead to weight gain also glucose can cause you to crave even more glucose that does not mean it is essentially soda bread contains other necessary nutrients fiber and can make your meal seem more satisfying if i was strict ordering from subway i would skip the bread and make a chef salad with all the ingredients that would go into the sandwich if i was more lenient i would get the whole wheat bread and have them tear out the innards to cut down on the calories more on bread 100 whole wheat bread is made only with whole wheat flour whole wheat bread on the other hand can be a mix of white and wheat so read labels carefully i believe the healthiest form of bread is 100 sprouted whole wheat lots more nutrients high in fiber and contains protein only problem is it is not the tastiest ,2,AskReddit
ojchahine6,you can find something acceptable to eat at most places you just have to be mindful of what you are ordering el pollo loco is a good one you can get two pieces of grilled chicken fiberful beans steamed veggies and tons of salsa for a decent price a similar meal can be assembled at kfc 2 piece grilled chicken green beans and corn on the cob or cole slaw with some dressing squeezed out boston market see above two in n out they do lettuce wrap burgers you just have to order protein style skip the fries and shake chipotle one of the best options thanks to their burrito bowls good source of protein lots of veggies taco bell you can make a burrito bowl by ordering all the ingredients as sides wendy chili i cannot think of any others right now always skip the soda and desserts most places do a side salad and you should include one in your meal avoid the high calorie dressings though the refined carbs tortillas buns beading are often the least healthy part of an order aside from the soda also you can technically lose weight eating anything so long as you operating at a calorie deficit so how much you eat matters just as much as what you eat ,1,AskReddit
ojchahine6,the refined carbohydrates of the bread are the real killers if you are trying to lose weight an innocent subway sandwich is sabotage the produce is the healthy part the meat and cheese are low quality but provide a good source is hungry satisfying muscle building protein condiments can also ruin your diet ranch dressing can easily add 100 300 calories to a sandwich ,1,AskReddit

ojchahine6,dude noooooooo that not how it works with equity do your homework and scope out good buying opportunities for companies that have solid fundamentals look for companies with a sound business plan good management that are making money and that are not grossly overvalued find a business you have confidence in and put your money on for at least a year without much worry this way you can avoid the higher short term tax rate commissions and higher taxes will eat your gains making all your effort futile compared to effortlessly putting your money in an etf index fund give it a year or more and you will also have more time to prove your thesis correct companies can hit rough patches but they are also rewarded when they overcome them most of the time stocks will oscillate up and down but stay around the same price then suddenly gain or lose a large amount in a day the longer you hold the more opportunities for you to be holding the stock when it pops swing trading is difficult you have to understand what makes a company good you will have to know how to decipher the numbers you will have to be skilled at reading the sentiment of investors and market makers you will necessarily have to make more decisions and that makes it harder to be right all the time this point sticks out to me because you are already having trouble deciding what to do with this one holding that what you want to be right every day so that at market close you are in the green however everyone even the most talented of investors have red days they should it part of the process this is why it takes both emotional intelligence and patience to be successful at investing lastly if you are going to be speculating on the ups and downs a stock within a certain time frame your better off just trading options bigger upside and bigger downside but it makes it worth it as well as possible to beat out the short term capital gains tax if you are investing intelligently you will have the confidence to make buy and sell decisions on your own sure you will ask for others opinions but ultimately you will be able to pull the trigger and move along ,3,wallstreetbets

ojchahine6,eh that hardly enough proof against us living in a patriarchal society there are numerous things that factor in aside from just voting rights there are things to consider such as social values social stigmas cultural values job opportunities wages biology the complex workings of interpersonal relationships and very importantly personal experiences we try to organize the world into neat categories with nice labels but in reality there are too many gray areas to you life may not feel like a patriarchy probably because you are a man that has never had to deal with the social pressure to get married have kids and take care of a household to someone else it may totally feel like a patriarchy here the reality in most of the world society is and has been for a long time patriarchal there are many reasons for this but it started way back with early human ancestors when society was still in its infancy biology made it so that men were a better fit for the hunting role and the women for the gathering role in early hunter gatherer groups these roles would carry on for centuries and were the underpinnings of society as it increased in complexity furthermore christianity islam and judaism religions which billions of people model their lives by all have significant patriarchal themes however with each day society as a whole is moving toward a more equal distribution of opportunities and responsibilities the change is due to women entering the workforce more than any other single cause if you are going to make bold claims about society as a whole you should at least back it up with something better than flimsy argument ,10,AskReddit

ojchahine6,certainly but is it helpful though does knowing about resistance and supports really improve your success or is it dubious information that complicate matters i always see people talking about how once a stock breaks a resistence it will take off or once a support fails it will plummet so many times it just flat wrong what is the point in putting credence in something as reliable as a coin toss ,1,stocks
ojchahine6,i get the premise of the support if enough people have limit orders at a certain price it can create the perception of a support point those limit orders are not endless and once they are filled the support ceases to exist however if enough people sell it does not matter if the chart has supports resistances cup and handle formation or any other nonsense the price will go down the error is using this notion of support points to influence your investing decision you should base your buys not on the price or chart behavior but on the underlying company ,1,stocks

ojchahine6,hey man you cannot think like that maybe you need more mettle as a trader but you cannot know what the stock will do so you cannot be blamed for taking the profit while you have got it had the stocks plunged you would be congratulating yourself for knowing when to leave it is not until the closing bell that we know all the best decisions we could have made if you are consistently closing out too early you need investigate your trading strategy and make sure it is not fundamentally flawed ,1,wallstreetbets

ojchahine6,do not make any exceptions no i have been good for a week so i will just have one because it saturday and no one is looking do not tell anyone i made a lot of promises to people that i would soon quit i would also tell them that i was trying to quit after a day or two of not smoking i figured this would hold me more accountable but it just made it harder i fall pray to wanting things i cannot have and announcing my quit attempt made cigarettes more off limits which only served to increase my temptation it also made me feel like more of a failure for relapsing turns out feeling like a failure was a trigger for me on my latest last attempt i did not tell anyone until i was two weeks in altoids and gum gave me something to pop in my mouth when cravings were the most intense try not to dwell do not fixate on how much you cannot have a cigarette or how much you want one do not spend time reminiscing the good times you had smoking do not expend too much energy fighting the thoughts rather when they come to mind just let them sorta slip away you can train this skill by doing meditation ,2,stopsmoking
ojchahine6,there are many reasons to stop aside from health two main reasons are that it waste of time and money personally i hated being controlled by an addiction and habit i did not even feel like i was choosing to smoke i was just taking whatever opportunity i could or mindlessly responding to triggers both of which i thought were pathetic so this point was a major factor for me ,13,stopsmoking
ojchahine6,i have to agree with tony after quitting for a period of time the reintroduction of nicotine can really mess you up it very depressing to go strong for a month have a cigarette and be back at square one it made worse by the fact that the cigarette is never really as good as you told yourself it would be ,1,stopsmoking
ojchahine6,i feel ya man my best bud smokes and they are the same flavor i used to smoke he only smokes half a cigarette at a time which means he goes out more frequently that means when we hang out for 8 hours he can take as many as 30 smoke breaks each time he goes out it a test of my willpower at first this was extremely difficult i could not even go outside with him now after a month it is not even a temptation every time you stare temptation in the face and overcome it is a victory that makes you stronger for the next time you have face it i am sometimes envious that he gets to smoke he knows the consequences but has no desire to quit i was never able to be so carefree about it i know that it me that should be envied i am the one free of the grip smoking has on a life anyway my point is you have to face temptation head on and overcome it to be successful you may fail but keep at it keep quitting until it sticks ,1,stopsmoking

ojchahine6,i disagree about price targets you should absolutely not buy and sell just because you reached a fixed number when you purchase a stock you should know what you are getting for the price you should have a general idea of how long you plan to hold the stock and what kind of growth to expect in that time period based on the company it represents this will give you a price target approaching the target should make you reassess your investment is the company still doing well can they continue to deliver on this growth is this company right for my investment goals is there something else i would rather be invested in etc if you have good reason to believe the company will do well and no good reason to take your money out then leave it i think stop losses are silly for investing different for trading options set your stop losses at 10 and that exactly the overall return you can expect in your investing career 10 should make you reevaluate soundness of your initial investment it should not trigger an instant sell if you are having trouble decided when to buy and sell you may have too much diversity in your portfolio leaving you with too many things to have to consider worry about ,2,stocks

ojchahine6,i know about short term trading and it still investing that is of course when it is not flat out gambling investing is risking your money with the goal of getting more back for it it does not matter the timeline in which it happens there plenty of trading going on based on fear hope news and other nebulous factors that does not mean it good or even necessary to base your own trading on these ideas i can predict growth in a company with a good product good business model competent ceo and good track record i can then take that prediction and investigate further i can check the current valuation and other numbers of the balance sheet to determine whether i am paying a good price for each share if the next 100 years of growth are already priced in i do not want the stock even if it continues to go up you might be very good at reading the market and making money off of it but i still think it a dubious foundation for a trading strategy if ta is a supplement to the rest of your dd i still think it a waste it might obfuscate rational decisions and there is an opportunity cost to spending time focusing on it but to each their own i suppose ,1,wallstreetbets

ojchahine6,i am not rich but i have also never been robbed by the stock market ta seems about as legit as astrology and astrology is a load of crap when you have 30 patterns your bound to find charts that match one of those patterns especially considering that charts can only go up down or sideways there is a lot of confirmation bias with ta when the charts do as predicted based on the pattern they are held up as proof the analysis works when they do not do as predicted the outcome is rationalized or ignored why waste time squinting at a chart when you have a far better predictor of where the stock price will be in the future the business itself you are delusional if you think that the stock market moves based on technical analysis theorems businesses doing well moves the price up and business doing poorly moves the price down that it everything in between is an unreliable indicator ta is just excuse for not putting in the effort to break down the numbers to determine the soundness of the investment ,2,wallstreetbets
ojchahine6,that because a decision to buy should not be based on what a stock has already done plus stocks that surge in ah often drop the next day within the first hour of trading ,7,wallstreetbets
ojchahine6,agreed there a difference between diversifying to mitigate risk and stretching yourself thin when you try to turn a profit by swing trading on 10 companies that 10 entries and exits that you have to time it also requires that more things go in your favor first you must look up your companies and do quality dd otherwise you are just guessing if you are just guessing there no point in asking other traders to evaluate those guesses or outcomes if you do your research and find that you have a good chance to make money on stock a then why waste capital and energy on stock b if you are investing in stock b to protect in case you were wrong about stock a then you do not have conviction and should not be putting anything into stock a in the first place ,3,wallstreetbets
ojchahine6,ta is silly and just a way to look for meaning in the stock market where there is not one anyone can come here and say that a stock that finished at 10 25 today could be between 9 25 and 12 25 in the future ta tries to determine what will happen in the future based on the immediate past which is a logical fallacy ,2,wallstreetbets

ojchahine6,today rally seems superficial revenue is down which is a huge factor this er should have resulted in less of a rally i think it goes down tomorrow as more take their profits and run ,1,wallstreetbets
ojchahine6,i go around spilling drinks on people computers ,1,wallstreetbets
ojchahine6,i would take my profits and run just because legalization happens does not mean these companies will be more successful then again if i had 100k i would have just started my own weed company the logic behind weedstocks seems very similar to the electronics craze in the 60s and the dotcom boom ,1,wallstreetbets
ojchahine6,yeah but never underestimate the inefficiency of some businesses i told my manager that we should be ordering our printer toner from a particular website selling at a third of the price we pay she dismissed the idea because it was too much effort the toner we get comes bundled with photopaper 500 sheets of photopaper per ink cartridge which at best can print 100 pictures we have stacks of paper that we will never need ,3,wallstreetbets
ojchahine6,it was all just smoke and mirrors anyway ,1,wallstreetbets

ojchahine6,they make money from the cash which is held in your account and not in equities also robinhood gold which more people sign up for than you probably realize there a potential for fraud in that they can carry out an order for you say that the market buy was 5 dollars flat when really it was 4 97 and rose shortly after rh keeps the difference and you cannot verify because there are no buy parameters ,3,wallstreetbets
ojchahine6,you went the better route ,1,wallstreetbets
ojchahine6,my gut says it will pop up in the morning regardless of them hitting or missing ,2,wallstreetbets
ojchahine6,absolutely i will also state that i have only recently taken a position wish i got in 5 years ago and it a relatively small one i do not expect an insane or quick return i do expect steady growth and regular dividend payments if along the way they make some positive business decisions i will be glad to have put money into the company now ,1,wallstreetbets
ojchahine6,i weighed that into consideration before investing first myspace at its peak had 75 million monthly users facebook has 1 8 billion currently facebook grew incredibly fast because it was the trendy new thing and was far less childish than myspace myspace users flocked to facebook but kept their myspace accounts the most important thing for a social media platform is users people stopped using myspace when it became clear that more of your networks could be found on facebook people are not just using facebook for their immediate friend groups rather their entire network of friends family and coworkers it was a snowball affect that solidified into a rock there were a lot of social media sites competing at the myspace level and only one that emerged triumphant when the dust settled facebook is now a mainstay in our modern lives whether we like it or not if you want to be the top social media site you will have to topple facebook to do it not even google with its incredibly talented workforce power and resources was able to go toe to toe with facebook plus if you do become popular enough to seriously challenge facebook potential it may just buy you out unlike the reckless acquisitions of many companies in the past facebook seems to know how to turn its acquisitions profitable there are also the countless websites that connect their users or give the option to do so to their facebook accounts furthermore if you are famous or want to be famous you will most likely have a facebook account i consider these last two points to be a sort of endless stream of free promotion for the company my last and favorite aspect about the company is that its revenue source is digital it does not have to assemble distribute and sell a product to make money ,1,wallstreetbets
ojchahine6,yeah but it different when a gorilla takes a bullet to the dome all you have is a rabbit with heat stroke ,2,wallstreetbets

ojchahine6,last ten years vz has been doing really well because of top of the line smartphone offerings you wanted the newest iphone back when new models actually meant new features you could get it free by signing up for a 2 year contract now you can get an amazing phone with just about any carrier with metropcs subsidiary of t mobile so it on their network i can get unlimited everything for 60 by paying for my phone outright you end up paying about half as much and get more over the course of 2 years with metro than you would with vz plus no contract once people are out of their currently existing contracts they will revisit the cellphone market and find so many better deals than the last time they were shopping around i expect new subscriber growth to slow and existing subscriber numbers to also drop in the coming years additionally as a customer i felt vz was overpriced and out of touch ten years ago in a decade my opinion has not changed ,1,wallstreetbets

ojchahine6,what you have is a good start but you need to expand dig deeper try to disprove your own selling points for instance you may think jaybird head phones are overpriced but that is merely an opinion what matters is that they are selling at a profitable price or stealing market share plenty of people loathe apple products and operating systems but that has not stopped apple from being the largest company on the exchange ,1,wallstreetbets

ojchahine6,market shmarket even after a bubble bursts people will still spend their money on something if i am buying equities i am looking for companies that will grow considerably for the next 50 years good companies survive bad times new companies are founded daily with all sorts of growth potential and i am just trying to spot the ones that will be winners i am sure we all wish our grandparents or parents had invested 1000 into msft in 85 or amzn in 95 i would like to be similar to the grandparents that saw these opportunities if another market crash happens i will have time for my investments to recover if the whole world goes bust money wo not matter anyway of course i am optimistic for the future but just because i am optimistic does not mean i am insane i do not think everything will hit zero but i also do not think cmg with its 578 p e ratio is in any way a reasonable investment also i like researching companies and taking a risk by investing in them ,1,wallstreetbets
ojchahine6,low volume can actually indicate an upcoming rally for that reason ,1,wallstreetbets
ojchahine6,if it goes to zero you can just build a yacht out of gold ,3,wallstreetbets

ojchahine6,okay so i will take that sarcastic response as a no you are side stepping the question i do not care that we disagree about issues what i want to discuss is substance what has trump accomplished as president that you think will benefit this country fuck i will throw you a bone trump was able to appoint with help from the republican controlled congress and a bending of the fundamental ways in which the senate operates a reliably conservative supreme court justice despite very strong opposition gorsuch is relatively young and will be adjudicating the most important cases in this country for many years ,8,pics
ojchahine6,i am open to discussion what do you think he doing well ,7,pics
ojchahine6,sorry but he been an objectively bad leader thus far and i doubt he going to change i did not like george w bush for a lot of reasons but his agenda i could stomach and it was at least in line with republican values trump is a lying narcissistic unprofessional bigoted immature inexperienced and disrespectful man with low self esteem and terrible ideas for solving this countries problems the only relief i get is that he too busy golfing to accomplish anything i would not want him as an employee or coworker let alone commander in chief i do not need the news or reddit to tell me this it evident in his words and actions he does not even pursue or represent republican values this is not about me being better than you this is about him being bad for the country to take in all the information of his first 100 days and decide that you would like to double down and choose him as your leader again is either stupid ignorant or plain delusional also i downvoted this post because i thought it was pointless and hardly critical there are so many important issues at play with this presidency that we do not have the time or luxury to worry about how the fuck trump walks down a flight of stairs ,10,pics
ojchahine6,i have begun to automatically see an asterisk next to the words president trump ,3,pics

ojchahine6,i am sorry to hear about your sister my best wishes to her and your family we have got your back and we want you to be successful if you can overcome this without giving in to the desire you will know that your truly strong enough and nothing can break your will power i lit up a cigarette when someone close to me died and it took another six months to quit it was not worth it it never is ,1,stopsmoking

ojchahine6,hell at least you worked out my lungs were so trashed that it was too much effort to exercise and so i did not ,1,stopsmoking
ojchahine6,one thing that has helped me is telling people how long i have been smoke free specifically the people in my life who care about me and those that encouraged me to quit they feel proud of me and smile sometimes they give me hugs that makes me feel good and rewarded more than a cigarette ever has ,2,stopsmoking

ojchahine6,i remember lying in bed and having an epiphany smoking does not just cause diseases it is one i thought to myself if there was a disease that made me cough made me stink made my skin sag made my teeth yellow ruined my sense of taste and smell ruined my lung capacity required a ten minute treatment numerous times a day and increased my risk of developing other diseases would i not immediately take a cure if someone presented me with it i had that disease and i had that cure i got right out of bed and threw away my pack of cigarettes 4 attempts later i was finally able to quit ,2,stopsmoking
ojchahine6,most of the times i quit i barely made it a whole day now if i can make it a month so can you ,2,stopsmoking
ojchahine6,it a hard feeling to fight when i quit smoking cigarettes it was not until maybe the 30th attempt that year that it finally stuck i felt like all i had done was fail but in hindsight i would not take back those attempts because at the very least they kept me smoke free for 30 days it easy to forget the grip our vices have on us when we have been away long enough but there is no greater satisfaction than overcoming that grip ,1,leaves

ojchahine6,fossil fuel companies not because fossil fuels are in direct threat from energy efficient appliances but because this act attempts to weaken climate change theory the energy star program implies that not all electronics are created equal that some electronics consume more electricity and that this is a bad thing because energy should be conserved energy should be conserved because the overuse of it by humans has had profound consequences on the environment those profound consequences are what we mean when we talk about climate change the energy star program implies that human actions have real consequences and that even small little changes that we make can a have difference in the outcome by removing the program you imply that climate change is not a real concern in fact climate change is so little of a concern that any attempts to curb it even if it tiny and not inconvenient is a wasted effort of course that my rational explanation for a man that does not act rationally perhaps trump is just on a mission to degrade the united states because i still have not been able to explain why he would cut meals on wheels ,1153,politics

ojchahine6,agreed the problem is not long term investing it that apple is a company whose growth has peaked so as a long term investment it wo not appreciate much there are apple stores in just about every mall phones and computers are a very competitive environment you have to be at the cutting edge of innovation to maintain your market share as a company additionally objectively better electronics are available at a far lower price than what apple has to offer and more people are starting to realize this meanwhile the current valuation already accounts for apple future growth and earnings i think apple will continue to be great company for a long time but in my opinion the current valuation seems optimistic it asking for a lot to expect a 758 billion dollar company to double in value in 30 years however there are plenty of small and mid cap companies with this potential op bought apple stock the same way people buy apple products brand recognition and no research also using the iphone 8 release as a selling point demonstrates short term thinking for a long term investment strategy which seems dubious to me ,1,wallstreetbets

ojchahine6,thats not a good analagoy the difference between a 1200 and 2000 rated player is huge 2000 and 2800 is huge but in a different way 1200 is still learning the fundamentals will make tactical mistakes frequently and botch strategic middle and endgames 2000 has gotten past most of that and really only lags in experience theoretical understanding and inventiveness ,1,chess

ojchahine6,if you play chess you know that being good at it does not carry over to everything else in life if you do not play chess but have attempted it you realize that it difficult and requires you to think so non chess players assume that if you are good at chess you must be good at doing difficult things and thinking which are two qualities of an intelligent person since most chess players do not have much else going on we do very little to combat the false perception ,4,chess

ojchahine6,you do not need metrics or articles to see that snap will fail just look at what people are doing around you snapchat was fun interesting and new when it first came out with snapchat it like a kid obsessing over a new toy their parents bought them sure a lot of people still use it but you can tell that many are now over it or are approaching that point teens and young adults have no reason to be loyal to an app and move on to the next cool thing in a heartbeat and snap will be on the shelf right next to zynga once people notice others are no longer using the app they will jump ship too i forsee an exponential decline in snapchat userbase furthermore snap is now public so there is pressure to constantly grow earnings which means more ads which will further deter users then there is the fact that what snapchat does have to offer is very limited so there is very little room for the company to adapt and add new features to maintain interest the way facebook can market cap 24b unless they make some smart acquisitions or innovate this company will die and investors will lose loads of money ,2,wallstreetbets
ojchahine6,anything is possible you should be buying based on sound reasoning and not based on daily price movements if the company has a good model is making money and is growing it will usually be a good investment i am confident amd will have a higher evaluation by the end of the year so i am not worried about the 6 percent my portfolio shows ,1,wallstreetbets
ojchahine6,mostly because they do not know better other times they are just screwing around our having fun i sometimes play a3 in online blitz for this reason some may play these moves as a sort of handicap since it essentially gives away a tempo i want to try it in a tournament since i am still in the lower sections the young kids are so dogmatic that i think their heads would explode if i played h4 against one of them ,5,chess
ojchahine6,queen traps are a little hard to see because the queen usually has so many squares it can go to there are some clues about this position that should tip you off to the answer first black has not developed any pieces second two minor pieces are very near the queen third the dark bishop can develop freely along the c1 h6 diagonal fourth the knight on f3 protects the g5 square a common square for a bishop to occupy so the bishop can develop there with tempo since the queen will be under attack fifth if a bishop does come to g5 the queen is sol and has no where to run ,1,chess

ojchahine6,emphasis on number one i played a round on less than 4 hours of sleep i went from alright i like my position out of the opening to well there goes my f7 pawn to and there goes my knight to oh and that my rook you are just not your best when you are sleep deprived ,1,chess
ojchahine6,i recently played in my first tournaments and had some take aways you can benefit from 1 have fun if you enjoy what you are doing you are more likely to do better and grow 2 do not rush i play a lot of online blitz so it was a dramatic shift to play a slow time control i played 11 games in three tournaments and lost 4 of those games in each of those losses i had over 40 minutes on my clock i was more upset about my poor time management than my loss you are better using your time to avoid playing poorly and double checking variations than to use your time trying to salvage a bad position also you will be very annoyed when you review your game and see that you could have won a piece after move four but you were playing your opening moves so fast that you did not see it 3 do not underestimate your opponent remember how i said i lost because i played fast well i played fast because i assumed my opponent would be easy to beat it does not matter if they are the tiniest of kids or the lowest rated player in the room you will still have to think and put in effort to secure a win 4 do not get lazy just because you are up in both the games i drew i was up at least 2 pawns at one point because i was up i thought the rest would be a cake walk but careless play caused me to bungle sure wins 5 check your notation it was my first time taking notation and i thought i was doing great when i later reviewed my games i found quite a few errors in my notation and i wasted time trying to remember what was actually played 6 do not stress so much about specific opening theory stick to the three fundamentals of opening play control the center develop minor pieces get your king to safety and you should reach a playable middle game no problem 7 check your variations double check them how much time do you have a bunch well then triple check them there no way you will see everything but this will help you see more things definitely do not do what i do where i check a bunch of candidate moves then see a new candidate move that initially looks really good so i play it without checking if it works 8 think of every game as an opportunity to present ideas to learn and to grow as a player 9 review your games all of them 10 be patient we were an hour into our game and i thought for sure one of us should have won already i looked at the scoresheet and saw that we were actually only twenty moves into the game another time i had been better the whole game and my pieces were closing in on the enemy king i wanted to start my attack already but instead took the time to thwart my opponents counter chances and improve my pieces which i attribute to my attack actually being successful and lastly if you are playing against little kids grow a big scraggly beard the kids i played must have wasted a collective hour just staring at mine ,5,chess
ojchahine6,there are differing features in tactics trainers many allow you to select specific motifs to train this may be good for drilling an idea but i think it diminishes the effectiveness of your training to focus on just one idea on the contrary i think it very beneficial to get a completely random position from that position you must break it down to understand what idea to pursue then you start doing hard calculations to try and solve the tactic it prepares you for otb play where you wo not be prompted by something externally that a tactic exists and will instead have to rely solely on your assessment of the position as for fundamentals like kr vs k and others of this nature i think having an organized study plan is essential chess com premium membership provides good organized lessons on these fundamentals ,3,chess
ojchahine6,it took me a long while to realize this feature on chess com so i would not be surprised if a lot of players do not know about it it amuses me to hear about and see all the different ways that insecurities present themselves in online chess there will never be a shortage of people that need to be reminded that chess is just a game ,1,chess

ojchahine6,that exactly it thank you that price ia surprising because about half the kids playing in the lower section were using these zilch in the upper sections i am playing in the silicon valley most of the kids are asian or indian so the parents have a lot of expectations of success and will spare no expense to make it happen i prefer old fashioned score sheets it fun to make your opponent sign after you beat them kinda just rubbing it in their face that they lost ,1,chess
ojchahine6,he can play however he likes even if that annoys you i do not care if my opponents round is ruined because he has to play a patzer that his her problem meanwhile if i have more to gain from playing up then playing at my level then it a better use of my time and i am going to go for it ,1,chess
ojchahine6,i am quite the opposite of you winning in the lower section does not feel that rewarding i do not even feel like i can claim to have played a good game in the under 1600 section i played in recently i was paired with a kid 400 points lower than me i took advantage of my opponents lack of development and airy king and squeezed him into a tactical finish when i reviewed the game i found that it was not that i played excellently rather that my opponent played terribly then i was just upset with myself that it took so much effort to beat him on the other hand beating someone higher rated always makes me feel like i am growing as a player ,1,chess

ojchahine6,this position is not a good example of my point because the forced win in this puzzle is the easiest line to calculate i was talking more generally recognizing that a position may have a tactical win is not hocus pocus for instance if both a rook and knight are undeveloped on one side of the board i recall the many tactics problems where i position my pieces to attack the rook which is trapped then i start calculating lines seeing if it is indeed possible if my opponents king is weak on the backrank i consider all the ways i can get a queen or rook down there to give a checkmate if i have 3 minor pieces pointed at a castled king i consider all the different ways those pieces can coordinate an attack if the queen is saddled with the burden of defending several minor pieces i think of how i can overload her as the other elements of my chess game improve i veer away from recognizing a tactical win and move closer to actively creating the types of positions that lead to tactical wins i agree with the expression from several grandmasters that tactics flow from good positions of course other times i go with my gut feeling that in the position something gotta give ,1,chess
ojchahine6,i believe it for certain positions i have done puzzles that were really funky and complicated one puzzle i did had a 7 move combination that left me with a 3 12 evaluation and a technical endgame that required extreme position that puzzle also had a 2 move forced sequence right from the beginning that only gave a 2 3 evaluation but with an endgame that was much more simple to convert so if i am playing a blitz game and reach that point when i am nearing time trouble i am far more likely to recognize the simple direct path to an advantage once i have found that path i will probably only search for the more complicated route if i have a comfortable time edge another thing is that to apply tactical knowledge in game one must first recognize that a tactic may exist in the position for some tactical sequences that is more difficult examples include checkmate in the early opening opponent having two pawns on the 7th but you are the one that ends up with a queen opponent having a mate in one threats but you end up being the one that gets mate i do not think it a good excuse to not try for complicated tactics on your games i can understand why many feel that way about certain puzzles what they should be saying is i am not familiar with this idea enough to recognize it otb this way the player knows that even if they solved it correctly they still need to work it out several times until it becomes second nature ,1,chess

ojchahine6,well look i read that comment and it did not seem terribly rude to me just very direct but i can see where you are coming from it should be noted that our negativity has fed off eachother in this post but we need not continue down this path here where i am coming from as chess players we are being a bit dismissive in responding to you because the request does at the surface seem silly to us the whole essence of 960 is to have an outlet for our insatiable desire to move chess pieces without having to carry with us the burden of history and the countless hours of studying it very in the moment bam you get a position what do you think of it what looks god awful about where the pieces start what looks juicy what are some weaknesses what move can make to coordinate the most of my pieces at once should i focus on an early castle will i even need to castle what you cannot know is the strength of early moves the same way as in chess in chess the move e4 leads to different theoretical openings which lead to specific types of middle games which lead to known endgames it stood up to the test of time it a path very well worn we know enough about it as well as the starting position of a regular chess board to confidently say e4 is a strong first move though many have tried of over the years to refute this claim in any given 960 starting position it could take a hundred years of playing to prove that e4 is a wretched first move there is a beauty in chess with it it symmetry depth and history likewise there is a beauty in 960 with its uncertainty you trek down those uncharted paths but with only your skill ingenuity experience talent and understanding of the fundamentals you can develop these by any means that improve your regular chess game even studying openings if you understand and can explain why certain opening moves are good in the king indian attack you can apply that understanding to the moment when you create a new opening over the board in a 960 game i think most importantly is to have fun with it see it as an opportunity to be creative instead of an obstacle to overcome ,2,chess
ojchahine6, you just might as well say there is no point in learning the strategic ideas behind standard openings because you are supposed to get the pieces out and think about every position you realize how absurd this sounds right i did some googling as per the other commenter who actually answered the question and found this site http chess960jungle blogspot com 2012 02 chess960 opening survival guide part 2 html m 1 so obviously there are which makes these reasons explained above as you say irrelevant because obviously someone figured out something being condensing is not helpful in these comments your tone reads like answer my question as i want you to or gtfo to me it seems like you are the one being condescending also i do not know why you are so sensitive people on the internet will be rude and abrasive you cannot let it bother you ,2,chess
ojchahine6,i answered in a tone that i believed was mirrored the tone you have responded with in this post you have every right to ask your question and the other users have the same right to give whatever answer they like even if you are not satisfied with it your question is not very fitting for this sub because as you have proven in some of your responses you only need to do a quick google search to find the answer in that spirit users here have provided answers that contribute to the ancillary discussion of how to ensure better outcomes in the opening phase of a 960 game i will acquiesce and answer your exact question no i do not know of any resources that could help you specifically with the opening of a 960 game i do not think and i have not looked this up there are many resources for 960 for several reasons it uncharted territory only recently has 960 risen in popularity and the number of its active players is considerably smaller than chess only a small portion of those active players are interested and willing to engage in resources that would help them improve it a niche market one of the only incentives for producers is that there is little other competition most players consider 960 a casual format and are less interested in winning ratings or improving chess is concrete and empirical which makes it far easier to write for since you cannot write specifically about an opening one must resort to generalizations i doubt that there are any generalizations one can make about 960 that is not also applicable to chess and vice versa so i believe it unnecessary to search for content that is exclusive to 960 and of course that just my opinion man ,1,chess
ojchahine6,cataphractoi never said you should not ask your question your question was answered but you just did not like it your opening strategy is to assess the position and proceed in a way that you think is suited for the starting piece placement you cannot say for example if your knights are too close to each other move one to the opposite side because with so many possible positions there is no way to know if this is good advice or not in regular chess you can have generalized rules because it is knowledge gained from millions of games being played from the same starting position with 960 any rule will be too broad to be useful or so specific that it wo not help in the majority of your games it a game variant designed to emphasize skill ability to calculate and spontaneity you improve by studying middle games end games tactics and improving your calculation abilities if that does not sit well with you there a variant called chess which has volumes of information about navigating the opening if still you are finding it too difficult to grasp there a game called checkers that might suit you ,3,chess

ojchahine6,yes if you were a super gm and lost to a low rated player you would lose a significant number of rating points if you are rated 900 in tactics and failed a puzzle rated 400 you would lose a large number of rating points ,2,chess
ojchahine6,at those lower ratings those tactics are fundamental skills it would be harmful to advance a player rating before they could consistently solve those puzzles correctly failing those easy puzzles should be punished more severely than the more advanced ones ,2,chess

ojchahine6,i agree that dogmatic chess thinking is a bad thing i used the word usually because i know there will always be exceptions these are not really rules that anyone has taught me rather they are observations that i have aggregated from the many chess games i have viewed played here my rationale castling kingside is quicker because there are fewer pieces to develop before castling is possible exception some openings lend themselves towards queenside castling and make it the faster option kingside castle is safer because the king does not need to waste a tempo to defend the pawns in front of it exception the opponents pieces may already be well positioned for an attack on the kingside making it less safe both sides castling kingside leads to positional play i am just wrong on this point better phrasing is it more likely to lead to positional play than opposite side castling or maybe same side castling is an inherently more positional approach you do very often want to move the king to b1 or b8 after long castle maybe not immediately i have seen this idea in many high level games and have benefited from it in my own more important than defending the pawn it also usually moves the king off an open file or diagonal while also stopping opposing pieces from sneaking into your camp exception in many cases the king is not in immediate threat there are better moves to be played the tempo cannot be wasted or the king is just better by being closer to the center opposite side castle leads to attacking races because both sides can launch they are pawns at the opposing king without compromising their own king safety and because it is widely accepted that the best way to defend from an attack is to counterattack exception pieces can be traded off neutralizing any attack dogmatic chess thinking can hinder and there will always be exceptions to the rules but that does not mean these ideas are totally rubbish ,2,chess

ojchahine6,these are the only things i know about castling kingside castle is usually more safe and quicker to pull off when both players castle kingside the resulting game is usually very positional when castling queenside you almost always want to spend a tempo to move your king to b1 or b8 where it is safer and where the rook pawn will be defended games with opposite side castling are usually all out attacks from both sides ,2,chess

ojchahine6,i have found defensive tactics to be far more common as my tactics rating increases it seems that finding a way to stay alive is harder than finding an advantage this is logical since we have to recognize that a position is losing without the correct resource then we have to find that resource also tactics that lead to an advantage often have forcing moves which make calculation easier defensive tactics have fewer forced moves and may have more lines to calculate ,3,chess

ojchahine6,oh absolutely when this game was played telephones had not even been invented yet we have internet now we can instantly find out the moves played by the two best players in the world we can find an opponent to play against 24 7 there are way more serious chess players now and much more incentive to be good we have chess engines with godlike calculation skills that have taught us so much about the game chess knowledge is compounding and well played games advance theory just a little bit more each time since 1851 millions of chess games have been played more books more coaches more tournaments more of everything so yes it takes way more to be a top player now than it did back then it a beautiful game but i doubt either of these guys could hold their own against a top chess player today ,3,chess

ojchahine6,this is my second year with a diamond chess com membership the value is relative if you do not have a lot of money that 100 dollars may be better spent on something else compared to some of my other hobbies 100 is nothing chess is my favorite hobby and i have a decent job so for me the decision to pay for a membership is a no brainer what others have said is true most of what you can get on chess com can be found elsewhere for free there are plenty of free tactics trainers and thousands of chess videos on youtube chess com merely consolidates all those things that can help you improve in one organized and easy to use location that can be utilized on either your phone or your computer the video lectures are very instructive this is the main thing you are paying for the more you watch the more bang for your buck as helpful as the videos are i find many of the lecturers a bit dry or boring i am much more fond of the personalities at chess24 so i am considering switching over there next year the tactics trainer is okay but i think chesstempo com offers a better one for free with chesstempo you can organize tactics by difficulty motifs type frequently incorrect and so on chess com just has one problem after the next and no other features really unlimited access to online tournaments is dope this is great if you want to play a little more seriously at your skill level but cannot make it out to in person tournaments the lessons option is very nice it like a cross between a chess coach and tactics trainer or like working through a chess book without the need for a physical board to setup the positions access to this is a nice luxury engine analysis is a nice feature and a breeze to use you can play a game and have it run an analysis immediately after i like not needing a computer or having to input a pgn of a game sometimes i just want to know what the engine thinks if my knight sac and i do not care for analyzing each move i can think of no other notable features overall i am quite satisfied with the membership and think it offers a decent value for the cost however there has also never been a better time for free chess resources and if you would like to know more about those you need only ask i hope this helps in making your decision if you have more questions just let me know cheers mate and happy holidays ,5,chess
ojchahine6,i do not know why some players think time is a factor in these formats but only for certain phases of the game the only instance you should not also be trying to flag your opponent in blitz and bullet is when you are in an impossible to win position ie opposite colored bishops no pawns and you are playing with an increment i am not going to waste mine or my opponents time by moving pieces back and forth for fifty moves just because my ego cannot accept a draw ,2,chess

ojchahine6,well that fucking commitment to an idea ,14,BlackPeopleTwitter
ojchahine6,computers offer a great learning opportunity especially for openings mostly because they can give you a lot of ideas for moves that you should not play one problem with playing low rated opponents is that they are less likely to punish a bad move and this can lead you to believe that the move is not bad or even that it winning you then start to incorporate these bad moves into your opening repertoire and you do not learn better until finally you get punished for it playing a computer can be as unpleasant as trying to beat a brick wall at tennis however as a study tool it can be invaluable like any tool though you have to use it properly to get the most benefit from it ,5,chess

ojchahine6,i am trying very earnestly to learn how to counter the smith morra gambit as black after 3 dxc3 but it is not easy white gets great activity and a fluid development of his pieces while black has game ending threats to contend with very early on in many variations these threats i should add are difficult to defend against even for grandmasters so you can imagine how easy it would be for a lower rated player to slip up learning the opening for white can be quite fruitful especially for blitz ,1,chess
ojchahine6,when i started to play more seriously i decided to pick a move one for white that i could learn and master i knew e4 was the most commonly played move so i knew there would be a lot of theory involved so i chose 1 d4 little did i know that d4 is just as theoretical now i am just trying to prove bobby fischer wrong ,1,chess

ojchahine6,learn the main line and a few of the sidelines as well as the general strategy of the position and experiment with it playing the opening when you lack extensive knowledge will lead you to developing many questions answering those questions will improve your knowledge of the opening and help you the next time you play it some think you should not play an opening you do not know because you might lose i think you absolutely should play an opening you do not know so that you can learn it does not matter if you are only learning what not to do ,5,chess
ojchahine6,great guys ,12,wholesomememes
ojchahine6,bg6 is the most obvious and probably strongest move here but even if you do not see that just a quick analysis of the position shows white is crushing the king is safe with no threats of an attack all the black minor pieces are undeveloped while all the white pieces are developed and exert control over many squares i have not calculated it but i am sure white could even consider giving up the exchange on f6 after a few moves of course so that the queen can enter into black camp ,3,chess

ojchahine6,hi valdr what you are asking is unreasonable there is no sure fire way to make sure you do not drop pieces if there was and any of us knew it we would covet that information and never tell you because we could use it to make a lot of money you must practice playing study strategy and do more tactics with more experience you will drop fewer pieces no promises though the good news is that even grandmasters drop pieces it happens to all of us i have played over 6 000 blitz games and have solved countless puzzles and i still drop pieces everyday sometimes it because i have bad strategy sometimes i just do not see my opponents move other times i just play too fast play slower time controls so you can think about your moves more make sure your pieces are defended and review your games so you can learn from your mistakes good luck chap ,2,chess

ojchahine6,it should be noted that what giri does is not trivial holding super gms to draws is not an easy task especially at the grand chess tour every opponent is sincerely trying to beat you and their confident they can do so yes there are times where he cannot convert his advantages but there are more times where he thwarted a loss in a worse position it takes extensive knowledge of opening theory middle game strategy and end game skill to even get to the point of drawing against a super gm it means making thousands of accurate moves throughout his chess career against players of lower skill giri absolutely has the acumen to crush them he done that many times what is most at play is the decision to take risk and play dubiously a player like nakamura more often plays wild exciting chess even if he ultimately loses against a player he could have drawn it seems to just be his playstyle although we know that that can change several times over a career he a young a talented kid expect years of good solid chess from this guy hell he could pave ways in figuring out even crazier ways to achieve draws which is still interesting chess ,7,chess

ojchahine6,eots temple and sm are all great intuitive and fun with a chance for catching up even if your group starts off poorly strand is terrible because if your team has to defend first and does poorly what is required for them to still win is to focus heavily on objectives kill more effectively and communicate better unless it a rated bg the group is going to do the opposite of this so many people convince themselves their team sucks or that the match is already lost they afk mess around by head hunting or just leave the result is the team that needs to get there shit together now has to also deal with apathy and player odds the team that already working well together now has these two factors working in their favor the team attacking first has an inherent advantage oh and to win you have to use bombs and tanks which very few people actually find fun yeah that what i wanted to do when i joined a bg get in a slow ass cart that has two moves and attack a wall ,11,wow

ojchahine6,karjakin did a fine job with the black pieces in his first wcc showing and i am certainly looking forward to seeing his play with white karjakin did have to work quite a bit to hold carlsen to a draw he loses some of the satisfaction of this accomplishment because he has to be realistic and remind himself that magnus was not even playing from his main opening repertoire carlsen has been hiding his preparation all year playing uncommon openings even at the olympiad tournament carlsen maintains this tension through game 1 carlsen knows this is karjakin first wcc and seems to be taking advantage of the nervousness that comes with the territory whether this proves to be of any benefit remains to be seen regardless it makes the match that much more exciting for the fans ,3,chess
ojchahine6,that just a dude in a hoody ,1,chess
ojchahine6,probably just a technical error ,1,chess
ojchahine6,damn i thought i was clever for seeing that the queen was trapped and i missed the solution ,3,chess
ojchahine6,i may be in the minority but i think carlsen opening choice was very clever at least from a psychological point opponent is a top ten gm world championship i have white pieces ehh to hell with an advantage i will play the trompovsky it a risky display of confidence even hubris it does more than that though it is almost certainly an opening karjakin has not spent a considerable amount of time studying invalidating many months of preparation this also has the effect of forcing karjakin to think and work harder if even for a draw most importantly carlsen is keeping his cards close to his vest karjakin has little insight about what magnus will play when he does push for a win does karjakin go back to study the trompovsky does he study other less known openings does he stay focused on stronger openings like the berlin and caro kann he may have to split up his preparation time just to avoid being caught off guard in addition karjakin now has one less game to score a win which increases the pressure on him when you are playing for a win with pressure on you mistakes happen and you better believe that magnus will pounce if he sees one as an american i am just happy to talk about something other than politics ,38,chess
ojchahine6,i think it is a sound strategy for a player at that rating avoiding the studied main lines of some of the more common openings can put you at an advantage your opponent may know 50 variations of the caro kann if you play a slightly inferior opening and get them out of book you may have an advantage as now you are playing the player and not their preparation carlsen is actually very good at this he often plays lesser openings manages an equal position then uses his incredible grinding skills to eek out an advantage remember a theoretically inferior opening is not bad unless your opponent knows how to punish it there are many openings that a sub 2200 player wo not know how to refute ,1,chess
ojchahine6,other sports are far less likely to end in an unexciting draw after several hours of play you go to a baseball game you are going to have fun even if your team loses watching a baseball game is completely different at the stadium than on your couch chess does not have that going for it it may be hard to justify an expense when money is tight personally i would pay that price just to be in the same room as carlsen while he playing ,18,chess

ojchahine6,my recommendation is that you not worry about rating points or losing focus on playing good chess a big factor in blitz is time management try to only spend a specific amount of time per move unless you think you might have a tactical win a general rule is to take your time control and divide it by forty this is the amount of time you should spend per move since this is the average number of moves in a chess game you do not always need to find the best move but you should definitely play the best move you can find control your emotions do not let a blunder or loss get you down lastly always review your games past mortem it does not matter how badly you played if after it is all said and done you learned something from it ,1,chess
ojchahine6,i would flip your closing statement work on everything else theory tactics classic time controls and this will help you develop your intuition for blitz ,4,chess
ojchahine6,rogues are still good in pvp although stealth is far less useful strong than it use to be assassination is just fine for leveling and a good spec for both pvp pve the stats are equalized in pvp making gear less of a factor though it will still make a difference because of the changes to pvp there will be far fewer opportunities to pick people off this just places more of an emphasis on strategy outlaw can be unpredictable because of a finishing move called roll the bones which can give you between 1 and 6 buffs competitive raiders see a big problem in this we are hoping for a change in how this ability works but blizzard has not given any indication for it rogues are competitive and fun still you wo not regret leveling one priests and mages are just as good but completely different styles of play you can do a level 100 class trial of all three to get a feel for them before committing ,2,wow
