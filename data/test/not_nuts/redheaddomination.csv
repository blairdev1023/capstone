redheaddomination,it would be easier to only learn a dialect because the number of words you will be using when casually conversing with the majority of people will be far lower than the amount of words you will find or hear in news reports literature etc but it will still be difficult and you need to have a fluent speaker to talk to also if you do not know how to write you will want to at least learn the basics of writing arabic grammar and sentence structure if you want to fast track the process i absorbed very little moroccan arabic when i did not know how to write did not understand the grammar granted once i could write it all came back ,1,learn_arabic
redheaddomination,to give an example i have a few friends who are heritage speakers they can understand their families and most people who speak their particular dialect but they cannot understand news stories read anything in msa or communicate with other dialects because they sound so foreign their language background makes pronunciation much easier for them but it just as challenging for them to learn msa as it is for me because it completely foreign to them ,3,learn_arabic
redheaddomination,it easier to learn a dialect if your primary form of learning is speaking and speaking to other native speakers and you do not plan on writing or reading anything the problem is that most dialects are not written and if you cannot read or write in formal arabic you are going to have a bad time trying to navigate order food or talk to someone who does not understand your particular dialect esp if it a north african dialect if you can read write and speak in msa you can communicate with everyone if they cannot understand your accent you can always write or find a middle ground in msa where you can both communicate yes it frustrating learning msa because a lot of the grammar is useless when it comes to speaking any dialect but it gives you a solid background and understanding of how the language works and it easier to learn slang and dialects once you have that foundation ,4,learn_arabic

redheaddomination,also the reason why the mua manager were so adamant about you paying even though they both probably knew she fucked up is that mua stylists do not get paid hourly and they usually only get paid 1 3 or up to 1 2 of the base price of the service the rest goes to the salon it similar to tattoo artists they make the majority of their money off of tips so for every unpaid service they are losing money as they are working for free and untipped services mean they are usually working far below what they should be paid so i can see both sides but that does not excuse how badly they both mishandled the situation she lied to you and that not okay ,14,MakeupAddiction
redheaddomination,good on you i had something similar happen when i was in highschool and paid a lot of money to get my hair done at least a lot of money for a highschooler working a 7 hr job but the manager was so scary that i just ended up paying it even though it looked like shit i am proud of you for standing up and refusing to pay as someone who worked at a nice salon and a beauty school as a receptionist customer service rep this happened all the time and whenever the customer was in the wrong i would fight tooth and nail to make sure they paid stylists and makeup artists cannot perform miracles but on the flip side when they did genuinely fuck up i would also fight to make sure the customer either did not pay or had their service redone by another stylist to their liking the things that still haunt me are when i knew someone was unhappy with their haircut color or makeup but still paid because they were too sheepish to complain as someone who is non confrontational by nature i understand how difficult it is to ask for a refund or refuse payment i am sorry your hair was turned into a weird orange splotchy mess jenny you should not have paid for it i tried to convince you to complain but there only so much i can do when it my job to make sure both the client and stylists are satisfied ugh ,19,MakeupAddiction

redheaddomination,what shape is your body actually it probably does not matter capes turn you into a stormy mass of a human but seriously if you are short i recommend shorter capes from the 40 or later if you are taller then the opposite but you can get around this by playing with clothing lengths you can get away with wearing long capes if your outwear is also long and dark colored i am 5 1 and most of my capes are long but i wear them with longer hem lengths and fuller fabrics to give the illusion that i am not a midget if you are tall do not wear short capes because you will look like a bandit from the middle ages ,3,AskReddit

redheaddomination,so your first option is to wait it will fade to grey once the blue completely fades out which should only take a few more washes your second option is to deposit a color that cancels out blue which is red i would advise doing this with an ash based toner or added shade as red is warm and will pull your color to a more warm tone your third option is to tone with a cool ash toner and hope that the color pulls more grey it like mixing paint colors but it more unpredictable with hair esp if you have previously dyed your hair honestly i would follow the first option it will fade and become more grey with time previously color treated hair is unpredictable even when you know the basics of color theory your hair will be happier in be long run and there a smaller chance of it turning green or some weird color or more blue good luck ,7,FancyFollicles
redheaddomination,you should try rag curls or bendy rollers on her because she has really thick hair i have very fine but full hair so it does not take that long for me to do this but when it comes to my girlfriends who have full and thick hair it takes forever i usually just rag curl their hair and save about 2 hours something about thick long non fine hair it dries in four hours thick long fine hair ahhh i will go the oldschool route and avoid accidentally burning their ears ,3,FancyFollicles

redheaddomination,i think it has definitely helped the sanders campaign without social media i do not think he would have been able to move from fringe candidate to viable option as quickly as he did here an article from the first democratic debate http www msnbc com msnbc bernie sanders sparks the most social media buzz post debate overall there were 10 million debate related interactions on facebook between 4 2 million people the sanders campaign also used the moment to facilitate donations by emailing the clip to supporters encouraging them to to donate before bernie steps off the stage the campaign reported that it raised 1 3 million in the four hours after the debate started raising 1 3 million in four hours is impressive and i think it shows the power of twitter social media ,46,NeutralPolitics
redheaddomination,i have seen a few people ask how to do pin curls so i thought that i would make a picture tutorial while doing my hair the other day psa this does take a fair bit of time and patience i prefer this method because hot rollers hurt foam rollers take too long if you take them out when your hair is not 100 dry you have just wasted a ton of time i do not have the patience for wet set pin curls and i have found this method has the best staying power there are a million ways to set your hair wet pincurl set hot rollers bendy rollers foam rollers and doing a hot set with a curling iron i prefer to use a curling iron and then set the curls while i am doing something else this is harsh on your hair so doing a wet set or using bendy foam rollers is much better for it i only use a hot set because i do not have the patience to wait for my hair to dry this shows how i do a hot set and the results i get from it but i have thrown in a few pictures of doing a traditional wet pincurl set and using bendy foam rollers so you can see the difference between the curls you can also achieve different curls depending on if you use a large or small curling iron how small you make the rolls and if you use wave clips at the end bendy rollers are more natural looking curls hot rollers give you a ton of volume wet pincurls will give you very long lasting curls but they are also much frizzier and using a curling iron gives you very sculpted sleek curls the way way you pin your curls is also important stand up rolls which i primarily do will give you more volume at the root pinned down rolls allow you to wear a headscarf hide your set while it dries are less likely to fall out in your sleep what you need bobby pins a natural boar bristle brush patience what i recommend l oreal elnett hairspray a curling iron teasing comb wave clips pomade bonus link to a tutorial on how do to traditional pincurls http www vixen vintage com 2012 12 vintage beauty how to do pin curls html another explanation on how to do a hot set with standup curls http thebeautydepartment com 2014 02 vintage curl tutorial ,4,FancyFollicles

redheaddomination,this is a legitimate critique but as someone who has tried for years to get my friends to vote nothing can force them except for internal pressure the problem is that the internal pressure never aries unless they are actually fired up about a candidate sure i have convinced a couple of friends to vote solely for free drinks or the novelty value but if they do not feel inspired to do so they wo not even if their best friend is offering a free ride or an unbiased rundown on all of the candidates so that they can make their own decision that why the 2008 and this election are different instead of trying to use external pressure i have friends who have never been interested or hated politics sharing information talking about the issues and even helping with campaigns it inspiring but also slightly maddening why maddening because i realize that if sanders does not get the nomination all of this newfound interest is going to fade away and the free ride drink or novelty value wo not be enough to convince them to give a shit ,1,politics

redheaddomination,here some related reading http www bustle com articles 104854 do presidential candidates pay interns its not fair to just focus on hillary clintons campaign since you do not seem to understand my point the overwhelming majority of political interns are unpaid or receive small stipends for their efforts and are expected to work 20 50 hour weeks this extends across the board while the white house does offer a year long paid fellowship their normal interns are not paid the vast majority of capitol hill interns are not paid either most internships related to politics and many other fields do not pay at all you are expected to accept this and find a way to pay for your living costs in exchange for experience while clinton may face the wrath of the intern generation at least she transparent about the program with the exception of rick santorum and scott walker none of the other 2016 candidates even offer information on whether or not they offer internship programs for their campaigns sen bernie sanders holds the distinction of being one of the few politicians on capitol hill who actually pays his interns currently individuals working in his burlington vermont or his washington office make 12 an hour while it a bit shy of his 15 minimum wage goal it still considerably higher than interns working for texas sen ted cruz who according to the atlantic make nothing ,4,politics
