born_again_tim,wait right there now i did not even share an opinion about mao so do not assume you know what i think and for the record i do not think his decisions for the country were 100 wrong he set and incubated a strong foundation upon which a much needed national identity was built although the nationalist edge to the identity is not working well in a 2017 planet but that beside the point however he made several serious fuck ups that compounded an already unstable national landscape perpetuating starvation level poverty in many ways of course he wanted what is best for china but you have to admit he fucked up and this set the stage for deng and his economic miracle which chalks up to western capitalism minus democracy minus human rights and before you even fucking start yes human rights in china have come a long way and continue to improve and no i dont think china should experiment with national level democracy at this time christ its the same goddam argument with you types every single fucking time ,1,todayilearned

born_again_tim, the story of china lifting 100 of millions of people out of poverty and into the middle class in a few short decades may be one of the greatest human achievements in all of history i disagree you talk like china made the blueprint for progress all by themselves what actually happened is they stopped ignoring time tested economic understanding in a region rich in territory and resources during a period free of war and they were able and are still able to accelerate this in a context that lacks the rule of law which makes it easy to smash through villages to create highways and other infrastructure and to make dissidents and the casualties of this progress disappear chinese economic growth over the last 40 years has been amazing and yes pulling 100 million people out of starvation level poverty is great but like most things that come out of china it is a copy of economic progress hammered out by capitalist based systems elsewhere you could do the exact same in north korea today for example without that clown show head of state you could focus the country on economic growth and have something on par with today south korea in about 30 years it not rocket science and it certainly is not deserving of the title one of the greatest human achievements ,0,todayilearned
