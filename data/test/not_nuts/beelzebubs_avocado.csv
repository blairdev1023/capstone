beelzebubs_avocado,ah that makes sense level 3 can be dangerous if people treat it like level 4 and tesla marketing and calling it autopilot does not help that situation it may not be realistic for the driver to stay alert enough at freeway speeds to take over if eg the car does not identify a large truck turning in front as an obstacle i think if i have to stay alert i would rather be driving and have the car backing me up if i miss something do not react fast enough or doze off ,2,technology
beelzebubs_avocado,it might be an easier hurdle for the autonomous car to identify situations it cannot handle soon enough to slow down and pull off the road that is probably what we would want a human to do if they were driving in a foreign country and encountered some situation they did not know how to handle and then perhaps once it pulled over it can call up its owner and ask for guidance or remote piloting ,1,technology
beelzebubs_avocado,of course you are right dr pangloss we are indeed living in the best of all possible worlds ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,there was a recent study done in oakland based on footage from the cops body cams that showed that the cops were a little more polite to non blacks than to blacks i was curious about the politeness of the civilians but that was not part of the published results ,2,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,agreed with both of you they do at least have a stressful and dangerous seeming job and most civilians do not seem to understand some elements like how dangerous a knife can be vs a gun but looking on r protectandserve there is certainly a distinct point of view which is worrying ,1,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,i think he not identifying it as a problem for himself but for others who have not broken through you say people figure out how to monetize it better and i think that part of what sam is trying to do here in a persuasive more than technical way i suspect there are some significant number of people who are either running down their savings in hopes of building up enough of a following to make a living or burning through investors money or just doing it as a time consuming hobby a lot of that wo not be sustainable once the early excitement wears off what has been lost eg in journalism is coverage of local government it not the sexiest thing but it is important in preventing egregious local corruption and state legislatures are where gerrymandering happens which has a big effect on national politics if there were an ethic of paying for the digital content that we consume many more people could make a living creating a lot more culture the likes of some of which we cannot even imagine now and would probably enjoy ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,pointing to a few people at the top who make good money does not say much about the general health of the industry saying that profits will increase presumably wise in the music industry leaves out part of the story which is that the reason they are expected to increase is that there will be fewer salaries and less rent to pay ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,i agree and disagree i do not think it healthy for people like the op to identify so heavily with anyone but on the other hand if they find their thinking and relational style to be so similar to someone it not totally crazy for them to feel attacked when those same qualities are criticized in the other person ideally they would be able to objectively see the good and the bad and apply that to self improvement but we tend to be touchy about our own flaws i think as the critic one is more likely to be heard by the target either direct or indirect if you are charitable toward them that does not mean lying but just sticking to facts and avoiding excessive negative spin and imputing motives and i agree to some extent with the criticisms sam is often very confident which people react to differently but his guests that i respect the most do not seem to have a problem with it if i was guessing it might be that either they are also very confident and do not feel threatened and or they are very emotionally intelligent and avoid reacting negatively ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado, i should say he prone to mischaracterizing and whether intentional or not that does not jibe well with his reputation for rationality you mean he not perfect i am shocked shocked i tell you but i bet in most cases if someone discussing in good faith called him on a sloppy characterization he would reconsider a podcast is not a book or essay there will be things said off the cuff that reflect system 1 thinking i am sure there are philosophers out there who would inflame fewer critics but most of them are not writing popular books and recording podcasts and of the ones who are not all of them are good ,0,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado, phones have been using ota updates for years unless someone hijacks cell towers or a major dns server it practically a non issue well that somewhat comforting but considering the damage done could be bigger than any terrorist attack or even industrial accident to date it probably worth thinking about consider that there are easier ways to get the information on peoples phones than hijacking the ota updates so probably hackers have focused more on other methods like phishing and there is not the potential to cause massive death and injury by hacking phones so there has been less motivation for terrorists or enemy governments also in the case of the iphone of the san bernardino terrorists the government wanted apple to use an ota update to crack it which seemed to indicate that someone with enough inside info could do so ,1,technology
beelzebubs_avocado,the downside of ota updates is a malicious virus could be very bad ,6,technology
beelzebubs_avocado,the thing is when a whole demographic holds that view on average when they become a bigger proportion of consumers you see industries shrinking with fewer people able to make a living in them we have already seen this is in the music and journalism businesses ,3,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,some good points were made in the short blog piece describing the author paper i think much of what is useful to learn about fallacies could be summed up as be intellectually humble and curious i do not think people are irrational because they just make the mistake of reasoning fallaciously i think they often rationalize their reasons for foregone conclusions which are arrived at for emotional and or social reasons that rationalization tends to involve shaky reasoning but the shaky reasoning is the by product not the cause very smart people are often better at this rationalization and so can be some of the most entrenched in their motivated reasoning because they convince themselves as well as some others lawyers and debaters arguing arbitrary sides of issues show that it possible to use somewhat good logic on both sides of most non trivial issues this is not meant to say that no side is right but just to agree with the author that the presence or absence of fallacies is not proof of a side being right ,2,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,the alaska permanent fund dividend is not enough to live on going between 850 and 2100 a year in the last 20 years so while it has similarities with a ubi it not that much of a game changer it might just pay your heating bill re hawaii i am curious if they will require residents to have been there for a while before getting the ubi otherwise i may be showing up if things do not work out here ,5,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,well good day then ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,ok i could have qualified that more by including another word either some or often you have heard of the principle of charity it goes a long way edit and of course none of us are without emotional reactions but some are certainly more impulsive than others as the president demonstrates nearly daily ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,if that is what you got from what i wrote then i have allowed myself to be misunderstood i only pointed out what seemed like a blind spot for the op there are certainly some people who react based on style of presentation ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,i guess it because for most people the most important content of communication is on the emotional level that why things like dale carnegie ideas and perhaps religion work for people who are more focused on the intellectual content of communication sam seems on the right track but they we are a minority ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,he acts in a way perhaps more so in the past that shows that having everyone like him is not a high priority so the result should not come as a surprise i think that fine and do not fault him for it but i read him charitably because i find him interesting and clear thinking it unrealistic to expect everyone to read him charitably or to read you charitably if you act similarly ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,i would not wholeheartedly recommend the jon ronson book but he is an entertaining writer there is an article in this month atlantic https www theatlantic com magazine archive 2017 06 when your child is a psychopath 524502 about callous and unemotional children that seems to refer to more recent research that i would definitely recommend having a look at ,1,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, it has been tested in trial it would be interesting to look at the test case to ground the discussion in an actual example with evidence do you have a reference ,3,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,i do not expect it to be a foolproof test but when you can see memory lapses which you might not see if you are not looking for them it would be worth paying attention to as i mentioned before not as a legal requirement but as a best practice ,2,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,oh agreed you would have to look for it by referring back to say an earlier part of the conversation to see if they are remembering it i have not tested this myself but i think my wife has been able to tell at least sometimes when i have been an ambien zombie based on her later account of it ,2,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, if someone is noticeably incapacitated then it negligent behavior to take advantage of that if they are not then they are free and clear it sounds so simple but noticeable by who a sober person watching the video afterwards i realize it generally a reasonable person standard but this is likely to produce a significant gray area as a hypothetical jury member i would pay a lot of attention to signs of intent such as feeding the partner alcohol at a faster rate than themselves edit this reminds me of an anti excess drinking psa where you first see the inside of a club and it all beautiful and everyone is attractive and having a great time and then the sober perspective is revealed and the club is dirty the patrons are sloppy and unattractive and cannot dance ,7,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, they would take it into account and i never said otherwise we might just have to disagree on that other readers can look up the page a little to decide for themselves i pretty much agree with your revised clarified position not a fan of negligent and reckless behavior though i wonder how often a woman has been prosecuted for it ,2,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,more of the other side of the story from a super classy news source http www tmz com 2017 06 12 bachelor in paradise sexual assault corinne olympios demario jackson utm source zergnet com utm medium referral utm campaign zergnet 1778541 adid tmz tf zergnet internal lp bachelor in paradise was shut down because a field producer filed a complaint that corinne olympios seemed so drunk the first day of filming she had no ability to consent to demario jackson sexual moves in a swimming pool and producers nonetheless let it play out on film the producer in question believes corinne may have been sexually assaulted although we know demario claims the encounter was not only consensual she was the instigator tmz broke the story of demario version of events that he and corinne were drinking heavily and making out at the bar she suggested they take it to the swimming pool where they took their clothes off and began rubbing touching and fingering he also claims she put her genitals in his face and he began licking he says he was unable to consummate things because he was so drunk our sources say the field producer in question was assigned to shadow corinne and began hearing stories from people on the set that corinne was so drunk she had no idea what was going on in the pool it unclear if the producer watched the incident but we know she has not seen the footage people familiar with the footage tell tmz corinne appears fully engaged as we reported after the complaint was filed warner bros immediately dismissed both demario and corinne and launched an investigation into misconduct ,4,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, more to the point though intent does not really matter here the state of mind of both parties does i literally just called my lawyer friend to confirm this and he said that being incapacitated either through intoxication or some other means is the only thing that matters whether a sexual encounter was on the table due to the setting does not matter nor does whether one person intentionally attempted to incapacitate you to make you more pliable to their offer the only thing that actually matters to make a contract voidable not void which would be something like a fraudulent contract or which invalidates consent is the states of mind of the parties involved that may be what the law says according to your friend but it hard to imagine a jury would not take into account whether someone had been drugged against their will and in practice you do not know what the law is until it tested in a trial ,3,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,so while we suspend judgment pending the appearance of evidence what should we have as our assumption in the absence of evidence i tend to believe that people are innocent until proven guilty though based on the controversy and the way it came to light there is probably something at the least very embarrassing to someone on that video is there another standard you would recommend ,2,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, she was not even aware of the act until later i am not sure we know that even stipulating the version of events described it might be splitting hairs but someone in a blackout is aware of the present they just are not forming solid long term memories ,6,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, other people seem to think it means not forming long term memories there might be even more interpretations i am not aware of as a legal matter not forming long terms memories does not and imo should not mean that you cannot form consent is not that the real meaning https www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc2800062 an alcohol induced blackout is the classic example the subject is temporarily unable to form new long term memories while relatively maintaining other skills such as talking or even driving while i agree it too much to expect every drunk person to be able to and legally required to diagnose blackout drunkenness in their hookup partners it does seem like a useful skill to learn to identify it i would rather know and avoid that situation though i would not be surprised if there were subcultures where it expected is that what some activists mean by a rape culture that label seems like an oversimplification if there is a community wide condoning of drunken hookups part of the oversimplification is that it seems to imply that the men are the perpetrators and the women are the victims but if the majority of women say at a college made it clear they do not want to have drunken hookups it seems like the community norm would change after watching the first season of unreal this does not surprise me much op title is brilliant ,3,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,the book i read on the subject was the psycopath test which did also cast some doubt on the reliability of the test the checklist is designed to be used by a qualified examiner originally designed to assess people accused or convicted of crimes the pcl r consists of a 20 item symptom rating scale that allows qualified examiners to compare a subject degree of psychopathy with that of a prototypical psychopath it is accepted by many in the field as the best method for determining the presence and extent of psychopathy in a person read more http www minddisorders com flu inv hare psychopathy checklist html ixzz4k6shvw93 i suppose a lot turns on the bar you set for effective which depends on what it used for and thus the consequences of false positives and false negatives while it seems quite imperfect many seem to think it one of the more predictive tests available for recidivism i could imagine that a psychopath who is familiar with the checklist could probably game it to at least some degree it was mentioned that programs that teach psychopaths to act normally can actually make them more able to pass and more dangerous there was also mention that the great majority of people who have that kind of low empathy do not do anything especially evil they may avoid doing bad things out of a sense of justice or fairness or or other motivations rather than empathy ,3,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, the thing is that psychopathy or antisocial personality disorder as the dsm has called it for a couple editions now is really hard to diagnose so it not exactly a handy way to spot random q public as a potential mass murderer the paper i linked refers to a specific test and its effectiveness it may not be convenient to make everyone take the test but it at least indicates that there is a there there hare psychopathy checklist pcl r best improved prediction of recidivism occurrence frequency severity injury and charges edit otherwise agreed ,1,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,here is an attempt at grounding morality in something objective game theory is a branch of mathematics which has been discovered which does not depend on humans to exist it finds that there are non zero sum games where it is tempting for a player to act selfishly or defect that selfish action could be called a morally bad action and could be considered a basis for morality and this is likely the source of our moral instincts we evolved to act like some of the more optimal strategies in game theory such as tit for tat which involves punishing defectors so we take these moral instincts and filter them through our culture and reasoning and come to different conclusions in some edge cases which could be described as subjectivity but the basic principle of favoring the greater good and punishing the selfish has an objective basis looking for an objective reason why this should be considered good leads to begging the question because this is what we call morality and anyone with their private selfish morality is the defector ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,i would not be surprised if they also tend to score low on empathy high on psychopathy which in one study https link springer com article 10 1007 s10979 007 9088 6 anyway turns out to be the best predictor of domestic violence notallmenarepsychopaths ,9,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,i am sure you are not the only one i have heard from a number of people who sided with chomsky in that exchange and that seems to be a central implicit part of the clash ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,i listen to the weeds podcast also and find it interesting to hear the well informed establishment liberal view on things but yeah there are blind spots and matt iglesias voice makes sam harris voice sound like roman mars by comparison ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,i would agree on that my replies were in some ways meant to be more of a fleshing out of your point than a disagreement i just omitted the explicit agreement part just because something is a fuzzy category does not mean it not a useful category and even if the interpretation is difficult that should not be an excuse to throw nuance to the winds ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,those and most pop feminist uses of toxic masculinity do seem like anti male gendered slurs i think we should call out gendered slurs in all cases ,16,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, not steel and rocks since they do not kill through their chemical action but through physical force yeah i guess though when you look closely that physical force is transmitted via some of the same forces between atoms that are also involved in chemistry i understand the motivation behind and support outlawing egregiously hideous ways to kill i am just trying to point out that interpreting it in an overly broad way as op seems to be doing at times leads ad absurdum ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,even stipulating the survey results does not that just move some of the source of the motivation from the bomber themselves to their community that supports them i guess we would see a lot more school and office shooters if there were an ideology that sanctioned such acts just because jihadis recruit the disaffected as bombers does not mean the bombers do not believe in paradise or that they would have become mass murderers if they had not been in that ideological context or been recruited edit it does seem plausible in the sense that the deeper you look into things the more complex they tend to reveal themselves to be but it does not necessarily refute the broader point that beliefs matter ,45,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,if the criteria were that a chemical leads to death we would have to outlaw gunpowder steel rocks etc ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,you might have a point there but it seems like a small point in the context of the quoted conversation are you defending all of the jason miller statements ,-3,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,you called my comment irrelevant i explained why i think it relevant what you do with that is up to you yes there is also a right wing paranoid style but it has a different flavor that i think is less relevant for this subject ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,but in this worldview what is evil it sounds like it boils down to causes harm to others if so mosquitos and malaria plasmodium are very evil people sometimes say this as a joke but hardly anyone seriously means it so i do not think this view makes much sense because it fails to distinguish a meaningful moral difference between a man and a microbe edit to be clear i think harris is wrong about free will but right about the importance of intentions ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,i had a similar thought but you have saved me the trouble of articulating it well i think it is possible to stick to your intellectual guns while not clearly violating this social norm but it may take a rare saint like john dickerson or neal conan ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,it seems like chomsky is assuming the clinton administration knew it was a pharma plant but then it hard to see how that would be a sensible political calculation and there was never evidence means that there has not been evidence made public right we do not actually know what the clinton administration based the decision on i am not attached to a belief in the goodness of clinton and am open to being corrected on the above if it not the case i lost respect for clinton after the rich pardon but it more parsimonious to assume incompetence fog of war than evil intentions if it really was just an attempt to distract from the lewinsky scandal based on no real intel then it should be condemned and is a bad example for intentions mattering ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,the reason it relevant is that if you hang out with people who root against your country someone who is relatively neutral will appear to be biased in the other direction ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado, conflict avoidant ok not secure with facing conflicts directly which is pretty much the same thing i used a perhaps too brief and pejorative word i do think he could learn to be a little more graceful about handling those kind of situations like in the peterson example i think he could have just noted that peterson was conflating objective truth and pragmatic or moral truth and moved on to other areas where there might have been common ground or at least shared definitions i think an exemplar for probing but polite discussion is john dickerson i am sure if was doing a podcast like this i would have at least as long a learning curve assuming it continued long enough to learn much ,2,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado, in general he seems too trusting of american politicians this seems like one of those subjective dispositions where it hard to prove one side or the other right but if we think it natural to root for one local sports team is not it also somewhat natural to root for one country i will observe that a reflexive distrust of the us is a fairly recent cultural phenomena on the left in the last 50 years or so and sometimes it produces strange bedfellows as with oliver stone becoming a putin apologist recently ,2,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,i would describe it as being more focused on following an argument where it leads than on observing social niceties avoiding conflict or controversy usually and with guests who are secure in their argumentation that leads to some interesting conversations but for insecure guests it can be pretty uncomfortable i think he been working on it and thus some here have remarked on the decline in confrontation in recent podcasts ,2,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,it true that even the atlantic has somewhat sensationalized cover story headlines but not quite to this degree ,6,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,that is a lot of furry foreheads and asymmetrical features were there some dogs thrown into the training set even asymmetrical glasses ,1,artificial
beelzebubs_avocado, i know women who seem to resent and hate men who are not feminists do they post about it online my impression is that the types who are just resentful without ideology are less active online online communities perhaps others more than this one seem to encourage taking sides ideologically ,3,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,i do not know the history well enough to really say but part of that could just be the different words that are used for similar concepts over time of course the concepts also change somewhat or at least carry additional baggage i suspect that when someone spoke of the prussian race it probably had a similar meaning to what we would now speak of as german culture even today the definitions of race and ethnicity are overlapping and either very similar or different depending on the source you look at or maybe part of the confusion is that groups formerly considered races are now considered ethnicities which is probably related to to your french germans example it would be tempting to r askhistorians ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,really i mean the nazis were not trying to commit a genocide on the french race from what i have read i am trying to find some reference for this but not getting much eg in this page on french german enmity https en wikipedia org wiki french e2 80 93german enmity and this one on france germany relations https en wikipedia org wiki france e2 80 93germany relations there is no mention of race ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,indeed which is why i think it should be abandoned by people who want to have honest conversations much like i initially thought that the deep state as described in the essay on the bill moyers site was a useful idea once trump supporters started using it widely to mean anyone in government opposing trump i am inclined to abandon it ,2,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,i think maybe what herr bert and i are having a problem with is that saying it socially constructed sure seems to imply that a fuzzy category is not a meaningful category instead of just adding that it has some arbitrariness to it and that it has historical baggage attached i think when he says you could make the same point without using that ocially constructed language he means that you could point out that the categories can be split and lumped in different ways and that there has been negative baggage associated with splitting i suppose getting two populations to consider themselves the same race is good all else equal for the prospects for harmony among those populations though it does not do much for the others left out of that category and even raises the specter of ganging up on other remaining races as a larger group when did the french and germans stop considering themselves separate races i am guessing it was pre 20th century ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado, they stopped calling each other different races and the baggage disappeared having talked to german tourists in france i can report that the baggage is not entirely gone whether this is the same baggage as was previously linked to race might be hard to nail down i could imagine that the resentment that french people feel toward germans might be of a similar kind though i am sure with important differences to the resentment that african americans feel toward euro americans ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,i think it unhelpful to use this social science jargon outside of places where everyone understands it because it very often leads to misunderstanding and often it seems it is intentional on the part of the users i think in common language a better description or at least less prone to being misunderstood would be ocially interpreted ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado, iq is to some significant degree heritable but also impacted by environmental factors the fact is that in america at least the legacy of racism and slavery still impacts every black person in some way that this impact is almost exclusively negative and that intuitively you would expect this to have a negative impact on a person ability to achieve success in life i pretty much agree with you but there is another puzzle that this description of the matter does not seem to help explain the difference between african americans and african and i think to some extend west indies immigrants several sources of difference occur to me selection bias of immigrants from overseas cultural factors and epigenetic factors these factors all point toward the details of a population being more important than race for reasons contingent on the history or the population in question so it reinforces your view of the issue anyway a technical term for genetic lineages is haplogroups but it kind of a mouthful and not that likely to make it to common use ,4,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,i can fairly confidently predict that if one had written a critical letter unless it was from a conservative perspective that it would not have ignited a shitstorm like this ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado, i suspect that most nonbinary people think it makes sense to identify as neither a man nor a woman or else they would not do so i suppose others ascribe other possible additional motivations and that may be the crux of whether they give them the benefit of the doubt or not one possible motivation is claiming minority status and thus the moral high ground in certain arguments and thus social status in certain circles it too bad that is even a thing that might seem desirable but that where we are ,3,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,so do the transtrenders believe that people are blank slates if so seems like another application of a pernicious idea ,5,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,i suppose if the message is to be cautious about anonymous sources fair enough i can agree with that it was especially a problem in the leadup to the iraq war on the other hand deep throat was very helpful in uncovering illegal activities even if he had his own idiosyncratic motivations apologies for attributing attitudes of many trump supporters to you so do you believe the rest of comey testimony including that trump lied ,1,AskTrumpSupporters
beelzebubs_avocado,i am remarking that it ironic for a trump supporter to give a lecture on careful journalism when trump has been trying to discredit all journalism with any standards it also ironic that do not trust anonymous sources is a talking point from a side that promoted and benefitted from anonymously provided hacked documents and emails via wikileaks do not you think ,3,AskTrumpSupporters
beelzebubs_avocado,but it all fake news anyway right and infowars is a reliable source of news s,2,AskTrumpSupporters
beelzebubs_avocado,what damage specifically do you imagine recall that there were some significant reforms in the wake of past scandals like watergate i think a lot of the damage was done in the years leading up to 2016 by right wing talk radio and tv and web outlets peddling intellectually dishonest narratives and outrage bait it has hurt the republican party by backing them into stupid policy corners like having to repeal the aca without having a viable alternative and of course the big money sponsorship of politicians has become a bigger problem than ever i am not sure exactly how we improve that but some of those politicians becoming discredited by having hitched their wagons to trump might help ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,ok i was not thinking of that one i guess but still threats credible enough that they lead to the cancellation of an event are certainly newsworthy even if it is probably the kind of news that coulter was hoping to make after the anarchist antifa violence outside the milo event it was foreseeable that there might be a repeat especially if the police took a similarly passive role ,3,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,since people seem to invariably apply it to individual works what about adding a few exceptions to the rules so that it makes more sense eg except when there are only one or two characters in the film ,3,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,seems accurate i underestimated the degree to which it would inform administration actions on the bright side a lot of other judges and civil servants are also appalled by this and are acting as checks on executive power too bad the house republicans have been pretty much complicit so far they are really hurting their brand which could also be a silver lining for the midterms ,2,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,i am not a lawyer and not from the uk so i cannot come up with a detailed prescription but there are other countries with reasonable civil liberties where they are not so free to recruit publicly ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,i know this is tricky because it referring to stereotypes i am not endorsing stereotypes as a good way to look at individuals though there is often a grain of truth on the macro scale it a trope in many comedies often ones from a black perspective that some non black person says nigger or ma nigga and is immediately surrounded by an angry mob of black men and narrowly escapes a beating i do not think there is an analogous trope with regard to gays or jews or women except perhaps in terms of a social media beating but that a more recent development part of the grain of truth in this case is that there is a history of a militant black group in the us outside of a few incidents there has not been a similarly really militant gay or jewish or womens group in the us so my point is that a perception that there might be a threat of violence if the norm is not upheld is an effective tool to enforce the norm and to negotiate the nature of the norm this is of course in addition to having the moral high ground due to history why does this matter it is an attempt to explain why the norm for nigger seems so much more strict than for some other slurs that are in the process of being reappropriated ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,would not it be a start to not tolerate those who advocate for jihad i am not sure about the details of how that would be done legally but the uk seems unusually tolerant of jihadis ,4,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,i am not sure there is a double standard there i gather that most many public figures who take on any controversial topic get anonymous threats it not really newsworthy unless the person makes it so by talking about it and a writer uses it to bolster their ideological point i am not pro anonymous threats mind you i think people should be prosecuted for them but the other cases were not about anonymous threats they were about actual violence and non anonymous threats it takes a very different climate for someone to make a threat with their name on it they must think they have institutional support and expect impunity ,8,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, getting people that are willing to die for opposite causes together is never a good thing or is it i can see it making great reality tv they can call it american gladiators 2 or something that should be something our reality tv potus can get behind s,1,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, we own all 3 branches of govt not for long at this rate and i suspect that not far in the future trump supporters will be ashamed of their pro russia stances and having fallen for a covert persuasion campaign it will make it hard for republicans to claim to be the party of patriots and american values any more ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,i think having eric weinstein back on could fill that role to some extent or have his brother bret who sounds more lefty they are both very thoughtful and not arrogant or dismissive in the way that chomsky tends to be ,2,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,i am not sure if diplomacy is what is called for so much as effective language if there were a few phrases that framed things in an emotionally effective way i bet they would be more effective than a book of rational arguments against most trump supporters i am thinking of frank luntz style language like calling the estate tax the death tax another thing that comes to mind is the image of trump and putin kissing it may be rude but it seems viscerally effective i doubt it appropriate for sam but spreading those kind of memes more could help i suppose snl might be the most effective disseminator of subversive perspectives about the administration or it might be providing a safety valve that saps the will to resist i am not sure ,3,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,i think one of the better reasons for being optimistic about trump before the election was that he would disrupt the deep state http billmoyers com 2014 02 21 anatomy of the deep state but if that was the hope it has been a bait and switch http billmoyers com story the deep state 2 0 i suspect some proportion of supporters are having buyers remorse but having a hard time leaving the camp while the pitchforks are out i did not even consider voting for trump but i was reluctant to call him practically hitler like some friends did ,4,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,there was a part of the applebaum interview i think where she mentioned that in depositions he speaks much more carefully but he still done plenty to incriminate himself already on twitter the snl version of the lester holt interview had a great part where lester says can we stop now he admitted to obstructing justice oh no nothing matters any more ,3,samharris

beelzebubs_avocado,that interesting i was looking briefly for a detailed account of what happened and did not find it do you have a link i mostly agree but i could also understand the interpretation that c unintentionally got the others killed without a good enough reason i think we should intervene if something is happening and it can be done without making matters worse but doing it proportionally and without escalating words to violence is important sjws like to call speech violence these days but they should learn to tell the difference and avoid escalating from one to the other an important rule of first aid is to avoid creating more victims public hate speech interventions should probably observe a similar principle ,8,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,sam did have his brother matt weinstein on the podcast it was a great interview matt has some sort of contrarian but seemingly well supported views on economics so perhaps it related to that ,2,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,i wonder at what point does everyone else get to play the reappropriation game it seems like with gay people this has already happened to some extent an example that comes to mind is when dan savage used to invite his readers to address him as hey faggot https en wikipedia org wiki savage love recapture of offensive words i do not feel the need to go around using the word but just pointing out that the norms around use of these kinds of words are pretty ad hoc it seems like to some extent they come down to what the group has negotiated with society and probably groups more stereotypically fear inspiring have an edge in those kinds of negotiations ,3,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,i am not sure where the difference is between this idea of racially motivated islamophobia and plain old tribalism if an animus against muslims were a result of their skin tone we could expect a similar animus against hindus who share that same skin tone with their pakistani neighbors ,2,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,i think this piece https www nytimes com 2017 06 04 arts television what was bill mahers big mistake html gets it about right over identification it cringeworthy but not evidence of racism edit it would be similar if a black comedian made a joke about himself being a holocaust survivor ,3,samharris

beelzebubs_avocado, i mean i do not like quotas either but i do not think the america has a formal quota system and yet the male suicide rate is also intolerably high i highly doubt dumping quotas alone is going to cut male suicides by a factor of 4 or more and if his assertion is that it is feminism that is killing men then what exactly is his proposed cure here you do not need formal quotas to achieve nearly the same result if there is very high consciousness that women are under represented in a field and the common interpretation is that it is due to sexism managers will feel pressure to hire women even if they get few female applicants i do not disagree with the overall goal of encouraging more women in fields where they may be under represented for contingent reasons but it seems like other parts of the process besides hiring like encouraging them to study the field and encouraging retention through making the workplace more accomodating might be more effective to make it happen ,1,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,and i am not advocating for any particular system just pointing out that there have been different systems in the past edit though i have also seen some criticism along the lines of that when there are new expensive apparatus that can be used that becomes the sexy thing to work on and they then tend to become overused particularly regarding fmris ,1,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,and i think i agree with you also then and our job and educational attainments sound similar i think of it all as being a matter of priorities and tradeoffs and i am happy to put a low priority on the parts that do not seem authentic to me i think i would call the values you are describing bourgeois but ayn rand pro business libertarianism conformity keeping up with the joneses and various flavors of protestantism seem to go into the mix to varying degrees also ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,i do not think there is an exact analogy between computer software and brain software since we cannot do a quick update on our brain software also computers are designed to be fairly general purpose whereas our brains evolved to do specific things which means that something like software information coming from natural selection is implicit in their structures if there is an analogy experience is the software and then the question of if the software is controlling the hardware or if the hardware is controlling the software becomes the nature nurture question which seems to be settled in favor of yes both ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado, but it also not like we are still doing relatively low cost double slit experiments like we did in the past either in physics sure but there is a lot to be discovered in psychology medicine etc that does not have to be super expensive a lot of the important research of tversky and kahneman and of haidt involved clever thought experiments and low cost surveys and the computing power available cheaply now is of course much more than what anyone had 50 or so years ago some powerful methods in biology and genetics seems to have become accessible to hobbyists bringing in the biohacking movement there is an appendix to tim ferris 4 hour body where he discusses how self experimentation can be useful and meaningful if the effect size is large enough he cites his experience with hooking himself up to a continuous blood glucose meter for days at a time as an example of seeing large effects that do not require a large n to achieve significance ,2,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,yes of course you need big grants or x prizes or crowdfunding or something to do bigger science and a lot of the discoveries before the 20th century look like low hanging fruit to us now but i think there is still a lot that could be discovered by independent scientists these days whether the institutions support this or hinder it is another question and of course there is the problem of weeding out crackpots and cheats ,2,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,i think you are making a hard to defend distinction between logical beliefs and illogical beliefs which is not meaningful on a psychological level the if you die in the name of allah you will go to heaven belief is logical if you accept certain axioms and suicide bombers and their families often seem quite sane i am not saying that we cannot get closer to truth by using better methods of course we can but that is apart from the psychology of belief ,3,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,you are assuming that free will is a binary thing i think it does not have to be if you have ever been drunk or feverish or a young child you have probably experienced a state of having less free will to take something separate but somewhat related at what point does an animal become a subject of moral concern clearly we do not worry about killing bacteria but many of us do have concerns about killing chimps or dolphins many others have concerns about all mammals etc just because there is not a clear dividing line does not mean it not a meaningful difference ,2,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,i think that a limited view of ideas and philosophy many philosophers saw philosophy as a way to affect the emotions and psychology for the better among other goals the stoics are a particular example to the point where key parts of their philosophy have been adopted by a branch of modern psychology sam often makes the point that ideas such as that if you blow yourself up for the cause you will go to heaven are important ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado, success is not likely to make you happy and i am determined to be as happy as i can during this all too short life so to hell with ambition and success be happy instead i think this is a view that may look different at different ages and after different experiences it easier to be young and poor than old and poor when young you also have fewer examples of peers who applied themselves and achieved things it also easier to take having money for granted if your family had it there is also the idea that happiness is something best approached obliquely or gained as a byproduct of doing meaningful things trying to seek it head on often seems difficult or to give short lived results i think success is not negatively correlated with happiness but is somewhat positively correlated with it on average of course there are happy poor people and unhappy rich people material success is helpful to having a good life but more so if you pursue things that are meaningful that also lead to success than if you just focus on making a lot of money and getting lots of stuff at all costs i think if you find a meaningful and realistic goal then the motivation tends to come trying to force it tends to lead to burnout so i think in the end i come down somewhere similar in terms of not being too hard on myself ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado, it obviously does not have free will this does not seem so obvious to me if by free will you mean having a soul then i suppose not but i do not believe in that and the rest of your post seems to anticipate that the machine could be designed to act a lot like a person with free will you seem to be saying that consciousness is the special sauce that makes a difference but what if it is just a function of the way our brains are structured there is a theory in neuroscience dahaene https en wikipedia org wiki stanislas dehaene that the function of consciousness is to integrate disparate brain modules and allow more complex forms of processing ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,we do not have a ghost in the machine sure but we do make choices and there appears to be someone making the choice of course you can say that the brain acting as a single entity is an illusion and that true to some extent as shown in split brain patients i think getting an accurate account of cognition requires describing how it actually works and not getting as hung up on whether it lives up to our folk mental models of how it works 100 for example instead of saying free will does not exist i think it more accurate to say free will is constrained and not quite what it appears in ways x y and z ,2,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,i think i agree but also i question the idea that there is this theoretical perfect predictability it is unfalsifiable and of no practical use and i have seen an article by a physicist explaining why it is based on a misunderstanding of modern physics i think it clear that we have degrees of freedom that are not absolute and that some people like addicts and children have fewer so you can still have empathy for people in tough situations without believing in hard determinism ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,but we do know that the way we think about events in our lives affects how we feel about them etc from cognitive therapy and stoicism so why dismiss the idea that belief in a philosophical idea might affect psychological and life outcomes edit typo,1,samharris

beelzebubs_avocado,all good points i guess i was picturing the old school classroom where the teacher asks questions some students put their hands up and the teacher does not necessarily call on the first one to put their hand up ,1,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,which is why before the big institutions a lot of science was done by the independently wealthy or those with connections to wealthy patrons it still got done and you might argue more effectively at least on a per capita basis without the time spent applying for grants and publishing papers with small results etc my advisor in grad school spent one month of each year on grant applications ,12,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,this reminds me of a conversation with a game designer he mentioned that some of the most popular games have a mix of skill and luck like backgammon ones that are pure skill like chess are only fun if the players are evenly matched and games of pure luck are not as rewarding there might be a way to bring that insight into classroom competition so that all the students have a chance to get some reinforcement the obvious way to do this would be to ask a mix of easy to hard questions ,9,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,while that the reason so many people are able to be employed as scientists the reason why people go into science is in large part because they like the idea of discovering new knowledge it certainly not for the big bucks ,15,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado,seems like a thoughtful statement more critical of us culture than obama tends to be but not as much as cornell west or ta nehisi coates i am tempted to reply with something like notallamericans but that largely beside the point he does not really call for any specific action other than to briefly mention the conversation and perhaps the implied imperative mentioning emmit till is to empathize with black people so there is not much to disagree with there it does look like trump election is encouraging this kind of thing though i am not sure i understand how exactly i hope this event raises consciousness in a productive way there have to be at least a few racist nba fans who think twice about their attitudes because of this i hope one day we can get to the point where something like this happens and it an annoyance but no more significant than getting your car broken into on the street because from a practical point of view it not more consequential than other forms of vandalism but of course it is a reminder of a painful history and of experiences that resonate with that history that are still happening to many today ,6,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,it looks like baby boomer college administrators who came out of the 60s anti authoritarian culture in some cases lack confidence in their own authority without boundaries being set young people can act like spoiled brats and this seems to be the progressive flavor of that kind of acting out ,5,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,so you are implying nothing about the relative moral standings of different actors on the world stage ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,i do not exactly disagree but i think my point stands it just does not make a lot of sense to overlay modern concepts on to a much different culture or does it would you say that most of the muslim and arab world is misogynist these days ,1,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,there is a risk of being ahistorical if you compare someone from the 19th century to current norms not a huge nietzsche fan but just a general caution my impression is that most people during his lifetime held something close to what we would now call traditional and essentialist views ,2,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado,why cannot both reasons preachy story and characters and bad publishing model be to blame and then a third one comes to mind video games now have better visuals than comic books and stories that are perhaps beginning to rival them it not new for marvel stories to have political content of course the x men were a parable about the need to protect minorities against prejudice but recent sjw politics seems especially unappealing to most people it good for virtue signaling and coercing thought policing but that not usually what people buy comic books for i think ,11,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,another approach given enough resources would be to decide that everyone is equally deserving of some help but also equally required to be accountable to community standards that would mean something like a ubi together with enforcing community standards re camping littering defecating in public etc those who do not want to are unable to work may find that their ubi goes a lot farther in lower cost of living places like stockton than in more expensive places like berkeley knowing that everyone is getting enough to live on should make panhandling go away ,1,bayarea

beelzebubs_avocado,yeah i am pretty sure even a very large person is not going to stop any trolley very effectively that is a serious threat to multiple other people the closest real life example i can think of was a cyclist who ran a red light and laid his bike down into pedestrians and killed an old person the main rule improvements i can think of there are to not run red lights at busy wide intersections and instead of laying the bike down and presenting the sharp chainring to pedestrians stay upright and slow down as quickly as possible edit there was on online quiz asking lots of trolley type questions with the context of a self driving car with failed brakes it seems to me it more important to either make the brakes more reliable and or program in the capability to skid the car to a stop sideways if brakes fail ,1,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, i mean the thing about this scenario and a lot of highly hypothetical scenarios is that they assume perfect knowledge about something that people are never going to have perfect knowledge about when making decisions i have often had that objection to the trolley problem in similar real life problems it a matter of probabilities and establishing a rule that will minimize harm overall ,1,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,i take your point and think it a good one in general perhaps i should have read all the linked research before coming to any conclusion but i did not see evidence the user i was responding to had gone that deep i just got the impression from the text of the discussion that he was choosing his examples to fit a narrative and disregarding others that might disconfirm it and by choosing to only argue a very narrow case where he seemed to think he had the advantage he seemed uncharitable to sam argument regardless he did bring up some good points that obviously need to be considered i would have been more sympathetic to his approach if he had taken a less maximalist approach to the discussion eg he could have said here are some factors that need to be weighed instead of here is why you are 100 wrong he was essentially accusing sam of shallow type 1 thinking and that does not ring true ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado, sure it reinforces the use of a lot of toxic labels but if it makes some of his supporters stop and re think their support of him then i say it fair play it essentially paints him as a weak hypocrite sorry did not watch the video but images alone are not necessarily reinforcing toxic labels for someone who sees nothing wrong with gays that image is just mildly amusing satire about an overly close relationship i am not 100 sure on this but that my take so far i would be interested to hear how gay people feel about it for someone who is homophobic it might be deeply disturbing to them and lead them toward an uncomfortable truth i do not see how it encourages anyone who is not already homophobic to become so calling him a faggot on the other hand seems like a poor tactic along with making fun of his fake tan or other superficial attributes when there are so many more substantive things to criticize ,1,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,well there are plenty of other objections i just mentioned one that some had not thought of there are other philosophies that seem to work well on small size like family level and time a few weeks or years scales but not large ones like communism and anyway i am sympathetic to consequentialism but find it interesting to poke at its limits ,1,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, schneier brackets pcness throughout the discussion not in this part one final cost security isn t the only thing we re trying to optimize there are other values at stake here there s a reason profiling is often against the law and that s because it is contrary to our country s values sometimes we might have to set aside those values but not for this i got the impression that he tries to have it both ways arguing that it a cost benefit analysis while putting his thumb on the scales in terms of estimating costs while also as above arguing that it a moral principle he refuses to engage sam on whether it also a moral principle in other contexts edit and like i wrote above i am happy to take the word of a security professional who has done a rigorous analysis and does not seem ideologically motivated but from this piece that not what it appears to provide ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,judges tend to be older than police due to retiring later edit and starting later so i would hope this is a generational thing that will go away as the oldsters retire ,3,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, it a reasonable and relevant question and does not have to imply that the victim is to blame it just seems to me that there are always people eager to infer the victim blaming yes agreed though a lot can be communicated in tone of voice or a look soon we will have a very well trained ai to conduct these interviews ,4,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,yielding to the expertise of a non pc expert seems like a good idea but after reading that exchange schneier reasoning seems pretty motivated by wanting to avoid any non pc opinion his main point seemed to be that adding another factor adds complexity which is a negative that is a good point but not an overwhelming one his other main point seemed to be an appeal to his own authority and claiming that sam analysis was based on emotion and his gut ,2,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,i sort of take your point but i think many of these comments that sound victim blaming are based on faulty logic it seems reasonable though of course not airtight to infer that someone going out dressed attractively is intending to attract a mate but that certainly does not mean that they consent to having sex with anyone when a sentence is reduced together with victim blaming type comments it appears the judge is using that faulty logic on the other hand suggesting reasonable and common precautions to avoid being hassled should not be called victim blaming but it tricky so i would probably stay out of it if my job depended on it i think there is some analogy to a guy dressed in an expensive suit walking through a poor part of town at night and getting mugged it reasonable to warn against doing that it not reasonable to reduce the sentence of the muggers because he was asking for it ,4,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, effective altruism movement and 80 000 hours i think it a good idea at least the part about vetting nonprofits and trying to pick ones that do the most good per donated i am a little unsure about the founder pledging to donate all of his income above 35k yr or so he seems like a well meaning and thoughtful guy but it almost seems like a publicity stunt and i am not sure if it an example that many people without inherited wealth would want to follow it seems to ignore the importance of local inequality for our psychological well being that is it would probably make everyone happier or at least not much unhappier to do this if everyone around them also did but doing it on your own means lowering your social standing unless your prestige comes from other things like starting a movement but to the extent that they can get more tech billionaires to follow in the steps of previous generations of industrialists that will be a good thing and if they discourage the practice of family foundations becoming sinecures for family members that will also be a good thing ,3,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, so the government leaders not caring about money would just stay in power and have no actual power as the corporate super ais would figure out how to get around all their foolish slow human brains so much like now but more so had not thought of the ai ceo angle does seem plausible though coo seems more likely you would probably still want a human in the loop so everyone does not get turned into paperclips seems like that would make reviving corporate social responsibility http www uclalawreview org false profits reviving the corporation e2 80 99s public purpose even more urgent since an ai would presumably be even better at pursuing narrow goals than current human leaders ,2,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,i can sympathize i have started sometimes hiding putting away but in a place that makes sense to me things when my wife leaves them out after i have repeatedly asked her to put them away it not a full solution but it a little bit satisfying i think to have deterrent value you have to make it more convenient to cooperate than to not cooperate the division of labor between awful difficult jobs that need to be done rarely and endless shit that has to be done daily does seem semi fair and that it kind of tracks with what you would expect lower and higher anxiety people to be good at but renegotiating division of labor from time to time as it sounds like you did to make sure it feels fair seems good ,2,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, rape of the earth is a metaphor using an image of humans as male and the earth as female so it implicitly related in the metaphor attitudes that lead to rape these seem to mainly be in our lack of empathy for male prisoners there are many jokes about the subject of course women are raped also and that is also terrible but pretty much no one condones it or jokes about it attitudes at work underneath environmental despoliation these seem rooted in either a frontier mindset of unlimited natural resources and or in overly business friendly policies i do not see much connection ,13,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado, there nothing you can say that just dismisses it though psychology and masculinity and how things things coalesce into behavior particularly on a large scale is interesting and the only reason you think it is not is because you have got an ideological ax to grind i suppose there may be something inherent to masculinity that can relate both rape of women and rape of the environment is interesting in the hand wavy unscientific sense that horoscopes are interesting but it strikes me as not even wrong in the sense that it cannot be falsified if you formulated it in a way that it could make predictions and be falsified then it would seem more scientifically interesting ,11,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado, i am certain that ideology is malleable in a way that hunger is not if you know a way to convince jihadists to become secular humanists i guess the pentagon would like to hire you i am all for trying various things but i am fairly unconvinced that draw mo contests are an effective way it might be effective if some large part of the world population participated but that unlikely ,1,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, in short it socially constructed in a quite literal sense the correlation did in fact turn out to exist i wo not quibble with that but surely these socially constructed questions cannot be a perfect test of the hardly rigorously defined psychological trait we call intelligence sure iq measurement is socially constructed but so is the mathematical notation that all hard science depends upon right so many things can be said to be socially constructed that the descriptor means a lot less than it appears to mean on first glance i do not think perfect test is the appropriate benchmark having predictive power would be a better one the classifications on the myers briggs test eg have been shown to have little predictive power but the big five personality traits model has done better if iq replicates as well as openness to experience conscientiousness extraversion agreeableness and neuroticism then in terms of psychometrics it fair to say it real i am not exactly disagreeing but i would place the emphasis a little differently ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,yeah i suspect that you might get nearly as good or better results by just saying trust your moral instincts except in cases where they have bad results and in those cases examine them more carefully from multiple ethical points of view i think it would also be helpful for everyone to understand that there are multiple sometimes conflicting moral foundations a la haidt each having some validity at least in an evolutionary context this is essentially promoting intellectual humility and self examination i would like to think that would result in avoiding moral catastrophes like the westboro baptist church and their more subtle fellow travelers as well as genocidal tribalists ,2,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, that would mean that 100 of the iq difference comes from differences in environment which is extraordinarily unlikely but for practical purposes 95 and 100 are nearly the same so from a social science and policy point of view the difference between 5 and 95 is almost the same as 0 and 100 particularly if there are effective interventions that reduce the environmental differences the main one that comes to mind is banning leaded gasoline and lead paint another one that would probably be quite effective though at a cost would be funding all public schools equally ,3,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,i think it worth worrying about but there is also the problem that if you tell people something that is obviously false for too long you lose credibility that was the problem with simplistic just say no and reefer madness anti drug campaigns i could imagine a similar response to other examples of denying fairly obvious reality being aware that one group has proportionally fewer members with elite levels of one attribute for whatever reason does not have to change how we treat individuals eg we do not prevent whites or south or east asians from playing basketball ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado, it is very highly likely that some of the iq difference among the racial groups can be attributed to differential presence of genes that contribute to intelligence genes which are seen in different proportions among the different racial groups this is where it gets a bit more controversial a lot rides on how much that some is if it 5 that very different for policy than if it 95 and it also matters a lot for policy whether we can affect the environmental part with the resources that can be marshalled ,7,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,i think i am not arguing against utilitarianism per se so much as a naive or overly confident application of it i think the farther we go from our familiar well known situations involving people we know well the more hypotheticals are involved so where you want to draw the line of too many hypotheticals becomes somewhat a matter of individual taste to take a realistic version of the trolley problem i would submit that our resources are better spent on maintaining our brakes than on practicing suicide driving also whether the other person is following the rules matters to how much we should go out of our way to help them i am not going to kill myself to save someone who jumps out into the street without warning and without having the right of way for most people when faced with that situation what you actually do and what i am pretty sure driving instructors recommend is hit the brakes and slow down as much as possible perhaps also turning gently if needed but without losing control or committing suicide and hope to reduce the harm i have been put in that situation by a racoon before and he lived to run across the road another day because the problem with swerving wildly is that the outcome is unpredictable you might very well take out a power pole that then knocks out power to a hospital or falls over and electrocutes pedestrians or swerve into opposing traffic etc etc a possibly ethically consequential decision that i have not seen discussed much is the choice of tires there is a pretty wide variety of tires to choose from some of which reduce the stopping distance significantly compared to others without costing much if at all more the downside is that they tend to not last as long or get quite as good mileage as harder tires so from that perspective there is an additional cost though it is perhaps outweighed by avoiding accidents ,2,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, it only works on certain scales and situations are you sure granted i prefer reading about trolley problems and gender politics in the blogosphere but whenever i read specifics on policy suggestions they often seem to work on a commonly accepted implied utilitarian basis heck perhaps even entire fields of economics this planet economy and its regulation by governments is the largest scale system we have to play with what kind of scale do you have in mind i do not have the idea fully worked out but here is an example we are beginning to discover that there are many exoplanets visible to us some of which might harbor life this means that there are potentially likely many many more beings out in the universe than on earth so by that logic we should put all of our resources toward helping them even if it means exhausting the resources of earth to build rockets etc of course a flaw in that view is that we might do more harm than good something that star trek anticipated but that is also a flaw in any real world version of a trolley problem when we try to kill one person to save several others what are the odds that will actually work or what are the consequences of training people to kill themselves instead of taking out two jaywalkers perhaps that training would result in more deaths overall or in the common case of feeding the hungry elsewhere in the world what are the odds that we create dependency instead of allowing feedback mechanisms like migration lowered fertility etc to respond to desertification that might not be the best example but the book dead aid makes a case for certain kinds of foreign aid being counterproductive ,2,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, i am not quite sure what you mean by a unilateral disarmament against liars but the main problem with using that game theory approach is that it never really sufficiently addresses the is ought problem game theory can tell you how people might act in a certain way but it takes an extra to justify whether we ought to act that way what i mean is that never lying means that you make yourself vulnerable to people who have no such scruples it is similar to pacifism it is a rule that would destroy a society if followed strictly because it would roll over for the next invaders game theory can suggest an equilibrium position when various players follow various rules rules can be evaluated based on the consequences of equilibrium position that they result in tit for tat has the advantage that it pushes the equilibrium toward more cooperation whether the others adopt it or not ,2,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,while i am sympathetic to punishing snowflakery i am not sure if encouraging provocations is the solution it seems like people like milo do not punish snowflakes so much stir up controversy and polarize things while lowering the level of discourse and furthering their own fame i would view it differently if they were bringing up challenging issues in a serious way like peter singer tends to do it seems like a utilitarian might be skeptical about publishing mohamed cartoons now that we know the consequences of doing so or at least i remember peter singer saying something to that effect on sam harris podcast is holding an ideology that leads to strong reactions against certain ideas or images that different from living in an area prone to famine neither is easy to change in the short term but neither is innate ,5,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,yeah i think it has become a part of our culture in much the same way that feminism has though later though our culture may not include parts of the south with heavy religious and scots irish influence it seems that abortion foes are usually making non utilitarian arguments against it ,2,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, is not this essentially the same reasoning as rule based utilitarianism though yes perhaps it seems like we have intuitions about morality and tend to find theoretical frameworks that more or less support those intuitions therefore those frameworks tend to converge on similar solutions the kant kantian principle of not treating people as means seems like a good one but you could say that is the case because people do not like being treated instrumentally and therefore you can subsume a principle like that into rule based utilitarianism if you want i think never lie as a strict rule is asinine though why does a murderer deserve to be treated with great respect and would not that be just unilateral disarmament against liars a game theoretical approach might suggest that tit for tat is a defensible edit and winning way to treat people ,2,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,thanks for the apparently informed reply do you mean that you are a professional ethicist for example if we tried maximising for median utility this paradox would be resolved and it would be just as utilitarian as before but could not that then lead to other problems such as exploitation of minorities by say harvesting their organs being considered moral i think utilitarianism is an interesting and often productive way to think about morality but like newtonian physics it only works on certain scales and situations it also does not account for many of our moral instincts see haidt that are perhaps also worth giving at least some consideration to even if you do not think they are ethically valid you might as well at least realize you will have to reckon with them utilitarianism tends to collide with reality when it insists we should care just as much about a random person on the other side of the world as about our friend or family member that just defies our biology and psychology in that case it seems to lead to a bloodless theoretical ethics that hardly anyone actually follows in real life and that was the impression i got when i briefly listened to the npr the ethicist http www npr org series 4464216 the ethicist podcast while i do not like a randian philosophy that encourages selfishness it seems like it needs to be acknowledged that we are not hive animals eg i would be more comfortable promoting charity but acknowledging that there are selfish motivations for it my comment about the utility monster sounding familiar was in relation to victim olympics type complaints i gather this is basically the demandingness objection https en wikipedia org wiki demandingness objection ,6,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,yeah i think rule based utilitarianism makes more sense than simple utilitarianism though it starts to look somewhat like other forms of ethics like kant categorical imperative because they both take the form of the world would be better if everyone followed this rule i think an even more useful form of ethics considers selfish motivations and game theory and asks what rules and enforcement mechanisms would make the world a better place given the amount of compliance that can be expected this leads to things like designing cars to not sacrifice their owners because who would want to buy ones that did let say i am starving and i have enough money to buy a meal there nothing preventing a wealthy person from buying all the food with no regard for my suffering or well being ultimately what can prevent this is revolution libertarianism seems imprudent even from a selfish perspective because it does not do much to address that risk ,3,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, but we did not see food stockpiling on any noticeable scale until farming was a thing i guess that because farming many crops results in a big harvest once or twice a year vs gathering many things with different seasons ,1,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado,seems like a combination of a reasonable observation that project managing is work with some typical blank slate dogma and yes there is a treatment of problems of women that is very different from how mens problems are allowed to be discussed a similarly one sided blaming of mens problems on women would be greeted with near universal derision the piece could have been shorted shortened 90 by proposing a solution division of responsibility for chores so that no one has to be in the project manager role there is no mention of the cognitive load required to anticipate needs and fill them i doubt you can win on facebook with this one ,17,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,relevant and likely of interest https dataskeptic com blog episodes 2017 opinion polling for presidential elections opinion polling for presidential elections recently we have seen opinion polls come under some skepticism but is that skepticism truly justified the recent brexit referendum and us 2016 presidential election are examples where some claim the polls got it wrong this episode explores this idea thanks to our guests idrees kahloon jill darling and ernie tedeschi other references mentioned in the show the usc dornsife l a times poll the nyt upshot piece by nate cohn about one usc lat poll participant distorting results ernie tedeschi re weighting of the usc lat poll how much the polls missed by in every state putting the polling miss of the 2016 election in perspective the polls missed trump we asked pollsters why mona chalabi data editor for the guardian on the partially derivative podcast how a mid sized error led to a rash of bad forecasts model talk debriefs the 2016 results presidential forecast post mortem keys to the white house,1,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,the risk from terrorism is often compared to risks from things like accidents or natural disasters and found wanting in that comparison the difference is that while it hard to prevent accidents due to activities people do willingly and hard to snuff out hurricanes at least in theory something can be done about terrorists so the two kinds of risks are not necessarily comparable can something be done about the republicans maybe but probably not with hyperbolic rhetoric like this ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado, or take the women and children first example that gets used this is associated mostly with the titanic which was notable because it was an exception to what usually happened source while it does not seem to have been a universal or formalized rule there are multiple examples https en wikipedia org wiki women and children first where the practice was followed in a crisis ,3,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,is the system of mating where women do the choosing not an institutionalized power structure and there would seem to be some significant exceptions to the idea that being involved in warfare is a desirable thing there have been many slave and conscript soldiers there has been a social narrative about honor that encourages self sacrifice but that propaganda ,8,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, this connection between the aristocracy and horses is really a hangover from the use of calvary as military power it the wallpaper to cover the dirty secret of oppression is it a secret i am thinking in ye olde days a parade with horses and cavalry officers was the equivalent of north korea parading missiles down the streets ,2,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado,yes intersex is a physical reality that exists at birth and has often been glossed over in documents is nonbinary the gender counterpart of intersex i am not read up enough on the matter to know i do not envy the database designer in this case i would be tempted to just add a third category other and a comments field ,3,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, i think the best course of action is just better nutritional education in school so that more and more people can grow up knowing that eating a loaf of bread is not a good meal also public education aimed at parents and taxes on sugar and processed foods ,2,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,a relationship involves an implied if not written contract if both adult parties freely agree to the terms then who is to say it not allowed if you only expect benefits and no obligations from a relationship you may find it harder to find a partner or have to settle for one who is less ideal in some respects but everyone has their own priorities ,7,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,well yes of course that is also trivially true ,3,samharris

beelzebubs_avocado,this is not really an idle thought is it is not it a firmly established piece of feminist ideology i would be interested to know if it accepted by most forms of feminism or only some that homophobia misogyny ,2,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,yeah if only he had the self control of angela merkel edit i mean i do not actually want a more successful controlled version of the narcissist in chief but i do admire merkel self possession ,2,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, homophobia is rooted in hatred of feminine or womanly men citation i would argue it stems from religious works like the bible and the quran i also think it is looked down on because it is pleasure over purpose similar to many other activities that are common to look down on for that reason alcohol drugs pointless hobbies what is your reasoning for your statements i kind of agree with you re the religious source i would put the ultimate source deeper at our instinctive uneasiness with things that defy categories in a similar way to the uncanny valley add to that the emotional charge often given to things related to sexuality then culture and religion shape that uneasiness in a certain way ,4,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, the trend over time is not the issue i get the impression that it is a big issue politically i suspect the trend over time has been fairly flat but the perception of the problem has increased with more social media etc and i actually think it good that our tolerance for the problem is reducing but i think it would probably be easier to find common ground with police groups if the facts could be agreed upon if police shootings against blacks are being underreported then the conclusions of the paper could be invalid well of course that conclusion could be true if that hypothetical were the case but given how sensationalized police shootings against blacks tend to be the opposite seems more likely ,1,NeutralPolitics
beelzebubs_avocado,sure but would not that limitation apply at least as much the farther back in the past you go so while the total number is probably low the trend over time should not suffer from that problem ,5,NeutralPolitics
beelzebubs_avocado,does not the first sentence of your comment kind of disagree with the last clause unless you mean it in the sense of this is a good article that effectively lays out arguments whose gendered application i disagree with ,3,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,you have a point but it would make the parties in the olympic village a lot less fun ,2,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, there are basically no competitive physical activities where women consistently perform better than men the recent outside magazine has a girl power theme to it the future is female https www outsideonline com 2172816 future female and these 40 women are proof and claims in one piece that women have an advantage in ultra long distance events but that does not seem to be reflected in the records https en wikipedia org wiki ultramarathon so i guess you are right on that score i think people who are not at a professional level should be encouraged to enjoy sports because they are fun and have health benefits etc whether female pro athletes should expect as much money fame and sponsorship as better male pro athletes is another question it hard to see how fairness as usually understood comes into whether someone gets paid 1 million or 10 million for kicking a ball the big money comes from entertainment value which fans tend to decide with their feet clicks and purchases ,3,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,i would not normally align myself with marxist feminism or freudian analysis but i agreed with nearly everything she said or at least it seemed fair minded ,1,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, men prioritization of earnings and preference for leadership roles seems to exist but the gender difference is quite small this is surprising i tried to look at the study but it behind a paywall i could imagine two potential problems with the analysis 1 it appears to be self reporting it costs a lot more than just saying you want to be a leader to become one i am sure if you asked a lot of kids if they would like to own a ferrari one day many would say yes few will actually prioritize resources to do so 2 it looks at average values even if the averages are close if the variance is greater for men and top positions require outliers on leadership metrics that could lead to a significant imbalance and d no doubt there is also some sexism ,3,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,i cannot say there is much surprising in this piece other than the ad hominem attack on the whole field of philosophy that one is bold ,10,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,yes i realize that this part of the argument taken out of context can be made to sound like a terf one as is the paper theme which is why the other part is crucial just off the top of my head i have the impression there are thousands of people in the us with gender dysphoria it is estimated that about 0 005 to 0 014 of people assigned male at birth and 0 002 to 0 003 of people assigned female at birth would be diagnosed with gender dysphoria based on 2013 diagnostic criteria https en wikipedia org wiki gender dysphoria so using the lower bounds from the estimates quoted above on the wiki page gives 12 000 americans with gender dysphoria they are known to be at very high risk of suicide studies indicate that transgender people have an extremely high rate of suicide attempts one study of 6 450 transgender people in the united states found 41 had attempted suicide compared to a national average of 1 6 https en wikipedia org wiki gender dysphoria signs and symptoms i have read about one person with racial dysphoria which puts it in the realm of not worth seriously considering as a thing to me searching wikipedia yields the page racial dysphoria does not exist so in either case i do not think we are philosophically required to accept self identification but if anyone could use some sympathy it transgender people i think that kind of sympathy can be imposed upon when it comes to a multitude of pronouns but i think it fine to call someone a trans woman instead of a man if that what they prefer ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado, changing the culture to promote people who accept their part of the blame and strive to learn from their mistakes may result in more women in leadership positions if it does great but more importantly it could result in a better kind of leaders female and male i would agree this would be a good outcome but it seems like often the tone is set from the top from the founder s and it seems like at least in recent years a lot of founders have fairly extreme personalities it takes a good helping of hubris to set out to disrupt an established industry steve jobs dov charney and travis kalanick come to mind i am not saying we should excuse bad behavior in founders but it is confounding how excess and rule breaking sometimes succeeds what has to happen to have more women founders i have seen problems with the vc world being a boys club cited as reasons for the lack but when you can crowdfund a project fairly easily that seems like a less compelling explanation ,2,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,yeah hh seems similar in intent and effect to a popular history book or historical film i think there tends to be more nuance and attention to detail than in most historical movies where the plot and characters are more important and the main character flaws tend to be omitted ,3,dancarlin
beelzebubs_avocado,i would describe myself somewhat similarly except that one thing i noticed is that i became more aware of my emotions by being encouraged forced to talk about them by girlfriends this is i suppose useful for those kind of talks and good for general self awareness but i am not sure i was suffering before making that change i think people who seem overly emotional demonstrative are actually more aroused to use the technical physiology term than i am but not because their initial emotion is necessarily stronger the difference is that they tend to reinforce and amplify it with an internal monologue that gives the emotion primary importance instead of focusing on the objective situation of course i do not always succeed at this but i tend to grit my teeth instead of yelling at a cop who pulled me over for going 1 mph over the limit there are also the people who seem to be performing an emotion that is socially useful like acting really really really happy to see everyone i sort of wish i could muster the energy for that ,3,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, i think one of the issues about stoicism is that having the appearance of emotional stability without that actually being someone emotional state can mask when there are serious problems going on underneath i think if someone is stoic and that is truly reflecting their emotional maturity and inner dialogue it is not harmful at all and in many cases could be desirable i wish the same word stoic were not used for the two things one an inner and outer state and the other a false front ,2,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, i have seen other people predominantly women break down over relatively trivial things to understand the source of this behavior consider who benefits from it in many cases it results in sympathy and the overly emotional person getting their way this tactic probably has an evolved basis as well as a learned component it can also also be unlearned ,3,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,the most important difference to me between the transgender person and the transracial person is that gender dysphoria is a recognized form of suffering with a biological basis and thus people who have it can legitimately make a claim on our sympathy to accept their self identification in a non traditional way on the other hand there is no such recognition of racial dysphoria or plausible biological basis for it it is also understandable that members of a discriminated against minority group might be reluctant to grant membership in their group to someone who does not unwillingly face the same discrimination ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,the part about leaderless groups picking a narcissist is a bit too close to home lately one reference that i checked did not check out that well the author argues that women should make better leaders because the best leaders are usually humble and whether through nature or nurture humility is a much more common feature in women than men but the article linked says this requires not only humility but intense professional will while women may have a much bigger supply of humility the intensity or obsessiveness part could be harder to find boards of directors typically believe that transforming a company from good to great requires an extreme personality an egocentric chief to lead the corporate charge think chainsaw ai dunlap or lee iacocca but that s not the case says author and leadership expert jim collins the essential ingredient for taking a company to greatness is having a level 5 leader an executive in whom extreme personal humility blends paradoxically with intense professional will in this 2001 article collins paints a compelling and counterintuitive portrait of the skills and personality traits necessary for effective leadership he identifies the characteristics common to level 5 leaders humility will ferocious resolve and the tendency to give credit to others while assigning blame to themselves ,14,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, this is not about me getting my feelings hurt so please do not try to imply that i am just being overemotional here to dismiss my point i think either i expressed myself poorly or you are being uncharitable or perhaps both i was thinking of you being concerned for the feelings of a third party not trying to make it about you you did talk about descriptors being insulting though so that does imply someone being insulted many of the complaints about supposedly overly feminized schools are actually problems for female students also girls might be naturally better at sitting still or obeying and doing mindless busy work but that does not necessarily mean those are good tools for teaching girls to actually learn and think either i do not know enough about the details to know how often this is the case seems like speculation characterizing poor teaching methods as feminine does not solve any of the problems in our education system at all for girls or boys how about substituting methods producing better grades and graduation rates for girls other than being a mouthful that is accurate no while grades and graduation rates are not a perfect measure of learning they are important enough that colleges refer to them seriously in reviewing applications saying that it not a gender problem but a poor teaching methods problem strikes me a bit as saying that there is not a problem of cops shooting unarmed black men there is just a problem of poorly trained cops that may even be true to a fair degree but it likely to be called derailing and piss people off ,12,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,in most cases are not those long lists meant to exclude without naming the normies ,0,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,it sounds like maybe you are making a distinction between organizing based on identity in a group as a tactic to achieve a well defined and laudable goal vs dividing people into groups as an end in itself or to make it easier to bully or control them i have been watching dear white people on netlix recently and it takes on a lot of these issues in an engaging way edit i think this piece https medium com lportwoodstacer the productivity of protest 5d7b974333f6 gets at the same dichotomy somewhat the key thing i learned from my research though is that identity and community and personal pleasure are not enough to sustain activist causes without clear moral commitments and strategic communication of political ideals social movements become indistinguishable from subcultures subcultures communicate social dissent in their own way but often in codes that are cryptic to the general public this is by design and it s what helps subcultures survive but whereas subcultures gain meaning from the boundaries they maintain between themselves and the mainstream social movements can only succeed if they can convert outsiders to insiders in mass quantities cryptic codes won t do clear communication is vital ,3,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado, though most anti traditional communities strike me as something i would rather not be part of maybe except the metal community if they are anti traditional they tend to be excruciatingly earnest which i find a turnoff ,2,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, it totally possible that different teaching styles might statistically affect girls and boys differently i hope that any time you see me write about properties of a large group you assume a knowledge of variation and statistical properties of groups if you are just reminding other readers then fair enough being able to sit still is a practical skill sure dogs are good at it too being praised for being good at sitting still is not really insulting but it pretty weak praise sitting still is pretty much the most boring dull skill in the universe do not you think i guess but this comes across a bit as anything that is not glowing praise is insulting writing about boys and men would be quite different if it were held to this standard i might say that on average boys are more inclined to risk taking that not exactly a pure positive but it accurate which i think is far more important than whether someone feelings are hurt i suppose you could interpret less propensity to risk taking as dullness or as being smart it something that has positives and negatives in different situations ,9,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,i doubt the change was very deliberate and i can see your point about it sounding insulting but i wonder what is at the root of that impression let take just one example to keep it simple if one change that has been described as important is enforcing sitting still how is that insulting do you think it is inaccurate that it would affect the sexes differently ,14,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, the essential precepts of mgtow are financial independence rejection of chivalry social preconceptions of what a man should be and consumer culture which defines masculinity by a man s house car clothes watch or cologne it is the refusal to be shamed into conventional compliance by being told to man up it interesting how there is a fair bit of overlap between these ideals and hippie ideals at first i did not think financial independence matched up with hippies but then i thought of the back to the land movement though that is a different kind of financial independence and did not always work out that well for the hippies and of course it leaves out the free love part ,6,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,the other side of that slippery slope though is that if no concrete difference is needed it opens the door to people identifying as space aliens and attack helicopters and any philosophical stance that allows that seems not serious to me ,1,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, i do not think it fair to see them all as teenagers fucking shit up out of spite they like donald trump and what he says resonates with them that includes building a silly wall on the border to protect them from crime and drugs because it coming by foot from mexico bringing their jobs back because reviving the coal industry is within the realm of possibilities and the muslim ban because terrorists come in posing as refugees having read about and talked to trump supporters i do not think those assumptions are safe to make some voted for him despite personally disliking him some wanted stricter enforcement of immigration laws and saw the wall as a metaphor for that some saw an america first despite the creepy historical connotations policy as generally discouraging offshoring and outsourcing which almost seems to be working a little some like sam wanted a more honest conversation about jihadists and islamists and then the degree to which they have been vilified by members of the left has probably confirmed their new tribal affiliation i hope they see the lack of getting much constructive done and doing harmful things as evidence that they made a mistake but the polls do not seem to be showing that so far ,2,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,i think the democratic party has gotten on the wrong track and sjwism is just a symptom of that so sure sjws were not directly the cause of the loss but the focus of the party led to both them being accepted more or less and the loss the wrong track involved siding more with big business and less with labor and the middle class that approach raked in a lot of campaign cash for sure but it led a lot of voters to feel like no one was on their side without being really a party of the economic left anymore what was left was calling the other party racist and sexist there were of course some good reasons for it with the repubs southern strategy anti abortion ways etc but that argument amounts to vote for us because the other guys are even bigger assholes not the most compelling message especially when people are falling out of the middle class ,2,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,i think it a tension between eg one person freedom to express themselves and another person expectation to not be harassed there is a balance to be struck there and pretending that any argument pulling the other direction is pure evil is a problem in either direction genuinely believing something does not make it true or founded in defensible ethics ,2,samharris

beelzebubs_avocado,i could imagine a temptation to have anti cruelty to robots laws modeled after animal cruelty laws i think this would be at least partly based on an illusion but the illusion might be so strong that we would be very tempted to outlaw such disturbing behavior my impression is that most movies tv shows involving cruelty to robots take the side of the robot victims westworld and hvmans are the ones that comes to mind immediately blade runner and ai were more ambivalent ,2,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, people should be allowed to get off how they want in private as long as they are not hurting anyone from a legal perspective sure from a public health and good of society perspective it might be a little different we have been hearing reports of kids these days being affected in negative ways eg by the glut of easily available free internet porn of course i am probably more concerned with the more general issue of internet screen addiction i would like think the solution to that is more about public education and things like the time well spent project ,2,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,i think you make good points where i start to get uneasy is when plastic surgery becomes expected ,6,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,yeah agreed a law being popularly ignored is more of a indication that it might not be just than a proof another point though is that we should not make laws that we wo not have the political will to actually enforce this is similar to saying do not go to war unless it an existential threat and there will be political will to see it through because when laws mostly are not enforced that opens the door to selective enforcement which can be quite unjust it also tends to lead to spending resources without much to show for it this is because for a deterrent to change behavior it has to be somewhat likely to catch someone or the penalty has to be so harsh the idea of harm reduction which i think is generally good can lead to some absurd places i heard a friend who would worked for a soros ngo involved in needle exchanges etc musing about how to do harm reduction for vampires who ritually drink each others blood i dunno pasteurize it ,1,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,my understanding from talking to a non expert friend who was offered the job is that liquor brand ambassadors are hired more for being fun to hang out with than for their knowledge of the liquor if she really wanted to get more respect at first glance it seems like she could alter her look to look less young and cute but presumably there are some benefits from that or she just enjoys trolling stereotypes culture jamming ,10,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado,i can agree with the sentiment i think one thing that makes me feel a bit better about it is identifying people of good faith who have a different perspective and trying to ignore those who do not argue in good faith or read charitably i think you are one of the good ones u not just amwac another thing that has helped is avoiding the subs where misandry and misogyny goes unchecked i guess that is also a way to ignore those who do not argue in good faith or read charitably i would be happy if more activists on both sides would have an attitude something like the other side also has valid issues but i am mainly focused on addressing the issues of my side that would allow for more peaceful coexistence ,7,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, i have never really accepted the people will just do it illegally argument i suppose it pragmatism http www iep utm edu pragmati if criminalizing something has the actual outcome of adding more netsuffering to the world then according to that philosophy that is a bad thing i suppose the counterexample is that this approach combined with utilitarianism would not prevent oppressing a minority to the benefit of the majority it might be ethical in another sense if something approaching a majority of people are violating a law then it possible that it an overly intrusive and or unjust law or at least that is how it feels to many people overly low speed limits on highways come to mind as an example of that personally i think individual rights are important but within limits set by rights it helpful to be pragmatic of course on the abortion question a lot hinges on who is considered a person but that another long discussion already done to death ,2,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado, i am just wondering if there some hypothetical conversation sam could have that would further help me find the right balance between seeing all the flaws of islam without having a moral or intellectual over reaction to them i would guess that you might get that more from reading sam muslim friends like maajid have you read the future of tolerance by both of them it quite short and an interesting conversation there are certainly inside perspectives that are valuable and of course traveling in a majority muslim country and getting to know some locals would tend to dispel stereotypes you are tempted to hold ,2,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado, should do this even in cases where doing so is likely to have net negative real world consequences i do not think so but in the face of uncertainty which is most of the time i would err on the side of telling the truth as much as possible i suppose a classic example is holding draw mo contests i do not think the originator of the danish mohammed cartoons was in the wrong since he did not anticipate such a violent reaction but now that we know how such things can be used as propaganda by islamists and lead to violent riots it seems more ethically grey it could be argued that even though such provocations might lead to more suffering in the short term they would lead to winning the battle of ideas in the long term i am skeptical about that but it at least seems like a plausible argument there is a difference between telling the truth and deliberate provocations and unless the provocations can be shown to be a constructive tactic they probably fall into that category of best avoided or at least prudent to avoid ,2,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,your argument that it reasonable to be defensive at times makes sense i think i got that before but did not acknowledge it enough it reminds me of the human tendency to be alert to conspiracies being described in a recent article as an evolved response to our ancestors having dealt with or avoided conspiracies against them in early human groups i certainly have had that experience and reacted in the way you describe many times but there are always edge cases and the intent is not always that clear and in online discussions the risks and rewards are pretty different there is little real risk other than getting aggravated or doxxed and the main rewards are learning new things sharpening your logic and convincing others often not the one you are arguing with so i aspire to avoid the defensive response especially online it often seems like a better use of time to ignore someone attacking you unreasonably online ,2,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,is there a name for your kind of feminism i may be interested in signing up i think it would be accurate to describe extremes of masculinity as hypermasculinity and it can be a positive in certain situations it seems to work ok for martial artists and certain types of soldiers they may have difficulties switching it off in other situations and it worth trying to mitigate that there tends to be an assumption that stoicism is a negative but the negative version is just repression posing as true stoicism as described by ancient greek philosophers and elaborated by cognitive therapists today ,1,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,i agree that it seems like defensiveness about beliefs that form part of one identity whether it good to identify with beliefs is another matter i try not to get too attached to most of them but then i have never found chest thumping one upsmanship that engaging as much as i intellectually realize it part of our primate heritage then there is the fact that the backfire effect has not replicated well https www poynter org 2016 fact checking doesnt backfire new study suggests 436983 ,4,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, the historical background of women being largely excluded from positions of power general stereotypes about men making better leaders being associated with power etc those seem plausible on the other hand it sometimes seems like female leaders have some advantages this seems to be particularly an advantage if they are good looking leading to lots of flattering photos and a halo effect and or if their sex confers them authority to speak about gender issues or sell products to women your point about varying by industry is a very good one the lack of women in tech has been in the news a lot in recent years but the nonprofit sector from what i have seen is dominated by women it does not pay as well but the work weeks seem to be much more reasonable ,1,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado,well if you are mixed race like our recent president you kind of can but claiming to have heritage you do not for gain seems wrong edit why is it wrong i think it similar to the concept of stolen valor claiming to have endured hardships that you did not is bound to be found offensive by many people especially those who have actually endured them whether being a very light skinned black woman involves necessarily enduring more hardships than average all else being equal is an open question ,2,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, the other side would likely argue that the same applies for top achievers as well meaning that top achieving women have it harder than top achieving men i am sure some anecdotes could be produced but how would you really know since self reporting is so inaccurate measure levels of stress hormones i realize you are not making that claim but i am tempted to question it anyway after a little googling i did not find a study that does that but there was one mentioning that workers at higher levels in a hierarchy have less stress than those lower down there was another mentioning that female rats and humans have more anxiety and depression than their male counterparts so it possible they do have it harder but not necessarily because of the patriarchy ,2,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado,then again it could be encouraging some of our worst tendencies toward delusions of super competence ,1,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,mostly agree but it still is probably not allowed under many rights based ethical systems to treat people differently based on membership in a group they had no control over or at least that is part of the rationale for wanting to outlaw pre existing condition exclusions from medical insurance and for protecting certain observed to be discriminated against groups from discrimination that is a separate thing from using facts about outcomes to decide whether a system is biased it may well be but overall outcomes should not function as standalone evidence also if outcomes are the only source of the observed to be discriminated against mentioned above then that can be a problem this seems relevant to the idea of whitewashing in hollywood where there are not a ton of roles for asian actors and there is major controversy if a white actor is cast for an asian character the main source edit of the conclusion that there is bias seems to be the small number of top asian actors if similar logic were followed we could conclude that eg white people are discriminated against in basketball ,2,samharris

beelzebubs_avocado,it sounds like you are doing it right by encouraging her to affect positively what she can what looks odd to me is staged and edited selfies on social media that get loads of you are so beautiful type comments it just looks like unseemly validation seeking and encouragement of identification with shallow things though after spending some time in r fitness i guess i should not say much ,3,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado,it not hard to see that foreign and domestic policy are different my point was more about his being morally complicit by being a citizen of a country he tends to call things like the greatest terrorist state looking through a bunch of his quotes i find that i agree with many of them so i guess much of my dislike comes from his vilification of others such as sam in their exchange plainly there is no point pretending to have a rational discussion but i do think you would do your readers a favor if you presented your tale about why clinton bombed al shifa and his grand humanitarianism that is surely the least you can do given your refusal to withdraw what you know to be completely false charges and a display of moral and ethical righteousness it might just be that his actions do not quite live up to the strength of his rhetoric ,1,samharris

beelzebubs_avocado,i understand what you meant but i think my point still stands which is that biological underpinnings could be found for cross cultural commonalities among men masculinity is not biological appears to be categorical but is actually much more nuanced to the point of being hard to disagree with much like gender is a social construct i suppose trans people are the prime example for gender not being linked to biology but i am pretty sure it is linked to biology we just do not understand all the details of how gender dysphoria arises and works and a lot of the things that boys and men get criticized for tend to be the things that are not easily unlearned otherwise they would have been socialized out at an early age ,3,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado, what is masculine changes from culture to culture this is much like saying emotions change from culture to culture and some people might agree but paul ekman was able to identify a basic set of emotions that are shared by all cultures overlaid on top of that of course there are different cultural approaches to those emotions and the fact that there are non neurotypical people like autistics who do not seem to express some emotions does not take away from this observation i am pretty sure something analogous could be found re masculinity and femininity as biological things shared by the great majority of humans the fact that there are trans and intersex people does not mean the two main modes are meaningless ,3,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, in addition he criticizes the us more because he thinks your responsible for your own actions and if your in the us you have the power to change us policies a masochist would say that though this quote from his wiki page probably describes the tonal issue better than i did chomsky colleague steven pinker has said that he portrays people who disagree with him as stupid or evil using withering scorn in his rhetoric and that this contributes to the extreme reactions that he generates from his critics he seems to prefer to preach to the choir chomsky avoids attending academic conferences including left oriented ones such as the socialist scholars conference preferring to speak to activist groups or hold university seminars for mass audiences he is no doubt a smart guy but he does not seem interested or skilled at pitching his message to those not already sympathetic to it to give a contrast tristan harris http www timewellspent io is someone who is bringing a message that is very critical of the actions of some very big businesses but is able to do it in a way that is so much easier to take on board ,0,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,not sam but i can relate a bit to a visceral dislike of some of chomsky writing about foreign policy it just seems so masochistic and manichean if the us is so evil and no doubt it has many flaws as do all nations to varying degrees why live here he surely has options and his writing about israel seems to have a similar kind of animus attached to it ,2,samharris

beelzebubs_avocado,ok i think we mostly agree then paglia short statement is not universally applicable it could be qualified to you are responsible for how people treat you to the degree that you can foreseeably affect it of course there are real victims and we should be sympathetic toward them and try to prevent them being victimized and punish perpetrators but if someone does not think they are a victim we should not try to convince them they are in most cases that would be just increasing the suffering in the world ,9,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,not conclusive or anything but i just ran across this very critical david frum review of charles murray 2012 book coming apart http www thedailybeast com articles 2012 02 06 charles murray book review to be fair i think murray addressed some of the things frum says he left out in the interview ,2,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado, i categorically disagree with her when she says you are responsible for how people treat you it seems like most people find this easy to take on board when applied to a young man who dresses poorly and prefers to get stoned and play video games to more socially sanctioned activities but if this kind of expectation of agency is applied to women it is often called victim blaming it makes me think of the idea of internal vs external locus of control from psychology paglia seems to be arguing for having an internal one which some studies have shown to be useful in learning and dealing with spinal cord injuries https en wikipedia org wiki locus of control,14,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,free markets need some rules to operate well so that you are not dealing with counterfeit bills and milk amazon and ebay are much more successful or at least better experiences than craigslist because they incorporate accountability in the process i have some faith that the problem can be reduced especially if the public keeps the pressure on the huge tech companies involved on the other hand eric weinstein whose views i generally respect seems to see authoritarian crackdowns on free speech in the offing https twitter com ericrweinstein eric weinstein verified account ericrweinstein apr 25 uncritical news today of google rolling out algos to promote authoritative over offensive content surprised do not be it on script eric weinsteinverified account ericrweinstein it would appear we are being psychologically prepared for a change in the algorithms that direct our attention ,1,samharris

beelzebubs_avocado,i think it more a matter of intellectual curiosity which means that reasoning is more motivated by truth seeking than feelz seeking i think being smart is probably necessary but not sufficient to have this quality on the other hand there are people who are not very smart or informed and realize it they might not make great contributions but they are less likely than others to make things worse ,2,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,hitch came to mind for me too i saw him once debate in favor of the iraq war live and while i thought he was wrong on that subject i admired the verve with which he played the part ,7,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,she did sort of write a book on the subject https en wikipedia org wiki sexual personae,3,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,one way of looking at it is that it is in the interest of the better off to have a progressive tax system that reduces inequality to some degree to reduce the chance of violent or democratic populist revolution as well as the psychic costs of stepping over the poor in the streets what degree is optimal is of course a subject for discussion but i just wanted to point out that you can help others out of selfish motivations if that makes more sense to you ,1,AskTrumpSupporters
beelzebubs_avocado,agreed sometimes the very clever are also very clever at fooling themselves ,1,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,ok yeah that sounds pretty bad though you can also find some peter singer or terf quotes that sound nearly as bad out of context or maybe even in context it almost sounds like a parody of singer writing i am not familiar with this guy writing so maybe the lynching is justified i gather keith ellison wrote some controversial things early in his career but i was prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt that he would since matured i think the way things are going the chances of any of us having something embarrassing made public eventually will approach 100 so i hope our default position on it eventually approaches something like compassion ,2,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, i have not seen a left wing vision which seeks peace and tolerance and also adequately acknowledges the fact that humans are neither peaceful nor tolerant this might be it https en wikipedia org wiki a darwinian left too bad it has not really caught on i have tried to understand what the anarchists have in mind for society and have not come up with much beyond fight club i am told their ideal society is republican spain which existed for a few years in spain it sounds ok but did not seem able to defend itself i take your point re school yard bullies but so far have not the alt right folks been mostly keyboard warriors if they were to do actual violence that would be different but i would like to see the police deal with it as a first resort ,1,dancarlin
beelzebubs_avocado,ok but here is a heuristic to tell if someone is intellectually curious more than dogmatic they change their views or at least recognize they might be wrong to accommodate new information instead of always denying the new information ,1,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, again polling is an exercise in sampling it is not an exercise in model building as is creating a pro forma financial statement about undeterminable events nor is it an exercise in pure math as is quantum physics or calculating odds at the craps table i suppose if you only want to answer the question which candidate is more likely to win then you just pick the best polls in all the states and come up with an a or b answer but if you want to know the odds then you have to look at all the possibilities and see how likely each one is and tally them up but from what the 538 folks say they were doing more than that by including assumptions based on results in past elections which had been predictive in the past with more normal politicians but this election had a very abnormal politician and russian and fbi help etc so i think they could be accused of over fitting the data at least in hindsight at least i am pretty sure this is a risk that silver is not unaware of having read his book ,3,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,well they are both stating the obvious but the first one is repeating a dumb talking point ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,i was referring to the first sentence the second sentence is just stating the obvious which was also stated in the interview probably multiple times edit hint what would it mean if the variation within populations were not greater than the variation between populations ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado, if you are a pollster you either ask the right questions allowing you to make the right prediction or you did not it kinda that simple really well that would work if you were able to poll every voter but you are not so you are stuck having to estimate the likelihood of results based on your sample size how representative it is etc if you have a better method of polling and can execute on it you should of course go and get rich i saw an an op ed saying that 538 was encouraging too much reliance on their model and polling and causing activists and voters to become complacent which i have some sympathy for so if that what you mean by ort of bs then i guess we sort of agree ,5,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,my understanding is the electoral college and apportioning electors the way it done was done to make it politically palatable to all of the colonies so that they would sign the consitution so you could perhaps describe it the way you did but it was historically contingent if the 13 colonies had all had equal populations there would have been little need s for such a complex system ,0,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, but how else will i fuel my i am an opposition to the brown shirts fantasies by wearing black shirts duh ,4,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,well sort of the 538 model was giving odds of the various outcomes based on the available information which included results from past elections just because the model said there were 3 1 odds of clinton winning it hard to say if those odds are wrong from one roll of the dice after the election of course the reasons for clinton losing became very obvious but there has to be some hindsight bias at work there ,5,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,yeah the piece briefly alluded to the idea that he might have become embarrassed by the direction the sub he started went but that did not stop the author from going full guilt by association he was sloppy about keeping pseudonymity and no this is not a challenge to try to dox me linking to his band page and his campaign page ,2,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,mostly agreed but i would be glad to oppose a hypothetical female politician claiming that all men secretly want to rape or something awful the main items of feminist alternative facts that come to mind and get a lot of play by politicians are the mischaracterization of the wage gap and the promotion of a moral panic about rape on college campuses both have the potential to hurt the prospects of your future hypothetical sons ,3,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,i think a big part of the problem was the rejection of morality and ethics it quite possible to use some of the same ideas in an ethical way and writers like athol kay and the author of no more mr nice guy seem on that team i tried a few times to argue for treating women ethically and it did not go over that well so stopped participating or reading i think there is probably a place for discussion of such issues from a male perspective but within an ethical framework without being masochistic like menslib ,6,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,i do not think we really disagree on the observations or even the prescriptions re criminal justice it more a matter of what attitude to take to them i am by temperament more of a perceiver than a judger so i can sympathize with what appears to be the reluctance to take a moral stance on things because of determinism but especially after reading haidt i also realize that taking moral stances on things is using an evolved capacity to strengthen one resolve to exercise more will power since sam has generally come out as anti moral relativism i would think he would be sympathetic to this view and his talk with haidt was very friendly of course that capacity can also be used to be an asshole to people which is probably why it gone out of fashion somewhat ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,that may be the case but i have disliked those assholes for years every time there is a protest in oakland or berkeley they come and smash windows of locally owned businesses and generally give the peaceful protesters a bad name they dress like fascists and use fascist paramilitary tactics reminds me of the leftist guerillas in colombia who gradually became narcos and kidnappers to support their lifestyle they are functioning as useful idiots of the right at the moment ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,ok sounds like we all agree on that then we could accuse the berkeley college republicans of having poor judgment except their intention is probably not to better inform their membership and the student body it is probably to provoke the far left into embarrassing itself and they have been fairly successful at that i hope the violent antifa types get kicked out of the coalition they appear to want to watch the world burn not improve it in a democratic small d way ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,that interesting because reich wrote a piece after the riot outside milo talk that questioned whether there were actually any black bloc clad antifa anarchists responsible maybe he become better informed since then mind you i am no milo or coulter fan but words are not sticks and stones etc ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,i mean i also think he wrong about free will and prefer compatibilism but i find him intellectually honest a clear writer and a valuable public intellectual and i suspect dennett would agree i can sort of see the point that he not an academic philosopher any more than kahneman and tversky were economists that might mean he missing an argument that someone who has a phd in philosophy would be familiar with but it does not mean he cannot contribute or do a good job popularizing philosophical inquiry ,2,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,i wrote nothing about judging an individual based on a group this only matters if you are making social policy based on the results of groups and assuming the entirety of any difference is due to discrimination ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,i probably should read free will though i kind of feel like i have the gist of the argument and i am happy to concede that free will is not quite what it appears to be at first glance people like to say things like i hope he suffers in prison or worse are they saying that because it will deter others from committing crime thereby making our society more harmonious they are not have you read jonathan haidt the moral instinct i think it helps to explain that kind of sentiment pretty well an instinct for vengeance is like having a stockpile of nuclear weapons with systems to ensure a counter strike it provides a credible deterrent of sorts behaving in a rational way in the present is not always the optimal long term game theoretic strategy consider your own experience with different forms of consciousness presumably you have experienced being very sleepy or drugged etc to the point where you have little range of possible actions compare that to normal consciousness it sure seems like you have a lot more free will or at least degrees of freedom in normal life than when sedated ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,the cultural explanation seems reasonable re swimming but in running there sure seem to be certain populations that turn out a lot of champions despite lots of runners competing from other populations kenyans and the tarahumara indians of mexico come to mind ,1,samharris

beelzebubs_avocado, all philosophers give him shit right like daniel dennett refuted qed i mean he gave him some shit but they have since shared a stage and been friendly ,2,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado, so the trapped pools of populations are nothing more than very very recent artifacts of geographical limits which are currently breaking down in short these exceedingly small variances which may or may not be accurately observed are vestigial at best but it getting worse with the smartest moving to urban suburban areas and having babies and a brain drain from rural areas i suppose this has been going on for generations but it seems to be accelerating this was discussed in the podcast ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado, but is not any alternative worse i think he saying that having all students learn in settings where they will be challenged but not overwhelmed will be better ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,you state those two objections and say they are not understanding but how do you argue against them the other important function of punishment is deterrence parts of the world with no formalized deterrence tend to be very violent the deterministic approach assumes that we can hit ctrl alt delete on the world and start it over to see if the same things happen again but we cannot do that so there is no empirical basis for that assumption ,1,samharris

beelzebubs_avocado, coming back to race and intelligence a subject that is certainly not new one that has been used in relation to physiognomy eugenics slavery and other such oppressive systems it worth mentioning that pernicious theories of racial supremacy arose to justify slavery so at least that part is probably limited to that historical context ,1,samharris

beelzebubs_avocado,i am wondering why more neurons are needed to control a bigger body it seems like the control problem for a body of a given geometry is similar or does this have something to do with the maximum 1m or so length of motor neuron axons also would not a way of restating the headline be women s bodies are larger on average when adjusting for brain size given higher obesity rates in women than men this could explain some of the difference ,3,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, if it was unconscious how would you know i think typically you realize it when you encounter a counterexample such as a smart jock and find yourself surprised it might be arguable whether it was fully unconscious or just unexamined but i do not know if that a distinction that matters much i think what we should argue for is an accurate nuanced statistically literate view of the world instead of a manichean one there are two flavors of manicheanism in this context every member of group a is better than every member of group b bigotry there is no difference between groups other than those imposed by culture blank slate ,4,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado,yes agreed re races being fuzzy categories eg there are certain mutations only found in ashkenazi jews but they are not found in all of us there is also some disagreement about whether jews count as a race which strikes me as semantics also i suppose you could probably find a correlation between certain variants of genes coding for melanin production with someone being considered white or a person of color but that a more lumped category than people usually mean by race ,1,samharris

beelzebubs_avocado, could not you say that socio economics is arguably the biggest but not the only reason there is a difference of intelligence between races in america you could but it complicated because the causality can go both ways that is the rich have advantages that help them be smarter but also the smart tend to get richer of these two effects considering the many undistinguished rich kids the second seems stronger ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado, the genes that cause race agreed with your post generally but i do not think you can point to genes that cause race you could point to genes that are to some degree of confidence markers of people who identify as a certain race you could also use the better defined concept of haplogroup from genetics and be able to be more specific ,2,samharris

beelzebubs_avocado, i have seen people here get into a heated argument only to realize that everyone involved agreed completely on the subject matter they had just all misunderstood each other you mean some people on both sides have a propensity to read those on the other side uncharitably that is for sure true it seems worse on the other side to me but then maybe that just an illusion because of where it aimed i am always pleasantly surprised to discuss with a feminist who reads me charitably which is important because i usually write concisely and then i tend to find i agree with them on most things because they are usually a liberal feminist who believes men as well as women deserve to be treated fairly as individuals and not subject to collective punishment but also preferred methodology does tend to matter when it comes to things like writing laws ,3,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado,i think the clinton campaign most media and facebook were caught off guard by russia and the trump campaign covert persuasion operations i would like to think that effective countermeasures are being developed and it will be less of a surprise and less effective next time especially if trump is seen as a disaster by many of his supporters that will tend to discredit those outlets and methods that promoted him we tend to underestimate the role of negative feedback coevolution in trends ,2,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,i am less of a free speech absolutist i guess i think it almost always the best way to go and is included in the us constitution but there are circumstances where some lies have had such pernicious consequences worse than libel that it justified to ban them i am thinking of holocaust denial in germany as an example while i condemn neo nazis in the us i am not convinced that they are a real threat to the country or even to jews richard spencer seems set to get owned in court it is a different thing when you are talking about fake news in the newsfeed on facebook by calling it a newsfeed they are implying that it is in fact news so it makes sense that they would want to and be expected to vet content there to a non negligent extent or at least adjust their algorithms so that they do not favor the fakest stories ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,so many spiders to escort outside the wife would have been eaten by spiders by now without me and never gotten anything off the top shelf or gotten any jars open or replaced the lightbulbs and switches etc if you as people tend to do find the work you do more salient than the work your partner does and have an ideology that encourages you to blame it on him it not a great recipe for happiness i once heard a good way to correct for this perceptual distortion is that everyone should do 10 more than what they think is their fair share which should lead to things getting done with less complaining ,3,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,this one is kind of interesting i feel like i learned a little from it and a similar paper the part that is attributed to attitudes about traditional power structures could also be interpreted as there being some biological basis for those attitudes it is refreshing to see a model of marriage that does not take the pop feminism tack of treating women as victims http www jstor org stable 2657416 seq 1 fndtn page thumbnails tab contents maybe you have access to the full paper ,2,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado,it not as easy to find as i expected cannot spend much time on it now the thing i have seen which is not quite the same as hypergamy as used in some contexts is that many high earning women do not want to date and marry men who are less accomplished of course it has some cultural input but it seems pretty hard wired as in they have a hard time talking themselves out of it even when they want to ,1,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado, i am not even going to touch the women are biologically prone to hypergamy bullshit at least that getting called out after 25 upvotes how do you know you are not rejecting this observation out of attachment to dogma and then reinforcing it with confirmation bias what would be a fair measure of whether it a real thing or not and try to answer this before looking at the data it always easy to have a knee jerk that study is inconclusive response after you have looked at a result you do not like would you accept a similar level of scrutiny for establishing whether certain important feminist observations about the world are real things ,11,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, they are actually complaining about getting all the drawbacks without the advantages i think this is true but not in the way you mean re chores i suspect underlying a lot of mens ambition is the idea that if they are very successful they will have more access to beautiful women or at least if they are somewhat successful they probably wo not be involuntarily alone so for men this is an advantage but it is not for women for the most part ,5,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,not disagreeing but i would add the following there is some part that is the unavoidable march of progress technology but there is another part that is due to policy set by elites i am pretty sure we would see different policy if the ones setting it were equally effected by it eg if there were a lot of h1b visas issued for economists i bet some of them would start to look more critically at the program it took a relative outsider like eric weinstein to investigate that the opioid epidemic in rural america would probably be much less severe if it were more salient to politicians than the lobbying of drug companies i do not think it fair to dismiss all of these peoples concerns as irrational of course they are not all well informed most of us are not but that does not mean there is not some truth to the general complaint that elites were not paying much attention to them it sounds like there is a similar dynamic in other countries ,7,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,there is not too much to disagree with in the piece i remember tomboys being not that uncommon and a staple of young adult novels when i was young they were seen fairly positively though perhaps with a bit of expectation that they would grow out of it this part struck me though when kids say she s in the wrong bathroom she tells them i m a girl and invariably they say oh o k it hard not to imagine the gender flipped case and see that an effeminate boy would have a harder time of it or at least would have back in my day maybe kids these days are more open minded ,10,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,there is also a part of white mostly rural america that is not well represented in elite circles and probably does not feel like they are part of the ingroup this piece describes it pretty well http www businessinsider com sam altman interview trump supporters 2017 2 i am also worried if neo nazism is really on the rise among 4channers and others but it hard to tell how much of that is just being edgy or trolling ,6,samharris

beelzebubs_avocado,i could imagine that eventually we might find that things similar to a collective unconscious and archetypes arise from our shared evolution we pretty much all react instinctively to be scared of snakes and heights etc presumably because our ancestors who did so lived to procreate more but some of the more supernatural stuff ,2,samharris

beelzebubs_avocado,i think most of the evidence shows that biologically there is more or less a bimodal distribution of genders which makes it possible to talk about two fuzzy genders i am not sure how to evaluate men and women are overwhelmingly more different than they are similar compared to what in some dimensions there are significant statistical differences between the groups on others not so much if good evidence comes up that shows that men and women are only different because of culture then i will go with that though it will take some strong evidence because it an extraordinary claim you are opposing pop feminism and traditionalism but i think the majority of people i know are more in a common sense camp which believes in equal opportunity while realizing there are differences between the sexes and i think some academic feminists arrive at a similarly realistic conclusion i have been in traditionalist places and they are not my happy place having grown up in a very liberal area ,1,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado,i was just thinking of something related in the case of the doctor roughed up on the united flight where someone dug into his past and made public embarrassing records about losing his medical license over prescription drug fraud or something if you view him as a victim then this is terrible but if you recognize that the viral video was only showing what happened after things had already gone bad you might look for other sources of evidence like accounts from nearby passengers earlier videos or yes even his background to figure out whether he was an innocent victim or if he provoked the beatdown to some extent and similarly in the case of a rape accusation where there is little evidence other than she said he said character witnesses are likely to be important for both sides of that disagreement it also terrible that defense lawyers have resorted to a slut shaming narrative as a defense i hope juries have moved past being sympathetic to that in most places but assessing the accuser credibility is necessary calling that victim blaming is begging the question ,1,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado,saying browder loved putin before he stole his money seems without basis based on my memory but i will have a look in the book putin is not even mentioned until page 160 he talks about how putin was leaving him alone for a while because his anti corporate corruption shareholder advocacy was providing a pretext for putin to smite his rivals his general analysis of putin ie that everything yes everything he ever does is motivated only by a desire for self enrichment well let just say i find that paradigm is unable to account for most of putin actions especially as far as foreign policy is concerned it just so dumbed down and simplistic surely putin also has some concern for national interests russia prestige etc i just find it so unconvincing that his only concern is his personal wealth i have a similar judgment of trump he seems to have taken inspiration from putin no doubt he also has thoughts about national interests and prestige but when there is a conflict between his own interests and the national interest it pretty clear which wins and even if his motivations are more complex than just enriching himself if that is an overriding one then the rest do not matter much ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado, jill stein and gary johnson had issues but there is a strategic value in getting 5 support for an independent candidate that has value regardless of what you think of a particular independent candidate yes agreed i just was not aware of much chance of reaching that threshold i had the idea that getting elected would have vindicated the hillary camp and made the bernie camp once again more on the outs but who knows and maybe the galvanized feminists will focus on more serious threats from trump instead of things like online lynching a guy for wearing a questionably sfw shirt otherwise your predictions sound very plausible ,2,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado, i would have preferred the national conversation that i anticipated subsequent to a hillary election i agree with almost everything you wrote above though the minor party candidates did not excite me much either but i am curious how you imagined the national conversation playing out differently i anticipated we would have more or less a continuation of the dynamic of obama second term perhaps with a bit more hawkish tone not a lot of large scale things got done but at least it was mostly not disastrous and not tainted by christian theocrats ,3,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, at any rate she won the popular vote by an unprecedented margin for a candidate losing the electoral college that in itself is evidence against the claims of sexism she was a popular candidate people did vote for her just not where it mattered my main takeaway from it is that it showed very poor strategy to devote resources to running up the score in blue states at the expense of contesting the upper midwest which turned out to be decisive i voted for her but now i want her to go away and let some younger democratic leaders come up and i do not want to hear about chelsea running for office since she appears to have little reason to do so other than it being the family business ,11,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,well i do not know that he personally ordered each person killed but the buck stops with him no presumably he savvy enough to insulate himself from a paper trail of ordering those kind of murders if he did do it and if he did not then he created and controls absolutely a government that acts that way without accountability if you get too hung up on putin feel free to replace it with putin government i do not want to accuse you of being a kremlin shill but there are a lot of them out there props to the russians for having a much more successful propaganda machine than the us we are for better or worse hampered by laws against propagandizing us citizens ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado, but they are operating on the presumption that putin is evil and aggressive rather than rational and defensive it a premise with a lot of evidence to support it that is if you consider murdering potential political rivals lawyers dissidents and reporters to be evil anne applebaum recently has been tweeting about how the syria missile strike was dumb so she not looking like a mindless hawk edit i do not agree on the characterization of sam looking bad in the harris carlin discussion on the part where they disagreed most criticizing islam i thought dan sounded uncharacteristically like a voice of the liberal elite establishment he did not seem to apply the same kind of first principles thinking there that he has to other areas that makes common sense so interesting ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado, we know that protein is the most filling macronutrient you conclude that from a p value of 05 among multiple variables in one study know seems a bit strong there there is a subreddit filled with people having dramatic success eating low carb is there something corresponding for low fat ,3,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,well dan carlin has been on the podcast so you cannot say his view has not been represented it was a friendly discussion seems like being aware of how putin operates while not looking to provoke a war is a realistic approach i do not recall either applebaum or kasparov advocating war ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,what other view on the russia issue would you like to see represented ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,i think it a lot harder to eat 1000 kcals of meat greens and nuts you feel full pretty fast but also there are aspects of metabolism that are not well understood like brown fat that generates heat and burns calories ,3,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,i read the beginning of your debunking i think you are reading him uncharitably he a smart science journalist not a biochemist it a topic with nearly bottomless complexity so saying he oversimplifying is probably true but hard to avoid for example in this part i think you just misunderstood his sentence if taubes s irrational contempt for keys was not obvious before it should be crystal clear after this passage on page 16 when keys launched his crusade against heart disease in the late 1940s most physicians who believed that heart disease was caused by diet implicated dietary cholesterol as the culprit we ate too much cholesterol laden food meat and eggs mostly and that it was said elevated our blood cholesterol keys was the first to discredit this belief publicly which had required in any case ignoring a certain amount of the evidence before keys came along all of the evidence that dietary cholesterol substantially affects serum cholesterol was from animal studies studies that just two pages earlier taubes argues have no bearing on human physiology so keys decides to conduct some cholesterol research on actual humans and concludes that dietary cholesterol actually doesn t have a substantial effect on serum cholesterol 7 if this were anyone else other than keys taubes would likely praise them for not following the conventional wisdom of the day and conducting proper scientific research but instead keys is accused of ignoring evidence i think that s fair in the sentence keys was the first to discredit this belief publicly which had required in any case ignoring a certain amount of the evidence ignoring evidence refers to the discredited belief not to keys discrediting or at least read that way it makes sense and your criticism of it loses its validity i am not claiming taubes is perfect with that many citations by a journalist i am sure some of them are open to criticism but i would want much stronger stuff than this to assume bad faith ,3,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,so they forced them to eat the same calories on the high carb and low carb diets seems like that removes an advantage of a high fat low carb diet which is that it does not stimulate appetite as much as a high carb one ,6,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,but the other option you seem to be suggesting of letting night club goers carry guns seems likely to lead to even more problems in many places across the country then again it might make the dancefloor more polite ,2,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,but we do not really buy that argument in general because then people should be able to buy any weapon or toxic substance muh rpgs pretty much everyone believes in arms control for civilians it just a discussion about where to draw the line ,2,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,i am actually ok with people who had to apply for a license and go through some training carrying guns it the others where it harder to justify ,1,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, the locations of these kinds of tragedies correlate fairly strongly with places with the strictest gun policy but the strict gun policy was probably passed in reaction to what was perceived as a too high crime rate so it not so easy to disentangle the causation there those areas also tend to be more urban i suspect that the gun deaths in the two kinds of places will tend to be of different types with more suicides and accidents in the places with less gun control and more gang related murders in areas with more gun control it not clear that relaxing gun control in areas with violent gangs would help but stricter licensing requirements in places with none would likely prevent some portion of suicides and accidents i agree the horse is already out of the barn in terms of preventing guns from getting into the hands of highly motivated criminals but stricter licensing would make a difference in terms of encouraging more responsible use by non criminals you would think a national organization advocating for the responsible use of guns would even be in favor of that anyway it currently a political loser and i am not going to waste much energy on it ,2,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, what do you think would help perhaps growing his audience through a successful podcast and books the losers on r philosophy who like to deal in ad hominems can just continue to be underpaid borderline autistic postdocs and keyboard warriors i doubt they have any real influence i get the impression they are threatened by someone who speaks and writes clearly and for a general educated audience it harder to disguise pseudo profundity in clear language i have seen them attack alain de botton in a similar way and he does not even venture into hot button issues much that said i disagree with him on free will but that ok i think he at least explained his reasoning fairly clearly and it a small part of what he talks about ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,another thought even if which seems debatable and likely does not cover the full costs of global financial meltdown as well as likely future ones wall st has been a net plus to the us treasury they have distorted the economy by diverting so much wealth they have diverted many of the top b school graduates from going into businesses that might have actually created value instead of just finding clever ways to rip each others customers off like high speed trading and less clever ways like insider trading ,2,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,the thing with the local government allowing rent seeking is that while i agree it a problem and i was rooting for uber until their management showed themselves to be pretty terrible people and now try to use lyft it does not seem like a much worse problem than in other anglophone countries the elite rent seeking at the national level on the other hand is world class perhaps rivaled in the uk with their large finance sector and i get the impression that it accounts long term for a very large transfer and concentration of resources of course it not just finance there is also the military industrial complex the surveillance state the deregulated telecom monopolies etc you do not get to be the most hated corporation in the us without some good monopoly power comcast well indiscriminately killing civilians without accountability blackwater now academi might also qualify ,2,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado,yeah i wonder if calling different things like direct aggression and passive aggression both aggression does not obscure more than it illuminates one other way of looking at it is that direct aggression is related to risk taking looked at that way relative size or social standing etc would factor in to how risky a confrontation would be looked at this way passive aggressiveness is a lower risk option to try to gain an advantage i am sure i have seen some research suggesting that risk taking is correlated to testosterone i have also gathered that this could be a mechanism of feedback because losing lowers t and winning raises it so this would encourage taking more risks until it backfires and then taking fewer risks this could also provide a biological mechanism for confidence i am also pretty sure that risk taking is much higher in men overall than women if you look at people pushing it in risky sports that do not depend on size like trad rock climbing or big wave surfing it often 10 to 1 men to women ,5,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado,a comprehensive study review is the only one worth looking at if you care about being fairly certain a result is real when the effect size is not that big and there is publication bias ,5,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado, stereotype threat has had a replication problem https en wikipedia org wiki stereotype threat failures to replicate and publication bias whether the effect occurs at all has also been questioned with researchers failing to replicate the finding flore and wicherts concluded the reported effect is small but also that the field is inflated by publication bias they argue that correcting for this the most likely true effect size is near zero see meta analytic plot highlighting both the restriction of large effect to low powered studies and the plot asymmetry which occurs when publication bias is active ,14,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,i think you are still being a little confusing rejecting atheism is different than rejecting an ideology because it requires accepting a belief system which is not a reasonable solution you can reject most ism without embracing some other ideology ,1,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, we know that someone that premeditates a murder is far more likely to be dangerous than someone that does not not necessarily they might have had a reason very specific to the victim such as you killed my father prepare to die and maybe they would tend to get some leniency for the reduced likelihood of re offending compared to random murderers but not in proportion to that likelihood and consider a mentally unstable person who is delusional and had no idea what they were doing when they killed someone for sure they should be locked away to protect society but they do not deserve say a life sentence like a sane murderer might it tricky we have evolved moral instincts that are the result of natural trials of different game theory strategies some of the seemingly irrational elements can be explained with game theory and we can reverse engineer many of those instincts with different ethical frameworks yeah we seem to be going around in circles a bit i like this answer i just found https www quora com do human beings have free will if so how can we prove it and the short piece linked from there https www quora com how far away are we from discovering the biological source of free will answer john bailey 43 share 1 srid thv0 ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,there is punishment as used in behaviorism which relies on basic learning and requires the animal to first do the undesired behavior perhaps several times before the punishment has the desired effect of reducing it then there is punishment as used in criminal law which is hoped to have a deterrent effect without the person having to experience it personally first one does not require a conscious concept of right and wrong the other does and because moral agents are presumed to have known they were doing the wrong thing and done it anyway we feel justified in punishing more harshly for premeditated murder vs murder as crime of passion or as unintentional side effect of eg driving badly ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,makes sense one thing that i have noticed from dealing with bullies over the years is that if you can somehow convince them that their attempt to bother you is ineffective they tend to move on to look for another victim it makes me think about a certain super annoying kid in middle school if only i would been able to pretend not to mind that stupid nickname he gave me the first time he probably would have dropped it you probably already know this and i am not sure how useful it would have been in this case and what you did was probably a lot more effective as a long term solution to this bully hope this does not come across as victim blamey i imagine if something similar happened to me and it could though it probably less likely because my peers are older i would also be bothered by it ,1,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,i think what you are saying is that the problem is conflating different levels it might make sense to talk about institutional racism in the context of addressing institutions but not as much when considering individual actions re reading the wiki definition it does not seem to add much especially this part institutional racism is also racism by individuals governed by behavioral norms that support racist thinking is not that a bit circular is there racism by individuals that is not governed by behavioral norms that support racist thinking or would that be sort of accidental racism such as being curious about different physical features or asking an obvious but ignorant question i guess that the idea that an action can be racist without the person being racist which i am skeptical about because i am pretty sure in common usage if you call someone actions racist there is a strong implication that they are a racist it kind of like saying someone actions wer rape but they are not a rapist if nothing else in terms of the negative connotations and reputational consequences of making the charge ,8,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,glad to hear things worked out to your satisfaction while this does sound like sexual assault from your description it sounds like the emphasis in terms of intent was more on the assault part than the sexual part was that your impression usually i do not agree with the blanket statement that rape is about power and not sex but this might actually be a case where that is true but in any case you prevailed rightfully in the end ,1,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, what does it mean to hold a person responsible in a way you would not hold a bear responsible it means that beyond removing the bear from a human inhabited area to prevent future conflict you might feel justified in punishing a human for murder in order to deter others from murdering if bears were able to understand punishment edit and that torture and murder are wrong then we might consider them moral agents punishment is not always rational in the short term but in the longer term game theoretical sense of a repeated game it can make a lot of sense ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado, you can recognize that someone is doing harm in your life while still understanding that they cannot help but do it that seems to blur the distinction though between the people who really cannot help it because they are mentally disabled addicts etc and ones who can but choose not to you can say that choice is an illusion because of determinism but sociopaths think of your favorite villain sure appear to have a choice in the matter and should we really regard them in the same light morally and if we do regard them in the same light morally is not that conceding that there is no point in trying to influence the behavior of others i think avoiding excessive resentment blame etc is good from a stoic perspective but not necessarily a deterministic one ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,i was just thinking the other day how we tend to have an action bias at least when we expect someone else to do the work the thought something must be done comes up a lot it refreshing to hear a statement in the other direction for a change ,1,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,maybe not how does california keep its money my understanding is that the way the states contribute to the federal government is mainly through their citizens paying federal taxes ,0,bayarea
beelzebubs_avocado,so you are going to stop paying federal taxes let me know how that works out ,0,bayarea
beelzebubs_avocado,it not really hypocritical to advocate a certain public policy for all but not be prepared to take it on individually without collective action that is not everyone who is in favor of higher taxes needs to donate extra to the irs to be able to advocate that position ,1,bayarea
beelzebubs_avocado,that seems like something i can get behind though the feds should really clear up their backlog to get it down well below 60 days and or pay for holding the person that long it seems strange to use the rhetoric that immigrants commit fewer crimes than natives and then prevent the removal of violent criminals and that is conflating legal and illegal immigrants which is annoying ,1,bayarea
beelzebubs_avocado,i think the distinction you often hear is non native invasive vs native eg the big eucalyptus blue gum trees that have been eradicated from a lot of places in the bay area were dinged as non native species from australia as well as being messy fire hazards and falling hazards similar with scotch broom i would be happy to eradicate poison oak even though it is native ,2,bayarea
beelzebubs_avocado,seems to be native to north america and somewhat common though not quite seagull common the double crested cormorant phalacrocorax auritus is a member of the cormorant family of seabirds it occurs along inland waterways as well as in coastal areas and is widely distributed across north america from the aleutian islands in alaska down to florida and mexico measuring 70 90 cm 28 35 in in length it is an all black bird which gains a small double crest of black and white feathers in breeding season it has a bare patch of orange yellow facial skin five subspecies are recognized the double crested cormorant is found near rivers and lakes and along the coastline it mainly eats fish and hunts by swimming and diving its feathers like those of all cormorants are not waterproof and it must spend time drying them out after spending time in the water once threatened by the use of ddt the numbers of this bird have increased markedly in recent years ,3,bayarea
beelzebubs_avocado,does this law forbid the local authorities from cooperating with ice even if they have a likely dangerous criminal in jail and if so what is the justification for that ,1,bayarea
beelzebubs_avocado,source i have heard something similar said a lot but assumed it referred to all immigrants which seems plausible ,1,bayarea
beelzebubs_avocado,this part seems compelling but also raises the question of the definition of predatory behavior but more importantly mcmahan and singer confuse self conceptualizing as having good intentions with failing to engage in predatory behavior they confuse a willingness to articulate one s position with being honorable if these characteristics were genuinely interchangeable multitudes of paradigm instances of exploitation through grooming and even through violence would be mitigated or exculpated ,1,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado,online anonymous fora are to varying degrees the wild west of course but on my fb feed misandry is just fine whereas misogyny or from my point of view treating women like men in comments is vilified by some vocal segment and hardly anyone dares disagree i am trying to think if i have seen real misogyny on my feed once comes to mind and i unfriended that sleazy mofo right away so from my perspective in a coastal progressive area the above description does not ring true on the other hand i am not going to demand a complete lack of double standards or special sensitivity when it comes to using black racial stereotypes i think black americans do have an especially tough history native americans might argue that but that another rabbit hole whether this is the best policy for the indefinite future is another discussion and one the members of that group will probably be able to speak to more effectively i am not totally comfortable with this giving black comedians license to traffic in stereotypes others might not be able to get away with but it a fuzzy judgment made by the crowd whether the jokes are more funny than offensive ,4,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,ok i went too far out on a limb speculating about the reason before realizing the abstract i quoted was not supporting the premise but suffice it to say there is sexual dimorphism is it surprising that there would be differences between the sexes in measures of temperament to try to avoid confirmation bias i just looked up panic attack since that is a pretty concrete symptom of anxiety and found this on the wiki page sourced from the dsm in europe about 3 of the population has a panic attack in a given year while in the united states they affect about 11 they are more common in females than males interesting bit about the europe us difference too bad there are no numbers quoted on the sex differences ,2,AskSocialScience

beelzebubs_avocado, i would contend however that if we have free the sort of free will we believe we have is different from the sort of free will we actually have fully agreed every time we have learned more details about a body system it has failed to match up perfectly or at all with our folk or ancient traditional wisdom we now know that we do not run on humors etc but denying free will sounds to me similar to denying that we have blood circulation when it found that there are holes in the humors paradigm it seems to be making an overly broad assumption or leap of logic but the terms are defined so loosely that it hard to even talk about in a useful way ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado, what other kinds of free will are there if you look at the wiki page there are a lot of options https en wikipedia org wiki free will most humans have the strong impression that they can make decisions this could be called agency but with a moral dimension of being responsible for those decisions it been called free will that moral dimension is more a matter of moral philosophy than science so it beginning to look like it a matter of taste if you have not guessed yet i identify most with the compatibilist school meaning that free will and determinism do not conflict ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,i think when you are dealing with a subject that is claimed to have no influence on practical matters such as this there is more than average reason to question why one should care about the theory if free will is being identified with dualism then sure dualism does not make sense but the nervous system is pretty complicated and we have only begun to describe its systems in detail if i had to pick an idea that sounded more plausible i would go with dennet or dahaene who refer to the actual brain workings instead of billiard balls do you see a distinction between agency and free will ,2,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,well you got me there and go equality i guess should have remembered that from dan carlin great series on the khans i am not saying that patriarchy is a normative good but that descriptively it seems to be a common stable mode ,2,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,i mostly agree but where i think it really matters is in assigning responsibility to people for crimes and on that score i am with the legal system in thinking that we are better off treating people who are normal adults as if they are responsible for their actions it seems better than the minority report option this is why things like the twinkie defense tend to get so much derision most people know that if we start admitting this kind of excuse that there will be a never ending parade of excuses but i am open to the idea that as we learn more and are able to intervene more to prevent bad outcomes that this view may need to evolve i just think we should not abandon the current paradigm before a better one arrives ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,the big difference i see with some other countries is the degree of regulatory capture which i have hear may be related to the us market being big enough to be worth the while of multinationals to buy their way into a monopolistic or otherwise advantageous position in a way that it not in eg canada or australia i worry that if we could somehow get single payer it would still somehow be much more expensive to the benefit of big business in a way not seen in other countries ,1,MedicareForAll
beelzebubs_avocado,it illustrates that brain waves can predict subconscious cascades before they reach consciousness it shows that random timing is handled as a subconscious function in this situation and that there is the illusion of having made a conscious decision just then so if that the only kind of free will you care about then i suppose that kind does not exist i think there has been too much extrapolation from simple experiments like this to all of conscious experience ,2,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,the definition of some crimes such as murder manslaughter depend on intent so in those cases it should affect the verdict i am not familiar with rape law enough to quote the law but it seems like it should also matter whether something is done with bad intent or is a misunderstanding delusion ,1,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, it does not exist in the same form as our intuitions would lead us to believe ah ok i agree with that and maybe that functionally equivalent to the claim that those denying its existence make since i have not yet seen an experiment proposed that would differentiate between the two stances they begin to look a bit glass half full half empty to take a stab at it from a slightly different angle was jackson pollack the author of his own paintings it not like anyone else was but then again he probably did not consciously plan each splash of paint ,1,samharris

beelzebubs_avocado,i had a look at the video it not surprising after having read consciousness and the brain deciphering how the brain codes our thoughts the author dahaene describe described the penetration of something into consciousness as being a cascade of neural activity which has a specific signature which can be read on eeg it is like an iceberg of a conscious interpretation above a lot more unconscious processing which is simpler but massively parallel you can either consider that unconscious processing to be part of the i that makes decisions or you can consider the i to only include consciousness and in that case the scope for free will is reduced but it still there eg you might brainstorm a bunch of words related to some problem those ideas emerge from unconscious processes but once you have written them down you can consciously weigh which ones are most useful to apply to the problem and no doubt there is still some element of intuition unconscious processing that informs that process as well but it can be ignored ,3,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado, what is contested is that she ever was a lover you think she just intended to rape a nonverbal guy that was not the impression i got from the article this reminds me of the much more common case of the married couple where one partner develops dementia but still seems to enjoy their sex life even though it debatable whether they are able to consent i gather there has been discussion of something like an advance consent directive for that sort of thing there is more of a presumption of consent in an established ltr of course ,2,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado, that my thoughts patriarchy may be all well and good but it political and social not survival based in a zombie apocalypse or hunter gatherer state of nature politics and social organization are matters or survival in modern technological society the connection has become somewhat obscured but if you replace survival with controlling resources then it much the same dynamic the reason we even talk about sexes is that there is sexual dimorphism from that fact flows a lot of possible ways to organize things some of which seem to be more stable given the dimorphism that is it is unlikely you will find a society with women physically dominating men or abandoning their children for the fathers to raise we should strive for a fair world but there are some constraints on how fair it can be when everyone is given different abilities ,7,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado, try and lay in bed all day forever you are gonna want to get up and do something i gather it gets easier if you pick up some substance and media addictions is the belief in the absence of free will falsifiable if so how ,2,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,your plinko metaphor agrees with my idea of constrained free will i just tend to focus on the things you can do because focusing on the things you cannot control is a waste of time because a decision is affected by irrelevant information it is no longer free i think that true only to an extent that is if you are required to opt out of having your isp sell your information you are much more likely to not bother and so the outcome is manipulated so you have less practical freedom on that decision than if it were not manipulated but there is still more freedom than if you had no choice i think an analogy can be made with vision we have discovered many visual illusions which show that we do not perceive visual reality directly but through multiple layers of processing and interpretation if we followed the lead of those who dismiss free will in the visual domain we might conclude that we have no true visual information about the world and in a very narrow technical sense this might be true and yet our vision is very useful ,2,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,sorry cannot really watch videos at work there are definitely some ways that the brain deceives us and this is probably one of them but that does not mean that everything we think we know about the way it works is wrong i am sure that button device is very spooky to interact with such as making post hoc rationalizations of actions it was unaware of as described in split brain patients by oliver sacks,0,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,notable constraints like being meat computers affected by chemicals and other environmental variables brain structures many of which operate party or wholly subconsciously individual quirks etc it seems like this no free will view amounts to predestination and should lead to nihilism why make more prosocial choices when there is no real choice seems like the the risks and rewards are asymmetrical that is if things are not predestined and spreading the idea of a lack of free will promotes nihilism that is a larger negative than believing there is free will when there is not and anyway why bother trying to convince me if it all determined already why get out of bed of course there is enough ambiguity and vagueness in the concepts that you can make the argument you are making i just do not see what use it serves and it could be actually harmful if the claim is that free will does not work quite like we think it does then sure i can get behind that and that actually encourages more investigation ,0,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado, if you cannot even control what your next thought it is what free will do you have you have free will with some notable constraints but you have the option to train your mind to have more control over it and sam is in favor of that so it seems in practice he behaves as if free will exists to some extent and matters ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,i have read about those kind of results and i think saying they disprove free will is a misinterpretation the way i understand it the unconscious reacts faster than the conscious mind in a reflex like way but the conscious mind usually gets a veto via inhibition over many unconscious behaviors to take a super simple example you may have the reflex to catch something dropped on to a hot stove but you inhibit that reflex to avoid touching the stove so there are constraints on free will if it is identified with consciousness but it still has some important room to operate ,2,samharris

beelzebubs_avocado,i think i prefer skeptic or empiricist because they apply to many areas of knowledge and have a bit less baggage i actually sort of buy the arguments for god that say in essence something was responsible for something existing rather than nothing that is mysterious and mind bending if you think about it much using god as a shorthand for that mystery seems not the most unreasonable thing i think that amounts to deism which might have been useful in the past for reconciling a scientific worldview with a religious one but where they lose me is when they claim they have any way of knowing what that something is edit reorganized a bit edit 2 it occurs to me that the label atheist puts religion in an important place relative to one identity similar to ex muslim say i was never religious and never considered that theism might be true so even though atheist would be an accurate label it not that much a part of my identity ,2,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,4channer cool story bro ,1,samharris
beelzebubs_avocado,nice context the reason women are not the primary casualties of war is because the army is made up of men is essentially the wrong counterargument but would not it be truer to say that it only a partial counterargument that is if roughly half 60 quoted of the casualties are civilians of whom maybe 2 3 are women that still leaves the other half of whom 100 are men so given the ww2 60 civilian deaths example female victims fatalities 6 66 40 or 40 male victims fatalities 6 33 4 1 60 or 60 if it could be shown that women leaders never went to war then the men as perps women as victims narrative would have more force ,6,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,i imagine they would say that white male is not a monolithic or even very homogeneous group it almost certainly not the part of that group at the top who will make use of a men forum discriminating against disadvantaged white males to try to even the scales of justice is a bit like saying that because some proportion of a minority are rich and famous that means things are good for the minority the average earnings of a group does little good for members of the group in the middle or lower and the way that the 1 incomes have diverged from everyone else in recent decades there is no real connection ,21,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado,yes they are ,2,bayarea
beelzebubs_avocado,yes i am aware of all that or at least the first paragraph i am not fully clear on what the second paragraph means in part because the grammar is a bit casual if murder is allowed in your thinking what is not allowed and if everything is allowed what practical use does the concept of allowed have if the purpose is to be descriptive about what is possible to do then fine i do not disagree with that but i thought we were talking about allow in a prescriptive sense of what we think people ought to do and not do ,1,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,i think we can agree on the desirability of liberal principles but i seem to have a wider pragmatic streak i agree that selective enforcement can be a problem but cannot get too worked up about something that has never been enforced in the case of voting i would favor encouraging it through persuasion and perhaps engineering the process to be frictionless i think a proportional solution to the vaccination issue would be to allow opt outs but make the application process onerous enough or have a lottery so that no more than the safe proportion looks like several percent of people do it and this is more of or less how it handled in a lot of areas though some got too liberal on handing out exemptions for a while there ,2,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,so for anything that you apply a strong enough disincentive for that is something most people would describe as not being allowed ,2,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,sounds like we agree on abortion except i guess personhood based on consciousness probably happens some time a few weeks or months after birth except that babies are so cute no one wants to hurt them so i would not push that point very hard and likewise late term fetuses look a lot like babies so i can understand queasiness there on the vaccination argument you could make the same argument about things like regulating automobile emissions or whether citizens should vote they are collective action problems where one person action does not do much but as a group they have a huge effect ,2,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,is a solution to that problem to let the child lead to a great extent on how much they want to follow traditional gender roles that is offer them lots of choices and support them i think this is a benefit of the often maligned perspective of seeing biology as very important it provides some grounding apart from the flavor of the decade ,2,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,if murder is allowed then you have erased the meaning of allowed if a police officer would be within their rights and training to shoot you to prevent you from doing something then it is not allowed for practical purposes ,2,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,i will take that one because i do hold those positions that is i think the social compact allows reducing individual freedom where the majority agree overall good would be dramatically improved and minorities are not abused this applies to things like having a police force in theory anyway if the majority were not in favor of vaccination i guess we would have to try to convince them i think we have much more responsibility to care for actual people than potential people if that does not address your question then maybe i did not understand it ,1,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,maybe but perhaps the necessity comes from competing with other boys who are extra competitive due to their biology this abstract http journals sagepub com doi abs 10 1111 j 1467 9280 1990 tb00200 x sounds suggestive two hypotheses have been offered to explain the relation between testosterone and antisocial behavior in delinquent and criminal populations one is that testosterone leads directly to antisocial behavior the other is that a constellation of dominance competitiveness and sensation seeking associated with testosterone leads to either antisocial or prosocial behavior depending upon an individual resources and background analysis of archival data from 4 462 america military veterans supported the first hypothesis testosterone was correlated with a variety of antisocial behaviors among all individuals however socioeconomic status ses proved to be a moderating variable with weaker testosterone behavior relationships among high ses subjects if testosterone is strongly correlated with behavior then the huge average differences between the sexes should produce some effects and transgender people on hormonal therapy confirm that the changes in their thinking behavior are real ,6,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,or how about the times i remember watching one specifically related to the 3 million fraudulent votes claim but no doubt it not the only case when he had a reporter ask at a press conference why he keeps repeating a specific claim with no basis is not it hard for him to escape awareness of the untruth at that point and even if he is able to shield himself from the truth and so make these untruths not technically lies is that really any better for the country does not it play into the idea that he trying to devalue the concept of truth ,6,AskTrumpSupporters
beelzebubs_avocado,i was definitely spending an inordinate amount of time during the early part of the campaign steelmanning trump statements but after enough cases where he says something that is baseless it reported on and then he keeps on repeating it at some point is not it fair to conclude that he knows it has no basis in fact and at that point it can be said to be a lie would not the alternative be that he actively avoiding facts ,7,AskTrumpSupporters

beelzebubs_avocado,what if boys on average are just more confident due to mostly biological factors it would not take much for people operating in bad faith to describe this as entitlement it might also help explain many of the issues you mentioned in school boys get worse grades than girls boys get suspended and in trouble more than girls boys get put on medication more than girls boys drop out more than girls and obtain higher education less than girls ,6,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,i agree with you with one exception which are cases where there is more or less a consensus on what the best choice is and things can be set up to make it the default easiest choice the other options are still available just requiring slightly more initiative the idea is linked to behavioral economics and is described in more detail in nudge improving decisions about health wealth and happiness https en wikipedia org wiki nudge book edit also it seems like it would not hurt to put ethics on at least even footing with choice after all i think it more important that politicians not be corrupted than that they have the choice to take bribes or not ,4,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado,presidents also spend a lot of time at fundraisers so there goes that point the problem is that politicians are bought and do the bidding of their masters which tends to go against the interests of the great majority of their constituents there has been research that showed this but it is probably obvious enough to not need a citation the solution would be something like this http anticorruptionact org ,1,technology

beelzebubs_avocado, analyzing the sexual dichotomy from the woman perspective that makes it sound like the idea of objective reality would be called in to question while i can see the value of looking at things from different angles it seems like to be able to communicate with others you need to be able to take more than that one perspective ,7,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado,a distinction is that we can clearly point to other civilizations that are not western and can come to a consensus on that this shows that even if the concept is somewhat fuzzy there is at least some definite boundary to it on the other hand is there any society that everyone agrees is not a patriarchy edit and i mean current day and not historical or fictional or mythical ,7,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,i think the functional meaning for most feminists is that the patriarchy is what they are against so like you said by not defining it they can pretend to agree and come to a false consensus this is illustrated in the bumper sticker i would rather be smashing the patriarchy ,9,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado,i think the msm are out to get trump but for good reasons as listed above the part where i think they could do better is in presenting issues that his supporters care about in a neutral way where they differ from the bipartisan consensus but the media is part of that consensus more or less so it hard for them to see outside it i think dan does a good job of this at least on some issues like income inequality and immigration when he talked to sam harris about islamism he sounded more msm like though still fairly open minded ,1,dancarlin

beelzebubs_avocado,it sounds like you have a great family i certainly do not mean to reduce people to evolutionary strategies and genes though it is an interesting way to think about general trends in how people behave my guess on the people who are less interested in multiple partners in real life is that they tend to have higher anxiety so the risk reward calculation is skewed in the direction of not making it worthwhile i agree that trpers tend to take an overly simplified and hostile view of human diversity there are a lot of traits where there is a spectrum and the trait is more and more helpful in most circumstances as it increases to a point and then it starts to become harmful an example might be the tendency to find patterns in the environment to a point it leads to insight but taken too far it leads to delusions so genes that lead to that tendency might be selected for even though in extreme cases they are dysfunctional a more concrete single gene example is the sickle cell gene which is protective against malaria in the heterozygous one copy form but causes illness in the homozygous two copies form ,2,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado, i wo not argue that men may well be less likely to enjoy being monogamous i would just argue that a large percentage of women also dislike being with only one sexual partner a large enough percentage that the standard evo psych stuff does not really explain it i know that red pill would describe this as hypergamy i think so there that i am not sure that the right explanation though i think women just also like fucking male and female monogamous mammals and birds each have reasons to want extra pair copulation epc they are not quite the same reasons and the implications are slightly different the below descriptions are from the point of view of the genes which influence behavior of course as large brained mammals we do not have to obey or identify with our genes the male benefits by spreading his genes with little resource cost in many cases his mate in mainly only impacted if he dedicates resources to the other offspring a female benefits from epc if she can get better genetic material than from her mate her mate is impacted if he is cuckolded and puts resources into raising offspring that are not his this asymmetry of impact could probably explain a lot of the double standards around infidelity some of the common kinks among women and men could point to the sex lives of our distant ancestors some of them such as gangbang fantasies would make more sense if we acted more like bonobos in the evolutionary past ,1,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado,if you like dogs you might want to consider fostering a dog dogs can be great companions as well as a way to relate to other dog people of which there are many i say fostering because you could try it out and if it does not work out you can give the dog back or if that not an option maybe just volunteer at a shelter also lots of people are introverted and or shy to some extent it seems like it tends to get easier with age and not caring as much about what other people think about you it sort of a paradox that by caring less what people think while still acting decently they will likely think better of you the more you can become genuinely interested in other people the more rewarding talking to them will become and of course it helps to cultivate interests and find others who share them while it easy to follow only male dominated interests if you are single it probably worth finding at least one that is not so gender segregated ,1,OneY
beelzebubs_avocado,i am not advocating for a lord of the flies style barbarism and i can empathize with not being popular in high school but it ethically suspect to say require the popular girls to date the nerds and even if we make nerds cool there will still be someone less cool i do not have a problem with trying to understand humans but a lot of feminist theory seems to come with unstated blank slate assumptions it seems to assume that society is so terrible that it best to tear it all down and start over come to think of it that is a similar argument that i have heard lately from some trump supporters re the us political establishment i think there is more merit to the latter claim though i am still dubious about it i suppose that makes me more of a conservative than an anarchist ,2,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, i know that it can be boring to be in a conversation with people where you have no real interest and are bored but the other people are fixated on the topic changing the topic politely to something everyone can take part in is a talent and is always fine but still does not call for condescension yes being assertive in a conversation is a good skill to learn it would probably prevent a lot of griping about things like mansplaining as a bonus i do not think i usually let on that i was thinking less of others for being sports fans but it probably did not help make me fun at super bowl parties ,3,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,yes harris also suggested campbell as an influence even though peterson did not well i always got the sense that connell was describing the mechanism of hegemony as being the collective buy in of society so the oppressed were complicit in their own oppression it that kind of systemic approach that i find particularly interesting in connell she describes basically a collective collaborative process rather than a exertion of force by one group against the other i have a couple objections to this kind of framing 1 what if instead of seeing this process as one of oppression we saw it as a way for society to trick or bribe many members of society into doing more than they would otherwise in terms of taking risks working long hours etc because if there were no such thing as status i guess we would see a lot fewer hours worked overall and less done on certain collective action problems or maybe this is describing the same thing but just emphasizing the positive aspects 2 we are social primates who tend to have dominance hierarchies theorizing about participating in our own oppression seems to assume the possibility of a utopian noble savage state but extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence of course we might prefer to draw inspiration from sexy bonobos over the violent common chimps but the bonobos are still screwing everyone in sight to enhance their status within the group ,2,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,the bit about the hero came from a recent sam harris podcast interview with jordan peterson https www samharris org podcast item meaning and chaos peterson described the archetype of the hero as the collection of traits that would tend to help a man rise to the top of any possible plausible dominance hierarchy he saw this as important in sexual selection and imagined women enforcing it by their mate choices this kind of description flips the mechanism of the subjugation of women and other men idea somewhat on its head or at least makes it a tautology of course this does not map well on to the examples of competing styles of masculinity going in and out of fashion within generations but you could imagine that averaged out over evolutionary time it could have an impact ,6,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, i also tend to be using the term a little differently than connell in that i say that it can apply to subcultures whereas connell tends to invoke society in a less granular way i tend to think that we belong to a variety of cultures at once and that each of those cultures has its own norms i think you are on to something real an obvious example was hippies who called war heroes baby killers i am not saying they did not have reasons but i can also see why an older generation would have been shocked by the sudden change of attitudes it would go against a definition i saw of hegemonic that referred to society wide attitudes but whether you talk about it on a society or a subculture level seems like just a matter of splitting lumping taste it is probably people from within a subculture who tend to use hegemonic in a pejorative sense or has the subculture expanded to become the majority or at least the elite culture in that case hegemonic masculinity on a society level might not be what some think it is it no longer exemplified by john wayne and for many is now exemplified by barack obama who often sounds pretty woke though it hard to know how much of that is pandering then again trump seems to tap into a more traditional form of masculinity if a crude form of it so maybe the us is just pretty evenly divided between cultures ,5,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, 1 the expression of masculinity that is most respected within a culture or subculture 2 the hierarchical superior relationship that masculinity is granted other forms of masculinity by that culture or subculture the hegemonically masculine man is the real man against whom other men masculinity is judged and most frequently found wanting i liked your post generally but this part got me thinking especially i recently heard the role of the hero in mythology described in very similar terms perhaps a synonym for hegemonic masculinity with a positive connotation would be heroism maybe i am reading too much into it but i seldom get the sense that hegemonic is used in a positive or even neutral way and i realize you are just recapping some feminist theory so i am not arguing with you but a little with the theory ,6,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado,it interesting that they consider the kernel of truth hypothesis and do not completely discard it it might be possible that black men in the us while being on average nearly the same height and weight are on average more muscular than white men but that still would not excuse judging any individual by this hypothetically somewhat true stereotype on the other hand when making snap judgments it hard to avoid being influenced by stereotypes perhaps part of the solution eg for cops might be to encourage de escalation and avoiding the need to make a snap judgment where possible another thing that comes to mind is that lower class men tend to act tougher and try to appear more threatening this has no doubt been labeled toxic masculinity but could probably be better understood as a strategy of improving social standing for men with few prospects to distinguish themselves in other ways such as with a career ,13,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,i agree with most of what you wrote except for the last part about assigning blame you could make the same argument about blame with regard to any crimes committed where they were sanctioned by a society if the individual is not responsible then who is the whole society the promoters of the ideology that produced the result you can even make a similar argument from a position of believing that humans behave according to deterministic laws of science and hence do not have free will but that leads to nihilism if taken seriously ,1,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado, are you under the impression i would think this makes it any less terrible it does not matter much to my point what you think about that but it is not a position that is commonly strongly condemned and fascist as discussed elsewhere has just become a synonym for bully or at least orwell http www orwell ru library articles as i please english efasc http www orwell ru library articles as i please english efasc noticed that 73 years ago ,3,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,but it unexpected so it plays into publication bias ,1,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,it hard to look into that study further when the author does not like link to it or provide any details but i would not take any one study too seriously when there is publication bias and it so easy to p hack to a desired or at least publishable result ,6,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,sounds like a bad situation at least it good to hear she in a better one now another reason to get around to switching to lyft soon i was curious and had a look on glassdoor and did not see many reports of this kind of behavior but then i have not spent much time on glassdoor so not sure how much that tells you ,2,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,i have no problem with devil advocacy but i am not sure what you are saying ,2,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, now that i think of it is not the racial discrimination explanation directly contradicted by something they mentioned earlier in the article which is that foreign born black women have infant morality rates that are nearly exactly the same as white women it not at all clear why they would be immune to this racial discrimination could it be that what is really being discriminated against is being a member of an underclass which has some overlap with skin color but foreign born black people and upper edit and middle class black people do not fit that stereotype ,5,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,you raise a lot of good points what if the ai functioned as an assistant to you the human mod edit and my comment about trolls was based on youtube comments which seem to have hardly any moderation ,1,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, i refuse to dismiss possibilities but if major chain stores are writing policies about it smaller chain stores will likely follow suit out of fear that seems plausible but it does not diminish my main point which was that it seems to indicate this has been a real issue and may very well remain one at least for a while at many mom and pop stores ,1,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, in this day and age such discrimination if proven would result in a crushing lawsuit that the stores in question would very much want to avoid just that has been happening though crushing might be a bit of an exaggeration http www cnn com 2013 12 21 us new york profiling claim index html if major chain stores are having to write policies about it it probably safe to assume that it happens at many smaller stores ,4,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,it does seem like it is only as neutral as the trainers who grade the toxicity of text of course you have the same issue with mods in either case it up to whoever is in charge of the comments to enforce their own brand of civilized discourse so for arenas that do not have good active mods who can handle the traffic it seems likely to help the problem with most online comments is that the trolls outnumber the mods by a large factor this seems like a way to even things out i hope twitter looks into this seems like it could also be trained to identify jihadis etc while there is the possibility for abuse i will wait before declaring the sky to be falling ,9,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, well i mean on the bright side that one way to end racism except that it wo not actually be gone we just wo not know what to call it we might have to use terms that describe specific actions or attitudes i do not have great suggestions on that but i think fake news has had a similar problem of growing to encompass so many different things that it also a floating signifier a more specific term to cover the original meaning of fake news might be fiction masquerading as news though that might also just be co opted by its creators ,2,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, check your privilege was intended originally as a way of saying be aware that others are dealing with a situation you do not see and please do not assume the situation does not exist that all makes sense to me though the phrasing comes off as a bit aggressive where it starts to break down is that women never seem to be asked to do it even though they are in most cases immune from situations arising from being a man sometimes a term becomes so ideologically freighted and contested that it stops being useful for fostering constructive discussion i think fake news has now crossed over into that category recently and sjw probably did a while ago ,11,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado,broadly it is that when progressives deny that there are any problems with certain ideologies when there obviously are they lose credibility and open the door for nasty right wing populists because they are nearly the only ones willing to talk about the issues a more fleshed out argument on the topic https www samharris org blog item a few thoughts on the muslim ban,3,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,how about salafism vs a secular society any clear preference edit and really islam is worse than christianity is a serious straw man since i have been explicit that is not my point ,5,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,i would agree that the important distinction is not islam christianity but comes down to certain beliefs and values that have a lot of overlap with certain religious traditions especially salafism i also think scientology is pretty scary but mainly in a they will sue the heck out of you rather than a they will bomb the heck out of you sense i realize you are taking great pains not to sound like kipling but you presumably do have values you just seem unwilling to stand up for them in this context whereas you are fine with doing so in other contexts ,5,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado,obama used it in a speech or several but it was an mlk quote that i paraphrased if it not possible to measurably improve a society why do progressives try to change society for the better edit and if you cannot say that a society ruled by the taliban or isis is morally worse than most you have a severe case of moral confusion ,7,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,my understanding of the narrative of progressivism is that when you look back over history things have improved morally in many societies something about the moral arc being long but bending toward justice whatever you consider the relevant moral unit i think the argument above still holds moral relativism is a convenient practice for cultural anthropologists to try to avoid bias in their field but it does not equip us well to see clearly when there are principles worth fighting for ,4,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado,the wiki page on sufi salafi relations https en wikipedia org wiki sufi e2 80 93salafi relations united states is a fascinating rabbit hole particularly these bits the relationship between salafism and sufis two movements of sunni islam with different interpretations of islam is historically diverse and reflects some of the changes and conflicts in the muslim world today 1 salafism is associated with literalist strict and puritanical approaches to islam in the western world it is often associated with the salafist jihadism 2 sufism is associated with the use of prayer music dance and the teachings of sufi masters who may serve as an intermediary between god and humans to achieve a spiritual sense of the meaning of god 3 while there are muslims who believe that salafism and sufism overlap the standard salafi response to sufism has been called polemical 4 according to various observers salafists have been usually unrelentingly hostile to devotional sufi practices 5 arguing that sufism is irreconcilable with true islam 4 and one of the elements corrupting modern day islam 6 relations between the two movements have been described as one with battle lines drawn 7 or a rift found in practically every muslim country 8 and in the muslim diasporic communities of the west 9 as well united states in the united states sufi leader muhammad hisham kabbani is well known for his vocal criticism of wahhabism 91 kabbani who moved to the united states in 1990 as an emissary of his teacher shaykh muhammad nazim al haqqani the grand shaykh of the naqshbandi order has described wahhabism as being like an octopus because its tentacles are reaching everywhere according to kabbani when he arrived in the us from lebanon in 1990 he was shocked to hear wahhabi doctrines being preached at friday sermons i asked myself is wahhabism active in america so i started my research whichever mosque i went to it was wahhabi wahhabi wahhabi wahhabi in 1999 during a forum organised by the us department of state kabbani charged that 80 per cent of the mosques in the us were run by extremists ,3,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado,i think it a fuzzy category and pretty much agree with the other user that personhood should go with self consciousness but for cultural reasons we consider newborns to be fully human so i am not going to argue that point either ,2,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,i agree with you 99 the only place i would differ is that while i think abortion should be legal up until viability or so we maybe should not celebrate it as a good outcome having no ethical spiritual component at all since people often grieve the loss of miscarriages there is at least something potentially psychologically weighty there ,3,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado,that need to procreate is encoded in the genes that each of us carries so the need of the embryo was implicit in the egg and sperm that it came from do the egg and sperm have rights do frozen embryos have rights if one of our cells mutates into cancer the cancer cells also have needs are we required to supply them ,4,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado,it seems like more of our opinions are leaking out on to social media all the time people seem to be becoming somewhat more emboldened to raise controversial opinions there for a variety of reasons that might be distracting to consider the obvious downside of this is that it may help normalize formerly taboo opinions that deserve to remain taboo the upside i suppose is that some assumptions might be questioned and filter bubbles made more porous i do not think this fb post tone is likely to provoke reasoned debate and a lot of it seems in the category of not even wrong but taking a moderate tone does not necessarily protect one from accusations of sexism so maybe he decided to just go big an interesting postscript is his friend long and in depth response which covers a lot of what is discussed here and more https www facebook com ericshawyoga posts 10212183229482540 and the op promise to reply to him edit and another of his female friends responded by reading between the lines of his howl and posting an article apologies to the sacred masculine http soulshaping com soulshaping apologies to the sacred masculine the letter this warrior in transition would like to receive it a bit heavy on the new agey jargon for my taste but the sentiment seems good and an effective way of making a connection across the gender divide for those who speak that language ,1,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado,ok i suppose it is also largely a matter of taste overlaid on or perhaps even in some cases in opposition to instinctive attraction and tastes do not necessarily become more sophisticated over time or more sophisticated in the sense of more experienced does not necessarily more understated you can have makeup enthusiasts who get very into dramatic harajuku or fashion magazine style looks i would bet that even for a lot of people who do not like the fake look like the many young guys who say they do not like girls with makeup there is a level of artifice that is just below the threshold where they notice it as fake that they do find appealing it like increasing the saturation on a photo it looks better and better until all of a sudden it looks fake that threshold is not the same for everyone but i guess it exists for everyone except perhaps for super professionals who are fully conscious of all of this ,1,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,it took me a while to get around to listening so apologies for being late to the party it made me think of the idea that while progress is typically assumed to be always positive by progressives it ai not necessarily so and this is an area where that seems pretty clearly the case the old traditional system where there was dating before sex and monogamy was expected does appear to have at least provided more intimacy and stability for more people even if there was less freedom but to have a system like that the sexual marketplace had to be regulated this was done by taboos on premarital sex slut shaming looking down on single parenthood etc then at some point our culture underwent deregulation part of that was universities stopping acting in loco parentis in the 60s i do not know how we go back to some workable middle ground i suppose it would require enough of the higher status students to decide they do not want to do hookup culture https en wikipedia org wiki in loco parentis higher education prior to the 1960s undergraduates were subject to many restrictions on their private lives women were generally subject to curfews as early as 10 00 and dormitories were sex segregated some universities expelled students especially female students who were somehow morally undesirable more importantly universities saw fit to restrict freedom of speech on campus often forbidding organizations out of favor or with different views from speaking organizing demonstrating or otherwise acting on campus these restrictions were severely criticized by the student movements of the 1960s and the free speech movement at the university of california berkeley formed partly on account of them inspiring students elsewhere to step up their opposition the landmark 1961 case dixon v alabama was the beginning of the end for in loco parentis in america higher education the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit found that alabama state college could not summarily expel students without due process however that still does not prevent students who exercise their rights from being subject to even more legal action despite having done nothing other than violate an arbitrary rule ,2,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,also the male costars are paid less and have to do a psychologically physiologically difficult job so there is probably less supply of young hot male porn stars and the ones who are able to do it tend to stick around for a few years it is reportedly not that easy to keep it up under pressure in a roomful of people etc ,3,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,yes of course there will be a range of opinions about that i am not suggesting limiting free speech just wondering how to think about his contributions to the national debate eg i can see the argument for not engaging with someone who often seems not to be arguing in good faith as is the rule here so i would not blame someone for declining an invitation to debate milo for example i take your point re he helped conservatives on college campuses feel like they could challenge political correctness though i do wonder if his model is replicable by others without his biography and personality ,1,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado, stupid crap like pat slap the other woman pussy as though they are kind of lightly spanking it and somehow this is supposed to be intensely pleasurable some like it i think my biggest complaint about porn is that so much of it is aesthetically offensive to my eyeballs even if not to my ethics hideious eyeshadow fake breasts that look like they used grapefruits for the implants platform heels that should earn arrests by the fashion police tacky nails i think those things might be the sexist parts porn stars need to look trashy or something i agree with you about not liking those parts but i think the reason for it is more nuanced or banal perhaps unsophisticated consumers of images tend to be impressed by more dramatic ones eg overdone saturation https goo gl images bp2a4m and excessive hdr https goo gl images 08d4eb overdone makeup fake tan and plastic surgery are similar they hit the instinctive reward buttons kind of like candy does but as someone becomes more sophisticated and learns how makeup works and how to spot a bolt on they tend to become less impressed with the fake look for women since they tend to learn first hand about makeup at least sooner than men that process probably happens sooner likewise we tend to outgrow a taste for candy to some extent with age ,2,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, i am not really into porn however i have occasionally wanted some and more often than not my attempt to find some that was actually appealing ended up killing my mood altogether so then i did not need any anymore right then which is one way to resolve the situation eh i gather that is a problem for a lot of women and it makes finding porn they would like a lot harder i do not think it that easy to define or make porn that women will like to some degree they seem to just be more picky discerning about it or to use your wording more likely to find it a mood killer i suspect this has some connection to the smaller proportion of women who are into kink women are generally less attracted to risk taking and kink and dramatic porn sex seem somehow related to that ,2,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,a couple questions what is as you see it the real story behind the pdp antisemitism accusations i looked briefly but could not find anything from a trustworthy source what if milo is not a nazi but it can credibly be argued that his net contribution to national discourse is a big negative on the positive side i suppose he is drawing some of the more extreme elements on the left out into the light and he has some parallels with oscar wilde who was reviled in some quarters in his day and imprisoned for his now unobjectionable actions and words on the negative side he promotes falsehoods mainly to raise his profile and make money as far as i can tell and he adds fuel to the fire of polarization and chaos ,1,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado, i understand why some people would view the unborn as innocents and value their right to live over that of their flawed parents who may have brought about their conception by being careless it an issue that is a lot more ambiguous than i think either the pro choice or pro life sides make it out to be i guess i do too to some extent but i do not think a manichean view of it is tenable because it leads to every sperm is sacred https www youtube com watch v fusplvstpbk which is ridiculous from a scientific or even just consequentialist point of view are we going to start locking up masturbators what about frozen embryos do they have rights then again i doubt those with anti science points of view will be persuaded any time soon ,1,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,pretty much agree with all of this i have experience with having a partner stop taking the pill without telling me turns out she could not get pregnant anyway so the joke was on her ,4,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, there a case to be made that having an abortion should not free one up from the financial obligations that come with having a child so you would have to give up a portion of your wages to some public fund that is an odd position and i realize you do not agree with it i find it hard to make a sharp distinction between financial and bodily autonomy because our finances in most cases derive from what we do with our time bodies so taking away significant finances tends to limit options for what we can do with our bodies that is it forces us to work more and have fun less with our body ,6,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,yeah it seems like there is some segment who believe women should have no responsibilities stemming from casual sex but men should i am not on either extreme of that one though a lot closer to the sex positive side than the traditionalist one but to be consistent i think you have to pick a position that applies to both sexes ,6,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,this seems like one of those things that everyone knows and scientists finally got around to doing a study that confirms it i would guess the biggest change would be between baby boomer and gen x since gen x were raised under feminism as a dominant cultural force ,4,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,what bothered me i think it would be that you seemed quick to jump to the assumption that just asking the question was evidence of bigotry i can understand being wary about certain topics because there are certainly bigots out there but the left has gotten into a very strange place on the topic of islam where there is almost no room to criticize islam publicly without being labeled a bigot from mainstream voices on the left sam harris is a prime recent example of this of course this is a lot to read into a few lines or your replies so apologies if i have pattern matched too much and i will look forward to hearing how you differentiate yourself from the progressive party line on this topic that combined with a condescending and censorious attitude about something that you know much less about than the op as seen in this line not wild about the huge generalisations across the arab world ,3,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado,do you know of any studies on that it seems very likely true with the caveat that there is path dependency about how the government got to that place that is there has to not be major ethnic strife in the country and not be an ideology hostile to individualism subscribed to by a large proportion of the country ,1,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado,you seem to be trying to figure out where muslims sit in the oppressor oppressed model it could be that it not a good model for producing coherent ethics ,3,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,another parallel of a secularizing leader in the muslim world is ataturk in turkey from 23 to 38 following the fall of the ottoman empire and in recent decades and years there has been a rise in islamism there i wonder if the trend toward secularism in the mid 20th century in that part the muslim world is to some degree a result of the fall of the ottoman empire that is it could not have happened during the empire and it may have been encouraged by the perceived failure of the empire ,1,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,it a fascinating idea but it seems like such a political third rail how do you talk about it without encouraging white supremacists or asian supremacists i imagine a counter would be that they do not need any encouraging but on the third hand you do not want to be tarred by being cited by them ,1,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado,i am not in favor of a blank slate but just do not want to read more into the data than is necessarily there the part i quoted talked i think about the possibility that it is different snps that are associated with the relevant underlying genes which may be the same is that what you mean by linkage it been a while since i studied genetics in college ,2,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,this part seems like plausible speculation and would frame the differences found as mainly incidental and not functional that we can use common snps to proxy them in europeans could be interpreted as just meaning that we can successfully find patterns in the random ld patterns noise that are statistically linked to variation in the causal variants a lot of this random variation post dates out of africa and thus does not work for africans ,1,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado,it verging on the naturalistic fallacy which u orangorilla already illustrated but personally i think while monogamy might be a good ideal particularly for raising kids if two people approach it consensually it probably not wise to make it the be all and end all of a long term relationship it smacks of catastrophizing and makes the relationship more fragile i prefer esther perel and dan savage takes on it there is little cost to not being in favor of monogamy if you are scarlett johansson but for most people it would hurt their ltr chances ,1,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado, and islam collectively just never had crises like the protestant reformation it had different crises and it would be hard for at least sunni islam to have a similar church state crisis because there is not a centralized church like there was with catholicism so instead of religious authority becoming captive to or co opted by the state it tends to be forced underground and bubble up where states are weaker i suppose the saudis co opted salafism but their bargain involved turning it loose on the rest of the world ,4,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado, of course but where was that the prevailing argument from places like newsweek and time magazine when anita sarkeesian was claiming death threats were being sent to her i agree the msm has often been timid about questioning claims by feminists and other progressive heroes but their sins have usually been ones of omission so while i tend to disregard everything from infowars or breitbart with the best msm i find i mainly need to read between the lines and compare multiple sources but it does make me think more citizen journalists could be a good thing and fill in some holes in coverage eric weinstein was recently calling for that on twitter https twitter com ericrweinstein status 831918083665063936 i think with everyone having a video camera on them at all times the opportunities for gathering evidence are out there eric weinstein ericrweinstein the fix to the emptiness of stadium rock was punk rock a fix to msm is indie punknews now i feel i am back w the ramones all over again unfortunately it hard to prove a negative like someone not getting threats without hacking them and even then but easier to gather evidence of things like blac bloc types with clubs ,1,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado,the company policies reflect the attitudes of the management many in silicon valley have the attitude that free speech is a good thing but they have not really worked through how to implement systems for when it crosses a line into harassment or propaganda the main leverage we have on these big social media advertising corporations is via their public perception as forces for good or evil we do not have to use them and they do not have to remain free of any meaningful regulation facebook did react when they got a lot of bad press for fake news not sure how effective that has been ,9,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, this is classic conservative be more ladylike lecturing i guess but there is surely some overlap with feminist concerns about sexualization of young girls etc that is just because someone you do not like says it does not mean it 100 wrong i think sex positive sounds more fun than sex negative but i guess you have to draw some boundaries even if where they are drawn is somewhat arbitrary ,6,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,i think there is some value to the implicit threat of violence that is in part what a large nonviolent protest is it is a show of potential force we can hope that it is mainly a show of electoral and or moral force but there is the implication that if pushed it could become more so i would favor large protests of nazis over sucker punching them it does seem important to make it clear they are not condoned by large parts of society before they can reach a critical mass where they might feel emboldened to do more than talk ,2,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado, would you really be so surprised to see similar sentiments arising in muslim women today as arose in western women a century or two ago without thinking about it too hard no but based on the lack of examples i am tempted to think the cultural prerequisites for feminism as we know it are pretty specific of course there are womens movements in the islamic world https en wikipedia org wiki islamic feminism but they look pretty different from the feminism we know apologies if i missed something in the op video i do not usually watch videos ,1,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado,it sounds like we nearly agree but you are understandably mainly seeing the ongoing annoyances from the female perspective the thing that happens all the time in this example from the male perspective is having to second guess their own behavior and getting messages shaming them about it in the media this can of course be dealt with but then having someone want to continue a conversation a little too long can also i am not trying to imply it never gets worse than that but just give an example of a common mildly annoying thing ,7,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,well yes i get that point in certain circumstances though i think the narrative that we are extra hard on womens appearance is a little overplayed but i think it not that hard to find other circumstances where the roles are reversed with regard to acute chronic eg when it comes to behavior women have pretty wide latitude to be friendly flirtatious etc in public and at work it might result in unwanted attention which could occasionally be quite unpleasant but it will almost never result in an arrest or firing men have to be a lot more careful about their behavior all the time see all the attention paid to trump appearance vs hillary also i would take it as primarily evidence that men and women are interested in womens appearance and not as much in mens this can be annoying but it can often be used to get an advantage over an otherwise similarly qualified man or woman ,5,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,yes men are given a hard time sometimes by bullies for being non gender conforming but they are also given a hard time by mainstream society for being gender conforming that is what i was trying to point out with the quotes i am not trying to engage in oppression olympics but just trying to question your premise that mens complaints are somehow more circumscribed and less relevant ,7,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado,i am wondering if you read the same parts of the other thread that i did just in case i will quote some mister ghost anti feminist movement feminist 16 points 1 day ago white man here i would not say i feel oppressed what i feel like is a legitimate target no part of society is structured as a conspiracy to deprive me of autonomy or quality of life on the other hand it is a politically lionized act to pseudoironically denigrate and dehumanize me to disregard my beliefs as irrelevant to dismiss my struggles as automatically superficial and to treat my existence as inherently hostile no one has ever made an attempt to systematically deny me rights or legal standing but i do get treated to people who emote that an idea is stupid by repeating it in their most masculine voice people who find stereotypically masculine behavior like calling your friend bro offensive and even hostile people who despise the suggestion that anything should be made more welcoming to men and people who believe that being able to avoid me and people like me is an important public accommodation and i should accept it gracefully when i point any of this out anywhere but here it is treated as hostile people make assumptions about my beliefs they assume i must hate women or that i believe that men are the real victims whatever that means i get it must be so hard to be a young straight white man here the thing the man heh is not keeping me down but i should not need to be oppressed for me to say i am being treated poorly that bad and you should stop and there is something fundamentally wrong with the fact that when i do say that i get treated like an enemy combatant in the culture war sorry if that came off as grouchy it more emotive and less logical than i like to be but i needed to vent ryeroen casual feminist 3 points 21 hours ago but i do get treated to people who emote that an idea is stupid by repeating it in their most masculine voice people who find stereotypically masculine behavior like calling your friend bro offensive and even hostile people who despise the suggestion that anything should be made more welcoming to men and people who believe that being able to avoid me and people like me is an important public accommodation i get what you are saying here it a difficult point to respond to so let me try to explain why i actively avoid people who come off as overly masculine i am gay and every person who ever bullied me in school was the walking talking embodiment of testosterone it was the same people that played sports and wrestled with each other and went to big underage drinking parties i fully acknowledge that many of these people grew up and many of them are not that way at all but i have such an ingrained aversion to this type of person that i simply cannot stand to be around them i am sorry for that this also applies to many other types of people for me as well for example overly flamboyant gay people annoy me and i tend to just stay away mister ghost anti feminist movement feminist score hidden 9 hours ago this is another common response and while it nowhere near as upsetting to me it still frustrating as all get out i totally understand your experience it is not at all revelatory for me to learn that sometimes people have bad experience with groups and develop aversions to them everyone is on the same page on that front the problem is that bad experiences with men particularly with straight white men the situation is treated totally differently i am from halifax ns what that means is that every year thousands of university students from ontario arrive for 8 months and basically treat my hometown like their dorm room as a result i have a reflexive dislike of people from ontario i do not like that the reflex is there but i also do not force myself to pretend it is not we all pretty much intuitively understand where the line is on this front i am entitled to my opinion i get to prefer people who are not from ontario to be around but i do not get to make them carry it i do not call them onterribles or come from aways my dislike is my problem not theirs and while i am allowed to not like them it bad for more to relish not liking them there is no right to be liked but everyone has the right to not be mistreated when it comes to men this goes out the window people love to not like men it is a point of pride it is fun it brave and it righteous and the onus for accommodating this prejudice is placed on the men not the people who actually have the prejudice and the ontario things was just the least controversial comparison i could come up with how to you think the feminist movement feels about men who having had bad experiences with women decide to avoid them and go their own way ,11,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, the existence of men facing microaggressions in particular circumstances but most of the examples given in the other thread i linked were of a pervasive anti male bias in eg media and social media so it seen in regular everyday life also it is of a nature that until you recognize it it is invisible no doubt like the sexism of the early 60s shown in eg mad men was to most people of that time ,12,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,it both refreshing and disappointing to read a philosopher coming to common sense conclusions i suppose i could read her papers to see the logical steps involved to get to those conclusions see she seemed to steer mostly clear of controversy avoiding the questions about trans implications for essentialism only noting that there is anti abortion feminist philosophy ,7,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado, for women it more of a constant erosion where they are just getting constantly worn down throughout their daily lives i get what you are saying but if you read the other thread https www reddit com r femradebates comments 5q4duf why do white men feel oppressed it seems that men face some microaggressions also a difference is that we are generally hesitant to talk about them non anonymously for fear of ridicule or worse it may well be that women face a worse background radiation of sexism but it hard to say when the public expressions of each are treated and incentivised so differently ,15,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, ashkenazi jews have the highest median icome i am pretty sure about that maybe but i do not think they are tracked by the census the highest ethnicity income level on the census is austrian which might have some overlap with ashkenazi jews and there is dispute https www quora com are jewish people part of an ethnicity a race a religion or all of the above whether the jews are a race an ethnicity or a nation etc ,1,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,i was just quoting a piece i found that described some critiques of the concept i do not agree with everything in it some of the figures given seem neither here nor there but the figures on the page you linked are per capita household income i have to confess i am not sure what that means i think i know what per capita income is and what household income is but ,2,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,while this might very well be an example of sexism it of the fairly easily avoidable kind and once a writer is well known they are no longer held back by their sex being known on the other hand if the idea about there being more variance in male than female intelligence is true and certain kinds of writing benefit from unusually high intelligence the source of the stereotype would at least be known ,0,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,this seems to make sense at least on the face of it but there has been criticism of the model minority https en wikipedia org wiki model minority idea and its use by governments to blame minorities for their problems an interesting bit from the above article asian americans do have higher median family incomes than all others by race however that s because asian american families tend to include more incomes our per capita incomes still lag behind that of whites asian americans also tend to be clustered in coastal cities where median incomes are higher skewing that statistic even further even the supposed higher than average educational attainment level of asians doesn t stand up to close scrutiny when it comes to the percentage of adults without high school diplomas the hmong chinese laotians vietnamese and cambodians in the america all exceed the national average of 19 6 with the hmong on the extreme end of disadvantage at 59 6 ,4,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,i think that is a risk of assuming that progress is always positive it is just change with a positive connotation it true that there are some big examples where change has been positive and progressives tend to talk about those a lot but there are also many examples where it has not been positive in some of those cases i think the change was the right thing to do even if it had some negative consequences but i would just like to see more humility about unintended consequences and more examination of the assumptions behind the concept of progress i guess this is the argument that traditional systems have the fact that they have been stable for some time as a point in their favor you could say that communism was in theory a fairer system but in practice it did not work out to be stable or stable as a fair system anyway ,10,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado, if expansion of women roles freedoms and opportunities is ultimately generally good for men which is something i have always believed then a movement to liberate men from the constraints of their outdated traditional roles should generally be a good thing for women even though it might be a distressing proposition for many women as it was for men i think i mostly agree perhaps mainly because it the culture i grew up in but i do wonder about the endpoint and whether anyone cares about testing empirically whether that endpoint is an improvement for human flourishing eg should we expect everyone to wear unisex clothes in the future that just seems a bit totalitarian and if not how will we know when everyone is able to express their own preferences without the taint of traditional roles it seems that without a willingness to look at the role of biology in preferences we will be doomed to fighting an imaginary enemy ,3,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,i expect the initial imbalance was probably caused by innate differences in preferences or historical contingencies but then once an imbalance gets started it tends to be perpetuated to at least some extent things like the craze over extra sensitivity to sexual harassment a while back did not help things because to avoid that pitfall male executives often did not invite female colleagues to after work functions involving alcohol ,11,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado,well i think the argument is and i am not sure how much i agree with it that being visible is more important than inspiring sympathy i hope it not true because traffic is bad enough as it is and there are a lot of worthy causes out there i guess it always going to be more attention getting when someone puts their life on the line for a cause buddhist monks self immolating are the ultimate example of that but perhaps we have realized that walking a hundred people out on to a freeway is not really putting your life on the line and it effectively similar to throwing tacks on the freeway ,2,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado,recent trends seem to be going in the opposite direction so this does not seem like much of a practical loss i have seen the argument that without the courts deciding things via roe v wade the congress would have had to come up with a solution more responsive to public opinion which would have resulted in less rancor i am probably not informed enough on it to have a strong opinion but it sounds plausible there do seem to be some parallels between gun rights and abortion rights in that the advocates for both tend to take maximalist positions on edge cases that are not in line with the opinions of most citizens ,5,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado,agreed i wonder how this might fit into leadership styles i have found that effective leadership in this sort of situation often involves building a large enough coalition to get critical mass and then announcing we are going to x you are all invited of course depending on a bunch of factors like lying about wmds that can piss people off but it can also shorten an agonizing process and give a better result ,6,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,if someone is reluctant to follow the advice then giving it in a way that they are more likely to take on board totally makes sense as you wrote but if they are eager for logical advice and want to follow it where the logic leads as 33 minutes friend seemed to be that probably less of an issue this is especially true when there are 2 or 3 clear choices all equally difficult in medical interventions it often involves something that either expensive or a hassle or breaking long standing habits vs being lazy and doing nothing so compliance is as issue ,4,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado, you have just been relying on people moral intuitions which systematically favor preventing nearby harms over preventing harms that are far away and out of sight these are moral intuitions evolved presumably because we prefered to live around people who act this way and tended to shun those who did not or because group selection favored groups acting that way it a little similar to the idea that most people would not buy an autonomous car that would not take their safety before that of others it been pointed out that even so this is better than not having autonomous cars since things will be safer overall if a philosophically virtuous idea does not lead to a game theoretically stable situation it in danger of being out competed ,1,EffectiveAltruism

beelzebubs_avocado,when i was in college in the early 90s i do not remember hearing much about privilege per se but i do remember a girlfriend who had political ambitions telling me how she wished she were a man because then it would be much easier i did not know what to say but her becoming a politician seemed much more likely than me doing so what if we back up and use a less fuzzy concept like unearned advantages given that concept would you agree that women as well as men have some unearned advantages that come with being their gender ,8,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence is a metaphor but it is also a real phenomenon which has a parallel in the gender discussion when you look at the grass at your feet you can see the brown patches but when you look at the grass in the distance you can only see the green parts because they obscure the bare patches on the ground similarly you can see the downsides to being yourself but you tend to rely on media representations of the other gender which often focus on famous people ceos etc ,11,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado,well no because there was no context of we have to elect the first female president and if you do not help you are a sexist without that context then yes i am with her would be innocuous ,21,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, having sex with members of the same sex is a homosexual act by definition yes but historically in a lot of cultures being openly gay or bi is a fairly new development gore vidal wrote an articulate defense of having sex with men but not identifying as gay in palimpsest his sort of memoir if memory serves he did not find the matter of who he had sex with to be one of the more important factors in his identity i guess we all have features that others might identify us by that do not seem like major elements of identity to us eg i do not identify strongly with being white ,3,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,are you disagreeing with the proposition that admitting to having had same sex sex is much riskier for a hetero identified man than for a hetero identified woman it strikes me as too well known to need sources but i am sure they could be found if needed ,9,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,you are implying that no women or minorities voted for trump despite misgivings about some of his policies and rhetoric and that no white men voted for clinton despite misgivings about some of her policies and rhetoric ,17,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, you really have to walk me through this because i do not see it by this token any presidential candidate who had their name in their slogan was giving off the same message ike won with it so it not necessarily a losing strategy you really do not see a difference between i am with her and i like ike just to be even more clear i am with hillary or i am with clinton or i like h or i like c would not be gendered but i am with him would be ,28,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,one reply that seems semi effective is to say that i think trump voters made a poor choice but it was not a criminal act as some on the left tend to consider it there seems little chance of being labeled a bigot for pointing that out why is this worth saying because it can turn down the hysteria a little and put the focus on productive forward looking actions more accurate but not meant in the ancient gendered sense my male friends are just as guilty of it ,4,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,the most obvious was the i am with her slogan as well as gendered attacks on berniebros during and after the primaries the impression it was easy to get was the message that it was her turn and womens turn there was no need to make that a 1 selling point it was already obvious to anyone willing to vote on that single issue that she is a woman ,36,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, do not actually make white people look all that great it almost as if they are individual humans people are influenced by things on the margins not all of them rational most people will not be influenced by one of those things that you think are unimportant but someone who is right on the edge might be and when that happens with enough people in a close election it can make the difference i do not think turning election analysis into moralizing is productive for having a democratic party that can win elections it leads to vilifying voters who in many cases voted twice for obama would not it be nice to welcome those voters back instead of pushing them farther away ,18,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,listening to the 538 podcast with nate silver they point out that in a close election any number of factors could have been decisive comey letter fake news sjws being stupid clinton campaign focusing on running up the score in solid blue states instead of strengthening some swing and close states health insurance rates on the public exchanges were going up 20 or so,14,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,another speculation terrorists might wear military uniform if they thought it would exempt them from search but you would think they would realize pretty quickly that is not the case so i do not know on the third hand maybe some tsa employees want to make their job easier and pick someone more likely to be cooperative and less likely to freak out at being told to do something ,1,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,this is at least very suggestive legitimate news stories outperformed the fake ones in the early months of the 2016 election campaign but in the last three months fake news sources saw their engagement surge there s a clear partisan dimension to this story according to silverman 17 out of the 20 fake news stories had information favoring donald trump http www vox com new money 2016 11 16 13659840 facebook fake news chart and the meme of truth relativism that the right has been spreading lately could also be called an attempt to silence dissenting opinions a cautionary word we are all capable of believing things which we know to be untrue and then when we are finally proved wrong impudently twisting the facts so as to show that we were right intellectually it is possible to carry on this process for an indefinite time the only check on it is that sooner or later a false belief bumps up against solid reality usually on a battlefield george orwell in front of your nose first published tribune gb london march 22 1946,1,AskTrumpSupporters
beelzebubs_avocado,i think you expressed it better than i did it occurred to me afterwards that perhaps she was intending to produce some clickbait and now i feel bad that i helped spread it if that was all planned then i have to give her props on her method acting at least some of it was planned since she got a cop to film it for her i am not sure if i asked a cop to film my pat down for me if he would cooperate i guess that expected difference in reaction of the male cop is what i would call attractive woman entitlement ,1,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,username checks out ,1,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, fake news trump did not win because of disinformation he won because hillary is terrible to say the least if fake news did not help him win why so much defense of it i acknowledge that in a close election any one of many factors could have been decisive ,1,AskTrumpSupporters
beelzebubs_avocado,why not do both you might have a different feeling about if the other side mobilized a more successful disinformation campaign in the next election ,1,AskTrumpSupporters
beelzebubs_avocado,yeah i think just knowing that a hijacking by jihadists could lead to something like 9 11 has changed the behavior of passengers to the point where they have much less chance of pulling it off that has been the case with several hijacked planes already starting with the one on 9 11 that crashed into a forest so like you say that lack of surprise combined with a few minimally intrusive security measures should do the job but it hard to scale back a big bureaucracy and it hard to reduce security theater or excessive caution because if anything happens then there will be blame cast a commission might be able to recommend something like that if there were any political will to make it happen i suppose it a jobs program at least ,9,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,this came up on facebook most comments were that it looks like a normal patdown and that she is being dramatic it strikes me as an example of playing the victim card in a situation where her attractive woman privilege was not removing obstacles for her it also reminds me of a case where morrissey the singer claimed to have been fondled by a tsa employee but video was found that refuted his story he was probably also used to receiving special treatment and got mad that he did not get it i would not say the tsa have not screwed up a lot of times or that their mission might not be ill conceived but this does not obviously look like a screwup ,13,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado, clinton got 1 3 as many votes as obama but those other 2 3 of votes did not vote trump they just did not vote i do not think this is right but cannot find better numbers quickly my impression is that clinton got fewer votes than obama due to lower turnout and some obama voters voting for trump but not by 2 3 maybe 10 20 lower or something it complicated http fivethirtyeight com features education not income predicted who would vote for trump ,11,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,i feel quite confident i can do my own fact checking given enough time but there is not enough time in the day to check all the fake news also there are a lot of people who do not have great critical thinking skills or media literacy i think facebook has a responsibility to discourage those people from circle jerking themselves into ridiculous and harmful beliefs i think the radio stations that carried the likes of rush limbaugh also have a lot to answer for frank luntz republican wordsmith even said as much in a talk he thought was off the record http www slate com blogs weigel 2013 04 25 frank luntz rush limbaugh and the secret tape addiction html ,1,AskTrumpSupporters
beelzebubs_avocado, pjw is the worse among them for the reasons you stated i wish one or the others did a piece on it they all predicted trump would win from the beginning which gives them a lot more credibility than the entire msm including the four sites that are monitoring facebook scott adams saw what trump was doing because of his hypnotism training so i certainly consider him more credible in detecting effective use of hypnotism techniques now on the other hand michael moore also predicted the result would you say that gives him credibility on other subjects it not hard to find out what happened if you look past the headline breitbart is likely to give attention to something that the left media will ignore as a non trump supporter you should be regularly scanning breitbart headlines as i do with vox and others could you give a couple examples of stories the left wing media have ignored one that comes to mind is crime problems related to muslim refugees and immigrants in europe but i have heard about that from other sources i would rather check the atlantic the economist or commentary for intelligent center right to right takes the russia narrative is silly given the number of influences hillary had supporting her the fake news narrative seems like an allergic reaction to losing and will most likely bite them in the ass by making the dems come across as the censorship party i am with you on having been very disappointed in clinton being a part of the deep state like all recent presidents but she was not surrounding herself with advisors paid by russia or with business interests there if you wrote a novel about a manchurian candidate with facts that we have seen come out people would complain that it was unbelievable ,1,AskTrumpSupporters
beelzebubs_avocado,while i am aware there are competing narratives out there and i found some of what scott adams wrote about the campaign illuminating the pjw video just seems shouty and partisan i had heard of infowars as a conspiracy site just had a look at it and it looks like it also hyper partisan and breitbart does some news stuff but heavily slants headlines and spreads disinformation and propaganda like pizzagate so i do not take that too seriously if you think those are reliable sources of news then we will have a hard time agreeing i think the reason that fake news along with russian influence became a big story after the election is that they were consequential no one cares much about some tinfoil hat wackos if they do not do anything more than waste time looking for evidence to confirm their beliefs and up until recently that was all they did ,1,AskTrumpSupporters

beelzebubs_avocado,agreed i do take issue with the mandela effect as a plausible theory though a much simpler explanation for the observations it covers is that people often mis read or mis hear things in similar ways ,1,AskTrumpSupporters

beelzebubs_avocado,i am not sure about all fake news being a conspiracy seems unlikely but there are memes talking points which were likely crafted by someone central such as the msm is fake news or there is no such thing as human caused climate change followed by there is human caused climate change but it too late to do anything about it republicans have been effective in recent years at using language to shape the narrative with terms like death tax frank luntz http www motherjones com politics 2013 04 frank luntz rush limbaugh problematic secret tape has talked about doing this sort of thing as a consultant ,1,skeptic
beelzebubs_avocado, but to judge all feminists based on this dumb twitter junk is about as fair as judging all mras based off of the oh so popular equal rights deserves equal lefts meme i mainly judge the individuals though to the extent there are shared attitudes in a tribe this sort of thing can show them the idea that chivalry is not compatible with strict egalitarianism seems ethically defensible while at the same time we should not abuse weaker people just because we can sounding too gleeful about it is not a great look and probably comes from experiences that gave rise to bitterness it interesting to note that the response to being they think unfairly characterized is to respond with a hyperbolic version of that caricature i have read that some of the tactics of the alt right and breitbart have followed that playbook this year a lot of others were not in on the joke if it was one and became even more horrified i am not making an equivalency but suggesting that it probably not a productive tactic except for raising morale in the in group ,2,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado,i had never really paid that much attention to killallmen before it had seemed like a vaguely hostile meme looking it up on twitter just now it looks like about maybe a third of the uses are ironic a third are unironic hate speech and a third are hard to tell or just references to the meme i did not get the sense that the ironic uses were making fun of feminist mass murderers or radfems the message i got was something like men suck but i am not going to do anything like this about it because victim ha ha it does seem like if vague internet threats or off color jokes are something that needs policing then this might qualify i do not think all feminists are evil bitches whose sole goal in life is to ruin the lives of men but this does add to the impression that many feminists are very sensitive about some things but often very insensitive when mocking the outgroup this salon not usually my go to outlet on gender issues piece seems to back up some of these impressions http www salon com 2013 05 07 twitters latest unfunny trend killallmen ,1,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,i have found myself in a similar position recently one way of putting it that seems possibly helpful is to say that while i think the trump voters made the wrong choice what they did was not a criminal act ,2,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,it a more niche market but presumably the supply of content for it was low also the market probably includes many who are more mrm sympathetic than mras also youtube and blog viewer readership can translate to tv shows think tank appointments etc of course this applies to anyone not just female mras ,3,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,the main benefit i could imagine for female mras is self promotion through a youtube channel etc but you could say this about anyone on youtube the additional benefit for male feminists seems to be social acceptance and perhaps dating access to feminists who would not date non feminist men listening to an interview with karen strahan talking about how she became an mra she seemed sincere of course i suppose that a story any public figure would want to hone is the idea that it ethically suboptimal to use femaleness to help get noticed in this context i suppose that hinges on whether you think the mrm is bad for women and conversely whether you think male feminists are gender traitors depends on whether you think feminism is bad for men ,3,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado,yeah although i did not read about much in the way of behavior issues like you would find with wolves or african wild dogs or dingos so i am guessing they were domesticated at one time and then went feral some thousands or tens of thousands of years ago i would probably feel more comfortable with one as a pet than a purebred line that had been bred for fighting edit that is to say i think they might be confusing wild and feral ,1,whats_my_mutt

beelzebubs_avocado, the left will want social safety net the most you will get out the right is a ubi or nit i do not disagree but i wonder in practice what the difference is between safety net and ubi nit is it just that there is means testing and more complicated criteria etc for welfare the main problem i have seen with the right adoption of libertarian ideas is that they have taken the low taxes and regulation part but not the rest ,7,FeMRADebates
beelzebubs_avocado,there was an episode of a fairly recent tv show where a character who seems flawed but mostly decent walks into a bar and gets a drink then sees his ex dancing drunk he asks the bartender how many she had the bartender says 5 so he orders 4 more to go with the drink he just got they end up taking a cab home and presumably having sex and seem happy though she is hung over in the morning the interesting part is the implication that if he matches her on drinks then it ok of course she was not falling down drunk just having a lot of fun ,7,FeMRADebates

beelzebubs_avocado, is it not a politically stable state or has the path to get to one just been too difficult so far another reason could be simply that rulers do not like being told to rule less i would file that under path too difficult and maybe also under unstable you might have one ruler who was a perfect libertarian philosopher king but then the successor wants to do more stuff that would go under unstable it seems what the philosophy is lacking is ideas about how it can catch on as a popular movement and how it can stay popular at the moment it seems to be supported by a few very rich guys who are in it for the low taxes maybe not the ubi and a small segment of the electorate or would some compromise be an acceptable option ,1,FeMRADebates
