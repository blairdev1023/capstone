Yakkahboo,this is my understanding so i apologise if i am wrong basically no existing mods will become paid mods we are not losing mods in that sense any projects that go through creators club have to be submitted at point of design to bethesda for them to vet you basically have to pitch your idea for a mod to them before you start actually making it you get feedback pluses negatives etc if accepted you gain access to a bunch of their resources and i imagine they would require you to use a particular creators club assets so bethesda can hold onto the mod itself securely kind of like how the ark devs are doing their supported modding i believe there would be a level of integration into bethesdas games that is similar to how their dlc works so what stops somebody ripping it and uploading it for free i imagine whatever stops official dlc being treated the same way whether that works or not who knows ,2,gaming

Yakkahboo, after money is involved morals tend to break down the same can be said for anything then i mean digital homicide are a truly reputable company and it was purely luck that they died or was it this system depends on a level of competence and fairness which is why the first system was pulled altogether if their true aim was to extort like you said they would have stuck with the same system they will likely pursue this option once it becomes clear that console players buying mods will make up for lost profit from angry pc players i will point back to my previous statement on this if people stop making mods they have nothing to sell they shut down nexus people will stop making mods it would be the most counter intuitive move they could possibly make the system would fail and it all comes crumbling down also i feel you are underselling your hatred for console players so they can reap the benefits and give next to nothing to the mods creators do you have figures on the cut bethesda take so we can verify this claim ,1,Fallout
Yakkahboo, lowering of content this is not very descriptive of the problem but i will try breaking down what i feel you are trying to describe and why it is not necessarily a problem volume of mods the format of the paid mod proposal will not reduce the amount free to use mods by any discernible amount unless affected by outside intervention what i mean by this is it will obviously go down if people decide to sabotage the program if anything modding will probably see a larger influx of contributors given there is now a proverbial carrot dangling in front of them the reason for this is regardless of how many mods are pumped out and how many people want to monetise them bethesda have finite resources they want to run any projects through an integration and qa process using their own resources before they even get a sniff of being a paid for product they can only handle so many mods and will focus on the absolute best ones to be brought into the creators club the vast majority will stay free and bethesda wo not come close to considering them quality of mods the quality of most mods especially for games like skyrim and f4 are already pretty damn dump there are many many great mods but for every one of those there are 20 garbage mods stolen mods etc we saw this rear its really fucking ugly head when the first tried paid mods people were stealing copying generally posting crap and monetising them because they could now they cannot bethesda says what can and cannot be monetised people simply cannot pump out crap and monetise it crap mods will still be crap but there no reason for mods to decrease in quality however at the top end we have an incentive that carrot again suddenly competent mod makers see the potential for return if they make a good enough mod people start putting more effort into their mods to aim for this goal most still wont make it i propose that free mods will in fact get better as people try and make the cut this is all based around the understanding that bethesda have finite resources to work with these mods and so they cannot put everything through the process a good example is to think of any top sports team do we think that since professional sports players are getting paid serious amounts of money that everyone who does not make the cut is suddenly going to stop trying of course not people saw michael jordan at his peak with his stupid nike deals and they wanted to be the next jordan quality will only increase as it has done in sports as it will do with anything where there is competition for rewards lack of a community this one is entirely on the community bethesda will likely have a dedicated creators club forum nexusmods wont magically disappear unless bethesda shut them down ill give you a hint they wont they need nexusmods to keep doing what it doing to help create fantastic mods and create fantastic modders to pump into their system which yes they get a cut from you do not bite the hand that feeds the community will be fine unless they decide themselves for it not to be lessening of future games now this one is an interesting one i do not entirely disagree with you the fact that bethesda are committing resources at all suggests that if anything were to launch alongside a release it will have taken resources from the product it goes with i cannot personally see bethesda committing to ruling out day 1 community content and even dedicating a team to it would feel to the majority like it taking away from the base game given bethesdas form this is the one point i am personally concerned about and wo not give 100 support to the system until they prove to me that they wont do this however they are not stupid despite what people say and they probably know more than we do that this would actually be the deathbed for their games all in all i think there are 3 major problems with the creators club reveal 1 they did a piss poor job with paid mods 1 0 people dont trust them with it yet 2 they explained it during their show really really really badly the fact we are diving into their faqs to get the real answers and are having to piece this together ourselves is a bit of a pr disaster 3 people like free shit and anything that can even be remotely linked to taking that away will cause people to shit bricks point in case wildcard studios with ark survival evolved they hand pick a bunch of mods each month top 10 they have a small pool of money they distribute said money to these top modders in exchange for essentially hosting their mod the devs get to sit with the mods and work with them and the modders to ensure they are properly supported within the game the mods are held and distributed by the studio to stop people trying to steal it etc basic protections great stuff right it exactly what bethesda are trying to do except bethesda want the consumer to chip in and thus the bricks were shat ,3,Fallout
Yakkahboo,please do tell me what havoc do they invite do that and ill thank you ,-4,Fallout
Yakkahboo,ah you are a valuable member of the community ,-2,Fallout
Yakkahboo,i feel it a very interesting solution i would say it elegant but using a bespoke currency which bothers me funnily enough something is already in place for another game and people were all over it remember ark survival evolved remember how they are paying 10 modders a month to maintain top quality mods that are held by the dev team so they can support them properly excellent by the devs the community was all behind it when it cropped up but the second a company asks the player base to contribute to that system now do not get me wrong i still need to be sold on this if we start seeing expansion sized content on this system great success i do not want to be spending minute amounts of coin to get a single new sword x50 on this system give me deep content packs that are akin to officially supported dlc and ill be all over it ultimately browsing the internet today and i see a group of people who care about the contribution modders make to their games it ai not the people that are raging at bethesda ,20,Fallout

Yakkahboo,http uk ign com articles 2017 04 15 battlefront 2 multiplayer preview bigger better and more emotional this is what a quick search gave me while the team won t get into specifics at this point there are some fairly telling changes from 2015 s battlefront firstly we re teased with the idea that the new game will offer full classes rather than the changeable equipment loadouts of the first each class will come with a shared progression system but will change appearance depending on what map and side you re playing on for instance the prequels battle droids and first order troopers look very different but are the same class with your chosen upgrades that progression system s seemingly designed to let you feel as though you re moulding a character as you play helping you get more attached as well as fit your play style ,2,Games

Yakkahboo,british here and i think that it important that my nation maintains a position of basically no guns i support that stance obviously this topic points more towards the us and i feel it important that us citizens are allowed to own guns this is not a constitutional issue for me it just there that many guns many of them in the wrong hands there no way that you can get rid of them people should be allowed to protect themselves from that this is accounting for what happened in australia too the us is a whole different kettle of fish it would simply make law abiding americans less safe i do not appreciate those who blindly defend guns however proper training is imperative and i personally think that strong licensing laws are required to deal with that i obviously do not have the answer to this but if people keep crying about taking guns away the second there a sniff of policy aimed at controls on arms issues will constantly rise and it goes without saying you do not want a civilian population getting into an arms race arming everyone is not the answer ,5,AskReddit

Yakkahboo,now i am aware you are in a heavily gender biased field i work in games development myself i am not denying your issue here i have seen some really surprising terms used in professional capacity but it seems a lot of it stems from a perception of what men do and do not for example men are childish as fuck especially in jobs i have worked at we are all boys we are the boys with our toys regularly there is no belittling based on terminology amongst males unless you get to suit and tie jobs and it often down to our lack of wanting to treat women differently that causes this sort of stuff to carry across it also comes down to social comfort and discrepancies are often down to a misunderstanding in social status between people in the way you would start with sirs and madams then to surname status then first name basis what i mean here is woman is definitely a more sincere term which is why i completely understand while it cab feel belittling but it is also very formal sometimes when formality drops again with social familiarity people might stop using it i think that dumb but it happens mostly with no malice usually if there this misunderstanding you just need to get around to asserting the discomfort it not easy but if people continue then it an issue it absolutely not a comfort for you for me to say this i understand and i am sorry you feel the way you do thought i would shed a bit of light on how males often are in the workplace though at least from my experience ,-3,AskReddit

Yakkahboo,fury does not half feel great now i am actually excited for both enrage windows and times i am not enraged furious slash is a great tool for when you cannot enrage bringing some well needed consistency to the spec and rampage is so damn satisfying to hit i am genuinely stuck between enhancement and fury now they have nailed both of those specs i feel the only differences are that fury spec choices in some of the lines feel a little less impact full than they could be ,1,wow

Yakkahboo,i was looking at my warriors gear and none of it from previous cata questing was added i fear that race change and faction change have fucked me up tldr my warrior did not have access too whirlwind axe in my transmog collection makes me sad edit recopied my character the prodigal son returns it may look like gash but ww axe is bae,1,wow
Yakkahboo,there was a thread on this a few days ago the sad state of affairs is this is fucking legitimate like if you want to allow the player to take a screenshot you need to declare permissions for the camera and the gallery if you want to access the device id in this exact case you need to ask for phonebook and caller permissions blame the permissions system not the game devs all they want is to be able to get a unique id from you if you have any tech issues so they can flag it on tickets for example and yet they have to do this this pop up highlights the problem with the entire system its a shame there are a lot of devs who abuse this system cough facebook cough but some guys just want a few things to assist with game features that do nothing out of the ordinary and yet they have to basically tie their own noose around their neck to do it ,113,gaming
Yakkahboo,i cannot really disagree with anything he said i was chatting to a friend of mine context being were all kinda 50 50 console pc but i own an xbox and almost everyone else owns a ps4 what we got out of this years e3 was yeah the hype from sonys conference was unmatched but microsoft seemed to have tapped into something new i had my friend saying yeah i might pick up x or y now that its coming to pc microsoft have gained a new customer which for them is great and for me is great too courtesy of the cross platform play on one side its also a bonus for sony because people dont feel the pressure to get an xbox for the most part if they have a gaming pc and sony will arguably see an even larger share of console sales in the future because of it but microsoft have opened themselves up to a whole new audience in gamers who play both console and pc and i feel that it puts them a step ahead at present like tb said we now know microsofts plan but we really dont with sony so its hard to be certain but if nothing changes for sony theyll do well on paper for a few years but will probably start to fade as people see the benefit of a cross platform system and the options that it brings ,16,Cynicalbrit
Yakkahboo,the entire permissions thing is just poorly thought out half the time its the bad catagorisation of the permissions anything that wants to let you take in app screenshots hey we want to use your camera anything that requires your device id for multiplayer authentication like that hey we want to use your phonebook its bad for everyone ,6,gaming
Yakkahboo,maybe halo 5 could have done without the first 11 levels or so it only got okay when you got to sanghellios even then it was poor better but poor i did really dislike halo 4 too but maybe 5 had more potential that it did not fulfil which could have left a souter taste in my mouth ,0,gaming

Yakkahboo,i fell out of favour with it after a while the campaign was the worst out of any of them and the multiplayer worked for a while but the lack of btb maps and the ever so slight increase in aim assist made it harder and harder to play for me ,1,gaming

Yakkahboo,it is really dumb they kind of dropped the ball really we had war crimes and the legendary questline theyve taken so much of the important lore away and pushed it to other areas or taken it out so wow itself has nothing left dont get me wrong i love war crimes but i would have loved it more if we had a scenario for the battle of the temple of the white tiger its unfair that people missed out on such a pivotal part of the game lore instead we get blizzard saying so garrosh escaped and thats what happened ,10,wow
Yakkahboo,well the legion is always trying to invade its just were at different stages but yes this runs very deep ,5,wow
Yakkahboo,well we still are idiots i believe in legion though he apologises for conspiring to get garrosh out and having kairoz establish the alternate draenor this time around he more likely to concede that his ideas are not always the best which i believe is why so far his presence is muted in the broken isles he hunting for answers rather than making his own ,20,wow
Yakkahboo,probably not it always better to do new stuff than revamp old especially if theyre open to doing updated versions like they did with warlords pvp weapons for example ,3,wow

Yakkahboo, goal of making every school an academy but no compulsion to do so cool so when we agree that academies arent best for everyone forcing a pull in plans to switch all schools to them you merely change policy to lets do it over time so nobody notices cheers govermentbros the goal should be to provide the best education to children as possible and that the case for academies should be handled on a case by case basis there are some times it will be a great idea there are some times it wont be there is no way for certain they can say that academies will always be best for education this statement to me says that obviously the education isnt the priority here ,6,ukpolitics
