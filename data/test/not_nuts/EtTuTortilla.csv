EtTuTortilla,the truth is we do not really enforce the trigger warning tags for anyone prolific writers or otherwise also prolific does not mean better it just means heavy output so let call them pop authors or something when a pop author writes a story that violates the title rule or the believability rule they are deleted as fast as a new author sometimes the stories even have thousands of votes and we still can them it the job those are rules we all agree are important u iia has fallen victim to that as has the author of the sar stories as have several others if you search the ooc however you will see a lot of threads where most regulars and mods express our distaste for trigger warning tags it horror by definition the goal is to trigger fear disgust revulsion terror etc so it not that we are colluding with pop authors by any means it that we do not enforce that rule at all if anything your post is making me think that we should remove the word must and replac it with some comment like some readers like trigger tags so it up to you ,21,NoSleepOOC

EtTuTortilla,i am also a local and i do not at all think that rationale makes sense the current figure for unemployment in arizona according to the bureau of labor statistics https www bls gov web laus laumstrk htm is 5 using the numbers provided for the whole country i calculate a mean unemployment rate of 4 29 and a standard deviation of 98 the distribution for all states is slightly negatively skewed but kurtosis is 35 not above the rule of thumb value for considering the data set non normal thus arizona unemployment rate is within 1 standard deviation of the national average certainly not high enough to be a major factor in breeding specific types of crime statistics on meth use seem to be conflicted with some showing higher rates in the southwest and some showing higher rates in the deep south and southern plains states why do not people in colder climates use meth does it not pair well with macaroni salad and miracle whip perhaps we will never know uh what was i saying oh either way arizona does not stand out on its own for meth use as for the heat yeah that could do it sometimes i get so angry sitting in completely stalled traffic on the 60 that i do feel like getting out of my car and murdering the guy with the thumping bass or going on a falling down style adventure through suburban phoenix so that could be i think the prevalence of shooter cases has to with the media circus surrounding them the national news reports when we have one and when one gets caught so that all you guys hear the local news here though lives on those stories when the i 10 shootings were going on you could not watch a single channel at 9 pm without hearing about for an entire month when the original two guys were terrorizing the city it was all anyone talked about what you end up with is a localized cultural meme centered around serial shooters if you are a person who angry and you want to act out in another state you might do a spree killing or a series of rapes and murders here your thoughts jump to serial shooting you think about how long the original guys and the baseline killer were able to run around without getting caught you remember that the two serial shooters were only caught because they screwed up maybe you can do it better so we get the i 10 guy who according to the police did do it better because he has not been caught you also end up with the guy who was just caught and the pet shooter who was active out in the east valley for a while ,12,UnresolvedMysteries

EtTuTortilla,i never said our titles were clickbait free from the original post you replied to the mod team was unable to find exact guidelines from a number of sources so we created a formula that would serve as the rule it not perfect but it helps reduce the number of improper titles meaning there are a rough set of guidelines without exact definitions so we constructed just such an exact definition to cite when removing stories there nothing subjective about what is removed and what is not it all based on that rule the rule is not subjective it based on title guidelines and loosened somewhat to allow for both immersive and literary titles if a rule breaking story stays up it because it was missed and not reported again not subjective ,5,NoSleepOOC
EtTuTortilla,well you have definitely turned not reading everything i am writing to you into an art this is at least the third time i have specified that it not my personal subjective opinion there are guidelines that exist outside this subreddit made by editors and staff of writing associations about titles if it were possible it would be great to implement some readability criteria and shunt the rest to r nosleepworkshops where new writers can get pointers we do have a rule on walls of text anything beyond that is difficult or impossible to implement one may be worse for the experience of the audience in the short term but a poster who does not care will never improve until they decide to care a writer who cares is constantly improving ,3,NoSleepOOC
EtTuTortilla,i still would not call that guy a plumber in a nonprofessional environment like at a bar i would not say oh that jim the plumber to make it clear i am not saying i value good writers over bad writers here nosleep is a great place to practice and train i do not have a lot of respect for people who do not educate themselves in their hobby or chosen field though a bad writer who cannot figure out plot how to break paragraphs and effective titles is still a writer they get that badge a person who comes here and thinks a wall of text is acceptable or does not bother to look up how to title something is not a writer they have not shown the proper respect for storytelling which is one of humanity oldest passtimes ,4,NoSleepOOC
EtTuTortilla,how is it subjective if guidelines exist outside of nosleep guidelines put forth by the same organizations and editors who advise on word choice plot pace and paragraph structure and look i would not trust a guy who played with pvc pipes as kid to fix my water line and i definitely would not call him a plumber i am not saying he has to have formal training in plumbing and pipefitting but he should educate himself on the trade before he decides to put his service in the world ,3,NoSleepOOC
EtTuTortilla,that not the only reason they are bad which you would know if you fully read my reply there are plenty of guidelines for titling short stories that these titles blatantly ignore we should not be rewarding writers who do not bother to learn about what they are doing ,4,NoSleepOOC
EtTuTortilla,it would but we would need a gigantic team of moderators working tirelessly to edit all the stories that get posted do not forget that we are mods not admins this is all volunteer editing the stories for the most recent ebook took days and there are only twelve stories and all the subsequent parts of series posts ,9,NoSleepOOC
EtTuTortilla,wanting views is fine i want views you want views but that not what i said i said they are sacrificing their integrity as a writer for views that is wrong when an author ignores guidelines for making new paragraphs we remove the story when the author ignores guidelines for titling a work it should be removed ,3,NoSleepOOC
EtTuTortilla,that really does not impinge on the writing we require the links be innocuous so they do not damage the immersion and by that virtue they do not damage the integrity of the story ,6,NoSleepOOC
EtTuTortilla,we care about the title because we are trying to be a place for not only good horror but also good writing a sloppy title is not good writing and it absolutely does not showcase the author talent at wit summary and foreshadowing what it showcases is the author drive for upvotes over substance and highlights exactly how much their willing to sell out their craft for a few days of recognition the mod team was unable to find exact guidelines from a number of sources so we created a formula that would serve as the rule it not perfect but it helps reduce the number of improper titles the first title you mention should not be allowed all the mods know it all the writers here know it it a loophole through the formula guideline not a proper title i can cite a bunch of opinions on proper titles but i feel like everyone in the ooc knows what a real title is even if they do not bother to make them ,7,NoSleepOOC

EtTuTortilla,fourberry is absolutely right anything is fair game as long as i sitting by a window in a recliner in my underwear cannot pull the curtain aside and see that you are slinging bullshit also it cannot be something the national news would grab immediately and make a breaking news report about the reason is because those things are falsifiable there are tons of paranormal things that just are not falsifiable in a scientific sense and therefore can be used in any story you write ghosts are not falsifiable because 1 what would you possibly investigate and 2 if you decided to look at one thing and did not get a result someone who believes in ghosts could just say you did not look in the right place it just not an accurately framed question nothing paranormal is vampires could be living next door because we have not disproved their existence also totally real stuff is fair game on nosleep too the things you mentioned like serial killers creepers and awkward quiet people who build nuclear bombs in their garage that all fine ,7,NoSleepOOC

EtTuTortilla,it a good idea in theory but it bogged down by practicality who going to set up the structure kindle unlimited was set up by amazon who could shunt money into the coding and streamlining necessary for the setup nosleep has a volunteer staff and no money negative money even from what past mods spent on mailing physical prizes and what i pumped into the ebook site before we switched to 30 press aside from the money i do not think a single one of has the know how what about permission from reddit the reason ebook publication is done by a group completely separate from the nosleep mod team is so we can take revenue from physical sales to pay for the hosting and eventual monetary prizes the mods are not allowed to make money from the sub and technically nosleep is a domain owned and operated by the owners of reddit changing the structure of this specific subreddit would absolutely get their attention and not in a good way some narrators like the nosleep podcast do offer monetary compensation each story gets 40 flat rate and the author retains rights i think authors should be smart and block access to their content if a narrator is in a position to make the kind of money nsp does and does not offer compensation that said small time narrators are struggling just like small time authors we can lift each other up if we are fair and work together let the little guy keep their youtube revenue pocket change and in return maybe they give you a shout out when you publish a book after all narrators would not be in business without writers and writers reach a whole different demographic when they let narrators read them on youtube it a symbiotic relationship already so we should just draw that teamwork out as far as possible ,8,NoSleepOOC

EtTuTortilla, i am also fucking tired of how fascinated people in the industry are with their own lives man oh man you are absolutely right in every way there this is a big problem with new writers on snl too they come on write something amazingly off the wall that almost everyone of taste hates but the real weirdos love and it becomes an internet sensation in a few years they have lived in the city too long and every joke revolves around new york in a way most of the world does not understand and my god how many movies about hollywood were there in the last two years like 4 at least only about 1500 people resonate with each one and people say comic book movies are oversaturated ,2,NoSleepOOC
EtTuTortilla,i have submitted a few things to real journals but the only thing that ever got through was a satirical poem about working in an office i mean i had this amazing epic poem about world war 2 and they would not touch it i also submitted two surrealist horror pieces since i could not find a journal willing to publish the kinds of things i actually write i know they exist but they are usually run on a shady pay for submission architecture i am poor anyway surrealist horror fell flat then i found nosleep according to my favorite english professor who was always trying to publish his novel you have to play the little journal game to gain recognition among the gatekeepers to publishing sure self publishing gets around that but how many self published books sell a million copies i also submit to science journals for my day job and i will certainly tell you that literary journal publishing is lacking objectivity you have a drink with an editor or meet her at a party you are published literary publication is as much about fluffing egos as it is wordcraft scientific pubs are more level ground not entirely but more so that why i started posting here my first story got some great attention and i did not have to schmooze some asshole in new york chicago or la i knew it probably was not the ideal path to publication but i assumed that followers are followers then of course i started doing the ebook and they made me a mod i fell in love with the community and i became addicted to watching my story karma rise ,9,NoSleepOOC

EtTuTortilla,well keep in mind that fire travels up it travels everywhere but it really likes up think of a campfire the tower of sticks and logs is all burnt at the top but down below there are some pieces of wood that never even caught if the fire department arrived soon enough to save the house but not the people which is totally likely the floor may not have had time to burn through ,1,NoSleepOOC
EtTuTortilla,it does not take long at all to die of smoke inhalation that shit works quickly if the smoke is really concentrated you can pass out in under 5 minutes if someone finds you immediately you will probably suffer life long lung damage or maybe you would just die in the hospital from complications of not getting enough of your blood oxygenated quickly enough to use if you want a long estimate to be on the safe side your people would be dead in 15 minutes realistically a lot less i remember fighting a brush fire out where i live with rakes and shovels not the best tools for the job but it was in an area where there was no water and the fire department at that time was about 25 minutes away to really get in there and stop the fire you had to be right in the smoke you could only do that for a minute or so i suppose if you were not frantically shoveling you could probably stand it longer by just holding your breath when you are working though you have to breathe and shoving your face right in the smoke did not let you breathe it was easy to see how quickly smoke inhalation can snowball on you first you take in a bit then you cough that inadvertently drags in more smoke the cycle continues the problem i see with your scenario is that your victims seem not to know they are dying you totally know you are inhaling smoke it burns like a mother and causes spontaneous and uncontrollable coughing it not carbon monoxide you do not want to use the stove because a mixture of aerosolized gas and oxygen is basically a big ass combustion engine and like the doors of the house are the pistons when a spark is introduced say from a frayed wire or pilot light standing in for the spark plug the fucking thing explodes liquid gas works a little differently because it not mixed with air in perfect apocalyptic proportions it burns nicely but also burns hotter than typical materials because a volatile substance lots of energy to expend hoarder houses are usually complete losses in fires because they are filled with kindling old newspapers and cardboard boxes suck up fire like kirby inhaling enemies so filling someone house with a bunch of burn a rific stuff like that is a good way to make sure a fire you set is going to continue ,3,NoSleepOOC

EtTuTortilla,phoenix police officer sean drenth his story has only been on here once before and that discussion only focused on this new times article http www phoenixnewtimes com news the curious death of sergeant sean drenth 6456218 the main points to take from said article drenth was found dead in an alley near the state capitol complex the initial scene drenth on his back shotgun and hands on his chest bullet wound to the head based on that the lead investigator leaned toward suicide said investigator then left the scene other investigators though began to question that initial assumption drenth service pistol was found tossed over a fence about 500 feet away drenth gear was strewn around his body drenth backup revolver was laying near his feet one shot recently fired brain matter was found in a tree 12 feet from the body but not directly around it the backs of drenth hands were dirty and scuffed the backs drenth was out of communication and not answering radio calls for almost an hour before a witness heard the shot s the first officers on the scene reported finding the shotgun facing barrel to drenth feet it was barrel to chin in the morning when investigators arrived that article was from 2012 about 2 years after drenth death in october 2010 what went unnoticed in the previous discussion were reports from 2013 when drenth widow was granted the right to line of duty death benefits according to this article http archive azcentral com community phoenix articles 20130607phoenix police drenth granted death benefits abrk html an independent team of crime scene investigators hired by the family found that the details were not in support of suicide some startling things the shotgun drenth supposedly used to shoot himself an instantly fatal shot was pumped the shotgun shell was ejected in such a way that was physically impossible if drenth was lying on his back when he made the shot it pretty obvious i think that drenth was not the sole person involved in whatever went down in that alley but what did happen we know drenth and three other officers were being brought up on charges right before he died that sounds bad and it is but maybe not as bad as you are thinking these four officers had signed a contract with a phoenix housing development to provide off duty security they only showed up about half the time the development was charging them with theft of 1600 for taking pay when they did not work definitely some unsavory freeloading that i would prosecute if i was the one paying but motive for suicide one theory is that drenth did shoot himself but one of the first responders two were drenth friends altered the scene to be more consistent with homicide so his family would get the payout that explains the discrepancy of the shotgun orientation the fact that another shell had been primed but it does not explain the odd placement of brain matter and the impossible shell casing could one of the other three officers decided drenth needed to go before they went to court over the 1600 possibly but what could he say about the situation that would be worthy of murder i know people have been killed for less it just seems iffy drenth had worked for the major offenders unit prior to his assignment near the capitol could he have met with or seen someone he knew was a wanted criminal did he see a crime in progress what about the backs of his hands i initially thought the hand scuffs could be explained by drenth carrying the shotgun and falling he would have reached out instinctively but not been able to rotate his hands to land pal first if he held the shotgun phoenix pd notes however that the shotgun was clean and unscuffed i think drenth was handcuffed at some point reason for his gear to be strewn on the ground and an explanation for the scuff marks on his hands i think he had the shotgun in his hands but it was taken from him then he was made to dump his service pistol drenth tried to surprise his attacker with his backup gun got off one shot that did not make contact and was met with a shot of his own ,9,UnresolvedMysteries

EtTuTortilla,i had not heard of gamergate until now but that has to be one of the most ridiculous movements i have heard about i mean games these idiots politicize everything as a writer though i did hear about the bullshit with the science fiction community i did not know it was tied to gamergate or the alt right people were submitting really sub par junk by the right kind of person because there were too many transgender and minority characters like what the fuck it a story no one making you read it it not an 8th grade us history textbook for fuck sake i mean unfortunately i think that also caused a lot of progressive novels to be idealized now for the politics and not the writing and storytelling but hey just another way the alt right has boned the world we could all be reading fun things if they did not try to ruin it ,9,Fuckthealtright

EtTuTortilla,and your assertion that tommy taffy is the most unique monster shows you are not an unbiased critic of the system and calls into question the validity of your concern what evidence do you have to back up your claim other than your own opinion keep in mind i said third parent was up there i did not say it won drawing parallels between this method and participation trophies tells me you are not familiar with the number of nominations i received for the contest not to mention the number of stories that are posted per day i could add several more categories next year award them to different authors and each one would be deserving we have dozens of authors who give readers like you free content and who should be recognized for the quality stories they post we also have hundreds of thousands of posts that were great and went unseen did not hit the mark or were just terrible you think giving an extra author or two a kind nod and an ultimately intangible and meaningless award is akin to giving every story posted to the site an award no this contest is for the authors and the readers appreciating more authors helps strengthen our community and keep content strong likewise allowing one author to win every contest with one or two stories does not provide new readers with a good supply of nosleep best i do hear your concern though it one that been raised before about the monthly contests if you are not aware of the rule only authors who have not won in the past year are eligible it a similar idea on one hand if someone is the best they should be recognized as many times as is appropriate i believe that on the other i am also keenly aware that simple name recognition can influence votes it called the mere exposure effect and it influences a lot of decisions people make daily it not fair or merit based as the contest is currently decided through community vote alone i will not conside changing the current and admittedly flawed rule however by 2017 i would like to instate a panel of unbiased judges who choose winners from the nomination pool at that time i will consider changing the rule because exposure familiarity and group think wo not be an issue while your opinion of the best monster is obvious i will say that i think you owe an apology to the rightful winner of the category edit just to make it clear that i have no horse in this race i will admit that i have not read a single one of the listed stories ,37,NoSleepOOC

EtTuTortilla,i have had a theory about civil war and the marvel creative team for a while think back to the trailer it really made it look like bucky was turned and the entire team got into an all out war it looked pretty great and at least sort of in line with the comic then you go to the movie and you learn about the other soviet supersoldiers and baron zemo only the first act followed the trailer it was super cool to be in the theater and as a person who keeps up with comics and other junk like that be taken for a ride with different twists and turns i think they consciously chose to make a trailer that did not give away the story and consciously changed the idea behind the civil war name so there could be fresh content do also recall that there has been a lot of criticism from professional reviewers and the moviegoing public about trailers that give away too much of the plot not just marvel but movies in general i think we can expect to see more creative trailer editing from marvel going forward because they have taken that criticism to heart ,20,booksVmovies
EtTuTortilla,i was really hoping they would put something together like the v h s films so like you have one storyline of a reporter interviewing some people and there some sort of arc there not sure what the zoms are not as much of a problem by then so it would have to be something else whatever when the interviewee starts the story it transitions to a completely different vignette by a different writer director and cinematography team it would really feel like someone new was telling a completely different story ,11,booksVmovies

EtTuTortilla,that great advice show do not tell 101 the 102 class should cover things like do not let your showing get in the way of the narrative just like an aside should not detract from or be longer than the main sentence descriptions should not hinder the reader from progressing in the story i mean maybe if you are writing a story for people who practice mindfulness meditation but most of us do not if you find yourself describing everything in detail you have gone too far sometimes a cup is a cup sometimes a meaningless supporting character does not need a description because they do not matter the hefty dmv lady called me up to pay the fee is enough make your description match the feel of the narrative if you are writing first person and your mc makes a lot quips and one liners an overly verbose or clinical description will seem weird and unnatural however if your descriptions follow the style of the mc dialogue you are golden a sex obsessed frat guy would say something like the palm trees sprouted around the compound like a forest of boners all reaching for that great wet poon in the sky and not the palm tress rose in front of the compound like prison bars it did not take much to imagine the hand of god clanging a night stick against them to remind us all we were trapped here until we made a final exit that more for like a private detective who did 5 years in a maximum security prison for murder before being cleared ,7,NoSleepOOC

EtTuTortilla,you are not really supposed to believe everything is true it super tongue in cheek it basically a horror fiction subreddit that goes a small extra mile toward immersion and keeping the creep factor alive with a few rules eg narrator cannot die most stories are first person or framed as third person retellings of something they heard comments cannot dive into critiques so it all fake because of that we remove some creepy posts and assume they are all pure fiction but i think some are not ,10,UnresolvedMysteries
EtTuTortilla,killing might not though there were 114 murders in my city alone in 2014 which does not include missing people that may have been killed and people killed and missing who no one would report like transients and prostitutes for every murder though there were about ten rapes over 1000 in one city in one year that huge combine that with the idea that a rapist murderer might seek out a place to tell true horror stories and i think it absolutely likely that one of the 130 daily posts we have is real i do not mean one per day just in the 6 year history of nosleep at least one has been real ,13,UnresolvedMysteries
EtTuTortilla,there are a lot of factors none of which are scientific or surefire 100 of the time i mean it sort of like potter stewart i know it when i see it explanation of porn anyway word choice is a big one i will use different adjectives to evoke fear than i will to evoke pleasure and obsession focusing on certain parts of the act is another authors will tend to describe an act evenly usually focusing on the blood or their anger if they get hung up the weird stories get hung up on much stranger details like the skin around the wound sticking to the knife blade like tight labia definitely odd and shitty writing is another most people know if they are decent writers or not we do get some strange stream of consciousness posts about things other than murder and rape but the weirdest and most poorly written ones do seem to focus there so you know it totally valid to say well those are just bad writers and you might be right you are certainly right about most of them i just feel like there have been a few that have come through that were genuine little ways to tell the whole world the truth and not have the fuzz on your door ,29,UnresolvedMysteries
EtTuTortilla,mark goudeau arizona baseline killer is not a killer he was charged with several rapes and murders and convicted with dna evidence found on one of the rape victims he definitely a rapist no question there the murders were all carried out with gunshots to the head the murderer when seen which was not very often wore some sort of mask or halloween costume the rapes were committed by a person wearing a mask or halloween costume he would coerce women into having sex with him at gunpoint the kicker when raiding goudeau house the police found a mask and a realistic toy gun that matched the firearm used in the rapes so he used a toy gun to rape and a real gun to kill also none or maybe only one i am not clear on that of the murder victims were raped before being killed if the rapist and the murderer are one person that meant he had two completely different sets of gear and motives when he went out and he never got carried away and killed someone he had raped even though they could provide details to the police the rapes and murders are linked by a robbery wherein the robber wearing a mask fired a shot into the air as he left alright so you might be wondering why these were all tied together why lump some possibly unrelated events together and pin all of them on one guy who again is a rapist just because of the mask connection well no not just that during the time the baseline killer was active the phoenix metro area was also dealing with a pair of serial shooters who injured and murdered several people by firing shots from their car it was a crazy and scary time to live around phoenix i remember walking drunkenly home from a bar and thinking i could easily be killed by some yokel shotgunning me because i was easy prey things got bad enough for the fbi and maybe atf though that could have been a we might have to bring in the atf statement from a press conference to get involved law enforcement was under serious pressure to solve at least one of these cases i think they lumped the rapes and killings together out of desperation when they got a hit on the dna which was only a 3 out of 13 marker match anyway with goudeau they drove all the cases home on him the shooter is probably still out there i also think the shooter caught wind of the investigation it was almost impossible not to and purposely dressed in a mask or costume to further link his murders to the rapes there are also some weird similarities between the serial shooter case i mentioned and the freeway shooter case from a few years ago namely most of the guns used in both cases came from the same gun shop in phoenix arizona is a red state and we have plenty of gun stores but hey coincidences happen that said there was enough mishandling of evidence and unproven links between the guns used in the freeway shooter case and the suspect that the charges were dropped and he later sued the state i think something might be going on with that gun store owner ,8,UnresolvedMysteries

EtTuTortilla,i love that miniseries it was good enough that a remake is not necessary that said i would watch the fuck out of a remake though a series format would do the book more justice also maybe netflix could make some of the books that came after dune a little more enjoyable i remember thinking dune messiah was a chore to read children of dune moreso but i was so invested in muad would ib by that point that i had to keep going the butlerian jihad was pretty great but i think that was not by frank herbert ,1,AskReddit
EtTuTortilla,it makes sense from a content maker point of view give it to people who cannot afford it and those who have extra money will donate to the consumer the economical solution is to not pay i suspect that why humble bundle offers extras for paying over the average edit there are some people who honor their free services with payment i give 3 to wikipedia everytime ol jimmy wales jumps up in front of the page about lycanthropy i want to read i mean i use it for researching stories killing time learning useless facts and even sometimes getting a primer about subjects at work when i do not have time or desire to hunt down primary sources that said economics is usually a dance between the provider and the consumer just like the evolutionary arms race in nature or the real arms race between the ussr and the us in the cold war consumers are always balancing cost and value trying to find a sweet spot where they maximize their own benefit and minimize their expenses providers do the same thing in reverse maximize their value and keep the price at a point that does not diminish said value some providers like starbucks and other large brands push their value through bullshit and advertising starbucks coffee is really no better than the ex military guy who slings joe in a trailer a few miles from my house when i want to do a business coffee date though we do not go to gill grounds sorry gill starbucks knows this so they charge me a semester tuition for a fucking latte espresso and goddamn milk foam and i pay it because of the value i get from having the meeting there where was i going with this oh yeah most people are maximizing value and minimizing effort by reading your stuff for free they might even intend on paying you and then decide to do it later because it not a simple one click procedure time spent is part of the value so i would say keep building your brand until you have some followers you can start a patreon account if you want it free after all when you do have a bunch of followers release a patreon exclusive and you will probably see some capital i cannot do that with the ebook because i pledged like 3 years ago that it would be free forever i have to keep that we are selling printed copies though to help me recover some of the losses of hosting the site and my time ,5,NoSleepOOC

EtTuTortilla,effective sure proper way to do a title no the apa requires titles to be no longer than 12 words and that for scientific writing with titles that have to be more descriptive in fiction title writing is supposed to be part of the creative process and is somewhat akin to writing a riddle the title should be interesting perfectly encapsulate the entire story but maybe not obviously until after reading and short enough to fit on a spine or headline there are some great titles that fit that bill the brief wondrous life of oscar wao the bone clocks a feast of crows a liar autobiography and then there a bunch of titles that just day something cool in the title drood leviathan wakes kill switch those are obviously not as clever but they set the tone for the story ahead ,4,NoSleepOOC

EtTuTortilla,my question for you is this how old were you when the prequel trilogy came out i was 13 for menace and i really hated jar jar and kid anakin high school and college me did not really care for the other two either i did like the battle of geonosis but i remember thinking the films relied far too heavily on cgi that just was not up to snuff that said i could certainly see someone younger being really into the movies they might be more connected to the jedi and the characters of the prequels than the bounty hunters smugglers and dirty pilots of the original trilogy i could also see someone who loved the prequels feeling more at home with awakens than rogue i like rogue a hell of a lot because it felt like the parts of star wars that always intrigued me most the hoth battle was one of my favorite freaking things i loved it i always wanted to see more ground battles like that i am also not a fan of the stark black and white lines drawn by the jedi and sith teachings i always wondered about things like bounty hunters with low level force abilities and no desire to choose a side chirrut was pretty freaking close to that ,4,StarWars

EtTuTortilla,well she was a friend to those dudes they saw all the good and the bad and completely knew her as the actual human she was just like anyone with their friends fans of star wars always see a little or a lot of leia in her no matter what she does i grew up with star wars i was poor so i had actually only seen a new hope my parents bought me the vhs for a really long time i watched it so many times the tape got weak and the fucking vcr ate it i cried for a whole day my parents surprised me with the whole trilogy on my next birthday like i said i was poor i lived in the desert on a ranch and it was not too much of a stretch to think of myself as luke skywalker i thought about the star wars world more than the real one with all the eu novels and video games i spent more time with han luke leia and chewbacca than any real people when i am sad about carrie fisher dying it not all just altruism i am not just mourning the loss of an actress i am projecting all my kid feelings about star wars into this death it was a timeless place to retreat for some adventure there seemed to be a never ending stream of books and comics and i could even make up my own stories with the action figures and now it sort of like realizing the star wars universe at least the original trilogy time is not a timeless place that always there it old and it fading it also reminds me that i am 30 and i have not lost myself in a science fiction world for a long time because i have real obligations i will never be the hero in real life and i do not have time to imagine myself as the hero of my own star wars tale anymore i will just work and then i will die pointless so you know there some heavy shit with this death on the plus side mexican restaurants will always serve tacos three crunchy half moons of beef and cheese will help you keep your nihilistic musings buried way down deep at least until you drink too much and they are able to swim to the surface ,3,StarWars

EtTuTortilla,the mountain heartbeat diagram is ok it should look like el capitan in yosemite a nice easy stroll up one side and an almost sheer dropoff on the other you can evenly space some plot points on the mountain and bang you are done but that a very constrained way to write a lot of authors especially for short stuff like nosleep stories will just start writing and let the story take them but that might be too free i like to treat writing like i treat a car trip to a new place i take a look at a road map and find the most direct route that the fallback then i look around for cool places i want to drive through that are not totally out of my way but will spice up the drive i come up with one or two ideal routes then i start driving along the way i might see a restaurant i want to stop at and change the route slightly if i like the restaurant i probably go back on my way home in terms of writing i make a straightforward outline hero wants hero does hero gets then i make a couple ideal outlines or bullet points to work toward if it makes sense as i write lincoln assassination uss merrimack gatling gun then i start writing if i come up with a really cool idea as i am writing i will pursue it if i do i bring it back up toward the end chekhov gun usually the outlines come out looking like four sentence fragments on a line with a few more sentence fragments sitting around the line like those asshole drivers who do not merge until it too late if i am not distracted i will whip out a 500 word sss story in about 45 minutes that sort of a weird figure because it entails writing about 700 words and then cutting the story down maybe 700 words in 15 25 minutes is more accurate ,4,NoSleepOOC
