thedugong, especially when he interrogating the statistical evidence for some of black lives matter claims yeah about that this is the study commissioned by government and rushed out http www nber org papers w22399 a primary obstacle to the study of police use of force has been the lack of readily available data data on lower level uses of force which happen more frequently than officer involved shootings are virtually non existent in stark contrast to non lethal uses of force we find no racial differences in officer involved shootings on either the extensive or intensive margins using data from houston texas basically houston is the only place in the us which keeps detailed data and everything is extrapolated from that our results have several important caveats first all but one dataset was provided by a select group of police departments it is possible that these departments only supplied the data because they are either enlightened or were not concerned about what the analysis would reveal in essence this is equivalent to analyzing labor market discrimination on a set of firms willing to supply a researcher with their human resources data in other words the data we have got is very very patchy can a conclusion really be drawn from it that contradicts pretty consistent anecdote ,2,samharris

thedugong,so you believe that twitter and reddit are obligated to provide a platform for anyone and everyone edit regardless of tos it also not comparable to firing someone for saying things while not at work as has happened too that not really the point has anyone been fired for saying things when they could be conceived as a representative of their company eg they are in pr and use their personal twitter account for company business they have their employer listed on social media etc ie the two potential examples i can think of ,2,samharris
