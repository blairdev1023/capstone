elchupanibre5,whats hilarious is that they all thought this was going to be a huge scoop that would take down trump but they forgot one very important thing you cannot stump the trump ,3,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,could you imagine if turns out obama was the one who created the dossier and that this whole fiasco was all because of one former president wanted to troll an incoming president ,6,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,thanks this is perfect so as president he has the authority to make recommendations on any investigations and it would not be considered obstruction of justice due to his position as commander in chief that interesting how is something this simple not explained in the msm it obvious it would hurt their narrative so they would rather not talk about it sickening the media and dnc are in free fall and its wonderful ,1,The_Donald
elchupanibre5, many demoncrats and some rinos will be calling for impeachment tomorrow it sad that you are probably right but they would only be hurting themselves there is almost zero case of impeachment that can come from this it is essentially one man word against another there is no audio tape only memos typed up after the fact which have zero context not to mention comey shot himself in the foot by not coming forward with this information sooner but rather after he was fired the only chance they have now is following through with evidence of a russia hack and even that is a lost cause at this point ,3,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,good we need more pro trump things to see while waiting in line at the grocery store ,8,The_Donald
elchupanibre5, obstruction may consist of any attempt to hinder the discovery apprehension conviction or punishment of anyone who has committed a crime the acts by which justice is obstructed may include bribery murder intimidation and the use of physical force against witnesses law enforcement officers or court officials by this definition it is technically possible for anyone including the president to obstruct justice through none physical means such as intimidation the president is powerful so coercion with mere words could be looked at as intimidation to some i guess thing is who would open a case against him in this situation it essentially one man word against the president i think this testimony puts a near kill shot on any possible impeachment due to trump obstructing the farce of the russian investigation the problem now is ending the damn investigation quickly or at least clearing trump name from it so we can all move on spez you are right i just needed context the president has the authority as commander in chief to make any suggestions on any investigation including ending one and it would not count as obstruction of justice this whole thing is a giant waste of time ,1,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,yes he would in his testimony he explained that he did not feel compelled to share specifics with superiors despite him suddenly documenting the conversations it does not make sense and the more you look into it the firing looks justified i just hope congress asks him the right questions obviously the democrats will try to get their soundbites in but republicans need to back trump on this with strong direct questions ,5,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,how so exactly just asking so i can have ammo against the libs,2,The_Donald
elchupanibre5, i wrote this on another comment but i think it would be best to place it here i read the whole thing in this part caught my attention specifically comey wrote i felt compelled to document my first conversation with the president elect in a memo to ensure accuracy i began to type it on a laptop in an fbi vehicle outside trump tower the moment i walked out of the meeting creating written records immediately after one on one conversations with mr trump was my practice from that point forward this had not been my practice in the past what exactly compelled him to suddenly want to document his conversations with trump starting from the first meeting it odd to me that he suddenly just felt compelled to document meetings also how exactly fair is to document conversations after a meeting without proper context it is impossible to verify the validity of conversations without audio tape in a court of law essentially it comey word against trump this really hurts any chance of solidifying any potential obstruction of justice case which is what i think the media will be pushing after tomorrow hearing based on comey interpretation of events it seems like trump understands that the russian conspiracy is hurting his ability to pass policy and lead the country which is what we voted him to do it in his best interest and ours if the investigation is either concluded or pushed away from him as quickly as possible so he can lead effectively enemies of trump will see his poking and prodding about the cloud as disguised coercion to end the investigation for nefarious purposes but think about it put yourselves in this man shoes of course the fbi has a responsibility to investigate everything until it reaches its conclusion but the main issue for trump and those who want him to lead is to just get the investigation over with as quickly as possible trump knows he is innocent and wants the public to know this the problem is that as long as plausible deniability exists around this investigation his enemies in the dnc controlled media want this story to stay around as long as possible to hurt him or force his hand to make mistakes this is all a manufactured political witch hunt this entire debacle makes me feel sad for dr president trump because even in his direct conversations from a single perspective with comey he seems like a man who understands the importance of his position and wants to do the job people voted him to do as effectively as possible but his enemies who are everywhere inside and outside the white house are stopping at nothing to assure he fails this is why he wants loyalty but unfortunately those who already hate him and think he is satan cannot and will not give him the benefit of the doubt ,10,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,i read the whole thing this part caught my attention specifically comey wrote i felt compelled to document my first conversation with the president elect in a memo to ensure accuracy i began to type it on a laptop in an fbi vehicle outside trump tower the moment i walked out of the meeting creating written records immediately after one on one conversations with mr trump was my practice from that point forward this had not been my practice in the past what exactly compelled him to suddenly want to document his conversations with trump starting from the first meeting it odd to me that he suddenly just felt compelled to document meetings also how exactly fair is to document conversations after a meeting without proper context it is impossible to verify the validity of conversations without audio tape in a court of law essentially it comey word against trump this really hurts any chance of solidifying any potential obstruction of justice case which is what i think the media will be pushing after tomorrow hearing based on comey interpretation of events it seems like trump understands that the russian conspiracy is hurting his ability to pass policy and lead the country which is what we voted him to do it in his best interest and ours if the investigation is either concluded or pushed away from him as quickly as possible so he can lead effectively enemies of trump will see his poking and prodding about the cloud as disguised coercion to end the investigation for nefarious purposes but think about it put yourselves in this man shoes of course the fbi has a responsibility to investigate everything until it reaches its conclusion but the main issue for trump and those who want him to lead is to just get the investigation over with as quickly as possible trump knows he is innocent and wants the public to know this the problem is that as long as plausible deniability exists around this investigation his enemies in the dnc controlled media want this story to stay around as long as possible to hurt him or force his hand to make mistakes this is all a manufactured political witch hunt this entire debacle makes me feel sad for dr president trump because even in his direct conversations from a single perspective with comey he seems like a man who understands the importance of his position and wants to do the job people voted him to do as effectively as possible but his enemies who are everywhere inside and outside the white house are stopping at nothing to assure he fails this is why he wants loyalty but unfortunately those who already hate him and think he is satan cannot and will not give him the benefit of the doubt ,27,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,the dnc plan was never to impeach rather to push this fake story for as long as possible to create manufactured doubt towards the trump administration it may work for hardcore lefties or extremely casual observers but the people who matter the moderates who pay attention and actually vote see through the bullshit the dnc is committing a slow suicide by putting all of their attention on making trump the enemy rather than focusing on creating an issues based platform ,3,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,bravo this sounds like a klavan show monologue ,3,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,if its not definitive then why even publish the article oh right your narrative ,1,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,get to work you cunts ,2,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,this could be true but what if he forgot the signs which required the translator to confirm either way i do not think the commentators context was specifically about the player needing to learn english i could be wrong but that not what i heard ,1,The_Donald

elchupanibre5,uh that not what he said he said learn the language of baseball like signals and such which makes sense ,2,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,sources were saying bannon was all but gone sources were saying kushner was complicit with russians none of these revelations were confirmed with any evidence what makes you think this source is suddenly legitimate once again this is all noise so until actual things happen or are proven there is no point dwelling on it ,3,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,there is no hope for people like this until something significant happens and by then it will be too late sad but true ,3,The_Donald
elchupanibre5, trump had russia hack the election it hilarious how this sentence still makes absolutely no sense yet people so blindly believe it ,1,The_Donald
elchupanibre5, the alternative facts ,2,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,so i guess every other day is considered an election period in this guy brain ,2,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,you know what they are right this is low energy let this be a wake up call we need to collectively step it up let get this peition out to more guys with larger followers sjws know how and where to push influence and we need to be better ,2,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,it almost as if respecting the fans by sticking close to the source material while handling the property with care actually works ,10,The_Donald

elchupanibre5,because part and parcel ,10,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,i am not sure what the revelation is here i frequent t d since june 2016 and everyone anticipated the podesta email leaks then once they were released everyone would dig into them looking for clues this is probably explains the spikes for those keywords at those specific times wikileaks decided to publish a set amount of leaks at intervals spanning the weeks leading up to the election for maximum exposure this is public knowledge ,1,WikiLeaks
elchupanibre5,wade best season was 2009 but people always look at buckets more so than over all impact on the court he was arguably a better defender and a much better facilitator than kobe was kobe was a better shooter scorer than wade ,5,nba
elchupanibre5,wade in his prime was around the same time kobe was exiting his it was an argument who was the best sg in the league around 2009 when wade was in the mvp conversation,3,nba
elchupanibre5,it sad how people forget that wade made it to game 7 of the ecf against the tough pistons in his 2nd season and then won a finals mvp only in his 3rd season in the league wade was the real deal and in his prime was the best sg in the league due to his impact at both ends of the floor its a shame he faced so many injuries throughout his career ,63,nba
elchupanibre5,this is how i see it you may agree or disagree which is fine lebron impact to the eastern conference over the last 6 7 years is exactly what jordan impact was but to the entire nba for most of the 90 imo what holds back lebron from surpassing jordan is the power of the western conference just examine this current warriors team who are unquestionably the top dog of the nba over the last 3 years with consecutive 60 win seasons thanks to their top tier offense and defense that exactly what jordan bulls were in the 90 except they never lost in the finals hell they never went to a game 7 in the finals the bulls were without question the top dogs of the entire league for close to a decade and jordan impact made this possible the closest lebron has been to being the unquestioned top dog in the entire nba was between 2012 2013 with the heat look this is not to diminish lebron as talent wise he is definitively a top 3 4 basketball player of all time it is also not to diminish this current cavs team which is the best iteration they have ever had and although they are championship capable they have not ever technically been the top dogs of the entire league due to the potency of the western conference warriors spurs this is a statement that could never be made with jordan bulls lebron is nearing the end of his prime so unless he slays these warriors and wins 3 more rings i do not think lebron will ever be able to surpass jordan he could surpass him in certain statistics but his impact so far league wide just is not what jordan was ,2,nba
elchupanibre5,so sad when these tragedies happen close to home i drive by that place all the time r i p to the victims my thoughts and prayers go out to all the families involved ,5,orlando
elchupanibre5,we are in the timeline where donald trump is a worldwide beacon of hope and freedom unreal ,18,The_Donald

elchupanibre5,this it is engraved in my soul i can feel the heat down there too can you ,4,nba
elchupanibre5,his defense has been surprising to me he impacting the game at both ends of the floor ,3,nba
elchupanibre5,if the warriors sweep they should erect a statue of that toaster at oracle,411,nba
elchupanibre5,real life has become the best comedy in years ,48,The_Donald

elchupanibre5,ah my fault yes i believe this country functions better when individual states control policy rather than sweeping federal legislation ,7,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,i partially agree but imo we cannot ignore that the poor do in fact need assistance due to several factors outside of just being lazy or gaming the system such as health issues workers comp etc there are real people and families who do need help and we should this is my opinion set aside a small portion of our money to assist them if at all possible as a gesture of good will this is my liberal side speaking the only thing for me is fairness in how the money is distributed vis a vis the law of equivalent exchange if those who are in need of assistance can somehow return the favor by working in the public sector within their communities to improve them in order to acquire government money then i do not see the downside of it as these folks would be essentially paying their fair share by improving ghettos in some fashion i already agree that if a person served in the military or has worked in the private sector for decades essentially paying federal tax they have already paid their fair share and deserve govt assistance if its needed because they paid the price for being a us citizen when it comes to welfare what i do not agree with is illegals or lazy system gamers taking advantage of the system spez after i posted my comment i did not see your full edited comment what you are saying in your full comment makes sense ,4,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,it 100b annually if i am not mistaken ,1,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,not to mention the eu countries who need that money to continue the gravy train of their incredible socialist programs such as paying massive welfare to misplaced refugees there is no doubt in my mind based on the backlash that most of the annual 100b payments will go to aiding socialist programs aside from paying the usual corrupt bureaucrats politicians ,4,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,this is her finest hour,8,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,if this deal was all truly about improving the environment they should have at least attempted to renegotiate you know for the sake of humanity or whatever instead they rather use the media to attack him go figure ,1,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,companies have already invested money into clean energy this was thanks to obama monarch style of governing we need to allow the free market to decide where those investments go from here also if were going to make government responsible for setting policy we need fairness from all nations including third world countries and especially china whose carbon footprint is the largest on earth the usa is putting its foot down telling the world it needs to renegotiate if the usa is to be involved instead of trying to alter the deal they rather use the power and influence of media to attack us ,10,The_Donald

elchupanibre5,they did not take it far enough they need to stop driving cars or traveling on planes which operate on fossil fuels any product made in a fossil fuel plant should be boycotted at all costs that means all the hair products to change hair color and all the chemical plants that created the pills which help transform them to their gender of choice i also hope they make sure to include any food at supermarkets or restaurants which used fossil fueled trucks ships to transport food to their nearby suburban locations they should also make sure to pay the eu 7k yearly to assist in this accord ,2,The_Donald

elchupanibre5,i think you misinterpreted me which is not your fault since my post was so vague to clarify i mean you are waking up to the reality of just how massive the leftist propaganda actually is point is you should always seek truth no matter the politics it is healthy to open your mind to different ideas and allow the best philosophy to win based on facts and evidence rather than feels despite the outside noise it actually what many of us try to do here too hopefully you can stick around ,2,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,you are waking up ,3,The_Donald

elchupanibre5,what are you talking about i am posting this message from 12ft under water ,41,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,they all sound like mini olberman ,6,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,that fair i am not entirely thrilled about trumps personal views on climate change i am also not thrilled on how this topic has become a political weapon for far left globalists to push policy in their favor as human beings we have a responsibility to our home and we should always look to make our future a cleaner and environmentally safe one but at the same time not forsaking the now real families right now are suffering because of job killing regulations when it comes to the facts of climate change science i think we have moved past the doomsday scenario scientists were predicting so we should have a more moderate approach that does not involve unnecessary bureaucracy the way i see it obama was too aggressive in how he used the government to push for clean energy which hurt jobs trump is rolling that federal aggression back one would say who cares about jobs now when our planet is at stake but the problem i have with this statement is that the same scientists who were predicting florida would be under water by now should not be unequivocally trusted because of how wrong their predictions were we need a more measured approach from all leaders that works in favor of the planet rather than politics ,2,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,trump is one president and everything takes time companies have already invested heavily into renewable clean energy so those will continue companies wo not just throw away those investments because of a president why cannot we have both at the same time so things can smoothly transition do have any idea how much oil and coal are of use in today economy we cannot just abandon what is in front of us now we need patience and balance some industries should continue toward the path towards renewable energy while others can transition at their pace without killing jobs ,11,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,i guarantee you that 90 of the people complaining about this are complaining because of the name of the deal rather than the intricacies within it they see the headline trump poised to quite paris climate deal and they instantly think drumpf kills environment when in reality the deal was probably an amalgamation of back loaded job killing regulations taxation and bureaucracy hopefully a fellow autist can breakdown the pros and cons of this deal so we can see clearly why the president feels its in the best interest of america to pull out ,2,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,true let go middle name then pepe covfefe the frog,6,The_Donald

elchupanibre5,what do you mean they care deeply about it because they wo not shut up about election interference all of this russia bs stems from supposed interference in the election ,5,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,so they think putin is a comicbook supervillain not surprising considering how obsessed these people are with nerd shit this still does not answer the question of how they could possibly pursue their goals within a democracy like america just look at how ass backward crazy the dems are now there is zero possibility putin could manipulate america or any other nation into doing his bidding these people give way too much credit to the actual job of the president ,7,The_Donald
elchupanibre5, orclivesmatter,83,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,i hope so too but if we have an sjw as president around that time then we are screwed ,3,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,very rational and fair point my question is how exactly does a conspiracy theory negatively impact an unsolved murder investigation i think it would be important to have all possibilities on the table if we are seeking true justice this whole excuse that it impossible for political assassinations to occur in this country is simply naive and it frustrating when there are many signals pointing to the probability of a politically motivated murder yet zero media attention to push forward an investigation rather the opposite is occurring where media personalities are being punished for even suggesting a full investigation if the media police lawyers are going to straight up conclude that it all a debunked conspiracy it would be nice for actual evidence to be presented ,3,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,i am not going to downvote you but i just want to explain the stakes here the problem is that 90 of the mainstream media is owned by 6 corporations then you have advertisers who essentially help pay for reach on their platforms companies own the media which means they control what we watch listen to via tv radio newspapers etc the internet is all we have left to defend free speech and it has been under massive attack for over a decade unfortunately reddit has a huge market share of internet users so yes this sub does have importance the fact that mods wanted to nuke it is a big deal it a war a battle for information and culture if reddit is a battlefield in this war then this sub is important obviously spez could have nuked this sub long ago but even he understood how catastrophic that would be to his bottom line as a ceo right now this sub and its mutual relationship with reddit as a whole is a microcosm of the internet current relationship with msm it is very shaky and you better believe they are doing all they can to try and silence us at the right moment they want control and will fight for that control which is why we have to fight back ,1,The_Donald
elchupanibre5, it s not what trump does but rather the uncouth bombastic self absorbed manner in which he does it that makes those who will never support him even more unhinged but more damagingly it makes it hard for those who largely support his policies to defend him you know i do not understand this mentality what is wrong with our president being bombastic or self absorbed this is a serious question i am asking because to me those traits actually represent america seriously is it really so terrible that trump acts like an alpha like is it a risk to national security if you ask me as long as he is fulfilling his promises and putting americans first idgaf about his personality or how he carries himself as president maybe it just me because i am a business owner who focuses on results more than anything else if he does his job effectively then i really do not care about anything else why is the position of president viewed in such a cosmopolitan elite way why do people focus on such superficial bullshit rather than actual results it seems counter productive and foolish to me but if you have a counter point i am all ears ,3,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,bye felicia,24,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,the problem with socialism as history has shown us is that it actually does work for a moment but then gradually gets worse and worse over time until it eventually becomes full blown communism the difference here being that california has the backing of possible federal funding which is not good for you or me not to mention you will have other blue states whom will want to copy california incredible healthcare system and of course once the inevitable happens where they lose all their state funding those states will then demand federal funding to help their sick and dying essentially screwing the rest of the country over in the process this shit is a mental disease how can such supposedly educated people have so little understanding of economics history ,7,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,just like everything else nothing has been proven and all of this information is coming from sources how many times will you let the msm fool you there has been at least 3 4 different instances of trump is going down and nothing came from it what is in this specific reporting that makes you suspect the trump administration is going down fast ,2,The_Donald

elchupanibre5,what he said in context is if my evidence is required to be given in the united states which i think means he is willing to give evidence right now from where he resides if there an investigation but if us authorities investigators require him to physically turn in said evidence inside of the us then he is willing to do so as long as he gets safe passage i am not a lawyer so i am not sure what the rules jurisdictions are when it comes to turning in evidence in specific cases ,2,The_Donald

elchupanibre5,well i was not expecting anything out of his statement or whatever but to those saying this is absolutely nothing lets think about it for a sec this statement adds pressure to both kim and the us government law enforcement positions 1 kim is putting himself out there in a way i did not think he would if he is lying then he is taking a huge gamble believe me i too take what he claims with a huge grain of salt but there may be something to this after all kim is telling the world that he personally knew seth rich and his motive of leaking to wikileaks and is willing to allow his conversations be examined within the parameters of an investigation fair enough 2 by openly creating hype and publishing this to the world this now places pressure on the media dnc dc officers and the fbi to at minimum release a statement or at best push the start of a federal investigation if they 100 ignore kim it makes things look even more suspicious 3 this is key he wanted to change that from the inside i was referring to what i knew when i did an interview with bloomberg in new zealand in may 2015 in that interview i hinted that julian assange and wikileaks would release information about hillary clinton in the upcoming election this actually is not a lie and i have always wondered this how exactly did kim know a year in advance what was to come i always thought that maybe he had a close friendship with assange but i could be wrong if he has backups of conversations with transcripts where seth told him he would leak to wikileaks then it would prove that seth was in fact the leaker with definitive proof that could not be refused in court obviously i could be wrong about all of this and my expectations anything comes out of this are low but at least this statement was something rather than an absolute zero of nothing like the 33k email debacle in october i am just hoping for justice to be served in seth murder towards whomever his true killers are ,17,The_Donald

elchupanibre5,yep and trump has not been all too keen on helping assange either for understandable reasons if trump is truly a law and order president it would be hypocritical for him to allow asylum to a man who has openly spread leaked classified documents i am sure in secret trump is thankful to assange but in public he really cannot do anything without it looking suspicious or hypocritical ,1,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,agreed if you read the full context what trump actually said was that journalists who publish highly classified documents should be put in jail if government employees with a security clearance face potential jail time for simply leaking classified information then why cannot civilians face the same punishment especially if those journalists knew the documents they would be publishing were in fact classified cnn is a disgrace to journalism ,6,The_Donald

elchupanibre5,although being empathetic is a virtuous position that i agree is necessary with illegal immigration there are other factors outside of potential job stealing which hurt the economy such as an increase in welfare spending this study http cis org welfare use legal illegal immigrant households shows that a large percentage of welfare recipients are in fact illegal immigrants there are obvious reasons for this as many are not fluent in english or are having trouble integrating into society this is where a virtuous government steps in to assist so that kids do not go hungry for example but in my experience having lived in high minority areas i have witnessed first hand through friends and family of friends the degree of lies and deceit within these communities in regards to gaming the system for free welfare not just for their own immediate needs but the needs of their families overseas when it comes to illegal immigration we need to stop being partisan and recognize that there are pros and cons to both sides and deal with them accordingly and in a fiscally responsible manner i believe that if an illegal immigrant has been paid a pittance via the tax dollars of legal citizens then the least they should do is have the courtesy to try their best to become american citizens so as to pay back what they have essentially borrowed and also become beacons of assistance to others in the future and i do not mean through paying sales tax but contributng to federal taxes social security insurance etc unfortunately many just take the money and run because why the hell not it not like there are consequences ,1,MarchAgainstTrump
elchupanibre5,what i think is that this is not a partisan issue but an honesty issue being respectful and being honest should not be separate matters why cannot we be respectful to moderate muslims whom obey the law and want peaceful co existence while at the same time also acknowledging that islamic terrorism does in fact originate from a basis of extreme muslim beliefs is it really that impossible for two things to be true at once how can we expect to realistically solve problems if our leaders are not allowed to openly be honest about the symptoms of those problems unfortunately in this ultra pc environment world leaders public figures or anyone with a loud enough voice simply are not allowed to express actual grey areas of opinion without having their character attacked from extreme sides of the aisle we all need to take the collective sticks out of our asses and understand once and for all that the truth sometimes hurts we may not like to hear the truth because of how disgusting it may be but the cold hard truth is sometimes necessary to invoke a real and necessary change for too long the media has placed such a high level of importance on narrative that they choose to ignore reason login and the truth in favor of salvaging the power of the narrative this obsession has filtered down to every level of media except the internet at least for now trump is the answer to this battle between truth and narrative his very existence and the way he operates is the antithesis of what the elites and media have established for decades which is why they hate him he represents the truth in the most blunt way possible and that is refreshing ,1,The_Donald

elchupanibre5,you got it another caveat to add is that many t d users who were on mobile could not see the mod message about the protest so they actually thought t d was nuked and there was a huge shit storm on r all rising because of it so of course in furious wrath t d users started to wreak havoc creating new pro trump subs while taking over trump hate subs for a moment which was a lot of fun i think this entire situation was a blessing in disguise because it revealed a few things 1 we cannot trust voat to be there for us if this sub ever actually gets nuked 2 mods admins are probably rethinking banning because of the shitstorm it would cause site wide by 400k furious users 3 we live in these people mind rent free guaranteed i was surprised at how quickly word got out in the hate subs about this sub being private you could feel the coordination once they realized how effective we were on r all rising it was a wild night last night ,3,The_Donald

elchupanibre5, here s one big thing we agree on donald trump is an anathema to our values donald trump is the most dangerous president in american history said perez who served as labor secretary in the obama administration donald trump has to go and that is why we must work together as democrats yep they have not learned their lesson this will be their platform in 2018 and it will fail hard ,1,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,do not you get it us being here is an act of defiance because as much as they want to nuke this sub they know what the consequences of that will be you cannot just walk away from this you fight until the end because its the right thing to do ,3,The_Donald

elchupanibre5,man you guys are like experts at going over post history i was not always a trump supporter you know i used to be a registered democrat who voted for obama twice and a bernie supporter up until the collusion of the dnc like i said we are always learning and i have learned quite a lot about how democrats and leftists in the media operate throughout that time which makes me not want to associate with them until they can figure out the mistakes they are making and apologize from a policy stand point i feel like im experiencing an awakening of understanding thanks to being open enough to listen to the other side of the aisle rather than just paint them all as racist bigots i am not alone in this either as many trump supporters within td are former democrats i am trying to be reasonable with you and have a conversation about this particular subject i honestly do not care about what you think of me personally ,-1,Fuckthealtright

elchupanibre5,although i do not agree with much of what you say i do appreciate all of your points and will take them with me i am just trying to learn and be as complete as possible it unfortunate that we always creep back into our safe spaces rather than discuss topics in an open format i wish we could do this more often because its healthy for people to read our responses and take with it what they want although you probably think i am a piece of shit with zero intellect just remember that in life we all experience different stages and in those stages what matters most is that we always continue to learn rather think we already know it all ,-1,Fuckthealtright
elchupanibre5, but a natural disaster is negative event so negative coverage will naturally occur is what they spew whenever this subject brought up last i checked when a disaster occurs the media does not only focus on the bad moments but also the good ones such as survival rescues donations etc in a very clear and factual way i simply do not see anything positive toward president trump outside of fox news i mean at least try to be unbiased about your political leanings and look at the good trump has done for conservatives in this country nope since anything conservative is bad everything about trump is bad ,1,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,my suggestion was not to sway away from clarke views which are extreme right just to point out that obama has a history of learning being part of extreme left ideologies and i made clear that obama could have moved away from those philosophies but many of his political positions and even decisions as president would point to the contrary the problem i see is showing that one side is extreme while the other is moderate when that is not true i just want balance and clarity through as much information as possible its unfortunate that the media does not do this now here we are the issue arises once again toward what you believe to be factual information and what is not based around corroboration from trusted though heavily leftist news outlets whether you want to believe this account of a young obama is true or not is your choice and i can respect that choice i just hope you can agree that obama was not perfectly moderate himself like these heavily biased news outlets would have you believe many people have touted obama as being one of the most leftist presidents ever and for good reason via his policy and exchanges with foreign leaders kind of show his propensity toward marxist ideologies which are things i am sure he learned in his past finally in regards to clarke comments i also made clear in context that in a situation where people are trying to murder you maybe you need to be a little extreme in your rhetoric once again you can disagree with this due to your political leanings but i think its necessary at times of conflict which in this case is jihad against western civilization ,-2,Fuckthealtright
elchupanibre5,this probably means we red pilled effectively last night ,1,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,i experienced this too whenever i forced them to please provide evidence of collusion they would just restate msm talking points which they also conclude is all unsubstantiated claims without evidence or are classified so we have to wait their idea is of course trump is going down eventually yo just wait so in essence they too are insecure themselves since they know they do not have the actual evidence i foresee 3 things happening 1 the unlikely trump is impeached due to deep state media and alphabet agencies creating fake evidence to connect his camp with russia then using it as a means to try and remove trump from office 2 the likely the conspiracy is of course fake but the democrats will use msm pressure to invalidate trump to as many people as possible hoping it will help them in midterms then in 2020 3 a possibility they try to impeach trump with the fake evidence they have the impeachment fails due to lack of legitimate evidence causing a huge shit storm from the left which they think will sink trump support further this may also make people crazy enough to attempt assassination ,5,The_Donald

elchupanibre5,wow i was not aware of this thanks for the link and info maybe this is why i have seen a decrease in the coverage of blm because it has no real central leadership which created a certain chaos surrounding it even the tea party had some form of central leadership but of course they had other specific motives well like you said if you take it as a hashtag then yeah i agree that black lives matter because of course they do it a shame when wackos hijack terms movements with underlining legitimate ideals for their own personal gain ,0,forwardsfromhitler

elchupanibre5,here is another example http www americanthinker com articles 2011 02 meeting young obama html obviously he could have changed his perceptions and perspectives from that time which people tend to do but its clear that obama did have heavy marxist beliefs during times in his life not to mention the scrubbing hiding of his past connections to guys like bill ayers and mentorships from communists like frank marshall davis once again this is not to say that obama was a communist even though some of his policy aligned with those ideals but it shows that he had heavy influence of marxist ideologies ,-5,Fuckthealtright

elchupanibre5,i already did on a post below ,-18,Fuckthealtright
elchupanibre5,i do not completely agree with his statements on this particular subject but that does not mean he will effectively be able to push those extreme stances within his department obama and other democrats in the past have had very communist leaning ideals yet we did not dissolve into a new soviet union thankfully i think that sometimes potential criminals need to see that our leaders have a zero tolerance policy just to put fear into them in this case clarke is using extreme rhetoric against an extreme force isis and isis sympathizers that want to eradicate the west he implying that when it comes to terrorism or those who sympathize with terrorists he is not playing games and you know what sometimes that is necessary if anything to curtail possible future attacks his stances are a far cry from european leaders just giving into terrorists by saying its just another part of life in a big city obviously the ideal thing and actual reality would be somewhere in the middle but in a time of such partisan hostility here we are ,-5,Fuckthealtright
elchupanibre5, however you just read an article about a guy who wants to crush dissent against the government through violence and expand on the massive prison police state he wants to limit freedom of speech so that criticism of the authoritarian state is an imprisonable offense according to an article from the new yorker quoting mother jones i wonder what the conservative leaning newspapers think of him oh wait i am sorry if forgot reddit does not want altering viewpoints on their website my mistake ,-17,Fuckthealtright
elchupanibre5,this speaks to his inexperience as a political leader but also the same stupidity of a partisan government who refuses to get things done this still should not excuse the pure hatred from the other side when he has in fact tried to work with them on many occasions obama had the same problems so i guess this is how we want to run our country by not running it at all ,2,tucker_carlson
elchupanibre5,where did you get that from my post i am all for womens rights i just think you need to focus your time money and attention of said rights in places that actually need them because currently if you live in a western country you are experiencing the greatest time for women in human history and this is because of leftism which is a great thing the problem is when it goes too far the same way conservatism can go too far all i want is balance ,0,neoliberal
elchupanibre5,1 it hard to get anything done with so much pure hatred and deceit from the other side 2 we do not ignore the news we filter out the partisan bullshit using logic and common sense 3 name the criminal behavior with actual evidence you cannot do it because the evidence is not in your possession all you have is the trust of sources hearsay and conjecture if you choose to believe this then that fine but do not call us pathetic just because we choose to believe the man is innocent until proven guilty with actual factual evidence 4 trump has made many accomplishments such as an improved economy dealing with international conflicts effectively appointing gorsuch reducing illegal immigration even without the wall but just using his stance of law and order etc now you may not agree with these accomplishments due to your brand of politics but that does not mean his administration has been a parade of incompetence 5 we cheer that hillary lost because not only was it one of the greatest underdog stores of all time but because of your reaction to it all it fucking hilarious ,0,tucker_carlson
elchupanibre5, as for clinton i recall the fbi reaching the conclusion that she just had been incompetent but not criminal the conclusion for that particular investigation was bullshit which is why he was rightfully fired just ask anyone who works with a security clearance what they think of that investigations conclusion its oj levels of absurdity and the fact that shes able to get away with it boils my blood if there is actual legitimate evidence of trump collusion with russia then i welcome justice to be served as well i just hope that with comey out of the picture clinton will also face proper justice in one of her multiple fbi probes also thanks for communicating and having dialogue with me ,2,TrumpForPrison
elchupanibre5,regressive leftism is the problem i have no problem classic leftism because it a necessary component for balance the problem is that leftism has reached too far left and has been on a mission to destroy conservative values as a result regressive leftists no longer seek balance rather domination of their ideals this is all endangering the freedoms of western civilization which our forefathers have fought and died for ,-2,neoliberal

elchupanibre5, well i do not like trump so i do not give him the benefit of the doubt but will still wait to see what the classified evidence is once it reaches public light i appreciate this honesty as for clinton she had a history of corruption and was is still under multiple criminal fbi investigations but where are the results of those investigations nothing then not only is she allowed to walk free with no resolution but she also gets a pass from the media why why did the media cover for her during the election while lambasting trump why could not there be equal balance in coverage you see my thing is i welcome a media that scrutinizes our leaders and i welcome politics to work so that no fascist will ever be in power in this country what i do not welcome is unfairness and clear political bias within our system of communications because it is a very power thing all i want is fairness and justice what occurred throughout that email investigation was not justice and many people agree especially those who work with a security clearance no one should be above the law not trump not clinton not anyone and it should be the responsibility of journalists to not allow their political ideologies to get in the way of facts and we also should not have people in government who set precedents of being above the law ,2,TrumpForPrison

elchupanibre5, just wanted to respond to the original commenter but their post got deleted so i will post it under yours if you do not mind you are asking for compromise which is understandable and something i wish could happen in an ideal situation but ever since trump announced his presidential run there has been zero olive branches or compromise towards him from dems media even politicians from his own party the american people voted him in because he was an outsider whose message was a breath of fresh air towards the immediate future of this nation andrew klavan describes trump best as a blunt object whom half the country voted into power due to an ever increasing liberal globalist anti american agenda an agenda cultivated thanks to uncompromising leftists trumps hard stances are what drives his base and support unfortunately any compromise will be looked at as weakness in the eyes of his supporters and ultimately the way things are looking it will be his supporters who will fight hard for him in 2020 despite the media deception the democrats are digging their own grave by continuing to be a pro sjw anti trump platform rather than slowly cultivating a real issues platform to bring moderates towards their side this is exactly why they are so desperate for trump impeachment and will do everything in their power to use russia conspiracies via media influence to make that a reality if they do not get rid of him and fast they will keep losing support until a republican super majority is established ,2,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,that place is cancer now way too many shills,3,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,trump was not the president that the elites wanted so they are trying their best to sabotage him they are using every conceivable weapon possible to end his presidency as quickly as possible and if these weapons do not end up working i do not think they will i would not be surprised if the next step is assassination this entire situation shows that the corrupt politicians do not care about america especially republicans who have all the power they have been clamoring about for 8 years yet are squandering it the deep state and media are the rulers of this nation and we must fight back now ,4,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,imprisoned if they exposed sensitive classified info which yeah they probably should be ,4,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,there go the leftists once again attacking someone for trying to uncover the truth ,125,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,been waiting for this,3,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,one of the best things to come out of the election of president trump is the complete exposing of the news media for their banana republic method of functioning they slander they lie they manipulate and deceive the masses without consequence they are absolute snakes they are the enemies of western civilization and i will never trust or consume their crap ever again for anything other than mockery ,12,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,there is no proof but its pretty clear that anything considered conservative is viewed negatively by the media and is held with a tight leash ,2,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,well if government officials can be sent to jail for revealing classified information then why should not civilians be punished ,5,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,uhhh nothing is going to happen they have been spewing this nonsense for months they cannot impeach without hard evidence and so far there is a lot of noise but still no concrete evidence of course they could technically manufacture evidence or lie if this becomes the case then i will have no choice but to fight ,1,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,i have never seen so much divisiveness its both remarkable and terrifying how people can be brainwashed so easily i do not hate many things but i think i am actually starting to hate the mainstream media ,1,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,agreed sick of the constant lies and deceit ,2,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,7 more years of the media getting exposed as hack frauds its going to be glorious ,1,The_Donald

elchupanibre5,the most hilarious thing about this is that they probably paid to enter this golf club and protest trump some how always manages to win ,7,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,i mean sure there could be some truth but my point was that if there is no truth to this then people in the media need to finally be held responsible accountable for using their influence to slanderously destroy a persons character ,1,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,people need to be held responsible for this slander if the damn leader of the free world cannot shake away this level of lying and manipulation from the media then who can its disgusting and the media deserves to burn to the ground for their lack of integrity ,28,The_Donald

elchupanibre5, i would wager the other political subreddits do this too as a t d poster i hope op could do this same kind of investigation toward t d and reveal the evidence if bots also truly run rampant in that sub this way we can come to a fair and fact based conclusion rather than just brush things off as well the other political subs do this too i just want some damn integrity and if reddit admins wo not do it then its up to the users ,6,RedditCensors

elchupanibre5,this is brilliant,11,nba
elchupanibre5,comey is one man in an entire agency tasked to investigate just because one man was fired does not automatically mean the investigation ends it just means that someone else will lead it to its conclusion if trump places someone at the top who is his stooge and the fbi has real evidence to back this russian conspiracy then do not you think the truth will come out one way or another i mean its the freaking fbi for gods sake i simply do not see what the problem is and have a hard time coming to terms with the hysteria around this firing the guy comey for all intents and purposes helped trump win the election through his politicization of hillary criminal investigation now it seems like he doing the same thing with this russia investigation if this is how he runs investigations then yes he should have been fired look if there is proof of wrong doing between trump and russia then the fbi should just do their jobs collect their evidence and be done with it as quickly as possible rather than make a media dog and pony show every few months that does nothing but give the hysterical liberal media talking points to attack the president without actual concrete evidence to use in a court of law i watched the hearings and when anyone would question the fbi director about this supposed evidence of russian collusion he would just waive it off as its classified sorry then everyone with a microphone continues to jump to biased conclusions what ever happened to innocent until proven guilty in this country if there was something compelling to this investigation it would have been released before the election you know it i know it do not you think the clinton machine would have been researching for massive dirt on all republican opponents back in feb 2016 think about how they got their hands on that access hollywood tape would they not have found something confirming legitimate russian connections back then it comes to a point where any rational human being just sits back during all this and says there is nothing here why are people going insane which is how i feel about reddit in general over the last 6 months ,2,politics

elchupanibre5,what these people do not understand is that we care about the people more than the party we are not blind to dead children on the streets and the fact that its brushed under the rug and even worse defended is disgusting real leadership is assessing the reality of a situation and actually doing something to fix the problem other than brexit and trump i have yet to see any democratic leaders come up with a solution to this problem instead they want people to simply accept dead children on the streets as just another part of life no that should not be accepted or tolerated ever ,13,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,for the people of france and future generations of french to come i hope you are right ,2,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,exactly trump is one of the only politicians who openly calls out islamic terror for what it is and is actively trying to secure the borders of this country but of course virtue signaling liberal judges block him at every turn when was the last time we saw a european politician try to secure their country borders or at least call out islamic terrorism for what it is what is worse is that any public official who tries to even suggest islam as a possible link to the terrorism gets labeled a racist or worse get charged for hate speech it frustrating how backwards everything is ,8,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,i do not disagree about your point that the other candidates were far left there were also aspects to lepen which were pretty far right that i disagree with but she was not completely far right like they labeled her all i am saying is that i will never trust the media establishment candidate of choice after everything that has happened over the last year we have experienced how the media establishment will do everything in their power to make their candidate of choice look amazing while trying to make any conservative candidate the enemy and that is not fair i am not going to call macron a socialist islamophile but he is extremely pro eu and we all know the eu stance on immigration and other leftist policies lepen was right france just elected merkel to lead their nation i hope i am wrong ,13,The_Donald

elchupanibre5,doing things like this shows desperation we already knew his ratings were steadily declining from letterman numbers but trying to be edgy reeks of desperation and adds a black mark to the late show moniker all he will be left with once people have had enough of trump jokes is an audience filled with sjws and shills who are clearly the minority in this country what we are witnessing right now is the slow agonizing death of late night network tv ,5,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,it was not even about wikileaks exposing her criminal behavior she was already under multiple criminal fbi investigations hell she is still under multiple criminal fbi investigations yet once again nothing happens because she is too influential and powerful it was obvious to most voters that she was above the law she is the embodiment of the political corruption americans are fed up with she will never admit this though i mean who would does not stop it from being the truth ,20,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,although this is awesome the very fact that she used a tape from a private conversation to try and destroy her opposition reveals the type of person she is it revealed to the nation just how low she is willing to stoop to win i also have no qualms saying trump himself stooped low at times to win but the difference is that hillary got a pass from the media about her dirty laundry while trump was constantly attacked for it it the hypocrisy that fuels my desire to forever root against clinton or any other establishment candidate if the dnc want to recover they need to separate themselves from this hypocritical crap but we all know they wo not ,5,The_Donald

elchupanibre5, that being said again this is not a kids show imo you cannot simply brush this off as this is not a kids show when ultimately kids have a tendency to let curiosity get the best of them the main issue is this slow descent into madness where there is zero accountability in recognizing when it is appropriate for children to learn about certain subjects such as sexuality as a social construct when their minds have not been fully formed i mean fuck it seems like these sensitive subjects continue to be pushed onto the mainstream to younger and younger audiences without any thought of responsibility towards verifying facts versus opinion then just tossing it out there as facts because ehh progressivism is good this is cult like behavior that is actually being encouraged to be accepted do you know what is another terrible way for kids to learn about sex pornography there is no doubt that pornography has had a huge influence on millennials i also do not want my children to learn about sex in that way but even with pornography for all intents and purposes it is not mainstream which means there are enough parental tools government regulations which allow parents to have some kind of control towards the viewing of pornography it much more difficult for parents to censor these kinds of tumblr esque shows because they are purposely directed at a wider audience and are disguised as educational programming that is acceptable at least in regressive leftists minds for young people to watch this goes beyond pro lgbt stances this is about children and this seeming obsession by leftists groups to influence the brain development of children using propaganda ,1,The_Donald

elchupanibre5,i agree with you on the visuals and world building being its main mark on cinema but what is interesting to me is that in 40 years that mark has yet to be duplicated much less surpassed the closest thing to star wars as an experience is probably the lotr trilogy and even that was based on a book where star wars was an original story avatar is also up there visually but the story fell flat the matrix came close to being a cultural phenomenon but it has not aged as well as star wars does not help that sequels were mediocre we all know that the original star wars was simply lightning in a bottle its success was almost pure luck tesb was the real gem in that it added lore and depth to the story characters then rotj tied it all up in a decent enough bow imo star wars should have stayed a trilogy because its three act structure was done so well and gave us just enough to appreciate it as a product of its time much like indiana jones or back to the future unfortunately star wars was such a merchandising powerhouse due to its imagery that lucas was essentially forced to open pandora box with the prequel trilogy in an attempt to recreate star wars for a new generation by adding lore to a story so unpredictably well executed that he himself with all the money technology imaginable could not match it when an original creator essentially gives up on his creation you know that creation has transformed into an uncontrollable monster now disney comes into star wars with corporate precision and financial expectations trying to control this monster disney understands that nostalgia is a money printing machine so what do they do add fan service to the films in order to turn a profit rather than placing an emphasis on artistically taking chances in adding lore to the universe rogue one although i hated it at least tried to attempt something different but it also annoyingly relied on nostalgia maybe this was disney plan to start off to get as far away from the prequels as possible and back to ot but this nostalgia fest we see in hollywood over the last decade has over stayed its welcome imo and its affecting star wars as a brand i am really hoping that episode 8 can add depth to the story and characters of tfa in its own artistically unique way i see all films as its own piece of artwork there is simply no way to replicate an original piece much less an original masterpiece like star wars without missing the mark tfa is a good example of this abrams tried his best to replicate star wars and while he did a commendable enough job it was still a risky mistake by disney and co to replicate an original piece rather than explore it into new and risky directions they tried too hard to replicate star wars that they missed the mark imo what tfa did best was establish new likable characters that can be built upon now i hope what disney does now is take risks liberties adding their own artistic value so that the franchise can be taken a fresh unexpected direction we will see if they can succeed ,1,movies
elchupanibre5,the answer is two fold and depends on what you believe 1 the united states is partnered with nato and like many other nations currently have both allies and enemies in order to appease allies and send a message to enemies the president felt it was in america and the world best interest to exclaim with force that the use of chemical weapons are a big no no trump acted decisively to which he is getting praise this was also a bold political strategy as it kills 5 birds with one or 59 stones without too much damage that we know of 2 the chemical attack was a false flag operationn designed to create sympathy and eventually fall back on his original policies for the good of humanity or what not the deep state military industrial complex want war because and are also pushing false intelligence to the president in hopes of escalating the conflicts with syria russia trump is being manipulated behind the scenes to push further conflict because war big money for many special interests this is the primary reason why you are now seeing enemies of trump suddenly praising him like i said you can choose to believe whichever one you think is true or not i currently think its both happening at once but i could be wrong as time moves forward and depending on how the us russia syria respond in the coming weeks months should tell us what is really going on i am rooting for relative peace between our nations so we can defeat isis but it seems like the deep state does not want this they regime change style want war like what we did in iraq which i am vehemently against they want regime change and do not forget the pipeline situation where both russia and us have a vested interest at the end of the day i just hope we do not enter ww3 ,1,The_Donald

elchupanibre5,i will never understand the amount of hatred harris has for trump a lot of people share his sentiments too which is unfortunate i do not know it seems unhealthy to me to be this dismissive and hateful towards someone based on so little factual evidence ,3,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,this is encouraging to read still now that a chemical attack and subsequent pressure from generals deep state was able to successfully sway the president into firing missiles we have to hope that trump wo not be influenced this easily towards war or regime change when the next disaster happens america first was how he was elected and it should stay this way above all else ,1,The_Donald

elchupanibre5,i respect your choice but all i ask is that you think about removing all of your support because of one single possibly negative action where he has done a lot of good actions as well things usually are not so black and white and trump was bound to make mistakes maybe this is one of them but maybe not just does not make sense to me to pull support because of one action regardless i respect your choice ,1,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,lol this one got me,2,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,i agree with you but every situation is different we cannot equate open borders to a chemical attack one is about protecting a countries borders by following the rule of law and the other is not tolerating the extinguishing of human life which is precious no matter what country those lives reside i agree that other nations should intervene where tf is the un in all of this but historically america is the country who answers the call for liberty and freedom in these kinds of terrible situations it a shitty situation but we have to stand behind the choices made by our leaders and hope for the best the only thing we as civilians know is that no one should ever stand by while children are gassed to death and america has shown once again that this kind of shit wo not be tolerated ,1,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,the problem is that we also have allies to which we collectively agreed upon specific rules one of those rules was not using chemical weapons in any form when this happens whether it was assad or false flag wtf is america supposed to do look i wish we could be an isolationist country but in this day and age we simply do not have that luxury there is a reason why america intervenes in these kinds of situations that have more to do with keeping alliances than creating enemies do not get me wrong i am not turning off the idea that trump could have been led astray by deep state war mongers either but i am just keeping a clear head and waiting for more details before i say this was a good or bad strategic move ,1,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,if the military industrial complex wants war we get war we all hope trump could be the gap which could stop it from occurring due to his lack of political experience but when you are in the war room and intelligence officials are providing you with intel what can you do even as president you have to trust in your generals to provide you with the correct intel and you need to make choices based on that intel but what if that intel is compromised by war mongers it a sad state of affairs but all we can do in this time is hope and pray that our leaders will be virtuous and wise enough to do all they can to prevent any escalation of war ,1,The_Donald

elchupanibre5,to be intellectually honest it depends on the situation if the intelligence is nefarious in its purposes that go against the law and constitution then it would take a brave patriot who believes in the non negotiable ideals of justice to expose it the law would still rightfully need to be taken into account though the crux of this issue always goes back to whether the intelligence goes against the founding principles of the constitution ultimately every situation is different and all members of government agencies should always place the highest degree of importance in shielding protecting the nation but a quandary is set in place when a nefarious domestic threat reveals itself this entire debacle of unmasking leaking names and political wiretapping has exposed a crisis within our government as to who are allies or foes towards american justice and the constitution another problem is that democrats on the left actually use these arguments to accept the leaks of unmasked names were necessary because trump was being nefarious with russia despite zero tangible evidence it the same argument that we believed the wikileaks were necessary in order to expose the faults of hillary but the difference was that those leaks exposed truths where as the unmasking name links do not corroborate with factual evidence that we can see with our own eyes rather its shielded under an ongoing investigation which could take months or even years to solve or may not even be anything at all the thing i have a problem with is the leaking of unmasked names because it was illegal and has only resulted in unfounded hysteria the democrats who believe this story must accept their full placement of trust in an intelligence community who have lied to them in the past or provided faulty intelligence in the past and who have factions that have openly admitted to want to destroy a sitting president who does not play by their rules using highly sophisticated masking tools as well as media influence disinformation to push their narrative it all incredibly frustrating yet fascinating and i am rooting for justice and if president trump is legitimately innocent i believe he is then i am rooting for him to navigate his way out of this mess while taking down those responsible for creating it ,3,The_Donald

elchupanibre5,from my understanding correct me if i am wrong the letter does not say explicitly that flynn wants to testify in exchange for immunity in regards to potential trump connections with russia like the media has been exclaiming in their headlines just that he is willing to share his side of the story and was advised by his lawyers to protect himself what story might that be who knows remember there are multiple investigations going on right now the fake news side of it is that the media is saying flynn has already asked to testify specifically in regards to russia to both the hic and fbi yet both sources either declined to comment or said it was not true now more people close to flynn are saying this is not true either ,6,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,also we love truth justice and the american way ,6,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,wtf so now it is not true these knee jerking msm fools need to go take a long walk on a short pier getting real sick of their crap ,1,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,agreed russia is not necessarily a friend of ours but i also caution we tread lightly to avoid war with a nuclear power the hysteria behind this potential russian hack is not helping with america russia relations i am just hoping all of this gets cleared up soon via legitimate justice so the country can move forward without having to go to war ,2,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,they would not give him immunity if that was the case either way the ball is in the hic and fbi court to accept the deal and if they do not things will look even more suspicious ,3,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,i just want to thank you for taking the time to extend an olive branch of some kind for too long most liberals who post in here just laugh at us or call us evil racists i am glad that you care about country more than politics but so do most of us which is why we voted for trump in the first place while i appreciate your concern about flynn here is a letter from his lawyer https twitter com chuckrossdc status 847590500056137728 take with it what you will but to me it seems like he is asking for immunity for legitimate reasons that do not include flipping on trump rather allowing himself to set the record straight from his side also since we love america and what it stands for we will always hold trump and his people to account if they committed crimes i would just hope that your side would do the same peace be with you fellow american ,2,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,pretty cut and dry with the absolute war going on between president trump the ic and the dnc media dogs you better believe flynn needs to cover his ass in anyway possible as to avoid any potential prosecution for any little thing to me his willingness to testify is encouraging because it shows that flynn wants to set the record straight by sharing his side of the story if you ask me he deserves it after all the attacks on his character he received over the last couple of months as a side note i find it odd how guys like stone and manafort are open to give their side of the russian conspiracy story yet the fbi has not agreed to formally interview them as of yet kind of makes me question the validity of this russian story ,5,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,if they refuse to take his testimony would not the fbi look even more suspicious it might drive a substantial wedge in the russia investigation maybe this is flynn motive to push for immunity but really who knows ,1,The_Donald
elchupanibre5, he has made the offer to the fbi and the house and senate intelligence committees though his lawyer but has so far found no takers the officials said why not the guy is willing to testify for better or worse either the fbi believe he or trump is guilty of something or they do not have anything and are just buying time all of this still looks like political games ,4,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,they did the same thing with wikileaks the media is no longer a friend of justice or truth all they care about is being a megaphone for the liberal establishment dnc and its cronies ,3,The_Donald

elchupanibre5,you know what is even funnier the fact that major news media outlets did their best to undermine trump by working with hillary and the dnc to destroy him yet they all lost instead of admitting they colluded for their candidate of choice they instead double down and project their own shady strategies onto this russian conspiracy these people are lunatics and i hope their entire establishment collapses in the worst way ,1,The_Donald

elchupanibre5,he confirms that it was the fbi and nsa who refused to show up to the meeting which was supposed to be in a closed door classified setting to set the record straight about the unmasking of names directly to congress although nsa has been mostly cooperating the fbi not so much the fbi is looking more swampy every day ultimately this thing might not go anywhere until the fbi starts cooperating in the investigation there is zero timeline that this gets resolved anytime soon and i hope justice is served if you ask me this is all seems like political theater but i hope i am wrong and nunes and other republicans like gowdy legit fight to get to the bottom of this ,5,The_Donald

elchupanibre5,because there are a small minority of people in this country too poor or sick to afford things then leftists use their virtue signal bullying tactics to publicly punish the majority of people who can afford things effectively silencing them and deterring a system that actually works for the majority what is worse is that they believe what they are doing is virtuous and that anyone against this stance is a terrible human being the reality is that the majority of people are in fact responsible for their lives and those who are legitimately unlucky do not need the government to take care of them there are plenty of non profit organizations available to assist still not enough for the left who essentially want a fantasy utopian nanny state with open borders rather than a more realistic country of productive citizens and security ,4,The_Donald

elchupanibre5, even if it is not true why not investigate it further in order to set a precedent of keeping our government accountable no matter who is running it i am not against an investigation i just want fairness and clarity which no one is committing to what i am vehemently against is the liberal media defining trump as guilty before any evidence is presented much less a conclusion also in the quote you provided it still does not confirm a criminal investigation is taking place instead they call it a counterintelligence mission which is a vague term that could mean anything from establishing possible connections to just getting facts straight if they would have said criminal investigation then i would understand the justification of the media pushing the undermining of the presidency or democrats wanting an impeachment instead the fbi is investigating for possible coordination between individuals of trumps campaign who could realistically be anyone at any time for any reason manafort had business ties to russia trumps businesses also more than likely had business ties since ms america pageants took place in russia but these connections could be anything but nope to dems its a slam dunk smoking gun that putin colluded with trump to crew over hillary can you see how this can be viewed as a conspiracy theory now do not get me wrong i am not too fond of the denials lies from trumps camp either but to label someone guilty without the completion of an investigation and without due process is unfair the term is innocent until proven guilty for a reason and i wish the leftist media would follow this ,1,The_Donald

elchupanibre5,15 years ago a mexican man decided to enter the us to seek a better life for himself he understood that entering illegally would be the only option to escape poverty in mexico but there was risk he could get caught and deported back he makes a calculated decision to enter illegally and succeeds pretty easily too he enters america to exuberant open arms as people from within the community help him find places to live access to welfare and other mexican immigrants who own businesses provide him with work under the table the man finds an apartment the state is helping him pay for food and board and he wins a steady job for 15 years he refuses to become a legal citizen i mean why would he right he entered the country illegally had all of these people help him get in all cozy and assimilated he establishes himself in niche area of town where people who look just like him and are in his same situation are flourishing so why would he decide to become a legal citizen who pays taxes why should he give back to america why not just keep the gravy train moving along for 15 years things are great throughout this time he finds a wife and decides to start a family for 15 years america does it job in providing this man with a better life than he could have dreamed of in mexico then one day things change a new leader comes to power who wants to enforce the laws of the land then one day the man gets caught without his papers and is suddenly deported back to mexico suddenly his entire life of 15 years collapses as he is separated from his family and friends all due to a miscalculation that should have been handled from the start if he was expecting america to provide a better life for him and his family he was right america did do its job for 15 years but it was his responsibility to hold up his end of the bargain if he wanted it to continue he should have done the principled thing and decide from the beginning that he was going to give back to america by becoming a citizen legally but he simply did not the fact is that there are consequences to your decisions and sometimes you do not reap the consequences for years after life is not fair and if you make poor decisions you will reap poor rewards this man had every opportunity for 15 years to make the right choice and he did not yet instead of owning up to it he and his family blame president trump sad ,3,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,ah my mistake i must have misread the article clearly states surname i agree it very odd for a parent to not want to share their last name with their child i am also a little surprised its in the law for parents and kids to share their same last name just for record keeping purposes but i guess i can understand its probably easier for the state to have that barrier to avoid confusion ,2,The_Donald

elchupanibre5, fbi director has acknowledged that there is evidence for it the fbi director also did not say the russian hacking investigation was a criminal one rather a counter intelligence investigation unlike hillary who is still under multiple criminal fbi investigations one of which she was let off the hook by the same fbi director do not tell that to the leftists media no sir despite close to zero evidence of criminality they continue to push this russian narrative to try and undermine the validity of trump presidency ,2,The_Donald

elchupanibre5,there is no truth anymore just one sided arguments and brainwashing the truth is somewhere in the middle all i know is that now the ball is in the fbi and nsa court to provide evidence to nunes or they will look shady af mind you this is the same fbi and nsa who are actively investigating a russian conspiracy and whom refuse to provide details all talk and punditry outside of this is simply speculation from biased sources the left will push their talking points and so will the right i am just hoping for justice to be served ,3,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,i agree there is nothingness when it comes to the russian narrative ,4,The_Donald

elchupanibre5, if you want to continue this analogy it would be like your mechanic says your car has a major issue but i cannot work on it until the warranty is over in a few years but do not worry i am a mechanic in 3 years when you can have me work on it i will fix it no i see it more like if we fix your car right now without a proper plan the engine may explode and you will blame us for it rather than the original manufacturer of the car so we have to wait until we have a plan in place that 100 guaranteed wo not cause the engine to explode maybe this plan does not exist in this case the best option may be to just get a brand new car once the car engine explodes trump is trusting the people around him whom he trusts to figure out a plan that works and is popular among his constituents once a carefully thought out plan is in place that works among republicans in congress then it will easily pass in the senate where he can sign it into law the reality is that democrats will hate anything trump does so his responsibility is to his party and the centrists if no plan is presented that is popular enough then obamacare stays until the car engine explodes so that everyone is forced to set up a better plan he and his people have the rest of this year to really sit down and figure out a plan that works best we just need to give them time remember trump is not neocon so any replacement bill that was drummed up over the last 7 years kept certain provisions which allowed insurance companies to continue screwing us ,2,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,i hated bvs and ss but if this movie is simply the jl bantering together with this level of visually stunning action along with a decent enough story behind it i think i will enjoy it maybe there is no doubt that the expectations of this film has lowered which i think is a good thing for the future of this franchise no it simply will never live up to tdk series but if they go with a fast 7 vibe with superheroes then it could potentially work well imo snyder is such an amazing visual director and i am rooting for him to rebound with this film hell i am rooting for dc to find its niche just so people can stop comparing both studios and instead just enjoy these movies for what they are ,2,movies

elchupanibre5,i am going to step in with my two cents on this issue because it can get a little interesting something which often gets overlooked when it comes to same sex marriage is the children i personally am not against same sex marriage but i do have my concerns with gay couples who decide to raise children this goes beyond gay bashing it a legitimate yet overlooked argument the dichotomy of the nuclear family has high levels of importance in the development of a child which in turn affects communities since same sex couples do not have the capacity to biologically reproduce it sort of makes children like a commodity for their lifestyle i believe that the choices of two consenting adults whatever gender simply wanting to raise a child should come second to the optimal development of children in our society now you can kind of make a similar argument about adoption children as a commodity but even if a married gay couple steps in to give an adopted child a home it still does not reciprocate the biological necessities required for full development of that child making same sex marriage a law goes beyond simply allowing two great people whatever gender to be a formalized couple what happens when they decide they want to raise a family well then by legally allowing same sex marriage you are also using the power of the state to possibly risk optimal human development look this is not to say there are not terrific gay parents out there but scientific data has shown that the optimal environment for a child to be raised is in a household with both a father and mother since it provides the child the widest possible scope of experiences necessary for optimal brain development since same sex families are still a relatively new concept in our modern society we simply do not know the pros and cons of the children raised in those environments but i would be interested to see a study on this in the near future maybe science is wrong and children raised in gay families actually experience better development we just do not know but it a risk and science is on the side of the nuclear family ,1,The_Donald

elchupanibre5, they spend less money on overhead than any insurer and pay prices much lower than any of them as well do you have a source just want to learn,2,EverythingScience
elchupanibre5, in addition i think it clearest to me this is a conspiracy a false conspiracy when none of the verifiable and documented things against the clinton campaign and other sitting senators congressmen are completely overlooked when you have a media so ridiculously one sided in its partisanship with near limitless financial contributions and with a clear enemy in sight an enemy who was freely elected by the american people by constantly attacking him in this way shows that their goal is to effectively undercut democracy if a political party or group of intelligence officials can effectively subvert the will of more than half of america what democracy is there really thanks to wikileaks we know the tools available from the cia to be able to forge digital finger prints what is to stop the cia from placing trump in the middle of a russian conspiracy what is to stop them from going to war with other nations using these tools ultimately this entire situation just shows me that even if we the people freely elect and outsider to maybe step in and fix things our way of life is still at the mercy of a few oligarchs trump slogan was drain the swamp and i pray to god that it somehow works but it looks like a steep uphill battle right now ,1,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,more than likely what is happening trump and his people recommended hiring manafort to assist with his campaign they then found out about his ties to russia and fired him obama white house also learned of this was concerned enough to begin wiretapping russian officials caught flynn who was also part of trump campaign speaking with one of them so it raised alarm bells flynn lied about the conversation so trump let him go as this is all going on people inside the ic who hate trump are pushing unverified claims opinions to the media the media who also hates trump and work for the dnc publish all of this in an attempt to connect russia directly with trump destroying the presidents credibility basically trump is caught in the middle of a conspiracy against him from multiple angles and needs to find a series of maneuvers to come out of this relatively unscathed ,2,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,yep so i cannot use it on this list i am trying to make it of only things that had nothing to do with russia guccifer or wikileaks just to drive home rush point ,3,The_Donald

elchupanibre5,added to the list thanks,4,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,good stuff i will use it,1,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,i would have included this on the list but wikileaks exposed this revelation so i tried to only use reasons that did not include anything tied to or supposedly tied to russia just to drive the point home a little more ,12,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,reasons why hillary lost that had nothing to do with russia gufficer or even wikileaks her campaign was funded by elites pay to play trumps was not the documented corruption of the clinton foundation look at haiti calling a portion of trumps base deplorables getting paid millions of dollars for speeches obvious pay to play project veritas exposing dnc tricks bernie sanders sudden rise fractured the party paid online shilling through correct the record her questionable health video evidence obamacare premiums skyrocketing her campaign ignoring the rust belt the failure of benghazi her illegal private email server then lying to congress about it deleting 33k emails bleachbit literally hammering evidence the leftist media obviously colluding with her the dnc already losing house seats dating back to 2010 she was under 5 separate fbi investigations she was for open borders despite a rise of islamic terrorism she was pro tpp and globalism loretta lynch bill clinton tarmac meeting shady af comey reopening the server investigation due to weiners laptop using unlikable celebrities to pander for votes pandering to latinos for votes saw this with my own eyes making trump look like the enemy of democracy for votes she has a history of being a pathological liar just to garner votes blaming trump for birtherism when she essentially started the whole fiasco the economy was terrible under obama yet she embraced his policies to some she was the living embodiment of political corruption not trustworthy her message was dull and did not resonate with voters this was all off the top of my head there is probably a lot more and yet still had nothing to do with russia guccifer wikileaks or any other hacks leaks whatever despite this all the leaks did was expose even more corruption than we could have imagined better yet none of the leaks were doctored and have only been further proven to be factual evidence while the media was too busy pushing trump as the enemy the reality is that they worked and still do for the enemy spez would some words added some items to the list feel free to recommend more,66,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,here my view on the subject of course i could be wrong the democrats are so desperate but also so very incompetent they know this too and because of this they will simply continue to lose support the only way they could regain support is by impeaching trump and make no mistake this is their 1 goal by virtue of them constantly referencing russia as influencing the election for the purposes of destroying clinton they are effectively telling undecided voters that they are dumb and easily manipulated in an election its not the dems or gop voters who decide a winner it usually the undecideds how do you think these undecided voters feel when the democrats are essentially equating them to brainwashed russian puppets do you think those same people will vote democrat next time hell no the only way the democrats will regain support from the undecideds is if trump is legitimately impeached which would prove to undecideds that they were wrong for voting trump so the democrats last desperate plan is to create a polarizing environment for trump to screw up hope he screws up and then push like hell for an impeachment this is why you see them make a big deal about everything he says or does unfortunately this also confirms that democrats will never ever work with trump nope they want to destroy him and will use any and all tools at their disposal to push it it sucks because we need unity in order for our democracy to function all i know is that if president trump survives this while fulfilling most of his promises he will go down as one of the most underrated presidents in american history ,3,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,then once those citizens democratically elect a president who wants to actually re establish law and order for simple fairness they get called nazis white supremacists russian bots etc gotta love it ,3,The_Donald

elchupanibre5,i feel like we need to make a list of all the reasons why clinton lost that have nothing to do with russia so we can redpill more efficiently ,13,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,never thought of it that way but it does make sense unfortunately libs will just point and say herp derp righties are just dummies and move along their merry brainwashed way ,20,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,there was very little i can remember specifically from guccifer strong punches to hillary campaign was from wikileaks podesta emails huge arms deal to saudi arabia and qatar undermining bernie in the primary obama cabinet being assembled by citibank the other huge blows to her were from her shady history clinton foundation islamic terrorism abroad related to open border immigration obamacare premiums brexit project veritas alternative media her lack of campaigning the rust belt the fbi investigation into her hacked personal server etc these subjects had way more of an impact to her loss than anything rt or guccifer released even if russia was involved in some way i highly doubt it it would not really have mattered all the democrats are doing by pushing this russia narrative is calling out people who voted for trump as idiots who cannot think for themselves which is hilariously ironic it total madness which will ultimately be their undoing in 2018 and beyond ,22,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,its like clockwork,1,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,it all politics in the end the left will keep using this as fuel and the right will keep denying it they are both right until actual facts are presented problem for trump is that the dems have a larger reach through their monopoly on communication so they will keep pushing their narrative to try and undermine the president ,6,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,you caught me checking in from saint petersburg not tampa ,8,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,they can try to coup all they want but in order for an actual impeachment to take place there needs to be 100 evidence of trump being a putin puppet and to this point nothing has been substantiated because all they use is the it classified excuse and continue whispering in dark corners if there was anything substantial they would have already used it to destroy trump hell comey even said the investigation has no time table which essentially means this thing could last 8 years this hearing was simply political theater designed to double down on the muh russia narrative which delegitimizes trump presidency for partisan weaponry the dnc are idiots if they think this will work in their favor all they are doing is digging a bigger hole and pushing more of their supporters away ,1,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,it seems to me globalists want nwo and putin is against this so pro globalist nations are pushing russia as being the enemy of the world these nwo countries have essentially ganged up and use the media to make putin the dangerous dictator i am not saying putin is innocent either but our government is not exactly innocent i just want peace but every day that passes makes me think war is just an inevitability ,2,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,perfect summary of the hearing outside of gowdy this was a shit show ,14,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,lol pretty much but it does not help matters when comey says its an ongoing investigation with no timetable because it only fuels the democrats and liberal media to keep pushing the story as factual looks like trump might have to deal with this throughout his presidency and it will be a weapon against him in 2020 wo not damage him anyway i hope i am wrong though ,4,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,they just made things worse and created more division under the guise of it classified now republicans will further believe trump is innocent while democrats scream putin puppet instead of answering questions this created even more speculation and clips for news organizations to use the same problem exists where 90 of the media are liberal so they will keep pushing that narrative still no answers to clinton or obama dirty deeds even with trump our government is a corrupt shit show that does not get anything done we need to vote in more representatives like gowdy ,4,The_Donald

elchupanibre5,the biggest problem with the narrative that russians helped trump win the election is that it places emphasis on putin putting all his eggs on donald trump becoming president dating back to the early 2000 when most people did not believe trump could be president in 2016 even if people close to trump had ties to russians in the past it should not be the sole focus as to why or how clinton lost she was a terrible candidate on her own accord even without supposed russian interference ,12,The_Donald

elchupanibre5,i have switched stances pro choice to pro life mostly because i finally took the time to listen to both arguments without a filter in various debates ultimately i tend to lean with ben shapiro simple approach that it just wrong to kill babies but if there is a life threatening extreme situation where the mom could die while giving birth for example then yes abortion should be a viable option just like i feel that assisted suicide should be available as a last resort the fact is that a baby in the womb is a human being who deserves to have rights too but it unclear to know at what point in the development process those rights should be enforced by law ultimately i think the argument of abortion boils down to each persons morals and principles which should not be government controlled either way this means government should not force laws to absolutely not kill babies but also should not force me to pay for baby killing with my tax dollars if i think its morally wrong planned parenthood should be a privately funded non profit organization rather than government funded ,2,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,they exist in a left bubble the same way we exist in a right bubble the difference is that the left bubble has such an effective monopoly on communication that those of us in the right bubble are constantly bombarded with their view points so in essence thanks to this sub we are disseminating all of the information in a sort of balanced way since we are able to look at both sides equally formulating conclusions based on all of the facts it helps make our arguments stronger as opposed to the left who rather accept half truths through censoring opposing opinion or sheltering themselves away from the other side ,5,The_Donald

elchupanibre5,i always knew that politics was a divisive subject but to the degree it has been during this past election cycle is shocking to me i too have had people shun me out of their lives for simply expressing my point of view thankfully no one close to me i have been ridiculed and judged negatively just because i offered a differing viewpoint but you know what i still refuse to stay silent because i have come to the point in my life where i simply do not gaf what people think of me i am confident enough in my own common sense and ability to research to understand what is happening in our country world and i refuse to stay silent any longer if the media is not going to do its job and tell the entire truth then i will have to take it upon myself to share an altering viewpoint to as many as i can anything less would be irresponsible not just for myself not just for my children but to those brave men before me who died protecting the liberties and values of america i am not a republican democrat libertarian or any other political denomination i am an american who loves america western civilization and it pisses me off to see how modern regressive liberals disrespect america and it values principles in favor of regressive bullshit this goes beyond president trump we are in a culture war and we are on the side of defending the principles of western civilization we simply cannot allow ourselves to stay silent for fear of backlash we must be brave enough to stand our ground no matter the opposition the fact that the corporate owned liberal media can get away with swaying public opinion with lies while cultivating surrogates like your idiot friends who are willing to cut ties with good people just for expressing an altering viewpoint makes my blood boil when i see a lack of justice run rampant like the way 90 of media has treated trump it really grinds my gears as a fan of justice quite frankly i have had enough with the msms bullshit and am willing to do whatever i can to push the truth if we all could do this together without fear within our immediate circles then we could force a real change in our culture but it up to us to just not gaf and keep sharing the truth end rant,3,The_Donald

elchupanibre5,fair points but you have to also look at the proposed policies from both candidates and whether they practice those policies although flat tax rates may not be the best option for lower income wage earners at face value it is still a better option compared to the socialistic views bernie harped on throughout his campaign the amount of taxes necessary to fulfill his policies would have actually endangered jobs due to overtly taxing businesses and business owners like trump who employ thousands of people if the tax code were simplified businesses would be more willing to invest which in turn creates more jobs which in turn helps the poor there is a stench of hypocrisy when a candidate hypes up his own policies yet does not practice them and in bernie case for him to promise free college and free healthcare and only pay 13 in taxes when all of us would have to pay more taxes for these policies to take effect is a bad look he could have paid more in taxes if he wanted to you know all we are arguing is that if bernie truly believes in his policies then he should put his money where his mouth is ,1,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,i agree put your money where your mouth is ,2,The_Donald
elchupanibre5, but you would have to be a moron to think he would pay less than bernie sanders the thing is this is exactly what clinton bernie and the dnc were harping on about trump ,2,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,you are technically correct but this article offers a more detailed approach to how the nsa or cia can in fact bug a device specifically an iphone even if its powered down https www wired com 2014 06 nsa bug iphone basically the device would play dead by emulating a shut down but maintaining a super low power mode which allows connection to its baseband chip although phones are very specific devices which require battery power to run it still not out of the realm of possibility that manufacturers of tv could allow an exploit of this sort on their devices too at the request of cia or as a regulation during manufacturing either way to get back to oliver argument he is talking about simply unplugging the device as a means to escape cia detection when articles like the one i linked above prove that may not be 100 effective not to mention the inconvenience of having to unplug a device after every use just so we can have privacy seems ridiculous and unnecessary our privacy should matter more ,1,The_Donald

elchupanibre5, it basically nothing it shows he paid his legal obligation that year really disappointed in maddow tonight they should not have hyped this at all actually it something a yuuuuge something tonight pretty much btfo two key liberal arguments 1 that trump is not really a billionaire and 2 that he dodges his taxes this may not exonerate trump completely but it does give him a boost for this boost to come at the hands of msnbc is a travesty for the dnc ,42,The_Donald

elchupanibre5, f,2,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,good lord this timeline rocks ,8,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,the thing is if i recall he never said that he avoids paying 100 of taxes just that he attempts to pay the least amount possible which imo is reasonable taxes are a very complicated thing that can fluctuate yearly especially with an income level over 150 million maybe he paid a little more in 2005 but still the crux of the argument from liberals was that trump was just another rich white man who dodges paying his taxes this specific tax return proves that argument to be false now this does lend credence to the possibility that trump or someone from his team purposely leaked this information to make him look good but that kind of rumor is simply a conspiracy theorist level assumption i feel like we give these people way too much credit sometimes i believe incompetence was a factor here specifically from maddow and msnbc for rushing to publish these documents rather weighing the pros cons of releasing them they thought they had a huge scoop and it back fired much like many of the stories about trump over the last year ,1,politics
elchupanibre5,well maddow read it out loud on her show so it must be legit ,4,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,it is incompetence pure and simple i think we give these media organizations too much credit sometimes ,75,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,lol even shapiro is in on this ,6,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,this feels like election night all over again so much btfo from all angles its glorious ,2,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,i guess not but every year is different so who knows still 38 million dollars in a single year is a lot of money more so than entire corporations pay in taxes ,1,politics
elchupanibre5,well it reveals that he actually paid 38 million in taxes out of 150 million income which is actually a fair ratio ,6,politics
elchupanibre5,i just do not understand the strategy here by maddow this will only help trump all i have heard is that he dodges taxes yet he paid 38 million in taxes in a single year ,27,politics
elchupanibre5,this statement and the subsequent maddow debacle culminates the very definition of btfo,25,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,and of course we all knew it was inevitable that trump would be president ,2,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,lol i love pjw,5,The_Donald

elchupanibre5, if a left leaning person group calls you racist it is very possible they could be wrong however it also doesnt mean that you are automatically not racist which is the fallacious argument jon seems to be making i personally believe this mindset is a result of the frequency of the use of the word racist when people constantly use that word as a means of silencing opposition even if its factual data rather than having open dialogue then you see results like what you explained ,93,JonTron
elchupanibre5, but black people are in this position largely because of white people of the past so what is the best plan for blacks to get out of this position its not like there is not current systematic laws preventing them from escaping the clutches of white past in fact more than ever there is a lot of assistance for all minorities to succeed in the usa hell even illegal immigrants have constitutional rights yet the violence in chicago continues for example so then what do they do ,1,JonTron
elchupanibre5, if you look at the proposed healthcare bill it includes tax cuts for the wealthy at the expense of healthcare for the poor again could you link to this part of the bill i am not a fan of the bill either just so you know since i am in favor of a free market health care system the second part of your statement seems to be kind of a trickle down economics right like reagan said if you help the rich it will eventually help the poor but it did not work out like that because the rich hoard their money then they influence politics to get extra legislation to get them more money this is how capitalism works though it is not a perfect system but it the most effective in improving the quality of a nation what other form of economy do you think would work better we have seen the effects of socialism venezuela communism cuba china which have proven to the exact same thing where the leaders of the governments have the most money and power while the people suffer equally even positive socialist countries like sweden are seeing the negative effects of it via their refugee crisis where the governments are using taxes ineffectively either way whether capitalism or communism you are looking at an honor system where you have to trust either corporations or the government to effectively distribute wealth at least with capitalism our way of life is constantly improving thanks to the free market i know this is sacriligious to say here but illegal immigrants are not the reason the white middle class are going under its the super wealthy who dont pay taxes and get billion dollar subsidies by the government you are right illegal immigration is not the reason why white middle class are going under it actually the reason why lower class black families are going under because the lower wage jobs are being taken over by cheaper labor which in turn assists in creating welfare states another question is why are the super wealthy always seen as the enemy do they not help improve society by creating products that enhance our society and provide jobs to families free markets allow for competition which thrives businesses ahead you cannot have this kind of marketplace in a socialist or communist society where the government forces everyone to be the same once again capitalism is not a perfect system but it a system which has proven time and again to create positive results maybe you know of a better system in which case i am all ears ,2,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,but then you enter your own bubble which is a form of self censorship our beliefs always deserved to be challenged debate is necessary in an open marketplace of ideas its a good thing ,25,JonTron
elchupanibre5, but that does not mean we should blindly follow his plan agreed remember the magical 30 day plan to beat isis he promised us we have not heard anything from the white house since the election i am not a fan of him pushing obamacare 2 0 either i did not like how he rolled out the temporary ban there are parts of his over all plan that i disagree but also some i do agree with for example i support trump stance on bringing back jobs and securing our borders unlike most democrats who froth out the mouth in hatred and disgust over the guy ,1,The_Donald

elchupanibre5, they pretend racism and oppression do not exist for minorities but that losing a school social media account or being banned on reddit are the true oppression why must it always be about oppression olympics where is the common sense in just trying to be equal and not repeat our ugly history the problem here is that the current definition of words like racism and oppression does not match what they were 50 years ago western civilization has progressed enough to where racial oppression simply does not play as much of a factor in our culture and therefore should no longer be forced upon our governmental policies there was a time when progressive ideologies were a necessity to forge equality and balance in our society but now it seems that the definition of words such as racist or oppression come from a genesis of feelings and opinion rather than institutional oppression or physical hatred yet sjws still use these words as weapons to further along their progressive ideaologies hence progressives have transformed into regressives all in the name of supposed good i hope you can understand why people find it ridiculously hypocritical when the same liberal ideology which historically fought for free speech now regards the term as excuses for hate just because in their minds words and feelings are the equivalent of systematic racism and physical pain ,1,undelete

elchupanibre5,as much as i would love for us to create hundreds of pro trump subs to btfo shariablue it will only hurt us in the long run because you know what the admins will do if they see us trying manipulating shit shut us down of course its not fair but we need to play by their cucked rules at this time we cannot afford to give the admins a reason to shut down this sub its too damn vital to the movement we are doing a fantastic job as is in red pilling people the fact is that all of the shairablue shilling is actually pissing off reddits regular user base which eventually bring them here where they are effectively red pilled these users cannot be red pilled as efficiently if this sub is removed as long as the dems continue to shoot themselves in the foot we are here to set the story straight and people know where to find us ,34,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,to be fair paul ryan also believes that russia did collude in the election the fact that he believes this proves that he a shill and i have to really think about trusting him at his word ,4,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence to support it if the media is so hell bent on wanting us to believe their story then they should present us with evidence to support their claims if they truly believe that trump 100 colluded with russia then be a fucking patriot and reveal your information sources instead they say we cannot because it too classified just trust us well then i have the right to tell them to fuck right off with their bullshit ,2,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,terrific work breaking this down fellow patriot,2,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,the premise of your argument is that trump deserves criticism for being a liar and yes i agree he does but not to the degree of claiming his presidency as illegitimate on the basis of untruths extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence to back them up the moment trump decided to run for office the media decided to make him the enemy and he has been on the defensive ever since sure trump is not exactly a moral authority in many regards but at least he is not a pc shill under the purse strings of globalists political favors and the military industrial complex obviously you are going to say well trump himself is an evil rich white man but what has he done to prove this statement what factual evidence is there that trump is an authoritarian white supremacist for example i just see many criticisms of him are based around assumptions about the worst of what he could be rather than who he actually is and it clouding peoples judgement spez not sure why the comment was deleted but i just wanted to respond to it the disagreement here i believe and i could be wrong and if so i am sorry is that trump would have a better time with the media if he made less false claims in my opinion this just is not true even if trump was a saint i do not see the msm being fair to him because a large percentage of the msm is in fact a tool of the dnc it all political this to me was proven with how much they actively attacked trump yet shamelessly covered for hillary despite her massive problems as a candidate now the msm have suddenly switched from defending deflecting president obama mistakes to now overtly scrutinizing everything president trump and his administration does to the point of forcing resignations do not get me wrong i welcome a press who scrutinizes our elected officials but why did not they have the same vigor to scrutinize a democrat president when he and his cabinet made worse false claims mistakes it the hypocrisy that bothers me and which i do not feel people who oppose trump fully grasp it like i always tell people who dislike trump it fine to dislike him on the basis of his ego or his policy or lack their of but to hate his guts or declare him an illegitimate president based around engineered falsehoods such as this russian narrative is intellectually dishonest ,1,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,a new meme is born,2,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,because confirmation bias bubble propaganda disguised as truth i have never seen so much division in our country across party lines and it all the fault of liars and thieves who try to control what we hear watch or read at this point if breitbart found real evidence that obama physically murdered someone it would be silenced simply because it breitbart reporting it this is all absurd as a centrist trump simply does not have the same luxury that obama has with the msm and people who refuse to see this fact are either a shill or completely brainwashed by partisan propaganda the state of our news media is a damn tragedy ,52,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,fuck yeah represent ,13,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,it going to be up to each and every one of us to push this story since the msm simply wo not idgaf anymore i want justice to be served and am willing to fight for it open up all investigations to anyone and everyone until the roaches are smoked out once and for all ,7,The_Donald

elchupanibre5,being a racist and stereotyping are two very different things ,1,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,i think you are slightly downplaying actual racism because it has lost its meaning over time there is no doubt that racism at its core is evil but the meaning of the word has transformed into a micro aggression like status there is no denying that racism still exists but it has also been slowly eradicated from the mainstream public conscience over the last century thanks to progressive ideologies that were necessary for a time the problem now is that progressivism has been allowed to fester in the west without a clear agenda control or limits which has created a sort of social chaos and outrage culture out of very little substance it does not help when university professors and other supposed experts clamor on about bad words being the equivalent of physical violence for example this in turn makes other words like racist or sexist weapons which can be used silence or censor rather than have important debate discussions about factual evidence which is necessary to solve problems this is why i feel that the natural progression back to social sanity is through conservatism and it happening right now ,3,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,maybe he is but i rather enjoy that he being centered unbiased about his coverage ,4,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,we do not hate liberals we hate the constant identity politics from regressive leftists specifically those who are blinded by their own hypocrisy and lack of intellectual honesty ,11,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,confirmation bias is a very powerful thing,1,The_Donald
elchupanibre5, this should be true in all situations i agree but can you name me a president that took responsibility for all of his past failures i can guarantee you that obama has not taken responsibility for several of his failures on many occasions the difference is the lack of media backlash and or his defenders coming to his aid do not get me wrong i think we should hold all presidents to the fire equally and i welcome calling out trump when he lies but this situation he says this was a mission that was started before i got here which he was technically correct about ,1,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,shariablue is not sending their best ,3,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,this is not the same situation though why bring a totally different situation into this regardless if he was being truthful in his remarks then i see nothing wrong with this quote but i can also understand if you do not trust trump at his word due to him lying in the past i personally think he was being honest though just not eloquent with his wording ,2,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,great leaders admit when they make mistakes kudos to the president for being humble i wish more of our leaders would do this ,2,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,reddit is destroying themselves by allowing shills a platform to keep shilling as long as it does not affect their bottom line a fate worse than digg ,3,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,there is so much hate in their hearts ,10,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,makes me wonder if the oscars screwed up on purpose last night just to create a fake controversy so news would talk about them at this point it really would not surprise me ,1,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,i can understand being critical towards anything as long as the criticism comes from a basis of factual evidence to equate the actions of a president concerned for the security of his nation as something bigoted is not intellectually honest especially when the nation his family immigrated away from actually commits worse atrocities then just temporarily banning he people from a set of high alert countries to view trumps actions as an insult is stupid i am sorry look if trumps administration was whipping women cutting off heads in the street or shooting people who disagreed with him then i would say he was a tyrannical dictator that deserves to be ridiculed but no evidence suggests this to be the case of course this director has a right to protest however he wants but he also should not be surprised that people think his actions were foolish and disrespectful ,2,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,i think artists get a bad rap these days mostly because the majority of them are so annoyingly liberal whether we believe their talent is necessary or not is subjective there is no doubt that the arts have been an important aspect to our evolutionary and cognitive development for generations art is also fascinating and beautiful when executed from a basis of genuineness the problem here like most things is when politics blends with art it just ruins it same with sports or any other form of entertainment ,3,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,i do not think you can use this same argument yes it would be a valid discussion but is an oscar platform necessary for that kind of discussion also do you know what would happen if a well toned celebrity spoke openly against obesity they would be castigated as a fat shamer in this social justice climate even if he she presented factual evidence to support their argument what if the iranian director decided to speak well about trump using factual evidence he would also be castigated by his peers the core issue here is that there is no supported evidence that trump is some kind of tyrannical dictator worse than what is currently in iran or any other of the 7 temporarily banned muslim countries and to even suggest that is fucking hypocritical and stupid it deserves ridicule ,9,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,because it seems hypocritical for an iranian immigrant to speak ill against a country his family fled to rather than the country his family fled away from sure he has the right to do it but then we also have the right to call him out on the hypocrisy ,20,The_Donald

elchupanibre5,it unfortunate because an honorable press is essential to upholding true democracy the current msm is all about political favors and money gone are the days of values principles and truth now it all lies slander and confirmation bias just to sell clicks ,14,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,since the rest of us are attacking click bait titles alone might as well go deeper let examine them shall we 1 we need answers on trump team ties to russia hey bush before we can get answers we need to find legitimate questions first if there is not even legitimate questions then we will never find answers because a problem simply does not exist asking the tooth fairy for answers would be less of a waste of time 2 i support immigration policy that welcoming and that upholds the law so does trump in what way has his policies shown that america is not welcoming everything he has done has been with the basis of upholding the law so what is the problem you cannot enforce a law and be all welcoming at the same time 3 media essential to democracy no shit sherlock still does not give the media a free pass to publish propaganda and hit pieces for the sake of destroying the credibility of a freely elected president bush is a neocon whose reputation is better served by shutting up ,10,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,what is unfortunate is that the media will continue to blame everyone else for losing subscribers trust when it is their own biases which are destroying their reputations even little kids understand the basics of this yet entire media organizations cannot just adds credibility to the argument that that the media is in fact propaganda controlled by a few elites rather than honest and independent ,163,The_Donald

elchupanibre5,i say let them keep shooting themselves in the foot all it does is help president trump,11,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,diversity is good because it introduces interesting cultures values and ideas within a population which increases overall intelligence as well as humility and or appreciation of ones own culture harmonious diversity within a nation can be a beautiful thing but only with the right balance and respect for the country of origin as a whole i personally think utopia is an impossibility but in order for a nation to get anywhere close to it there needs to be like a base culture or core principled values which represent that nation as a whole and that every citizen abides by and respects japan is a good example of this i think the problem here in america is that there is zero respect for our own country history culture and values rather it is openly mocked and attacked as evil archaic christian white supremacy that we need to constantly progress away from even at the cost of destroying the good values and parts of our culture we need to learn to embrace our history the good and the bad while not simply brushing aside the values and principles that made america a great nation ,0,The_Donald

elchupanibre5,that still no excuse for his comments especially when people are willing to destroy someone reputation off of things they said in the past once again it is the hypocrisy from the left that angers me the most if the left are going to destroy milo because of things he said in the past then maher should suffer the same outrage consequences for his past comments problem is that it probably wo not happen because leftists have the power of the mainstream media press to obfuscate their tribalism ,2,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,because he is not a republican sad but true ,34,The_Donald
elchupanibre5, reeeeeeeee in text form he going to regret his decision of pushing you away for political reasons just give it time ,3,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,i have lost any remaining respect i had for that cuck he did not even properly confront milo on his show even though he invited him it almost like maher was involved in taking him down as well these media roaches sicken me ,46,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,psycho is an understatement she was certifiable batshit ,10,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,lol this is rich coming from clooney,2,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,i am guessing you are young because there have been much more than just 3 or 4 cases worldwide of female teachers having sexual relationships with young boys i am also not calling it an epidemic or anything but it has happened was my point maybe the word countless was not the best word to use this is a question of child abuse not of are le feeemales often mentally on par with 7th graders regardless of their age i agree but the commenter who i responded to was misconstruing milo comments as a supposed hate of women over all this was their comment how much do you have to hate women to think that a 28 year old teacher is less mature and stable than a 13 year old boy they brought up the argument first so i just responded with my opinion i am not defending milo i just thought that particular comment was kind of stupid and i think we agree based on your response i also think completely dismissing milo over all points just because he hates women is not intellectually honest once again i actually agree with you that it wrong for any adult to openly allow sexual advances from promiscuous underage children or vice versa that is irresponsible and those adults should be sent to prison for their lack of responsibility i disagree with milo stance on this specific issue though i agree with him on other issues ,-4,SubredditDrama
elchupanibre5,lol but seriously check my history ,2,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,i sort of agree look at my history too pedes i honestly think he was projecting his negative experience as a positive one to try and cope with what happened to him although i am also giving him the benefit of the doubt imo it is unacceptable for any adult to consent to a sexual relationship with any child even if that child supposedly is the sexually curious aggressor i think he was trying to make interesting points but they got lost in translation and it just looks bad he needs to clarify his statements ,2,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,yes i agree with you this is where milo screwed up in his comments to quote milo these things do happen perfectly consensually often by the way it s the women who suffer because what normally happens in schools very often is it an older women with a younger boy and the boy is the predator in that situation this is not normal at all and does not happen very often i disagree with him here ,17,SubredditDrama
elchupanibre5,i mean you have to be at least attracted to a person if you want to have sex with them right i would not be surprised if the basis of pedophile attraction comes exerting power control but who am i to say i also cannot paint pedophilia with such a broad brush because i remember my mindset at 13 and it was not exactly yuck cooties if back then a hot older woman would have approached me sexually i would not have exactly pushed her away there is also no doubt that if that hypothetical situation had occurred in my life that i would have been terrified and it would have undoubtedly screwed my brain so i am thankful to the laws in place that prevented that scenario from occurring i do not know reading milo comments kind of reveals that he quite messed up from his early sexual abuse and he using the fact that he was the aggressor to help him cope in some way when in reality the pastor should have been responsible enough to be an adult and walk away ,11,SubredditDrama
elchupanibre5,how does his comments relate to hating women in general do you not remember the countless articles of women teachers having sex with their students it a reality that we have seen occur in our society this is not to say all 28 year old women are immature enough to be attracted to a 13 year old but we have seen it happen before i do not necessarily agree that a 13 year old could be the aggressor in that situation but you never know every situation is different which i think was milo point ,-17,SubredditDrama
elchupanibre5,this still does not exactly extinguish the realities of teachers going for younger guys that we have seen in countless news stories so an attraction must have been there i remember when i was 13 year old boy i would have fucked anything so to know that my hot teacher was attracted to me in any way would make me feel powerful still its the teachers responsibility to be an adult and not succumb ,5,SubredditDrama
elchupanibre5,i am a trump supporter and i do believe in climate change just not at the apocalyptic rates that academia keeps fear mongering about i am also not a fan of dismantling the entire climate action plan the problem here is the title of this article if you read the first paragraph it says president donald trump will order the environmental protection agency epa to begin dismantling a regulation central to former president barack obama s plan to fight global warming it literally says he going to begin dismantling a regulation not the entire action plan this kind of click bait title encapsulates what is wrong with our media from both sides of the isle we have already seen that our current regulations regarding climate change have done very little to steer the rates of global warming yet we also have not seen any of the devastating predictions come to pass there is no way that current regulations have done anything to improve our carbon footprint so it begs the question were we all lied to this is why the apocalyptic nature surrounding the nature of global warming has subsided problem is that business never subsides i agree with trump in that we need to lessen the burden of epa regulations so businesses can get people back to work i do not believe he going to completely get rid of all regulations which are necessary to help reduce global warming he just wants to reign it in a little people just need to calm down from this thought process of trump being a complete buffoon dictator yes he is not exactly the greatest orator but he smart enough to hire the best possible experts and listen to them ,9,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,i love when stuff like this goes down add a solid pg sg and they are instant contenders ,1,nba
elchupanibre5,lol so spicy ,17,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,does not matter feels like these people want a robot president who says every single word with fine tune accuracy and precision anything less is literally hitler i guess by that standard obama was hitler too ,1,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,i am telling you the media is killing their credibility by overreacting to everything they are doing this to themselves and they still refuse to acknowledge it it is hilarious ,4,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,look i just do not understand what the problem is and i really do not feel like arguing semantics do you honestly expect trump to be an automaton that says every word perfectly do you not understand over all context of a message i just do not see the purpose in getting into such a fuss about nothing ,3,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,i can agree that we will never know with 100 confidence what exactly trump was referencing until you look at the full context of that specific section of his speech which was about the negative impact of open border immigration policies in several european nations we have already read several stories over the last year about the rise of rapes and violent crime in sweden so naturally its was not too far fetched for op to come to the conclusion that trump could be referencing this in particular still technically speaking we do not know but it does not seem like a big deal to me trump over all point was clear enough ,1,The_Donald
elchupanibre5, but it seems as if this sub just goes into instant defense mode every time trump does something actually what we do is clear the air with common sense whenever the media and the rest of reddit goes insane towards whatever trump does so i guess my question is do you really believe there was a terror attack in sweden this friday no and the problem here is that you are implying that trump was referencing a terror attack in the first place if you look at the entire speech in context he is talking about immigration specifically ,6,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,who said anything about a terror attack ,11,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,ok i wo not get political either in the grand scheme of things is it really worth anyone time or energy to make such a big deal out of this because the tone of the media is that we all should be shouting from the rooftops about how terrible this is ,3,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,this place is meant to be an echo chamber though the politics sub has a facade of being neutral when in fact it is clearly a leftist echo chamber ,11,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,they are shooting themselves in the foot by overreacting to everything ,8,The_Donald
elchupanibre5, look trump misspoke again he mentally unstable msm lunatics ,8,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,this looks nothing like the he will not divide us installment also was not it recently closed are we sure this is legit spez i did not know ledouche moved it thanks for the clarification ,5,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,translation rrreeeeeeeee ,4,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,we have become a massive coordinated red pill factory it glorious ,35,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,if this is true it could explain why spez and co decided not to outright ban this sub because even they knew it could be devastating to their bottom line they would rather expunge resources to slowly phase us out of mainstream reddit tbh i think its a good business strategy but a huge slap in the face to freedom of speech which will inturn be the undoing of this website ,1,The_Donald
elchupanibre5, i was given that information that not an answer that trying to get out of the way of a trainwreck i will give you this one he did not answer this one properly and his answer was unsatisfactory to me he wo not give a straight answer on anything that has to do with russia involvement in the election he just keeps saying how the intelligence community is out to get him thats because there has been nothing substantiated to back the claims the only reports we received were from the cia i read them all and they did not provide sufficient proof that russia was responsible for hacking the election i will link the documents if you would like all they spoke about was ip addresses originating from russia why would russian hackers use russian ip addersses to hack servers and the other report detailed memes and rt being responsible for swaying the public wikileaks has denied that their source for podesta emails not classified information were russian so based on this information he has a right to call it fake news and move on but the media keep acting like its 9 11 event its all bullshit the leak that the real story that not what he said with the dnc leaks who cares where it came from he begs for a softball question and when someone gives him one in this specific case he is right because what was leaked from the whitehouse was in fact classified where the wikileaks were simply podesta emails nothing of classified nature was revealed to the public think about it he begs for a softball question and when someone gives him one he accuses the reporter of calling him a racist and antisemite when the question was prefaced with essentially i am not calling you a racist or antisemite jesus christ what a shitshow that conference was this was also pretty bad but can you blame the guy for being on the defensive after people have been constantly labeling him a racist and antisemite how would you feel if the press made you out to be the next hitler while demanding you answer their questions that you know they will take out of context all while trying to be the leader of the free world it easy to arm chair but at least trump was mostly genuine yes he is new at being president cut the guy some slack ,1,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,could you imagine the headlines if trump disbarred cnn from attending his press conference trump bans cnn from press conference is he the next hugo chavez instead he lets acosta ask all of his questions and answered them ,1,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,not really the media clearly hates trump and he cannot exactly exhile himself from the media so has a right to defend himself from the constant barrage of bullshit tell me what was the point of maher inviting a guest to his show if he wo not even allow him to fully make his points ,3,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,what is funny is that this counter intelligence officer is saying things that were not even in the official reports that the cia and fbi released sounds like he is pulling things out of his ass honestly also in the grand scheme wikileaks had little to do with the democrats losing they still refuse to admit that clinton was just a terrible candidate ,41,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,look there were good men and women at those rallies but unfortunately they were all but silenced by the third wave feminazis truth is that many women not all but many wo not admit this but narcissism does in fact fuel their lives just look at the sudden boom in the make up industry for example then you have selfie social media obsession hyper sexuality hollywood celebrity worship health fads third wave feminist based causes excessive tattooing etc if you look deep enough narcissism is at the core of it all yet these are the same women who complain about president trump narcissism it just hypocrisy i kind of feel bad for single men out there having to deal with this crap ,3,The_Donald
elchupanibre5, give that man a medal lol ,2,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,wow what an ego on that girl the irony is that she probably exclaims trump is a narcissistic jerk when she is not that different ,3,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,yep this is the case on facebook as well i lose count at how many times people try to avoid debate when i present facts or evidence to their irrational posts its annoying because i can tell by their silence that they are too triggered or lazy to fact check so they just run back to their safe spaces instead i always welcome debate i just wish it would happen a little more often not when business is too busy though ,26,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,we already know that trump has a tendency to lie about dumb shit but what politician does not what human does not can you point to me another past president or world leader that has not lied in some form the issue is there are different degrees of lies you know fibs or whoppers but seriously to set him up about not giving correct electoral vote totals as the sole reason why he a fascist is just ludicrous and borders on mental collapse we never said that we do not believe that flynn spoke to russians the thing we do not believe is the narrative of russians hacking the election the actual fake news which is the core reason for the outrage about flynn speaking with russian officials thing is there is zero i repeat zero evidence to date confirming that the kremlin hacked the election so then whats the problem with flynn talking with russia trump let him go supposedly because he lied do not know why he did and i welcome an independent investigation to find out even though fbi already did an internal investigation on the leaked tapes and concluded nothing was said that could confirm collusion between whitehouse and kremlin so then whats the problem the media instead are screaming about impeachment same thing with the dossier or whatever they just keep making themselves look foolish ,1,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,we wo not call it fake news if there is verifiable evidence every article that has been touted as this will end trump include citations like claims not verified or sources of anonymity or cannot release full details due to classified nature at what point do we get actual details with confirmed sources there is a grey area where we have the right to conclude that if you do not have 100 facts to back your claims then why publish it using clickbait titles that make it seem factual it just dishonest journalism that borders on propaganda ,1,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,i am reading conflicting reports on this maybe these are not the same factories as previously stated from what i understand ford wants to still build a factory in michigan ,1,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,i can respect your stance as long as you do not believe the extreme stances being spread around i do not know i just did not see that press conference as him being in over his head i actually thought it was refreshing but to each his own you do have every right to not believe in his stances if it does not fit your particular brand of politics in reality neither of us know how trump will do i am just hoping for the best i like to listen to ben shapiro on trump because he a hard right conservative who hates trump so imo he gives the most balanced analysis on him he has a segment on his podcast called good trump bad trump that title perfectly describes him i agree with shapiro in that trump has a duality about him with a public persona and his actual action persona i believe that as long as trump effectively passes policy and listens to his cabinet recommendations which good leaders do he should do fine of course if you are a hard left democrat you simply wo not like his policies or his personality so i understand your anger but hey you have a vote in 2018 still there are aspects about trump that i believe are good leadership skills but we do not know yet if this will translate well in the political arena he a wildcard who could be the worst president ever or one of the best it just too early to tell the thing is that most of the media is not helping by constantly painting a negative picture making people go bonkers rather than at least taking a gander at his strengths ,2,facepalm
elchupanibre5,march 2013 amazon plans to sign 600m contract with cia november 2014 amazon releases the echo hmmmm ,112,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,lol r politics is trash,53,undelete
elchupanibre5, that same politician basically outright denying reality yes i see the difference and i see your point but i gotta tell you you are being a bit melodramatic about this and i do not blame you i think this is the problem with how we as a society view our leaders in power we have this idea of what a president should be in our eyes rather than just having a president who gets shit done yes it is very stupid lie what trump said but does a couple of stupid things he says completely negate his actual policy toward fixing the economy does it negate him fulfilling his promises faster than any other president once again i am not saying its not stupid to lie to make yourself look good but at the same time i am not ready to claim he is mentally unstable or a complete fascist dictator like the media are now doing just because he fibbed a few times the reality is that he is new and we should give him a chance but no everyone has concluded that he is the next hitler that we must take down i am asking for everyone to take a deep breath and relax ,1,facepalm
elchupanibre5,cannot help but agree with most of your post well said i also want trump to be held to the fire as much as anyone else trump is not great at some things and i am willing to admit that but to take extreme stances like he a fascist or he a racist or he putin puppet or in your words he is a fool based on a lack of quantifiable evidence just seems unjustified the criticism that tickles me most is people call him a buffoon despite him achieving billionaire status do not know about you but i do not know many billionaire buffoons look is he new at this being president thing absolutely and it shows but for the media and democrats to mercilessly attack him just seems unfair and will do nothing but divide everyone rather than bring us together in this very press conference that you say was a disaster trump calmly explains to the cnn reporter that he does not mind getting called out on his bs as long as its done fairly this is what i would like to see as well but it just not what is actually happening and you know it i also do not think obama was necessarily a smart man i do agree that he tried to do good but whats to say trump is not trying either nope he simply a fascist next coming of hitler at last trump is genuine instead of the same old politician man which we have had in office since my birth ,0,facepalm
elchupanibre5,gotta admit this looks bad but honestly we already know trump has a way of exaggerating things that make him look good or bad what is the point of asking a loaded question like why should americans trust you off of something insignificant like fibbing about electoral vote counts the media just seems to be nitpicking everything trump does you know what i also remember when obama promised me 37 times that my healthcare would lower and that i could keep my doctor with obamacare only to have my premiums raised and lose my doctor why was not obama grilled about this why should the american people have trusted him it just hypocritical to use something like this as a means to paint trump as an illegitimate president when past presidents have done far worse with less scrutiny ,-1,facepalm
elchupanibre5,agreed even if you hate trump you cannot say he is not genuine it refreshing versus the usual political mumbo jumbo ,25,The_Donald
elchupanibre5,lol i love it when the oh so virtuous leftists get the cold hard truth flogged into their faces later come the excuses ,24,The_Donald
