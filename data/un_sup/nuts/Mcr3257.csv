Mcr3257,no i do not think i was wrong whilst labour pointed out that i as secretary of state could priorities clean water projects that is not in line with the intentions a plan that will last after this government has left whitehall which could only be achieved through legislation in fact my pursuit of the bill has been justified in labour and the opposition opposing it as they have proven that only this government is to be trusted on this front and thus a change that outlasts us was the best option ,1,MHOC
Mcr3257,the 10 figure was based on an initial review of spending within the department and how it could be reduced as we implement this the number may change but for the purposes of outlining the policy it is a 10 reduction ,1,MHOC
Mcr3257,all of my aims this term have been outlined previously the main way that the uk will be working to achieve internationally held goals such as these will be through wholeheartedly supporting multilateral organisations that work towards many of the sustainable development goals including of course the un ,1,MHOC
Mcr3257,though i think parties wishing to scrap the commitment are misguided i will not declare a blanket condemnation before hearing their proposals for foreign aid indeed i do not know of any parties wishing to scrap this commitment at this time so the question seems somewhat irrelevant ,1,MHOC
Mcr3257,there will be a discussion within the department and the cabinet with regards to how these would best be implemented ,1,MHOC
Mcr3257,then i would not say they are the key as such but i recognise how such institutions could contribute to development in ledcs ,1,MHOC
Mcr3257,mr deputy speaker the implementation will be discussed by the government and any actions will be brought to the house in legislation so i do not see it particularly necessary to vote on m207 when it would be far simpler to accept the vote on any legislation that arises ,2,MHOC
Mcr3257,mr deputy speaker of course this is not my view and as such any reduction in bilateral aid will be accounted for in the grant applications fund this means that the wellbeing of the people in those countries in terms of uk aid will be handled by reliable ngos who can evidence they are making a positive impact as opposed to the authorities in the area which are refusing to be held to account over how they are spending uk aid ,2,MHOC
Mcr3257,mr deputy speaker this is an interesting question in terms of making the department itself more transparent i do not think there is too much to be done however when the budget is announced i will be available to answer requests of information regarding dfid expenditure unlike the previous government regarding transparency i have mostly referred to improving that of authorities receiving uk aid plans for which i have outlined previously ,2,MHOC

Mcr3257,mr deputy speaker i do not and i think the failure of the bill shows that the government were right to propose a long term investment plan in sustainable clean water as it is now clear that the opposition parties presumably the future governments are not to be trusted when it comes to providing additional money for clean water projects however i would comment that the labour party are doing a far better job at being an official opposition than the official opposition and though i found their comments in the debate unhelpful at least they responded ,1,MHOC

Mcr3257,mr deputy speaker i fully agree and am glad that the education secretary has brought this to me we are working to ensure that aid reaches persecuted christians particularly in the middle east and i will share this document with the home secretary and foreign secretary if the noble lord has not done so himself ,1,MHOC

Mcr3257,mr deputy speaker with the help of the civil service i am currently looking into creating compulsory transparency requirements for recipients of bilateral aid to ensure that we know where the aid is going this would mean that even if we find a situation in which it would be beneficial to give aid to a leader considered corrupt we would be able to ensure that british money is not being misused and is making a positive difference ,1,MHOC
Mcr3257,mr deputy speaker i do agree and our main foreign aid priority besides urgent aid will be investing in infrastructure and removing barriers to development ,1,MHOC
Mcr3257,mr deputy speaker i wonder if the noble lord could expand on what he means by open and inclusive economic and political institutions perhaps with an example ,1,MHOC

Mcr3257,mr deputy speaker i do not judge foreign aid by how much is spent but where it is spent and how effective it is this government is committed to the 1 target but if another government finds a way to provide the same or better assistance in the developing world without committing to the 1 target then i would support that ,1,MHOC

Mcr3257,wow i am impressed at the great work by the labour party on this and i am very glad that someone is holding the government to account given the incompetence of the official opposition whilst there is no alternative government element to this it does do a good job of scrutiny and i would like to respond personally to some of the criticisms where i feel qualified and on behalf of the government in terms of international development i would hope my right honorable colleague would understand that not only does immigration help our economy but also that he does not have the votes to control immigration in the first place many british people do see immigration as a concern and whilst immigration does provide economic benefit it also has huge cultural implications and impacts every aspect of british life this government is not an anti immigration government but in my view it is irresponsible of the labour party to be poking fun at efforts to put sensible controls on immigration by promising no room for cooperation whatsoever we hope that the government will not stop at simply remaining a signatory to the convention but works to promote ensure and further protection of human rights equal treatment under the law protection of minorities and the rights of all peoplein the united kingdom this government is undoubtedly a modern and compassionate government which believes in equal rights for all people living in this country and i do not think the labour party or anybody else should be left with any doubt that i certainly and as far as i can see the government as a whole is willing to work with anyone to secure these rights where there is room for improvement to build a safer and more prosperous world was the pledge by the department of international development in their recently released plans for this term and whilst on paper this pledge seems reassuring it will take an immense deal of work by the secretary and his colleagues to complete the task he has placed before him i am hoping that with the help of my colleagues in government and if offered to me the official and unofficial opposition spokespeople i will be in a better position than ever to achieve these aims or to at least pave the way and make our presence and financial assistance in the developing world make as much a difference as possible i have written to the labour party regarding our aims and whilst i have not had a response i will take the international development section in this press release as such and reply as follows firstly i would like to celebrate the government s renewed commitment to spending at least 1 of our national gdp on oda despite the conservative party committing only 0 7 at the last election this commitment of unity with the most vulnerable people across the world sends a strong international message of which the united kingdom can be proud my aim this term is to make uk aid go as far as possible and cutting our aid target did not seem logical in this aim having said that the most important thing in my view is not how much is spent but how it is spent and that will be my focus over the next sixth months or if mhoc copying rl is a thing over the next ten days or so the government has pledged to introduce mandatory transparency guidelines for the governmental recipients of foreign aid and whilst transparency in the delivery of aid is advantageous cutting it entirely is not a suitable response to countries that may not meet said guidelines the plans state that ngos receiving dfid grants will be encouraged to further invest in countries to counterbalance the suspension of all uk oda this is not feasible nor is it responsible of our government we cannot rely on encouraging non governmental organisations to deliver aid where we refuse to do so and so we hope the secretary will revisit his plans and look at alternative methods of encouraging transparency that does not put innocent people in harm s way transparency guidelines without enforcement would be pointless what this allows us to do is decide where our money would be best used as a means to the ends i have outlined when a foreign government is not informing the british government or their people as to how they are spending the money of the uk taxpayer it is not responsible or justifiable to be sending money to this government when the money could go to charities working in that area who have a proven track record b107 details the creation of a grant applications fund where charities ngos are able to apply for a grant to be spent in a specific country ie the government will allocate a certain percentage of the money put into the fund to be applied for and then spent within that country this already existing legislation gives us an excellent mechanism to redirect aid that would be given to governments bilaterally had they met transparency requirements which will mean people will not be worse of due to these reforms which is of course the most important factor to consider i hope that clarifies the intent of these reforms and that the labour party would consider working with us by supporting them and helping in their implementation and if not possible at this stage suggesting improvements the opening of grants for applications that seek to tackle the water shortage crisis is one that we are pleased to see every day we hear more and more deeply ashaming statistics 1 in 9 people worldwide do not have access to safe and clean drinking water 443 million school days lost each year due to water related diseases 1 in 3 people are still without improved sanitation facilities this government must strike definitively to fight back against this crisis before it worsens any further hear hear the clean water fund bill will be presented to parliament at the end of this month and this will create a fund similar to the grant applications fund which will specifically tackle water shortage where it is needed most i am glad to have the support of labour on this policy continuing onwards the plans then proceed to completely contrast the last policy with the announcement of an arbitrary 10 cut to the departmental civil service claiming it will reduce wastefulness and unnecessary bureaucracy this is simply untrue a slash to the civil service would not decrease inefficiency but instead it would do the complete opposite by slowing down the department s abilities to distribute aid and set and maintain the guidelines as outlined in the first policy it is a major concern of myself and the labour party that this proposal of a 10 cut may lead to further reductions of the dfid and possibly abolition entirely we hope that the secretary will now commit to no decrement to his department during his term in office the cut to administration etc is absolutely in no way leading to the deconstruction of the department and i would like to make that clear what it will do is free up money which can be spent on more important things i will add that the 10 figure does not represent employment in the civil service but expenditure relating to it such as admin and other costs whilst this will mean i will have to dramatically reduce my biscuit consumption this is a sacrifice i am prepared to make in full knowledge that the money paying for my enjoyment which is very much i can assure you is from the pocket of the hardworking man and woman joking aside this does have big implications but i can assure the labour party that this government will be excuse my trump sounding ness the best ever in the whole world on international development and will be making unpresidented reforms irrespective of any reduction in manpower we may face i must say that from my experience the civil service in this department are incredibly skilled and undoubtedly able to adapt to any reduction once again we see the government reaffirming their nostalgia of empire in policy with a promise to increase commonwealth aid by 50 000 000 on the grounds of prioritising our natural international friends we are hesitant to support a government that is insisting on allowing our former colonial empire to dictate where and to whom we send aid this is a policy that has been written without any substance whatsoever despite the secretary pledging to reduce wastefulness and to increase efficiency in how we spend our taxpayers money now this is a pledge from the ukip manifesto and whilst i see the labour party concerns i think they are unreasonable this government is a very pro commonwealth one and ultimately i do not see what is wrong with more aid if it is going to the right places which i can assure you i will make sure it is to build a safer and more prosperous world is a goal that we can all endeavour and work towards and the labour party looks forward to aiding in said endeavour i look forward to working with labour to work towards this male sexual assault is an oft ignored and dismissed reality in our country to respond to this the labour party will table legislation to ensure that the government builds 10 male crisis centres across the united kingdom i 100 support this and commend the labour party on this needed proposal overall this document is commendable and whilst it does agree with the government quite often to the point an invitation to the coalition may be justified s i am glad to see scrutiny of this government and i hope it continues ,3,MHOCPress

Mcr3257,mr deputy speaker firstly i will state that i am disappointed that i was not contacted regarding this bill given the impact its passage would have on my work this term however seeing the author of the bill and recalling his track record in terms of communication i am not surprised in the slightest and though i would guess that this is just another attempt by the liberal democrats to flood this house with legislation i am actually very happy to see this bill submitted whilst i think the bill being repealed is well written and clear with honourable intentions and i agree with some of it in principle in practise the bill is unworkable i will use the figures from the 2015 government even though they are not canon as they are the most useful to break this down uk aid direct to administrations in countries are of unique value as governments are often the most able to make a difference in the country having the most power and all that the only issue with aiding corrupt governments i see is the lack of transparency and next month the dfid will be publishing transparency guidelines for organisations receiving oda and hope to pass a bill withdrawing aid from governments that fail to meet the requirements this will mean that far more people will be reached by the benefits of uk aid and it will also mean the aid can be targeted so that we know it is reaching the right places the issue with withdrawing aid from corrupt countries as this bill does is that if an undemocratic government can evidence that it is making a positive difference in a way that a non profit organisation or multilateral aid body could or would then preventing british aid from reaching those people or areas is simply ridiculous it is all well and good promising to redirect the funding to ngos but there is no guarantee that charities will apply for grants from the grant applications fund laid out by bnzss in every one of the one hundred and thirty countries that the bill withdraws aid from even if that was the case it is very unlikely that grants would be taken out to fund the projects that are most needed in that area on account of the fact that most charities and ngos have specific aims and purposes in the case of multilateral organisations such as the united nations and the commonwealth foundation i would agree that these have their roles to play but again they cannot replace the impact that bilateral oda to governing administrations can have i will again stress the fact that i do not believe we should be throwing money at projects that are not making a real difference in the developing world which is why i call on the house to support the transparency reforms that will be made by my department which will mean that we are able to see where all of our aid is going in order that we can assess what the best option would be in terms of bilateral multilateral grants to ensure that money is not being wasted but what we do not want to do is exclude the people of 130 countries who previously received foreign aid from the uk from the immense benefits that it will have on their lives but to ensure that the money we will spend on oda is going as far as possible as thequipton once said it is not how much we spend on aid it is where that money is going to clarify the countries that receive bilateral oda under b274 are bhutan burkina faso rwanda sao tome and principe senegal and the solomon islands using the 2015 statistics this would mean a drop to 103 064 828 83 spending in bilateral oda which added to the 3 538 283 000 00 spending in multilateral oda which in my view is quite sufficient particularly in how it is distributed and i do not see it in need of change irrespective of the effects of this bill and the 33 required under b107 for the grant application fund 101 526 547 80 this totals 3 742 874 376 63 which is 0 2 of uk gdp falling massively short of the 1 target i know it can be argued that that shortfall can be made up in grants to charities and ngos as well as redirecting spending to multilateral aid organisations which are not linked to corrupt governments this model certainly illustrates how substantially the authors of this bill have underestimated the importance of bilateral aid and the effects that what is set out in this bill will have on it my aim in international development is to ensure that the money of british taxpayers goes as far as possible in making a difference in the developing world and that is restricted by b274 in excluding so many nations from bilateral oda without thought to the good that it can do for those countries with transparency requirements in place the dfid will be in a better position than ever to evaluate where uk aid should be sent and where it will make the most difference to the development of low income countries and the lives of people living in those countries and this cannot be done under the restrictions set out under b274 edit i would also like to accompany this with a list of notable countries that are excluded from all uk aid including to ngos and multilateral organisations under this bill as the people of these nations are deemed to be too high income to be entilted uk support syria kenya south sudan zimbabwe iraq moldova libya pakistan nigeria lebanon ghana indonesia vietnam the list goes on ,2,MHOC
Mcr3257,hear hear however i would mention that rwanda are not the only country that would benefit from the unique upsides of bilateral oda and bhutan burkina faso sao tome and principe senegal and the solomon islands would make the figure 6 out of the 136 countries previously benefiting from uk aid ,1,MHOC

Mcr3257,mr speaker in terms of overseas expenditure one can rest assured that spending will not in real terms decrease whatsoever and the dfid has detailed plans as to how to allow ourselves to better target oda and this should ensure that our money goes further and makes more of a difference in crises such as the one the right honourable lady mentions if the shadow secretary wishes to create a more solid resolution in terms of legislation i would be happy to work with her to create a joint plan as the prime minister suggests and i would advise she writes to me about that and we can look into it ,2,MHOC

Mcr3257,our motto is christian influence in a secular world and that is what we intend to be we are not planning a christian takeover of the uk or anything but we do want to make an impact on how the governing forces of this country run in relation to the teachings of the bible the moral enforcement question is actually quite interesting we have a duty to look after one another if a policy is clearly causing damage to people then it should be changed no matter how that infringes on freedom an example would be the growing irreverence for marriage this is not one you have to agree with me on but here is our position everything that god commands us to do he does so for a reason not only is marriage god institution and his gift for society it is very beneficial irreverence for marriage means more promiscuity meaning more unwanted pregnancies meaning more abortion neglect therefore if one has the power to stop this then they must now of course we cannot legislate against sin if we are not willing to listen to god on this then what could possibly lead anyone to the conclusion that the government would be listened to so things like fornication sodomy swearing lust etc etc could not be legislated against however when a practise is causing damage and can be stopped gay adoption abortion euthanasia etc then one as a leader has a moral obligation to stop it i hope that sums up our view ,2,MHOCToryConference

Mcr3257,the only other times ezer was used in the old testament were referring to god iirc irrespective i made little mention of such word in the briefing i made a mistake my apologies i was talking mostly about kenegdo the phrase help meet is derived from the word for help helper or saved ezer and kenegdo meaning in front of or opposite the root being neged but the word in verse 18 and 20 isn t simply neged it has both a prefix and a suffix the kaf prefix is an inseparable preposition which is typically translated as like as and according to and it affects and alters the meaning of neged the pronominal holem waw suffix is equivalent to the pronoun him so the word kenegdo is effectively made up of two prepositions plus a pronoun and can be called a prepositional phrase i must however admit that my knowledge of hebrew is very limited so doubting myself i researched it to find that most who wrote about it there were many said that it was very difficult to translate and that equal but opposite was the best estimate most also explained that help meet was an unhelpful term to be used since it belittles the role of the female in the marriage find me a young girl who says when i grow up i want to be a help meet anyway regardless consider that when man needed a help meet god created female in his image if god ideal spouse for man was woman then why should anyone trust deceitful human hearts as appropriate reason to disagree with god choice may i ask you if you believe homosexuality is sinful or not ,1,MChristianInstitute

Mcr3257,yes it is disgusting the poster is not saying that it is a good thing in fact the poster is nigh on explicitly portraying it as a bad thing yet in all seriousness we must not ignore that this is going on in islamic cultures and that needs to be exposed as a bad thing sure this poster is a mockery of ukip and how liberal they have been towards islam but joking aside bestiality is a terrible thing and ignoring it is not the right approach i have labelled it as nsfw so it cannot be too much of a shock to anyone a picture of a man having sex with a goat is not immoral a man having sex with a goat is it not being used for people pleasure it being used with evident implications that it a terrible thing with all due respect with the advancement of the gay agenda the 550 unborn children slaughtered each day in abortions the passage of secularisation and gradual but evident diminishment of christian influence in politics there are much greater fights to be fought than if a member of a party enters a poster vilifying sexual immorality in a contest and let me ask you one more question when sexual immorality is defined and described in the bible is your reaction that disgusting god must have no morals i highly doubt it if the evils of this world were just meant to be hidden away then there would have been no mention of them in the infallible word of god thus they are not they must be exposed and if a joke poster helps even in the slightest to expose the cultural normalisation of the disgusting act of bestiality in the islamic culture then i do not see it as a wrong or immoral ,1,MHOC

Mcr3257, i find it odd that the endeavour can only muster the drive to critique but a small section of a manifesto i am very sorry that i do not spend my summer holidays analysing every manifesto through and through and writing a response to all of it much of which i will admit i probably do not know too much about and some of which i will be neutral on accepting more migrants originally from syria in order to help them escape daesh a more open overall immigration policy this is not foreign affairs this is home affairs and as such it is rightfully not included in my foreign affairs review supporting the scotland malawi partnership the snp would also aim to maintain friendly relations with all of the uk and scotland s allies one example of this would be the snp s support of the scotland malawi partnership which currently benefits approximately 198 000 malawians this also demonstrates the snp s continuing commitment to funding international development and providing a better life for those abroad as well as those in the uk i am very sorry to tell you but i was doing a policy review and not a rhetoric review saying we support something or we will continue something is not policy and wo not be included in these reviews finally the notion that the snp does not care for scottish people is simply untrue as it states in the section you reviewed the eu supports over 300 000 scottish jobs and so staying in the eu will only help the people of scotland well when 60 of the scottish people want something and a party claiming to give scotland a louder voice ignore it then it becomes clear how truly out of touch the party is also that jobs stuff is nonsense the figure came from this report http www europarl org uk resource static files ukjobs pdf actually reading the report reveals the key info that the aim of the present investigation is not an overall evaluation of eu membership but rather an estimate of the employment effects that result from the exports of goods and services from the uk to the eu although many previous studies have sought to answer the question of what would have happened if britain were not a member of the eu we do not seek to test this counterfactual hypothesis a very similar report by the niesr says there is not a priori reason to suppose that many of these jobs if any would be lost permanently if britain were to leave the eu it is just sheer nonsense and the snp should not be misleading scottish voters into thinking that they care one bit for them the result of our model referendum in my opinion became a meta issue of poor moderation and implementation of the meu the question on the ballot paper had no mention of the meu the referendum was never about the meu it was about britain continued membership of the eu how difficult is it to accept that scots are fed up of being told what they think by the snp thus it is wrong to say that scotland rejects the idea of a european union we only know that they reject the meu this is just pure ignorance when scotland voted to remain by 62 irl nobody said that it is wrong to say that scotland rejects the idea of leaving the eu we only know that they reject leaving this eu i would give this article a 10 10 for tory spin however thank you but i would suggest that not being a tory does not help me on that front ,2,MHOCEndeavour

Mcr3257,part 2 2 through 30 trade deals negotiated by the eu including the single market itself british firms have full access to a 24 trillion market the recent deal with canada and on going discussions with japan and the us could double this to 47 trillion you ve seen my comparisons to the value of other nations trade deals firstly you are cheating with the figures you are giving the eu a trade deal with itself if we exclude this it will show truly how inefficient the eu is when it comes to making trade deals sure 47tn sounds a lot of money but it is the same value of trade deals that is had by tiny singapore population 5 4 million how come the eu with 100 times this amount of people can only make half this amount and at a push the same because it requires having 28 completely different economies agree to the terms something that takes far too long and is incredibly inefficient not to mention that the eu frankly aren t very good the uk would struggle to achieve the same quality of trade deals independently and is yet another reason as to why a single market has given us an advantage yet discovered across most of the world i m not sure i quite understand how can you honestly suggest that the uk would not be able to negotiate such amount of trade deals when the european union has set the bar so shockingly low the uk is much more open and outward looking than the rest of the eu bar malta already and regaining our independence will enhance that immeasurably it also means that unlike the european union we will look further than fortress europe and negotiate with the rest of the world it also means that if we want a trade deal we don t need to have 27 other countries with different economies and cultures and constitutions to agree to the terms of the deal we need britain to agree that it is in britain s interest and that is exactly how it should be arrangements negotiated in our interests not some mediocre deals that took 10 years to agree on with the european union our investment prospects have changed for the better as well investment flows across borders inside the eu have roughly doubled following the introduction of the single market as the eu s leading investment destination the uk was a key beneficiary the eu accounted for 47 of the uk s stock of inward fdi at the end of 2011 with investments worth over 1 2 trillion official figures show that over the last ten years the european union s net investment into the uk has fallen more recently the eu as a whole has disinvested from the uk in fact today the united states is a more important source of investment in the uk than the eu is one only has to look at graphs of net investment https d3n8a8pro7vhmx cloudfront net voteleave pages 599 attachments original 1455783870 graph4 png 1455783870 and cumulative investment https d3n8a8pro7vhmx cloudfront net voteleave pages 599 attachments original 1455783593 graph6 png 1455783593 to see these trends the eu is also becoming less important for british outward investment the uk is disinvesting from failing eurozone economies where the rate of return has fallen by half over the last four years by contrast us earnings have remained broadly constant and let us be absolutely clear international investors don t want us to be shackled to this economic mess that is the eu in a 2013 survey 72 of us investors and 66 of asian investors said that the uk should have looser relations with the eu but yet another advantage lies in the free movement of labour across the eu in yet another poll conducted this shall be shown free movement of labour helps uk business plug skills gaps 63 of cbi members say that the ability to recruit and transfer staff from across the eu has been positive for business including 48 of smes overall only 1 of members said the impact had been negative and only 2 of smes said it had been negative let us save the immigration debate for tomorrow i now look to residents of my constituency cornwall and devon whom are significant beneficiaries of eu assistance according to figures from the cornwall and isles of scilly local enterprise partnership lep the region is on course by 2020 to have benefited from a total of 2 5 billion of funding eu cash matched with public and private investment since the turn of the century cornwall and devon are like quite a few locations in the united kingdom which have since our ascension to the eu benefited so greatly from brussels assistance in a way that has tangibly shown itself while far less attention came from westminster which is why i support and continue to support our membership of the european union it is british taxpayers money a lot of the rest of which is wasted or lost in fact the government could continue providing this funding and all other funding that the eu provides us and have 188m a week to spend i can t say how this will be spent because sadly i m not in government but what i do know is it will be spent by a government who have been elected by the british people the notion of no taxation without representation was enshrined in the magna carta yet the remainiacs are proposing we throw all of this away and submit to the eu no no no to say we are stronger out of europe is more like saying someone wearing high heels is just as equipped for a 100 meter sprint as a man wearing running shoes i d argue it s more like saying that we are good enough we can run our own affairs and we can once again become an outward looking nation which trades freely with the world and is not dictated to by a foreign and unelected bureaucracy but if you prefer to talk this country down with a high heels analogy then go for it let s vote leave and take back control ,2,MHOC
Mcr3257,part 1 2 rubbish i come before this honorable nation if it is an honourable nation then i would urge you to both spell using its language grammar and also to stop talking it down with your warped lies and misleading figures to conclusively argue we will see for remaining in the european union on nearly entirely the grounds of economic benefit i would urge you to reconsider if these are the only reasons you will accept i know that the remainiacs think they are winning the economic argument but they must not revere it as if it is the only important matter how about considering those who fought and died so that we could be a sovereign and free nation how about considering the english civil war that established this nation parliamentary democracy or revolutionary charters such as the magna carta this is not a matter to be decided purely on economic impact but on social cultural constitutional impact this is not an economic issue it is an issue that affects the entire british way of life being in the european union has benefited the united kingdom exponentially in the prospect it has maintained since entering the common market the total cost of eu regulation to british business is estimated to be 33bn a year and about 68 of this comes from single market regulations over the past 10 years a typical low income family in the uk has spent 2 of their total expenditure supporting the common agricultural policy this is the policy that increases the price of beef by 36 the price of chicken by 22 the price of potatoes by 10 and so on in fact the average uk family of two adults and two children would save 45 per month on their food bill if it were not for the wasteful eu policies that affect food prices since malta cyprus slovenia estonia latvia lithuania poland the czech republic slovakia hungary romania and bulgaria were given free movement a e attendances have increased by almost 9 million a year free movement laws stop the uk from testing eu doctors for whether or not they speak english which has led to the death of patients the clinical trials directive has created serious problems and delayed the development and testing of life saving cancer drugs the eu limits the use of gm crops in ways that have been strongly condemned by nobel winning scientists and which have resulted in companies such as basf moving operations to america it also passed the reach regulation this makes it extremely costly for small businesses and entrepreneurs to handle chemicals the government at the time admitted that the cost of registering chemicals under reach is excessive smes across the eu are hit disproportionately hard tell me how has being in the european union has benefited the united kingdom exponentially access to a 16 6 trillion a year single market so let include all of the nations outside of the eu which the eu has a trade deal with 5 23tn the value thus of the eu trade deal overall is 18 14tn let look at this in comparison well let look at switzerland whose deals are worth 29 2tn or singapore whose deals are worth double those of the eu at 35 5tn south korea 45 2tn and chile 50 3tn why do you not have confidence in our country to negotiate a valuable trade deal with its key allies such as the usa australia and china who we currently do not have a trade deal with are we not good enough not big enough my entire argument is based on the fact that we can do so much better than this and if you do not believe that we can explain why rather than saying a 16 6tn market is the best we are going to get free trade and removal of non tariff barriers have helped reduce costs and prices for consumers are you suggesting that eu nations with whom we have an ever growing trade deficit of almost 24bn a year would engage in some tit for tat tariff war with the uk that would hurt our firms and their firms even more yes i am sure the bloated officials in brussels want to give us a slap on the wrist for leaving but their is no way that the german government french government spanish government belgian government or any other government in the eu would do such a suicidal thing as to put their businesses in such a damaging position we are the eu 27 largest export market they export more to us than they do the the us china russia and so on and they certainly export more to us than we do to them let end this nonsense talk of tariffs or non tariff barriers also let just take a little look at prices again there is no way that you can suggest that given the level of punitive eu regulation prices can in any way be reduced by membership of the european union i will reiterate what i said before over the past 10 years a typical low income family in the uk has spent 2 of their total expenditure supporting the common agricultural policy this is the policy that increases the price of beef by 36 the price of chicken by 22 the price of potatoes by 10 and so on in fact the average uk family of two adults and two children would save 45 per month on their food bill if it were not for the wasteful eu policies that affect food prices over 52 of uk exports are to the eu trade within the eu has increased 30 since 1992 actually only 44 of uk goods and services exports go to the eu with the remaining 56 being sold to the rest of the world and exports of goods and services to the eu represented 13 1 of gdp in 2014 exports outside of the eu however represented 16 3 of gdp and were 25 more valuable than exports to the eu furthermore the uk has a far more open economy when it comes to trade the share of uk goods exports going to countries outside the eu is higher than every other eu member state besides malta all of these trends beg the question why anyone is advocating that we should remain in a position where we can t shape trade deals in our own interests if the majority of our trade is outside of the eu then shouldn t we take back control and the ability to negotiate our own trade deals rather than having a situation where it is very unlikely that 28 different nations with different economies will agree and thus we lose out on trade deals with key allies this has allowed the economy of our wonderful nation to blossom with some realities being imposed it is not the eu that allows the economy to blossom the eu in fact restricts this greatly it is the hard working people and the businesses of this glorious united kingdom that create wealth and prosperity to suggest that some overpaid old white men in belgium are responsible for this country s success is an insult to the people of this country who have worked so hard over the past forty years to ensure a prosperous economy this has managed to provide an exceptional boost to our nhs and medical systems with all due respect the nhs is facing its biggest financial crisis ever and the eu is not helping i will quote what i said earlier since malta cyprus slovenia estonia latvia lithuania poland the czech republic slovakia hungary romania and bulgaria were given free movement a e attendances have increased by almost 9 million a year free movement laws stop the uk from testing eu doctors for whether or not they speak english which has led to the death of patients the clinical trials directive has created serious problems and delayed the development and testing of life saving cancer drugs the eu is not helping the nhs and when in the time we are spending only 340 000 000 on cancer drugs we are sending 9 800 000 000 net to the eu the question really has to be asked how this is a more useful way to spend taxpayers money out of a poll conducted on cib members 58 of cbi members think that extra eu trade agreements have had a positive impact on their business including 55 of smes compared to the 3 who thought the impact was negative this proves that many are relating when they see the european common market on being a rather good thing this is not a good representation of whether or not business supports the eu of course they are going to say that extra trade agreements are a positive thing i don t disagree but that is not an accurate measurement let s look at some more relevant polling of cbi members shall we by nearly 2 1 cbi members believe that the eu hinders their businesses rather than helps them 28 said that the eu helps their businesses while 48 said it hinders them when asked who should manage international trade negotiations 86 said the british government just 10 said the eu only 28 agreed with the statement common eu rules make trade and business easier and the single market is good for jobs and living standards this and not your misleading statement with which it is difficult to disagree conclusively shows the views of british business and who can be shocked when eu regulation costs them 33bn a year when the 95 that don t trade with the eu are still restricted by this red tape the eu is a springboard for trade with the rest of the world through its global clout it accounted for 23 of the global economy in 2012 in dollar terms funny because in 1972 it accounted for over 35 the eu is in relative decline https d3n8a8pro7vhmx cloudfront net

Mcr3257,currently only between 5 and 8 of uk firms export goods to the eu whilst 100 of uk businesses have to follow eu regulations by leaving the eu the power will be with the uk government to cut unnecessary red tape freeing small businesses also you say we will no longer have any say over the rules the truth is we hardly do anyway the eurozone has a permanent voting majority and can always outvote the uk we have to rely on only 8 of the votes in the council of ministers and less than 10 of the votes in the european parliament to keep our interests safe since the records began the uk has voted against 72 laws in the council of ministers it has been outvoted every single time and these laws are now in place in the uk and have cost the taxpayer 2 4 billion so i ask you how can you justify all uk firms following regulations that are not in british interests despite 95 of them having no need to do so see the eu has already implemented laws that are very bad for british industry and who knows what they will do next and if a terrible law does past that cripples our economy we cannot get rid of it without having 28 nations agree only if we take back control of our laws will british businesses be given the freedom to prosper and freedom from damaging and unnecessary regulation ,3,MHOC
Mcr3257,absolute rubbish what we have said is that on leaving the european union the power to make british trade deals will be with the british government and not some old european men who do not care about the british people getting a good trade deal is not up to the leave campaign it up to the government who have been chosen by the british people and of course there is a fantastic alternative to the eu we currently do not have trade deals with key allies such as australia new zealand and the usa because in order for the eu to sign a trade deal 28 nations need to agree that it is in their interests this means that the uk interest is only represented 3 6 whereas if we made our own trade deals we would be represented 100 see in the globalised 21st century you do not need a trade deal to trade it is not politicians that make trade it is businesses and we have some amazing businesses in the uk that means that if the eu does not offer us a good trade deal if it included freedom of movement or any other ridiculous policy we could literally refuse to sign it and they would ultimately offer us a better deal only 5 6 of british businesses trade with the european union and so realistically it not going to be too damaging to delay a trade deal we will still trade with them but there will be tariffs arguably more damaging to them than to us considering our trade deficit is in the region of 24bn the truth is the trading opportunities that the eu gives us are not very good if we were to add up all the gdps of nations who have trade deals with the eu we would get 5 23tn a lot i know but let look at switzerland whose deals total 29 2tn or singapore 35 5tn south korea 45 2tn and chile whose deals total 10 times that of the eu at 50 3tn why cannot the uk do better why do not you trust your own government to get a good deal with key allies the truth is the eu is not good for international trade and britain will be much more prosperous if we take back control of our trade ,7,MHOC
Mcr3257,the people are not entrusting the leave campaign in getting a good deal they are entrusting the elected british government and since you clearly do not have confidence in your government to get a good deal i would urge the electorate to vote you out in order to utilise the fantastic opportunities for trade that will be opened up after the brexit vote ,8,MHOC

Mcr3257,mr deputy speaker i was originally torn on several things the first was what i believed with regards to this bill i have always thought it completely wrong that a parent should hit their children the thought disgusted me and it is clear to me that any parent who brought up their children well would never find a situation where it would be necessary to abuse their child the truth is if a parent is as loving as is humanly possible to their children then when their children do misbehave a stern telling off and an explanation as to why what they have done is wrong would be more valuable to the child development than a simple spank which could most likely leave confusion and resentment however i also questioned what position i stood in to tell parents how to discipline their children this has been a method that will have proved relatively effective for families throughout history and who are we as politicians to tell parents what they can and cannot do if they feel that it is necessary to spank their child and they think that that way is the most effective how do i have the right to stop them doing what they think is best for their children why is my view of good parenting which i will implement when i have children objectively better than another secondly i was torn as to whether or not to involve myself in this debate as it had become so passionate so quickly and i would be opposing the sentiments of many of my fellow conservatives and right wingers but i could not keep quiet as this is a view i hold very strongly that view being that parents should not abuse their children not that spanking should be illegal so obviously i concluded that i should get involved and put my view across anyhow the latter view which i put across the whole i should not tell parents what to do is fundamentally flawed i am not unlike some of the leftist members of the house supporting this bill suggesting that my concept of how a good parent should teach their children is what all parents should follow parents should be perfectly free to discipline and praise their children in ways which they see fit of course that is true regardless of this children must be protected by the same law as adults are if it is considered a terrible act to hit an adult why is that okay for a child who is in most cases less able to defend themselves and less able to understand the reason why they are being hit some members who disagree with me on this argue that children cannot understand reason and therefore need to be spanked in order to be controlled well may i ask this if young children cannot understand reason then how do you expect them to respond to being hit the answer is in many cases that they will be confused they are not likely to stop doing the wrong which they were doing but to grow in anger and are belliousness and to those saying i turned out fine how do you see that as justification for children being beaten there is none parents can parent there children however they choose but children must be protected by the law this is vital and this bill is a great step forward in human rights i urge all to vote aye for the children ,3,MHOC
