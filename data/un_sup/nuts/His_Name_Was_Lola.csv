His_Name_Was_Lola,when i was a kid following my mum into m s i held the door for some hippy looking lady behind she stopped dead and said i do not need a man to hold doors for me aside from the fact i was not even 10 years old at the time i was still pretty far from being a man i let the heavy glass door loose and it swung outward since she was leaning toward me sneering the glass made first contact with her face my mum just grabbed my arm and whisked me away pretty sure i did not get told off but years later learning my mother stance on that sort of feminism she probably had a big smirk on her face ,41,humblebrag

His_Name_Was_Lola,i cannot remember who it was some buddhist monk or something he said in regards to meditation something along the lines of we have two brains there us our consciousness and our monkey brain that is always chattering away keeping us alive looking out for the next fight or flight response the reason proponents of meditation say to concentrate on breathing is to give that monkey in us something to do leaving our consciousness free to disconnect from all that chattering to think about things or not think about things edit it might be drivel to you for me it helped me understand the breathing thing and it seems to work for me it does not need to be 40 minutes of breathing exercises in wooden teepee with a joss stick propping up your chin i like to take a couple of minutes at the end of my lunch or a few minutes after work before picking the kid from school to just zone out in my head ,1,AskMen

His_Name_Was_Lola,well i used to work for a company which installed underfloor heating so the majority of my system was sourced through them and or made up from bits and pieces i collected from the jobs we worked on my biggest outlay was on screed but even that was not exactly consumer prices either i remember my boss charged a customer the best part of 8 000 for a larger than average living room and kitchen in my opinion it depends on the climate you live in in my house in the uk i would not have bothered if i did not get most of my system for free next to nothing the main benefit for us is if we have been away for a few days during the cold months it only takes a half an hour to an hour for the whole house to be comfortable whereas with just radiators it can take a while to really saturate the house by which time you have to go back outdoors and come in again to notice the warmth the dog likes it though spends more time sprawled out on the floor than in that over priced bed i bought her ,2,AskMen

His_Name_Was_Lola,i have only ever shared with a few people how my late mother regularly hid a packet of biscuits usually chocolate digestives from my brothers and i so when we had visitors there was always some biscuits to go with a cup of tea how it done in britain i once caught my daughter stuffing a packet of biscuits in the back of a cupboard behind a big bag of pasta at the time i thought crafty cow wants them for herself but left them there to see if they would disappear maybe for a teaching moment about not being selfish or something they did not disappear but reappeared when some friends came over she just waltzed out of the kitchen just as my mother used to opening a packet of biscuits she never knew my mother and i am pretty certain nobody else would have encouraged this pretty specific behaviour i do not believe she the reincarnation of my mother but i am just intrigued at her selflessness she does not get it from me those biscuits would not have gotten past a couple cups of coffee with me around she still does it too we have a biscuit box in the cupboard usually with a few packs of biscuits but when i keep a check on how many packs i have bought there will be one short or i will come across a random packet in a cupboard somewhere and she likes to be the biscuit bringer when we have visitors ,1999,AskReddit

His_Name_Was_Lola,there no minimum requirements to being a man you may have more of one sided upbringing than your brother but look at it this way he had less of an upbringing from your mother so you are who you are and your brother is who he is i know that a pretty vapid statement but there nothing worse than a person trying to be someone they are not be your own man and it perfectly natural to drift away from parents one or the other or both in teenage years and the ratio of kids who told their parents they hate them to the number parents who ever believed them is wider than you can imagine but as someone who lost a parent at your age make sure to let them know your true feelings if you still find yourself wanting male influences go get a job or some part time work mowing lawns or something you are sure to meet plenty of men good and bad who you will want to emulate or avoid ever turning into ,3,AskMen

His_Name_Was_Lola,i think ezekiel plays a cleverer game than that he mentioned in his chat with carol about how people talk and ultimately created king ezekiel if a handful of people know about this deal he knows people talk and he knows the rest of his kingdom know about the deal too what harm is there in showing morgan if he knows morgan will find out from everyone else eventually he tells people to keep certain information between he and them which makes people feel privileged in his inner circle only his inner circle encompasses them all he mentioned that if his people knew about the deal they do but they believe they are keeping it secret too they would want to fight the saviours i believe this is intrinsic to ezekiel he does not want war and bloodshed he knows his subjects are loyal to him and are probably more capable than first appearances capable of destroying the saviours and keeping the saviours at arms length might be worth 8 pigs a week for now at least and submitting to the saviours demands keeps them sweet because we do not actually know what role the saviours may play in the wider picture perhaps their presence allows some protection to the smaller production settlements ,1,thewalkingdead

His_Name_Was_Lola,it was an apprenticeship in car mechanics the garage was owned by a guy who was well regarded by people all around the mechanics who worked there were vastly knowledgeable and excellent teachers they told me of stories of back when they were apprentices how they would get all the shitty jobs like cleaning and tea making they did not give me the shit jobs we would take turns making the tea and we would all muck in on the cleaning the place was one of the cleanest tidiest garages i have ever seen which did not employ a dedicated cleaner we all got on well and i genuinely looked forward to work so much so one day i left early one day as i had a doctor appointment my visit to the doctors was quicker than expected so i headed back to work as there was a couple of hours left of the workday i was walking too before i got my first car on the way i tripped and broke my ankle trying to believe i would only sprained my ankle i really wanted to go back to work so instead of turning around and walking maybe 2 10 ths of a mile home i walked the 2 miles back to work walk is not quite the description i was almost in tears with the pain when i got there they took me to the hospital during this time the garage owner was going through a divorce basically she got everything in the divorce and he was allowed to keep his yacht so he set sail and got as far away from his wife as possible when she took over it was her ethos that the apprentice should do all the shitty jobs as an initiation despite having worked there well after an initiation she was an absolute piece of shit to work for the other mechanics grew to hate working there she pissed off all our good regular customers and greased up her friends giving them freebies eventually her cleaning compulsion saw me mopping out the garage 4 times a day even when no vehicles had been in the workshop all day i was ordered to make tea at every break then was not allowed to take a break and had to get back to mopping so after making her tea a few times with dirty mop water i quit my apprenticeship the other two mechanics who worked there for years before me also found new jobs within the same month and quit too the garage was left with only her a secretary who knew nothing about cars garages secretarying and a cowboy of a mechanic she managed to scrape up after being run into the ground the garage closed and was sold off within the year i did hear she lost her marbles and ended up being hospitalised a few times in a secure mental facility i have wondered if it was my mop water tea i made her two teabags and double up on the sugar she never noticed ,2,AskMen

His_Name_Was_Lola,i would not be surprised if there was something insidious going on here back in highschool i had an art teacher who would segregate the boys from the girls in hindsight i do not remember much teaching went on on the boys side of the class she tended to orbit the girls in the class there was one girl who was forced to sit on the boys side she had been held back a couple of years due to an illness which made her miss a lot of school she was older and a lot more mature making her more aware of the teacher behaviour which she often called her out on i loved the subject and worked hard one of the few subjects i prioritised but it only earned me a final grade d at the end of it which pretty much quashed any dreams to develop a career using my skills the twist came several months after leaving school my mother was friends with the retired art teacher who was replaced by the one described above she took a look at my work 3 years worth and asked if she could borrow it to show a friend of hers that was the last i heard for many months after i later found out her friend was the education authority who reassessed my work along with that of other students they gave me an a but it was too late and i would given up i found out from my mother friend that the education authority had found a pattern grading male students at well below and female students way above national averages to my knowledge some of my classmates grades were revised i do not know about older classes and the teacher lost her job it may sound a good outcome but if it was not for the luck of the old art teacher taking up knitting in her retirement that teacher would likely still be pulling the same shit i dread to think how many are ,19,pettyrevenge
