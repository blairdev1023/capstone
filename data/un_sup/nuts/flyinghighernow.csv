flyinghighernow,donald trump and republicans are in power the republican party has more power than at any time since when they decided to institute a punitive peace treaty that led to the horrible massacre of world war 2 john maynard keynes specifically warned against it as far back as 1919 president woodrow wilson tried desperately to get a just peace but he was unable to push for it as much as he would have liked to because the last 18 months of so of his presidency he was extremely ill the next three republican presidents all extremely popular at the time and the republican congress then deregulated and lowered taxes result the great depression today republicans including donald trump are pushing exactly the same policies as they did in the 1920 repubicans also have the power to investigate hrc obama weiner and all of the other people whose names come up over and over ask them to do so then ask yourselves why would not they yes i am sooooo concerned with trump ,1,conspiracy
flyinghighernow, this has nothing at all to do with defending democratic rights let test this right now tell me a few people who oppose donald trump that you might support at times ,3,conspiracy
flyinghighernow,that the point these unlimited money oligarchs want to spend all day striking people with so much propaganda that there is no time left to find any truth ,2,conspiracy
flyinghighernow, obama doj funneling money to democratic organizations republicans have power why are not they investigating ,9,conspiracy
flyinghighernow,but it up voted so much for trusting the up votes around here the retail value of all the land on earth is about 320 trillion and the military lost 600 trillion way to go lol,6,conspiracy
flyinghighernow,i do not buy the russia hacking story either but every day the collusion story becomes stronger in fact if there was hacking it was most likely done by republicans not russia and that makes the government in power more suspicious not less it also should make a person wonder why democrats are going after russia and not so much after republicans this is another form of collusion going on and one that should be familiar ,4,conspiracy
flyinghighernow,you are asking for a bubble i do not even go to the bubble of the politics sub i like it here i do not go to the donald bubble either conspiracy is for conspiracies and if history is any guide people in power are the priority that would be donald trump and the republican party here in the united states and they should be because they can affect our lives presently and they have investigation powers ,2,conspiracy
flyinghighernow,one of my most favorite sites and you can see it in my history is wsws org it is an actual hard left site if there ever was one i do not support its ideology i do not support any ideology and sometimes the communist rhetoric becomes tedious but the reports there are the highest quality and they always get the facts right wsws org is not afraid to cover a conspiracy here are two examples https www wsws org en articles 1999 11 bank n01 html https www wsws org en articles 2007 02 brze f02 html ,1,conspiracy
flyinghighernow, he has sounded and acted off since october i do not like the way julian has decided to promote one side over the other i know democrats hate him now that too bad he has kind of pushed himself to the republican side who will probably burn him in short order i think he blew it i am still hoping for salvation he done way too much good work to write him off at this point somehow i missed this guy in the video even though he has millions of views on that video i only had to see his wikipedia page to throw him the hell out omfg this guy is scum sorry check the wikipedia talk page out someone wanted to delete the page but many turned out to oppose it a rare moment when the wikipedians get it right lol promised to kill that trade agreement tpp was already dead ,1,conspiracy
flyinghighernow,i have read articles from there and i see it a bit differently but here the big thing the alternative news market needs a little support even if it not quite the way we want it the bigger it gets the more we will be able to push it in our direction we still need to be cautious always ,1,conspiracy
flyinghighernow,great list how about fair org wsws org consumerist com inthesetimes com etc there are many good sites but people keep going back to the old msm sites the partisan sites and other corporate sites ,6,IAmA
flyinghighernow,donald trump called out jeb bush i was cheering then i realized something donald trump was pretending to be an outsider just like the tea party did merely six years earlier when donald trump won the election the stock market told us in no uncertain terms that they loved donald trump that should have been a wake up call i do not dismiss this guy he should be ordered to testify on his counter coup i have always respected the work of julian assange if what this guy says is true and i doubt it actually that puts julian assange is a completely different light ,2,conspiracy
flyinghighernow,all right i listened that video came out just before the election i am surprised i had not seen that before he talks about a counter coup appears to implicate julian assange and puts out very general statements that was pure republican propaganda in fact what happens if there is a counter coup but there is no coup woah he is admitting that republicans tried to steal the election we should look carefully at who these people are from the wikipedia page pieczenik was deputy assistant secretary of state under henry kissinger cyrus vance and james baker 2 his expertise includes foreign policy international crisis management and psychological warfare 6 he served the presidential administrations of gerald ford jimmy carter ronald reagan and george h w bush in the capacity of deputy assistant secretary 7 now the idea that this guy is doing something for the people becomes utterly absurd this video was nothing but black propaganda to get republican donald trump into office and to continue the reagan revolution ,2,conspiracy
flyinghighernow,thanks for the generously sized write up it good to see a self post with some substance for a change i picked out a little section and here my response the media is trying to sabotage trump in their reporting aided by elements of the deep state not really the media was for trump before the election yes it was then http shorensteincenter org pre primary news coverage 2016 trump clinton sanders but now that we are not in an election year not so much https shorensteincenter org news coverage donald trumps first 100 days they are trying to convince the american public that russia has subverted our democracy yes the media and democrats are doing that republicans are in full denial the true story http www gregpalast com election stolen heres is that russians were not the biggest players in election cheating however they are reluctant to probe too deeply because they are fearful of letting the whole cat out of the bag it all just hegelian dialectic they know the white hats could expose a lot more corruption if pushed to do so the idea that donald trump is some sort of altruistic outsider should be fully dismissed by now he has 100 percent supported the koch business agenda has escalated wars and promoted a new one and has turned his back on promises that go against the koch agenda there are no white hats all sides are dirty republicans democrats russians and trumpians ,3,conspiracy
flyinghighernow,that would be too easy here we are believing that msm is working for the democrats but are they really it almost like they want this story out there on the internet to make themselves look like something they are not ,0,conspiracy
flyinghighernow,under that notion everyone in on everything together are you on the inside with everyone else but me we should be in utopia or dystopia by now you sure you did not forget the s anyway you edited your comment to add that link that a long article from what i can tell it full of circumstances and likelihoods can you give me the tl dr on the smoking gun in there and then do not forget my second question ,1,conspiracy
flyinghighernow,not an answer first you need to prove your initial point that the intercept is a limited hangout a claim that one story was not useful doe not even begin to prove your point second after you do that you need to refute my second point ,2,conspiracy
flyinghighernow,the problem is that voter id requirements are as i said onerous and often convenient restrictions by onerous i mean ids may be hard to get or even expansive especially for older folks by convenient i mean convenient for making it easy for favored demographics like those with gun permits over those with student ids and here information on that too voter identification requirements voter id laws http www ncsl org research elections and campaigns voter id aspx if in person fraud were a big problem it could be fixed easily by issuing a national id card through the ssa database you see what happened here everything was all confused convoluted and made difficult by the republicans who have been found repeatedly in recent years trying deliberately to purge certain demographics so that they can win elections read the articles i posted and try to dispute them before spitting out yet another republican objection thanks ,3,conspiracy
flyinghighernow,see what i said above about verifying citizenship they can do the same thing with central death records that has nothing to do with these purges ,11,conspiracy
flyinghighernow,the united states has been keeping a database for proof of citizenship for decades states are allowed to compare their records to the database so if a state wants to make a list of those whose citizenship is not proven out of their voter registration databases they can do so anytime once done they can take the unproven names and check bls and other sources for proof after that they could contact the remaining names and tell them to get the proofs or they are registrations will expire but that not what is happening instead republican governments are claiming absurd amounts of voter fraud and adding onerous and often convenient restrictions on voting rights justice stephen breyer recently said that he is very tired of having to deal with voter suppression cases they are flooding the courts if you are not republican read the reports i posted they should be eye openers ,12,conspiracy
flyinghighernow,the limited hangout mantra is for the most part just a way to discourage activism and to discredit sources that would not go along with the official paradigm even if this were a limited hangout it still provides better information than most other sources use it for what it worth ,2,conspiracy
flyinghighernow,first i painted the big picture of the state of voting rights in georgia second i painted the big picture showing how republicans use voter fraud charges to effect outcomes not as some ideological belief you are still complaining that i am only looking at one side here the other side another comprehensive analysis debunking the voter fraud myth https www brennancenter org analysis debunking voter fraud myth looks like there is not much voter fraud going on as for voter suppression that growing here a detailed report on that voter suppression how bad pretty bad https www brennancenter org analysis voter suppression how bad pretty bad since the original adoption of the united states constitution there have been exactly 17 amendments six of those amendments related to the right to vote expanding it in five cases today republicans have reversed this long standing trend to increase the rights of the american people to participate in elections your one sided republican view is now reversing this trend and trying to take away these hard fought victories notice that the links i posted come from the brennan center it is named for supreme court justice william brennan a republican you can talk about sides all you like but reality says that today republicans are on the wrong side of this issue as does history ,15,conspiracy
flyinghighernow,yes your comment is a distraction we were talking about georgia but since you insist on changing the subject to voter fraud i will jump over to that issue here is a comprehensive study on republican attempts to restrict voting you might think that republicans believe in the voter fraud claims but this study shows something surprising republicans are far more likely to push for voter restrictions in swing states than in red states think about what that means here the study it called a principle or a strategy voter identification laws and partisan competition in the american states http journals sagepub com doi pdf 10 1177 1065912914554039 ,15,conspiracy
flyinghighernow,conspiracy on top of conspiracy welcome to georgia the dirtiest election state in the year 2002 https www electiondefense org georgia 2002 1 similar story in 2017 http vetsforbernie org we may never know whether georgia 6th congressional election stolen https www thomhartmann com bigpicture greg palast gerrymandering voting rights and you are saying what they claim a dhs ip attack if you believe that you might also believe the russia hacking charges as of now i do not believe either ,2,conspiracy
flyinghighernow,the lack of concern by establishment democrats for crosscheck and paperless voting is fascinating why would democrats not be yelling loudly about this why is greg palast and his many years of intense research and investigation generally ignored from what i have seen republicans have been stealing elections regularly since 2002 it is even possible that republicans stole the 2016 democratic primaries since republicans controlled those systems yet democrats do not seem to care very much they would rather blame russia russia chose a side in the 2016 election and promoted it no doubt but the actual stealing of the election was done by republicans ,3,conspiracy
flyinghighernow,so you are one of the fish and chips conspirators ,2,conspiracy
flyinghighernow,i am not a big hot dog fan but i wo not go near those slimy oscar meyers or those rotten smelling boar heads what is a hungry person to do ,2,conspiracy
flyinghighernow,it much worse now you can get 8 hot dogs except oscar meyer which clings onto the old conspiracy but they are not a pound anymore they are only 12 ounces you wind up with a little pencil on a giant bun next time we expose a conspiracy we have to make sure they do not screw us for exposing it i want my 8 hot dog packages by nathans to weigh the full pound ,3,conspiracy
flyinghighernow,that another possibility i really think it would create a mixture of circumstances that could be detrimental to donald trump he cannot very well imply that the deep state is behind it while supporting a crackdown the two do not go together a big terror act on his watch would also punctuate how all the in fighting is crippling government that would not be good either the epidemic method would be far more effective it just sort of happens nobody responsible people become afraid to protest and people want government to save them perfect ,1,conspiracy
flyinghighernow, exactly what net neutrality is no it not republicans are doing two things both harmful first they are handing over censorship and discrimination control to some of the biggest multinationals in the world the telecoms lobby want to end net neutrality so that they can choose which isps to include in their services and so they can favor the speed of transmission of either approved sites or ownership related sites under the big conglomerate umbrella net neutrality would prevent this type of censorship second republicans do not actually mind the more direct and official censorship of free speech by government as they have demonstrated clearly in the past one of the most outrageous examples is the supreme court case of humanitarian law center v holder in that case the six republicans on the court allowed one of the most oppressive and vague anti free speech laws in american history stand the three democrats on the court voted against it this took place within months of the infamous anti free speech citizens united case on june 21 2010 the supreme court held by a 6 to 3 vote that the statute prohibitions on expert advice training service and personnel were not vague and did not violate speech or associational rights as applied to plaintiffs intended activities chief justice roberts wrote for the majority reversing the court of appeals which had ruled for plaintiffs on the vagueness claims and holding that while strict scrutiny apparently applied even support in the form of intangibles like human rights training freed up resources for other illegal uses and that combined with the government interest in denying blacklisted groups legitimacy was sufficient to trump the first amendment interests of the plaintiffs https ccrjustice org holder v humanitarian law project former president jimmy carter criticized the decision arguing that the material support law which is aimed at putting an end to terrorism actually threatens the carter center work and the work of many other peacemaking organizations that must interact directly with groups that have engaged in violence https en wikipedia org wiki holder v humanitarian law project supreme court 6 3 decision against freedom of speech the 6 were all republicans the three democrats voted against it ,2,conspiracy
flyinghighernow,if there was a major terror attack in the united states would that make him look good or bad i would say bad that means i would not expect him or his buddies to commit a false flag attack especially not now the way it going in uk so if there is a staged event it would have to be something different how about a contagious disease break out that would be a great way to get protesters off the streets ,5,conspiracy
flyinghighernow,watch out for these good guy types even though i have been following events for a long time i cannot tell you much about joe biden i remember with great clarity however how he tried to stomp out ted kennedy and let republicans run over the process in the clarence thomas hearings he was the committee chair for that i cannot stand him should he run for president i will make sure i know all the details some good guys that were bad colin powell mr integrity who totally fabricated that kennedy like presentation at the united nations about wmds i knew he was going to cave maddog maddis at his recent confirmation hearing nobody questioned him about his fallujah massacre it times like these that we see the deep state manifest add to the list anyone ,5,conspiracy
flyinghighernow,too many democrats have lost their minds with fear of republicans between the reactionary republicans and the panicked compromised democrats we are in a serious mess ,3,conspiracy
flyinghighernow,this is exactly inline with the establishment parties the big picture here is the oligarchs have been rushing with newly refined technologies to overproduce energy at the expense of the environment and at the expense of long term supplies using vastly improved technology they are doing this specifically to fight economic war against certain nations with russia and venezuela at the top of the list donald trump continues this elitist agenda but what would be expect from a billionaire ,2,conspiracy
flyinghighernow,republicans want to end net neutrality to consolidate the power of their corporate puppeteers but it gets worse republicans also want to censor the internet as it pertains to terrorism they literally want to do both and we are being lied to about both 1 they lie about what net neutrality is 2 then they lie and pretend democrats want to censor the internet but since you may not have heard of 2 here is a huge piece of evidence on june 21 2010 the supreme court held by a 6 to 3 vote that the statute prohibitions on expert advice training service and personnel were not vague and did not violate speech or associational rights as applied to plaintiffs intended activities chief justice roberts wrote for the majority reversing the court of appeals which had ruled for plaintiffs on the vagueness claims and holding that while strict scrutiny apparently applied even support in the form of intangibles like human rights training freed up resources for other illegal uses and that combined with the government interest in denying blacklisted groups legitimacy was sufficient to trump the first amendment interests of the plaintiffs https ccrjustice org holder v humanitarian law project former president jimmy carter criticized the decision arguing that the material support law which is aimed at putting an end to terrorism actually threatens the carter center work and the work of many other peacemaking organizations that must interact directly with groups that have engaged in violence https en wikipedia org wiki holder v humanitarian law project supreme court 6 3 decision against freedom of speech the 6 were all republicans the three democrats voted against it ,9,conspiracy

flyinghighernow,this is what happens in an investigation 1 look at the videos of donald trump at one time admitting he fired james comey to stop investigations of himself and his cohorts 2 apply the rule of evidence that and admission by a party is highly relevant and highly probative and also not considered hearsay and therefore admissible in a case 3 look at the elements of various statutes including obstruction of justice and apply the law to the facts to see if the statements may meet a level of suspicion 4 order documents 5 ask questions under oath 6 look again at the facts found and compare again with the statute then and only then can action be taken first there would an impeachment then a removal then a criminal prosecution that how it works ,3,conspiracy

flyinghighernow,my hypothesis is that a republican operative killed seth rich then pushed a bunch of conspiracies through internet boards it as good and as well evidenced as any other and it is a perfect and simple false flag operation one popular alternative is that an hrc democrat killed him for leaking emails this one has two huge problems from the outset 1 down side there would be no doubt that this would fill the internet to the benefit of republicans exactly what we see 2 with emails already leaked there is no up side further those who are complaining that there is some kind of cover up ought to be wondering why donald trump refuses to pursue this conspiracy on this point the answer is obvious p ,7,conspiracy
flyinghighernow,it could actually be very simple republicans caused 9 11 to happen so they could blame someone else namely osama bi ladin and build an elaborate fake conspiracy around it republicans killed a relatively low level democratic operative so they could blame the democrats and build an elaborate fake conspiracy around it that fits nicely not saying this is the final answer i am only saying that given the current evidence or lack thereof this is as likely as anything else ,1,conspiracy
flyinghighernow,anything is possible really we need to go back to square one let look at the possibilities 1 seth rich was killed by hrc operatives after he leaked information that he may or may not have had access to because because it too late the info already leaked killing him would make republican partisans go crazy on the internet hmmm that does not really work well 2 pretty much the opposite of the above republican operatives killed seth rich to create that illusion 3 russians killed seth rich for helping them out with their trump support hmmm that not how you treat your friends 4 russians killed seth rich because they thought he would turn on them hmmm if he did the leak then he would not likely turn on them and if he did not he would be irrelevant to russians so this one does not work 5 seth rich was killed by someone for a non political purpose i think that 2 or 5 make sense and the other three do not ,0,conspiracy

flyinghighernow, people just loving to be in an echo chamber sure if they are embraced by the far left then they are not not sure p if a site is partisan it is partisan regardless of how people believe they are using it in the end nothing matters to washington examiner or media matters other than electing their people everything they post is for that purpose any use of those sites supports their partisan causes if the left promotes an anti hillary article by washington examiner it is being used as a tool for republican partisans regardless of what is believed same thing for an anti trump story at media matters so i say unless a story is entirely unique and unavailable elsewhere do not become a tool of these partisans rarely do i find a story at a partisan site that is both important and unique ,1,technology
flyinghighernow,you said all those politically right news sources i said use republican partisan sources i say that for the most part the two are the same i am surprised at the extent of your disagreement if you have any examples we can take a look i contend that most of the right sources are exactly republican sources it is time for people to understand exactly what the goals of their sources are republican sources exist only to promote republicans for the next election democratic sources exist only to promote democrats for the next election show me a right source that is not partisan republican then i will show you a crap load of left sources that are clearly not partisan democratic let go ,2,technology
flyinghighernow,good point that sort of fits in with what i was saying when we use republican partisan sources we increase the visibility and credibility of those sources net result republican propaganda dissemination advantage when we use republican partisan sources we replace independent sources that would almost certainly do a better job covering the issue best possible result a partial truth geared specifically toward republican partisan advantage ,1,technology
flyinghighernow,r politics has nearly destroyed anything out of the partisan mainstream under the guise of getting rid of false republican news yes lots of republican news is fake and republican arguments are even worse but censoring most everything that is not democratic partisan actually feeds republicans legitimate conspiracies and derails independent reason this pushes people away from democrats and toward republicans especially on the free speech issue welcome to 2016 ,8,technology
flyinghighernow,on the other hand anonymous writing is a very important way of disseminating information requiring known sources produces an establishment bias while there are plenty of bs sites out there creating partisan outrage with fake stories mostly on the republican side btw the google sweep may reduce those but at what price the price will be the same as at reddit politics sub sanitization of information into a narrow establishment range i would rather see the fake stuff ,2,technology

flyinghighernow,i finally bothered to read this sticky post p it is amazing how adamant the anti speechers are free speech is a concept it exists as a limited right in the constitution presumably because it is a good concept however there is no limiting function in the concept itself and it should be applied as widely as possible if it a good concept for the first amendment it is a good concept everywhere as you pointed out to restate in my words just because something is says nothing about what is right or wrong what should be or should not be when someone argues what is for the sake of it it is likely that the person supports things the way they are some of the arguments made by the anti speecher are the usual discredited items reddit removes xenophobia etc no reddit moderators remove all kinds of things reddit is private property first of all no reddit would not exist without public access routes second a public forum the size of reddit has extraordinary power to block speech its owners do not like this is too much power in exactly the same way that government would have too much power without the first amendment except that reddit cannot arrest people and on it goes the same arguments year after year and some never learn ,5,FreeSpeech
flyinghighernow,i wonder if there is a difference on this issue i know that donald trump has said stuff about edward snowden to support the establishment with an election coming up trashing one candidate against the other when both support the same thing is opportunism i would rather discuss the candidates based upon actual differences for example hillary clinton is likely to get the super pac supreme court case overturned donald trump is likely to make sure that the current tpp is blocked these are real differences ,1,WikiLeaks
flyinghighernow,there seems to be a prevalent view that only hillary clinton supporters are shills this is ridiculous sure we all know that there has been a public announcement that ctr is spending about a million dollars for online trolling that is a lot of money for the purpose and it will go far but let remember a few things 1 super pacs were created by republicans it is no wonder that democrats would engage in the same types of activities 2 ctr guy david brock is a republican turncoat who brought his particular kind of politics of destruction to the democratic party so is arianna huffington btw 3 democratic partisans rather than looking realistically at the current situation would rather just deny and censor those who provide information outside of the narrow mainstream paradigm this is an illness throughout reddit 4 republican partisans do the same thing just look at r conspiracy while everyone is complaining about democratic shills there are two stickies at r conspiracy that are directly the products of republican super pacs if we are going to complain about ctr and we should then we should also complain about those dark money groups like donors trust rather than sticky them edit a little more about 4 back in 2013 exactly three years ago i was in the middle of a major battle for r politics the mods suddenly decided to censor some 44 domains for not being credible it was obvious to me and to many others that the bans favored republicans thus the strong support of theredditpope the overwhelming user base opposed the bans but all they got out of it was a reinstatement of mother jones at that time i had about 2700 post and 5200 comment karma after that battle was lost i left reddit for a long time after the return i now have 15000 post and 5600 comment karma the point being i do not comment much anymore i prefer to submit articles now as it turned out the republicans who banned all the sites they did not like were unable to balance the sub out for republicans but they did accomplish something the sub is now full of conservative partisan democrats ,1,WikiLeaks

flyinghighernow,hi again as you can see i found another article on the subject i hope you like this one better it does not have the conservative commentary but it not nearly as hard hitting either you still trust google to decide which facts are correct i do not i do not and i wo not too many times i have seen official facts being quite wrong important ones too for example to this day it is nearly universally accepted that saddam hussein kicked the inspectors out of iraq leading up to the 2003 iraq war this is plain false and any fact checker should know it yet virtually the entire media left and right continue to promote this ,1,altnewz

flyinghighernow,i just listened to this now and i am wondering who would find this as something negative this is very positive i cannot remember the last time i heard hillary say something so thoughtful and real probably not since the impeachment we can disagree and complain about the particular nuances but this stuff sounds real it is much better than what was going on when the primary got heated overall it a plus for her i heard her infamous deplorables comment edited version about a dozen times before i heard the whole thing while the full version was not good the edited version was well deplorable we should not have to be told that playing a little piece of a speech out of context is a dirty trick and we should not fall for it her key point was the punchline at the end the part edited out anyway now let go to the emails for a second if every charge concerning the emails were true what would it really mean in terms of our lives it is sort of the 2016 equivalent of the 1998 blow job unless you believe everything that government does should be absolutely top secret and there should be no transparency and you believe that her servers were less secure than say the nsa which was hacked recently p these scandals are all distractions especially those involving the clintons which go way way back let try opposing hillary clinton on things that matter rather than absorbing the republican crap ,8,conspiracy

flyinghighernow,sure i will give you everything in your first paragraph the same is true for the other guaranteed income article currently popular standards are not being applied fairly this and that article are both simply current articles to possibly add to our overall information about the subject neither is overarching analysis in fact the other article says the studies indicate one thing then goes on to immediately claim the opposite without any decent support not to mention all that moral talk about why people need to work that not economics at all but the publication is called the economist it like a joke really that article is a joke but this one receives most of the resistance i stand by that economics is a science as per all types of so called science it can be misused and misuse is the norm in the case of economics unfortunately i agree that economics and other so called soft sciences are tricky not because they are unscientific but rather because we can throw in the variables we like or throw out the information we do not like and cheat on the conclusions we who look at economics need to agree on a few things that are about as true as we can determine and form a common basis of conversation unfortunately that rarely happens sometimes the problems with economics in the arguments are so basic that a grade schooler should be able to point them out ,0,Economics

flyinghighernow, oh for fuck sake economics is not about taking sides and making arguments from ideological camps true or at least it should not be it may not be a science economics certainly is a science i respectfully disagree some level of standard for arguments which entail real world feasibility agree here the article in the economist seems to have missed these standards almost entirely that article is a classic propaganda piece by an institution determined to maintain the status quo it is not a philosophy you can argue about endlessly based on your subjective opinions the implication here is i only see sides no actually i am the one who says economics is a science what i do see here is that most economics analysis is sided and if that is the case it is appropriate to present the other side this is nice but now let apply it so many platitudes so little application not everyone who disagrees with you is automatically a republican did not say that i said the subreddit design is based upon a republican partisan organization the point being this sub is already very biased complaints about sources outside of the official bias of r economics are hypocritical krugman has condemned this bothside ism albeit he does it in terms of giving the conservative side an equal weight as liberal on countercyclical policy more platitudes krugman has made it perfectly clear in recent times that he is part of those official sides see sanders over the edge for example regardless of his general reasoning would you agree to giving an equal voice to batshit conservatives on the topic of welfare put it this way if there is equal opportunity to speak conservatives will lose the debate there is not equal opportunity and it is no coincidence that conservatives oppose such a thing and even if you are presenting the argument from another side that does not mean you can appropriate what economists support for your benefit i do not get what you mean here feel free to explain in order to have some authority or credibility behind what you are saying i am not very interested in authority in fact use of authority is precisely my complaint the original highly upvoted comment complained about the source that is a direct implication of authority which i strongly oppose because it violates the rules of logic credibility behind what you are saying what is more credible a team of experts looking to maintain the purest system of unregulated or deregulated capitalism whose analysis almost always ignores the most basic prerequisites of economics and whose associations make huge amounts of money or some guy who believes in minimum income for everyone and looks into it i think the answer is pretty easy this is ridiculous on so many levels what is ridiculous are those who make source complaints in a subreddit whose very theme is one big screaming bias and those who upvote the complaints the article talks to one economist who is an advocate of ubi of fucking course he favors it and nber and the economist of course are against it thank you for providing a comment rather than just adding to the barrage of downvotes edit rather than reply here the above user chose to go to badeconomics and ridicule my earlier phrase that nber is a republican partisan think tank the user linked back to here to create a wave of downvotes then removed the link to avoid what already had occurred whoops are not we honest d interestingly i replied to the ridicule post here https www reddit com r badeconomics comments 4nl2b6 the silver discussion sticky come shoot the shit d45w7p9 with the support for my statement my response was promptly removed now the response is back strange so much drama to distract from the facts and science oh for fuck sake so much for being polite and conversational to someone who starts a comment like that ,-4,Economics
flyinghighernow,have you looked at the custom design of r economics do you know who runs the copied design is that your choice of credibility nber is a republican partisan propaganda think tank now that not credible you know why this article and the other one coming to an opposite conclusion are both doing well because regular users want to see both sides of the discussion and both actual sides not both official sides just because you apparently agree with the one side does not mean people do not want to see both congratulations to our economics community for wanting to learn more about the subject regardless of whether we take a side and which side we take ,-14,Economics

flyinghighernow,that the thing it it well written it good propaganda but there are some flags here to watch out for there is a long history of venezuela factual distortions by mainstream western press in fact this very group has called hugo chavez a dictator in the past that is so far from the truth that this article should not be taken seriously this article was originally published in nber a nonpartisan group funded by conservatives and led by a george w bush official http www sourcewatch org index php national bureau of economic research but what about the article itself there is a temptation for incumbent governments to use media outlets to deliver political propaganda distortion 1 first few words this is an aspect that can be applied to anyone or anything anytime it is not in any way particular to either governments generally nor to venezuela particularly this propaganda can be used by the government among other ways to promote its policies to increase its standing with the population in advance of elections and to criticise opposition leaders and parties reinforcement of the first few words impression of reader governments are evil importance of political propaganda in mobilising support for the nazis invocation of hitler association now we have barely started this article hutu government during the rwandan genocide reinforcement to associate venezuela to being genocidal may lead to moral hazard may respond to such propaganda in a variety of ways may be especially common among the opposition may lead to an increased polarisation the poor disproportionately exposed to and influenced all highly hypothetical designed for some sort of common sense belief system to just buy these ideas discussion of each one could take a few pages in this country hugo chavez and his successor have routinely used cadenas speeches by government officials that are required to be aired live by all broadcast television channels we are to believe that this routine event is enough to brainwash the poor save the poor from the socialistic government does that strike you as a bit ridiculous and how routine is it i also have to ask based on flat out lies concerning venezuela in the past is this even true if so to what extent what other options beside cable and broadcast tv do people have examine short run responses to government propaganda in terms of changes in viewership this critical hypothesis say virtually nothing about the views of people and the idea that more tune out from this channel or that as an indicator of people specific political views is a farce it is interesting that they do not produce aggregate numbers not even of households with cable compared to with only broadcast it is also interesting that there are two types of information news and cadenas this description directly contradicts the article thesis that people become polarised the authors are polarized and i can assure you that the opposition media is no more news than the cadenas maybe that why so many people do not believe the so called news the polarisation is created by people like these authors who flourish upon it so i stand by my point ,1,propaganda

flyinghighernow,very nice article the article makes a compelling case against the bush plan as it should based on the facts i think privatization is reasonably descriptive as these plans send retirement money into private hands and reduce or distort the insurance aspect of the program stock market average returns have been greater than expected for long periods after the introduction of new funds into the market for example in the 1980s deregulation and after the tsp was created these changes produced massive inflows for the markets distorting the benefits of investing in marketable securities so much that the overall average was raised to unsustainable levels these are generational distortions not easily seen in the moment when large numbers of employees are invited into private retirement plans that did not previously exist and with many entitled to matching funds for those accounts it follows naturally and certainly that markets will be pushed upward for a very long time perhaps 30 to 40 years of inflation but at some point in generational time periods an effective equilibrium will come ending the inflation period i think we are there now with that in mind i have to wonder if the original greenspan plan and the 1983 amendments creating the big fund were done precisely to push for privatization in the long run let me know if you find anything on this possibility is 7 percent real a reasonable expectation no while i agree here the mere addition of a new giant source of funds to flow into the stock market will have major effects forcing prices up and fulfilling its own promise until the generational inflow ends too far in the future for current politicians to care or worry about blame just another way of looking at it that you may find interesting ,1,SandersForPresident
flyinghighernow,if i remember the moynihan plan was for partial privatization of ssa that was in approximately 1998 i have been watching ssa since before then clinton then touted the possibility of using the moynihan plan as a template i think the democrats gave up the idea not long after that george w bush certainly supported privatization and the whole idea is republican i recall that around the time of the 2004 election bush literally had a ssa privatization tour to drum up support for sending the money to the stock market but you are the one writing the paper so recheck these things i hope this helps definitely let me see the paper when done ,1,SandersForPresident

flyinghighernow,the right of free speech is to be heard 1 under standard rules of construction a law must have unique meaning and specific purpose 2 under standard rules of construction legal provisions are understood to imply underlying conditions 2 the above rules have been used in every free speech case since the espionage act and most other constitutional decisions 3 the very idea that money speech is based entirely on the right to be heard as courts have explained that money amplifies speech 4 key point if there was no implied right to be heard there would be no argument that money speech in other words the implied right to be heard is required for the citizens united decision so it cannot be denied as a general principle 5 a right to free speech in the shower is no right at all speech is limited in ways that cannot be expanded 1 as the money supply of large conglomerates increases to take up free speech on tv for example it follows necessarily that the speech of others is relatively less 2 as the money supply of large conglomerates increases to take up more speech on anything else radio internet social media billboards etc it follows necessarily that the speech of others is relatively less 3 only so much speech can be seen heard and absorbed regardless of one medium or another the end point speech consumer has absolute limits on the ability to take in the data we only have so much ability to see and hear as corporations spend unlimited money on speech they no doubt take up a greater share of the available space for free speech this leaves others with less of it thus is it not an argument but an undeniable basic state of nature that more speech to corporations gives less speech to others corporations are people when the supreme court uses the bill of rights to protect an entity from legislation it does so because that entity is a person with constitutional rights whether it states so or not key point the people who own the corporation have full constitutional rights at the outset to grant constitutional rights to the corporation itself is to give extra rights to the few people who make the decisions ,1,news
flyinghighernow,we have a supporter of citizens united here there is a right to free speech not a right to be heard are you seriously arguing this the purpose of the right to free speech is to be heard and all citizens united did was allow corporations to buy the right to be heard more if corporations are heard more it necessarily follows that everyone else is heard less it not like suddenly people can absorb more speech there are natural limits on this mainly on old media which is becoming less and less relevant there is nothing in the money speech decision that limits where the money is spent the money has been spent many ways that being said corporations like unions and nonprofits have a separate existence from the people who work or are members of the entity until citizens united this was called the legal fiction a separate existence does not make corporations people with constitutional rights it permits them to do things like sue or be sued why should not the corporation union nonprofit etc not be able to have a right to spend money to get its views across i noticed how you tried to complicate the matter here unions are voluntary people groups member for member with elections and one person one vote representation despite these characteristics the supreme court has let stand restrictions on unions including allowing the members to refuse to pay for electioneering in other words union members as individual people with constitutional rights can allow or deny unions to spend money for political purposes corporations are not democratic the largest property owners decide who runs them there is no voluntary association of people nor is there a check off option to refuse electioneering not to mention the consumers or governments who pay for the corporations products and services the stockholders of corporations are people they have the same constitutional rights as everyone else to give the corporation as an entity constitutional rights is to replace the rights of people with the leveraged rights of those who own or manage the corporation ,3,news

flyinghighernow,right that opening sentence should have been a signal here are some other problems 1 author claims fall of ussr caused the drop in poverty but poverty rates skyrocketed and remain extremely high in exactly those areas 2 un report indicates deliberate community actions to reduce poverty which author fails to note 3 author just happens to be on the board of a margaret thatcher created think tanks 4 graphs showing decline conveniently start at 1990 so we are not given the trend before 5 global inequality says little about the usual effect of wealth inequality in areas a concept understood by adam smith himself and demonstrated in individual nations throughout time 6 author uses china as a great capitalist example is that a joke ,2,todayilearned
flyinghighernow,here the opening sentence you think maybe we are gonna read a propaganda piece the hijacking of oxfam by the politicised left is nothing short of a tragedy this article proves nothing except the bias of its source declines in poverty are not by any stretch of the imagination based on capitalism although most of the hotlinks in the story are misleading or just plain no good the one to the un report actually worked the author here obviously did not use it properly read the report the reductions were not the result of capitalism but rather of community efforts the graphs conveniently timed to supposedly correlate with the fall of communism indicate only one thing an aggregate trend assuming that the selected year actually made a difference in that trend would require some coverage of the period before the author should know this or should not be writing supposedly scholarly articles of course not all of the graphs are times as such those that appear to increase the correlation go on for different periods more convenience capitalism did it rah rah rah now if you start splitting out the various charts by nationalities or by categories or in other ways that can begin to hold a few variable constant a whole different picture emerges most of the time increases in wealth disparities produce more difficult economics for the masses there are a few glaring exceptions that skew the resulting average in the chart also the fall of communism itself produced quite the opposite result http www undp org content dam rbec docs poverty inequality and social policy reform in the former soviet union pdf so the fall of the ussr produced lower poverty rates while poverty rates went up in the most affected areas is that what we are supposed to believe ridiculous maybe we should expect this clever scholarly bias since the author is on the board of the centre for policy studies a group created by margaret thatcher chinese investment in africa is now a major factor in helping africans do things for themselves funny how china is being hailed as a capitalist hero of poverty reduction now to the economics i could write a paper on this suffice it to say for now even back in the days of adam smith people including this father of capitalism knew that profits lead to gross wealth disparities and those changes cause havoc for the overall economy you put up lots of good submissions postnationaism unfortunately not this one d ,2,altnewz

flyinghighernow,actually your situation may be rather complex here some information to consider as you consult an ssa representative and your financial adviser or tax person mother should file for benefits at the latest by age 66 and father should file for benefits at the latest by age 70 no exceptions now to the options for the meantime first let say that the earnings reduction test does not affect mother and father in the year they turn age 66 but see below to maximize retirement benefits over their lifetimes most likely they should both collect benefits as of january of that year the permanent reduction in benefits is so small for collecting a few months early that they would be ahead in total money paid to them for many years to come if an appointment is made in november december or january before they turn age 66 this will all be explained there next they should get those numbers from ssa and bring them to a financial adviser or tax person to check on tax liability then make a decision the january date is based upon the fact that the earnings reduction test typically does not affect retirees in the year they turn 66 and most can collect benefits throughout that year ultimately this depends on three things 1 the earlier in the year of the birth date the more likely full benefits would be payable throughout the year 2 the lower the income from work the more likely full benefits would be payable 3 the ssa appointment must be made before the end of january or they wo not pay anyway as a general rule a person applying for retirement must file on both their own earnings record and the spouse record if the person can file on both in other words mother will file on her own record and will file on father record if he has filed assuming her pia is less than half of his as explained in my earlier comment above you need not be concerned about having a choice here delayed retirement credits despite all of the above delayed retirement credits drcs are also an issue i assume you want to suspend father benefits for this comparing drcs to age 66 benefits is very much like comparing reduced benefits to age 66 benefits i am going to run an example assuming someone turns 66 in 1943 or later but see here for the right numbers http www ssa gov retire2 delayret htm which will hover close to my example numbers let say father was born in 1943 or later that his normal amount or pia see my comment above is 2000 and that his drc benefit is 24 percent more or 2480 at age 70 if he takes benefits at age 66 he will receive 2000 per month for 48 months or 96 000 before age 70 he will be locked in at this amount for good if he waits he loses that 96 000 but gets 480 more per month after age 70 he starts out way behind it takes time for him to recapture this lost 96k the amount of time it takes may be calculated 200 months 96 000 initial loss 2480 2000 monthly gain 200 months is nearly 17 years add to this the initial 4 years of waiting a person fitting my assumptions will wait nearly 21 years from age 66 to see so much as a dime of increased benefits for waiting this is called the break even period this is why i say over and over again for most people take benefits as early as possible drcs transfer to widows now you have to gamble on how long they will live if father waits until age 70 and both pass away within the 21 years from age 66 they lost the bet if one or both survive they start to see the 480 per month in aggregate additional benefits again this is without considering taxes which may reduce that 21 year period i did all of this so that you will not go in assuming father benefits will be suspended that is a mistake many people make even those well schooled in finance and accounting spouse working for spouse here another wrinkle for you that could affect collecting benefits in january if income has been around or below 40 000 in recent years http www ssa gov oact cola rtea html you are done with this issue however a corporate officer or self employed person may not be able to collect benefits or may only collect partial benefits until age 66 where earnings have been above 40 000 in recent years this rule would apply to both parents from here it gets messy i will just add this any period of suspended benefits in the early part of the year in which they turn 66 will be reviewed and permanent monthly benefit amounts will increase accordingly filing in january may still be beneficial even if some months of benefits are suspended ,1,SocialSecurity

flyinghighernow,to look at your questions slightly out of order question 1 where a woman who is not working is under full retirement age and her husband is collecting benefits she too should file for her own and her spousal benefits if she does not file all of this money is forever lost regardless of who passes away first unless both partners live past the current dollar break even point which is approximately when she is 77 and he may be even older this is not even considering inflation which pushes the break even date out further this also assumes no taxability on benefits question 3 when a woman files for her own retirement benefits she will be required to file also for spousal benefits if she is eligible to file widows benefits will not be affected by this question 2 the primary insurance amount pia is the benefit that a person would receive if he or she collects ssa at exactly normal retirement age nra currently 66 before adjustments for age let say he has a pia of 1900 her maximum spousal benefit would be reduced to half that amount or 950 now let say her own pia from her work is 650 the 650 is reduced according to retirement factors 25 while the additional 300 is reduced by the greater spousal reduction factors 30 the two reduced pieces are added back together and that becomes her benefit amount let say that he passes away after she turns full retirement age or when she has reached an age where her widow benefit it maximized as a recipient of spousal benefits she automatically switches to his benefit when social security is notified this is the easy case now to the difficult part if he passes away before she reaches the age where she would be entitled to his full amount then her widows benefit may be less than his was in this case she does not switch automatically she must elect either to take a reduced amount or to suspend benefits until the monthly amount is maximized at the same benefit he was receiving presently this is usually age 66 ssa will explain options to her if the situation arises question 5 it is described here age 62 through the month before fra when the nh dies an application is not necessary if the spouse is also entitled to a retirement insurance benefit rib or disability insurance benefit dib a certificate of election ssa 4111 is required to receive reduced benefits pending receipt of the certificate the spouse is converted and placed in suspense s 9 status so that he she can be identified at fra if the widow er does not elect reduced benefits he she will be identified at fra and awarded benefits source https secure ssa gov poms nsf lnx 0300207005 this means she may stop receiving the spousal portion of her benefit until she elects to end the suspension or when monthly widows benefits are maximized her benefit is reduced now in return she gets a larger benefit later while you have to run the exact numbers be sure to consider the fact that money is worth more now than in the future additional points the above applies only to the exact facts provided in my comment and no more the woman is not now and will not be working or earnings reductions may apply if his benefit is reduced her benefit on his account will reach the maximum before she reaches full retirement age through the rib lim provision this unlikely scenario would only make it more urgent for her to file early i cannot speak to question 4 ,1,SocialSecurity

flyinghighernow,this is a very nice summary but it is entirely one sided you covered one of the most contentious and controversial supreme court decisions in history without seriously noting that controversy exists as if everyone should agree with it for example you quoted from both the majority and the concurrence but not the dissent the concurrence was specifically answering the dissent to include its answer without the arguments it was countering is to leave out a critical portion of the case the dissent said in an unusually scathing opinion that the five justices did not like the case presented before them so they changed the case the wsj article that you cited is entitled new study counters assumptions about impact of citizens united this is an editorial and opinion piece designed to sway people to a certain viewpoint in other words it is the very example of bias hopefully it is generally known that wsj supports the views of large businesses and i do not need to run through daily examples now to the study itself that the wsj was touting we find that while independent expenditures increased in both treated and control states between 2006 and 2010 the increase was more than twice as large in the treated states in other words the decision in citizens united did in fact produce more spending finally we observe that the increase in spending after citizens united was not the product of fewer larger expenditures as many scholars and pundits predicted and we note that people were just as likely to make smaller expenditures less than 400 after citizens united as they were before this is a strawman rather than focusing on the fact that there was more corporate spending in the states where citizens united overturned laws the author focuses on two other things 1 the pundits were wrong 2 small donations did not cease these pundit predictions and continuation of smaller donations are not even relevant to the double sized increase by corporate and large donors are we that easily confused the claims of wsj and the professor are essentially the same types of minimization of effect that we saw with the tobacco companies a key point of wsj is to convince people that this decision really is not that important do not worry we have bigger problems the fact that they are making this argument implies as a precursor that there is an argument on the other side you did not cover it you should have the oyez summary is missing the controversy in fact the supreme court changed the question presented in the case it was not the ngo citizens united that requested overturning the law it was the supreme court thus the fact you claim is plain wrong as noted above this was covered in the dissent it is also of note that the majority recognized that the media does not represent popular views i am going to assume that your attempt to present this objectively was honest so i have a question for you to think about if it was four years after dred scott or after plessy v ferguson would you present those cases without controversy if your answer is no you may want to make some changes here thank you ,1,politics

flyinghighernow,if you do not mind i would like to help out with this inquisition a financial deregulation bill was passed in the early 1980s under the reagan administration lifting many restrictions on the activities of savings and loan associations which had previously been limited primarily to the home loan market the result was an orgy of speculation profiteering and outright plundering of assets culminating in collapse and the biggest financial bailout in us history costing the federal government more than 500 billion the repetition of such events in the much larger banking and securities markets would be beyond the scope of any federal bailout this is a prediction at the time of the deregulation http www wsws org en articles 1999 11 bank n01 html the article covers the details those still asking questions are 15 years behind ,1,Economics

flyinghighernow,although this article says not much has changed i found something quite stunning in 2004 it was reported that share of economy going to wages and salaries drops for unprecedented 14th straight quarter http www cbpp org cms index cfm fa view id 1345 and was down from over half of gdp to 45 percent of gdp this article states taxable payroll the wages and self employment income up to social security s taxable maximum currently 117 000 a year represents slightly over one third of gdp question why is the percentage of national income subject to oasdi taxes decreasing ,1,Economics
flyinghighernow,obviously it not based on economics inflation comes after new money enters the economy and inflation only takes a percentage of such income therefore the effect of inflation would not and could not negate the increased spending power of the population generally rather this new money in circulation would increase the need for jobs and more people would be able to find work it a win win ,1,worldpolitics

flyinghighernow,it happens i still do not see the disagreement the supreme court role was simply to decide whether that law was constitutional true and that what we are talking about i could say plenty about those who would pass the first ever general anti lying statute but i had better not alito and those who joined with him disagreed about the level of first amendment protection true again those three would have reduced protection the first amendment to permit the first ever general anti lying statute to stand so the only potential disagreement left is do you think that the dissent in stolen valor would have upheld the first ever general anti lying statute ,-1,law

flyinghighernow,well yes it is and thank you for the response i am almost tempted to edit my comment now but i think i will leave it for posterity this idea that plain old lying can be criminalized by an act of congress is so antithetical to basic american ideals that a little childish term a term made notorious by the leader of the free world with little criticism at the time should not so totally negate the basic point that it overbalances the comment into would ownvotedom what is more important that i used a george w bush term or that these three were willing to make lying a federal crime and why does the response which misunderstood my point get upvoted i supposed that if i disagreed with the characterization of a comment i might indicate that and still be able to agree with the point made in fact i have done that i normally do ,0,law

flyinghighernow,now i have some material to work with whatever you think about the idea of government it is distinct from what you see if you look at the establishment no doubt the government is entirely corrupt the government is controlled for the most part by large international businesses who do themselves favors elites infiltrate take over and discredit the government to maximize short term benefits in the long run those businesses now conglomerated like never before want to would rown government in the bathtub why because as corrupt and self serving as they made the system today they still prefer to get government out of the way once that is done there is no chance of reform they will rule everything of course there will always be uprisings to deal with but those can be localized as they arise this is especially true when the same people who own the banks energy companies and weapons factories also own the bulk of media therefore i disagree with this idea that you are forced to minimalize government even if in principle a government could do things better first government actually does some good in maintaining freedom and societal order despite the overwhelming corruption we do not necessarily notice this because it is status quo and i dare say diminishing over time we notice where it is reduced in those cases shock doctrine applies and business organizations rush to claim that the very problem created by something like deregulation is a result of insufficient deregulation the corporate media makes sure this view prevails as antithetical to reality as it is second the existence of potential for a principle to become reality that government would take heed of needs of the people is better than a system where such potential does not exist essentially getting government out of the way is giving in to a permanent corporate hegemony blindness and deafness of computer users first i look at these computer security issues frequently and i find out later time and again that my security has been compromised people can do much better than the relative ambivalence we see today but many of the tricks adobe and others use are very hard to spot even when looking for them second there are times when i need to lower my security to uncomfortable levels just to fully exist in society even where i do not want to do it i have little choice but then adobe is clearly basically breaking into other parts of the operation of the computer perhaps it should be seen as intentional software tresspass this is a great idea nice to end on an agreement ,2,altnewz

flyinghighernow,let me help this economics novice out with a few answers jefferson city mo lawmakers in many states have been trying to boost their post recession economies by cutting income taxes curbing aid to the long term jobless or holding down the minimum wage some have pursued all of these steps whether such policies will spur businesses to expand as hoped isn t yet clear cutting income taxes in some cases where there is a tax cut stimulus directed at the workers or poor there may be a marginal affect to boost the economy where tax cuts for the rich come at the expense of large government deficits the increased disposable income to those who already have idle money sitting around does nothing at all to boost the economy where government borrowing increases those very same recipients of the tax cuts gain another benefit they turn from owing government a fair share to investing in government debt and profiting a second time upon their own tax cuts this of course inevitably means austerity cuts in services or increased taxes on all that last feature is quite interesting essentially tax cuts means tax increases curbing aid to the long term jobless since typically most people who are jobless are receiving lower income than they would usually expect cutting aid to these folks will reduce their spending significantly producing a multiplier effect throughout the economy making it harder to find jobs which then reduces spending more cutting back more jobs cutting spending cutting aid cut cut cut result economic disaster holding down the minimum wage if by holding down the author means not increasing this is a real wage decrease over time as inflation is almost ever present in the economy this refusal to maintain real wages reduces spending power and purchases over time which see analysis above the multiplier effect so the answer to this whether such policies will spur businesses to expand as hoped is it is very clearly harmful the article does eventually and weakly cover some issues but not well ,1,Alec

flyinghighernow,nearly all the time it does those rare instances when it does not the assumptions are stated general economic assumptions should be presented in the first class particularly elements or macroeconomics these apply from then on ,3,Economics
flyinghighernow, because they do not want to end up training a bunch of red flag waving revolutionaries exactly economics assumes a private market to say marx really really really is not that influential within economics is to report on the choice of those who set the curriculum marx is not influential because marx is ignored the austrian school is at least mentioned how does this rebranding and tweeking of thomas say 200 year old discredited thesis rate while marx does not in a word bias and not the bias the tv would tell you the exact opposite bias ,3,Economics

flyinghighernow,true krugman is now the old establishment you know those days when the us economy was pumping over five percent growth a year in the 50 and 60 and into the 70 in those days economics was more of a science and they actually used it in official circles to help make policy decisions theories by keynes were seriously considered since then these normative reactionaries have gained legitimacy by throwing large amounts of money around and how the economy been doing since 1980 the fact that krugman whose economics is typically very limited to old time mainstream theories is now seen as a shill for the left indicates just how far away famous economics figures have come from any science ,5,Economics
flyinghighernow,this is an excellent article but the main point is hidden in the very last paragraph intentionally or not this new system has eroded the power of the official parties that have rigidly controlled modern politics for decades by doling out or withholding pork barrel spending earmarks and campaign cash suddenly party leaders have none of the former to offer the result of symbolic belt tightening reforms and far less of the latter than big donors operating outside the party system the result the one obama lamented on that rainy day in washington state is the privatization of a system that we d always thought of as public it amounts to the takeover hostile or not of american politics by the ultra rich i strongly support this analysis it is good to see it on a popular site as i put it over a year ago http www reddit com r politics comments 1729ak im congressman jim mcgovern and i just introduced c8wswa7 now corporations can run campaigns for candidates independently just fine without handing the money off to candidates or parties in fact this supposed restriction more accurately empowers corporations to take nearly total control over electioneering ,2,altnewz

flyinghighernow,maybe that true but what is the logical solution to this terrible problem 60 minutes so boldly points out smaller government and more contracts do you think it is an accident that 60 minutes does this expose that both reduces public confidence in government and implies more government contracts i would say no the controlling owners of 60 minutes just happen to be banks and fund companies that also own military contractors and oil companies ahh deregulation one giant conglomerate check yahoo finance and you will see there are about 40 companies that together control just about every large public corporation ,2,technology

flyinghighernow, for the past few weeks the big question on everyone s mind when it comes to the crisis in ukraine has been whether vladimir putin would be willing to send russian troops across the border to annex territory but at the moment it appears that he really has no need to in other words the corporate propaganda that russia is the bad actor in this situation and that russia is against self determination here is utterly false but some already knew that operations around the city now appear to have ceased the illegitimate coup government cannot win even using its state military against the majority ,2,altnewz

flyinghighernow,there are so many things that the alternative press appears to hide or fails to cover it is maddening presently my main push has been to expose the 1992 defense planning guidance as it pertains to the ukraine situation my history is full of mentions i have not once ever heard the alternative press cover it in present context nobody knows about it back in the 90 it was known as the wolfowitz doctrine and nuclear pre emption today it is completely gone ,4,altnewz
flyinghighernow,i forgot to say i agree with you entirely about exposing usaid i know that over the years i have read many articles about it and commented here too i am sure this article is not necessary to expose it there must be others my first thought is to check globalresearch ca or wsws org selecting articles that criticize without all the personal vendetta and name calling stuff is not elf censoring there must be more important things going on in this world then this guy outing the evils of glenn and amy with baby name calling i would rather have someone go up to amy goodman as happened in the past politely hand her a copy of the movie loose change then after she says she will watch it pointing out to her that this is the third time now that she said that make her feel the pressure and force her to finally do a segment on the 9 11 attacks that worked ,3,altnewz
flyinghighernow,to make positive change we must attain power conservatives attain power two ways 1 leveraging money and putting out propaganda through their holdings 2 supporting each other absolutely and unequivocally even where there are differences or even where they do not trust each other unless and until a the political environment is such that someone has to be sacrificed as just occurred with that the negro comment or b enough power has been attained by the more reactionary elements that relative moderates can be rolled over as we saw after the 2010 elections i do not support this 2 b strategy to the extent conservatives use it some criticism is always needed but that not what we see here amy goodman and glenn greenwald do some fine work and they have some power relative to this other guy to attack them in such a total and personal way at this time given the cohesiveness of conservatives can only undermine efforts for positive change rather the author should be pushing amy goodman further not trying to destroy her i actually find this article interesting too i even agree with some of it call me a rubbernecker but i would not provide link juice to such a thing by posting it here enough fighting please stop ,2,altnewz

flyinghighernow,rarely do i see a wikipedia article that is such blatant propaganda please look at the 16 references that should be enough to see what bs this is you may want to protest the accuracy or quality of this article and get it changed the correct term is regulated free market as compared with laissez faire regulated free market means capitalism with regulation and competition laissez faire means capitalism without regulation the term regulated free market was created specifically to describe a viable private property production alternative to the fatal flaws in laissez faire unregulated capitalism which were described right at teh beginning by the father of capitalism himself adam smith famous debates occurred some 200 years ago between thomas saye and thomas malthus a regulated free market is a system of private ownership of production with competition or regulation the word free in the term means that buyers and sellers are free to make economic choices without fraud or coercion and with choices the formula regulated free market capitalism competition or regulation in other words capitalism is merely a component of the so called free market along came the chicago school milton friedman and others wanted to revert back to the long discredited supply side view of thomas saye to do this they had to create new simplified meanings or confusion of terms they bypassed academia to promote this notion directly to the general public of a free market where free meant the freedom of property owners to do whatever they wanted with the property this was such a thorough distortion that academia did not take it seriously meanwhile the idea gained traction in the general public and these people gradually snuck it into academia according to the friedmanites free market capitalism laissez faire according to the friedmanites regulation controlled economy socialism hopefully we all know that regulation socialism but milton friedman said they are the same he even said taxation is socialism they confused and equalized all the terms making discussion of this issue extremely difficult ,55,news

flyinghighernow,questions are there quality differences between regulations or are they all the same does the number of new rules and regulations adequately explain total rules and regulations where is the other side of this situation why leave it out why is the period where the number of new rules and regulations being issued each year was brought under control the one with the worst post world war ii growth rates to date according to the census bureau why did growth rates increase in the 90 why did growth rates fall through the floor in the 00 considering that the amount of new rules and regulations issued each year was largely stable why has the economy improved albeit slightly since the financial crisis of 2008 which saw new rules and regulations issued by the federal government spike in that year ,1,altnewz
flyinghighernow,this year versus last year did the economy go bad this year how was it last year hey how has the economy been since late 1980 when jimmy carter kicked off getting government out of the way by deregulating the banks what has been the regulatory and enforcement trend for the past 34 years what has been the economic trend ,2,altnewz

flyinghighernow,if you really thought that you would have graciously accepted my first polite clarification and that would have been that but no do not try to snow me again after all this back and forth i see that you are all about supporting this growing income inequality in your own words this is not an indicator of the economy so much as it is a description of a typical career that says it all deny deny do not pretend that you are some kind of noble headline clarity police to answer my ignored questions for you no income inequality does not concern you you like it ,2,altnewz
flyinghighernow,perhaps we have ever been in a capitalistic model but the closer we get to the so called free market the worse the outcome ,2,altnewz
flyinghighernow,question are you just determined to be right or are you actively trying to sidestep the basic point which is incomes for most people are on the decline who said anything about labor force this is a graph of the population not a labor force graph ,3,altnewz
flyinghighernow,i am sorry i was wrong about this because you are in a different group you are more likely to make more okay i agree you almost snowed me the evidence to support my other points was presented in your link except for the fact that more people are in poverty today than ten years ago that i hope is common knowledge let take a closer look at your link a median 20 year old household in 2004 who earned about 34k is now 30 and makes 52k more a median 30 year old household in 2004 who earned about 55k is now 40 and makes 64k more a median 40 year old household in 2004 who earned about 69k is now 50 and makes 66k less a median 50 year old household in 2004 who earned about 74k is now 60 and makes 58k less a median 60 year old household in 2004 who earned about 62k is now 70 and makes 34k less so we have two mores and three lesses looks like your entire point was wrong now about this increasing inequality does it concern you do you see that the continuing 14 year trend of declining median incomes will eventually push most people down to earning less ,3,altnewz
flyinghighernow,i got that actually it a silly idea because you are in a different group you are more likely to make more okay i agree but it is neither probable nor given current trends will it remain that way in fact we are already seeing that statement less true than it used to be with more in poverty and some groups moving into older groups and still risking lower income so i will still go with the headline over your view ,3,altnewz
flyinghighernow,this is more incorrect than the headline even with income stagnation you are probably making more than you were ten years ago the headline is lazy but makes the point that income is declining your point essentially denies declining income it is therefore entirely incorrect poverty rose this means overall income dropped regardless of age http www cbpp org cms index cfm fa view id 2914 you may be earning more or you may be earning less but many are earning less perhaps more are earning more note not probably but median dwellers are earning less than they would have been without this declining income trend the very chart you presented shows the same thing look carefully at the lines they cross in places some of the current age group makes less now than the age group they were in years ago your correction does more harm to the facts than good ,5,altnewz
flyinghighernow,if you really believed that you would have accepted my criticism of your correction and taken it as a clarification instead you dug in the article is more correct than you are what does that say about your credibility on this issue more importantly what does it say about trends in income and wealth distribution over time ,5,altnewz
flyinghighernow,that a very nice seeming technical or theoretical criticism but it is more misleading than the than the original assertion take your criticism a step further given your criticism a more accurate headline would be you are probably making 10 percent less than you would be today or you are probably making 10 percent less than someone in your position 10 years ago the 10 percent less part is still true either way why try to undermine it ,4,altnewz

flyinghighernow,so i did not go back far enough there are four most basic mathematical operations addition subtraction multiplication and division addition means you add things together subtraction means you take away things the other two will be convered in the next lesson the term regulated free market was created by economics scientists in the late 1800s like alfred marshall to describe the system upon which the rules of economics were built and to synthesize the adam smith system the term was scientific and not controversial in the 1950s a group of pure capitalists came along with a program to bypass academia and sell selected adam smith quotes to the public to legitimize anti competitive business combinations with milton friedman as the face of this new school their term not mine they subtracted the word regulated from the term completely reversing its meaning and essentially co opting the field of economics in the public consciousness the result you ,0,technology
flyinghighernow,laws of economics are based on a series of conditions that must exist for the laws to apply 1 no single producer has any control at all over market price 2 no single consumer has any control at all over market price 3 parties to transactions always act in their best financial interests 4 competition exists such that goods or services are entirely fungible 5 parties to transactions have perfect information about all relevant factors of the deal and of course the free market formula regulated free market capitalism competition or regulation ,-2,technology
flyinghighernow,did you want me to spend a long time deconstructing each of your assertions considering how completely ridiculous they are and considering that you apparently do not know the word regulated was dropped from the term by the propagandists who invented your pseudo intellectual babble that would be a waste of good time instead let start at the beginning here an equation for you regulated free market capitalism regulation or competition does that mean anything to you ,0,technology
flyinghighernow,that changing today corporate darling google is falling fast i see it everywhere in the past two years or so i remember when this happened to other companies before the fan boys are always the last to realize what happened and the first to say i told you so ,2,technology
flyinghighernow,you need to go all the way back to adam smith and realize that your propaganda was discredited long before it was even invented basic rule going all the way back to adam smith a regulated free market requires regulation note the word regulated in there that is the correct term it means something very specific ,0,technology
flyinghighernow,it is bad very bad the effects of few token efforts against things that the people oppose cannot possibly balance out the overwhelming efforts and spending that goes against the people in fact the reason these issues exist at all is they were seeded by that very form of lobbying who are we pawns in the middle maybe some large corporation self interest will coincide with the people a tiny fraction of the time no thank you i oppose all corporate lobbying and certainly all money speech rules ,10,technology
flyinghighernow,who made the system that way google buddies at the american legislative exchange council which google now actively funds google is guilty as sin ,1,technology
flyinghighernow,google is the company that pioneered and legitimized the official policy of no human service sure others would try to avoid providing service but google brought it out of the closet for that alone google may be the most evil company yet i hope you can think of better alternatives seems that every other company competing with google has not felt the need to hoard billions of dollars while boastfully denying human service ,-6,technology
flyinghighernow,but there the paradox according to the laws of economics a regulated free market can only exist with guess what regulation the more government does its job to regulate business what you called more power government has over business the more business interferes with governance you see what is happening here possible answer a total separation of business from governance and a new bill of rights that the people can apply directly against business i read the original microsoft statement of fact by the judge that came with the decision microsoft was acting governmental regulating the market to maintain its power examples 1 threatening intel that if intel were to build an operating system it would never see windows on its system paraphrased 2 actually denying windows to ibm for not ending its os2 operating system ,-2,technology

flyinghighernow,the fact that you need a far right site to push for the impeachment of obama indicates just how conservative the so called liberal press and most of the alternative media is no thank you there are good sites out there when i want to find valid reasons to impeach obama i will go to an authentic alternative site such as http lawanddisorder org category impeachment a quick search of the internet indicated exactly zero articles from reason com pushing for impeachment of bush if anyone can find one please post it ,2,altnewz
flyinghighernow,and as we know from prior studies the more they watch tv the less they know about most things ,1,altnewz
flyinghighernow,here some truth for you by threatening a bloodbath the far right regime in kiev revealed the blatant hypocrisy and double standards in the us and european union orchestrated regime change operation in ukraine just weeks after using neo fascist forces as shock troops in overthrowing the elected government of president viktor yanukovych claiming yanukovych had lost his legitimacy by deploying security forces to attack anti government demonstrators the unelected western installed regime declared its intent to massacre people opposing the coup ,2,altnewz
flyinghighernow,seems like a pr stunt to me maybe they do not fully trust facebook to pay the powell tithe to the chamber of commerce meanwhile people are taking seriously the merger prospect of time warner and america most evil company officially anyway but i can find slightly worse comcast ,1,altnewz
flyinghighernow,i read this the other day how to fight the fascist offensive in venezuela http venezuelanalysis com analysis 10592 i must have forgotten to post it this seems like a good place ,2,altnewz
flyinghighernow,you have to understand why a great site like media matters would be banned because it is the other side of the approved corporate media website and provides analysis of those sources it that simple it has nothing to do with rehosting in fact any site that is critical of corporate press could be accused of either rehosting or of putting up unverified information one or the other always applies it the nature media analysis this sub is entirely partisan and biased censoring anything outside of the corporate view ,1,politics
flyinghighernow,right that exactly why the name was changed so someone on an internet forum could complicate the matter and confuse people by saying things like but it not blackwater they are no longer a company ,3,altnewz
flyinghighernow,there is a tendency for folks to try to ridicule any claims of us or corporate involvement in stirring things up or creating black operations around the world based on the real world it is time for this tendency to be reversed the ridicule should be pointed at those who deny such involvement out of hand since big bankers were caught red handed fixing the libor the old conspiracy theory about bankers has finally been proven true still we have these shock troops rushing to ridicule reality every chance they get by the way many of these denialists are paid it all part of the true conspiracies all around us there plenty of verified information about this too ,3,altnewz

flyinghighernow,this is an interesting idea i am concerned that it is more a matter of form over substance it also appears to be regulatory in nature and unconstitutional under citizens united electoral reform is a particularly difficult issue while money regulations help to slow or reduce the lopsidedness of election influence they cannot cure it drastic measures need to be taken here are some ideas in no particular order 1 break up the interconnectedness of large corporations and limit companies to areas and lines of business that make macroeconomic sense in other words regulate according to the actual laws of economics as opposed to the normative economics that the tv actors promote 2 provide proportional governmental support or funding permission to potential candidates relative to popularity at various times reducing the field as the election becomes near 3 demand television coverage of candidates 4 instant run off voting systems 5 approval voting systems or 6 throw out house elections entirely and use the science of statistics to attain a random sample from the population then use house membership as a pool of candidates for higher office statistical methods will tell you that the best representation is not through elections ,1,altnewz
flyinghighernow,i was referring to the proposed rule in the above comment that limited the time period for electioneering the citizens united case dealt with a rule where electioneering was limited in a certain time period the court jumped right over that restriction and made it unconstitutional on much broader bases while the case time rule was a converse of what is proposed it was the same idea limiting or restricting electioneering speech in time if the first amendment protects free speech for an electioneering movie and blocks banning of it during the election period then the first amendment would also protect free speech for electioneering outside the election season it a time limit on free speech either way the five justices would have no problem making this analogy i actively support a constitutional amendment join us https movetoamend org on the income tax issue here some information for you http incometaxcases blogspot com ,1,altnewz
flyinghighernow,this is exactly why we have punitive damages punitive damages make these types of calculations of bodies versus profits much less certain and this is why the multinational corporate types support tort reform ,3,altnewz
flyinghighernow,it is a good idea but precisely citizens united would make that rule unconstitutional so the commenter above you cannot both support citizens united and that idea citizens united went to the supreme court asking it to declare the fec ruling that hillary the movie was an electioneering movie overturned strangely the court found that is was an electioneering movie but then went much further overturning statutes and case laws that went back up to 100 years normally we call that judicial activism ,1,altnewz
