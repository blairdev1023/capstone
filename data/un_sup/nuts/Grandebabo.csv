Grandebabo,i have to say i disagree he is redpilling more people than we could imagine he say stupid shit all the time and looks like a complete hypocrite i absolutely love the damage they are doing to themselves trump 2020 maga ,1,The_Donald
Grandebabo,yes this is actually what happened it looks like they bought multiple properties at once for rentals not to get into the weeds of this but this is how it works say that you buy a rental property you can sell your old rental property and do what is called a 1031 exchange so what you do is you buy multiple properties to the purchase price of the old rental you can purchase multiple rental properties for the amount that you sold the old rental property for this makes it possible for you to avoid the income taxes because it was reinvestment into the equivalent amount of rental property value it is very common and people do it all the time ,38,The_Donald
Grandebabo,that is plausible too however i think that she was probably a one person arming she had a political axe to grind the fbi or the cia used fake report to out her that report was too juicy for her to pass up and she had access to it ,1,The_Donald

Grandebabo,no they are not try there is something going on with the climate but this change in the climate is a short term hypothesis we have had this hockey stick incline in the last decade or so however the last two years the global temperatures have actually fell the real question is it man made or not the world oceans by themselves produce 97 of the carbon footprint on the planet all the people on this planet only make up 1 3 of that carbon footprint that where problem is scientist climatologist and statisticians frankly do not have enough data to make that call to say that people are the cause of global warming is a fallacy also there has been instances of cherry picking data to suit the narrative think about it if you were a climatologist getting big money to perpetuate a narrative would not you tweak the data in your favor to guarantee your job and livelihood i am talking big money but let say just for the sake of argument that climate change is real and we have had an actual increase in global temperatures in the last decade or so let even say that the carbon footprint has increased to 3 by man made means but we already know that is not true we have actually decreased our carbon footprint over the last decade globally so if it is not man made what makes us think we can reverse this when it is a planetary thing that is causing global warming frankly this is out of the control of man the earth is the earth and it will do what it does no matter what we do that why i like to call them global warming exaggerators they are exaggerating the data to perpetuate a fallacy without enough data for a complete hypothesis the only thing these countries are trying to do is fleece the united states we get the short end of the stick every single time if they were serious about it they would have a binding accord treaty for all countries to abide by if they were really serious about it they would condemn and punish the major polluters of the world and they do not if it were true these countries would be fighting like they were the last ape getting on the ark and it is starting to rain and they are not that tells me global warming is not a clear and present danger ,1,The_Donald

Grandebabo,exactly up vote are never considered a barrage consider how president trump controls the media it not about good or bad news about him it about controlling the narrative bad media is just as good as good media the point is continually being their heads so when people see this at the front page every day it constantly in their frontal lobe this is part of a long term strategy turning people in the election of 2020 also we must always be considered the underdog we must always fighting as if we are never in the lead when we considered ourselves in the lead we will become complacent hillary clinton campaign remind you of anything they were complacent because they were thinking they were winning frankly the best thing that ever happened to the donald is when we were banned from the front page why is this we are now considered the victims in a lot of people eyes because we cannot voice our opinions fairly and equally with the rest of reddit everybody loves an underdog everybody cheers for the victim to vanquish the powerful the left has no idea the damage they are doing to themselves all this anti free speech and the antifa in berkeley has the same outcome ,3,The_Donald

Grandebabo,who would have the most motivation and benefit from a mass cultural and societal shift in a predominately caucasian white christian society the amount of interest groups is mind boggling muslims outnumber christians 2 1 globally that one massive interest group also those that will profit in a globalist society the idea of globalism and not nationalism is that there are just a few bureaucrats that control the entire world the united nations is exactly a globalist organization the interest groups and lobbyists of the un in is incredible which brings me to agenda 21 https en m wikipedia org wiki agenda 21 agenda 21 is a non binding voluntarily implemented action plan of the united nations with regard to sustainable development sounds pretty innocuous right well i would ask you to watch this https youtu be 1t 62uxbmbm i think it interesting that you bring up culture in the military and for people to hold onto their culture while serving in the military i could not agree more i have a lot of experience working with many cultures and our us military we all need to hold on to our culture and is important to be proud of each and every one of our cultures just as our society and societies that we build cannot be undermined by globalist this also extends to our culture i do not know if you have ever heard of cross cultural competencies but it is an idea that the military practices as we go into countries and help or rebuild them that we do not change their culture and their societal structure many great books on this subject japan is in a population decline they decided not to taking immigrants to prop up their economy they have chosen to wither away and die then to take immigrants into the country they did this so that they can hold onto their culture and their society that they built for over 2 000 years it is that important to them but nobody is calling them racist or any other bigoted name because they have chosen to do this it odd how this is selective across the world and you can find many other countries cultures and societies that are not ridicule like the united states is my question is why is the united states so criticized when they hold on to any type of nationalist belief this is probably the number one reason why i voted for donald trump we need to hold onto our culture and our society unapologetically this society that we have built over many generations this is our country yes we are a melting pot but people arrive here legally need to assimilate to our culture society beliefs and values as donald trump said when people come here to our country we want people that love us not hate us ,2,The_Donald

Grandebabo,does this mean that sarah silverman understand what it like to live in poverty now according to bernie sanders white people do not know what it like to live in poverty to live poor so now that sarah silverman is black she understands the plight of the black men and women that a paradox ,1,The_Donald

Grandebabo,that what gave you the thought was the complete iron of this ,1,The_Donald
Grandebabo,you have to realize that this production was done pre election netflix bank the shit ton of money on it to make it happen thinking it would still fly because they thought their girl hillary was going to make it so what does netflix do instead of wasting a bunch of money they put it out there they are dumbasses ,1,The_Donald
Grandebabo,yeah that is real good i have been working on my mene magic as well ,1,The_Donald
Grandebabo,all this shit was in the works before the election all these post productions that we are seeing now after election are shit that going on that they thought would continue with the arrival of a president hillary clinton they banked a bunch of money on it hoping it going to fucking float and it does not because they have lost the same can be said about all the commercials we saw during the super bowl all those were produced pre election that whole mtv bullshit that was done before the election as well all these dumbasses thought they had the pulse of the people but in the words of president trump wrong ,2,The_Donald

Grandebabo,i do not think you understand the hypocrisy in your own statement so since she is a comedian and it is satire you are basically giving her a license to do this kind of thing but not to anybody else do you see the hypocrisy in this now but while you are digesting this it is wrong to do it regardless of who you are and what you do for a living she is a gigantic piece of shit and everybody knows it just two weeks ago she calling for a military coup against the government what kind of bullshit is that she can go fuck off ,6,The_Donald

Grandebabo,yes personal debt student loan debt sits at 1 4 trillion secured debt this surpasses anything else out there that is personal debt credit card debt is about 1 trillion dollars unsecured debt mortgage debt is a 14 trillion secured debt the medium individual debt is 56 000 that a shit ton of debt dodd frank is the biggest policy that needs to go down after the financial crisis of 2008 the knee jerk reaction was to have all banks have liquidity sitting around doing nothing so that banks could back themselves up in the case of a run on the banks without recognizes that not all banks are the same investment banks need to have their money invested into different entities to make money ie stocks bonds treasuries you name it commercial banks that gives you that car loan and home loan needs to have the liquidity on hand in case there is a run on the bank but these dumbasses when they made the law did not recognize the difference but this is why the federal reserve was set many years ago so that no banks had to sit on a large amount of liquidity all the time this is why overnight rates with banks was set up with the federal reserve to borrow money as needed this is why glass steagall needs to be reinstated to define the difference in banks the glass steagall act prohibits commercial banks from engaging in the investment business this is all that is needed and dodd frank need to be shit canned if this happens which i think it will get ready for a massive influx of liquidity into the banking system and also liquidity for businesses to grow this will translate into higher wages better employment more jobs and a course a better stock market with greater economic stability this will help with the massive fluctuations in the market that makes my stomach turn ,1,The_Donald
Grandebabo,i could not agree more with all your sentiment here unless you were an investor you did not do well under the obama economy financial and real estate investment management is what i do the obama economy was great people like me but my family and most of my friends suffered under the obama economy stagnant wages loss of value in their homes under employment for their skill set education debt with no job to compensate for the cost just to name a few of the major issues sure the unemployment rate was at 4 7 but nobody ever talks about the u6 rate which is at 9 7 or the quality of jobs that were created which are mostly service related jobs in retail which are crap for wages obamacare is force companies to only hire employees to 36 hours a week so they do not have to pay the penalty or cost of healthcare for their employees how ridiculous is that also with quantitative easing of money and the lowering of interest rates to prop up this economy is just a bubble waiting to happen the only way out of this is pure growth in the economy trump and economic advisers recognize this but when your growth rate is less than 3 gdp something has to give this economy needs to least have a 4 gdp just getting rid of the stupid regulations will get us to 4 gdp which president trump has gotten rid of a shit ton in the past two weeks already our economy is the world economy when we hurt the world hurts when we improve the world improves the world recognizes that if we do not produce they do not produce the america first policy is going to help the world ,1,The_Donald

Grandebabo,well i guess mexico is being protectionist then duty rates in mexico vary from 0 to 140 4 with the average duty rate at 13 97 some products can be imported free of duty eg laptops and other electronic products mexico operates a simplified regime for postal and courier imports a global tax of 16 on the cif value applies to imports by post where the fob value ie product value excluding shipping and insurance cost is between us 300 and us 1000 imports by courier where the fob value is between us 50 and us 1000 https www dutycalculator com country guides import duty taxes when importing into mexico ,1,AdviceAnimals
Grandebabo,you are exactly right in the example of mexico that 60 billion 60 billion of goods that are not manufactured in united states that is not sent to another country could you imagine the number of jobs in the amount of income that would be produced or the taxation that could be reaped from this kind of money it a lot ,1,AdviceAnimals
Grandebabo,as i stated it is like a tax it a tax if you will is what i said no it is not a tax but it is a cost to the american people when you have a 60 billion dollar deficit in trade to another country it is a cost that is absorbed by the people that lose that economic income ,1,AdviceAnimals
Grandebabo,you are absolutely right we are both mutually dependent upon each other if one hurts the other does as well however they depend upon us more expecially for grocery items food if you will here another thing with the strength of the dollar and the weak peso it basically all equals out anyway with a strong dollar and a weak paso that means we will pay less for products coming in from mexico but we all have to understand this is the opening salvo of a negotiation by our president do you really think he wants to put a 20 tariff on all goods coming from mexico probably not but he will if he has to he knows it going to hurt american people as well we are negotiating people so here it is he going to ask the president of mexico to either pay 20 billion for the wall or 20 tariffs on goods coming to united states that 20 billion dollars is chump change to a 20 tariff on 300 billion which equals to 60 billion dollars annually ,3,AdviceAnimals

Grandebabo,mexico is currently our 3rd largest goods trading partner with 531 billion in total two way goods trade during 2015 goods exports totaled 236 billion goods imports totaled 295 billion the america goods trade deficit with mexico was 58 billion in 2015 this is an unseen tax if you will that we are already paying in the united states so the real question is do we want to pay a 20 tariff on all good coming into united states to pay for the wall or do we want to continue paying 60 billion dollars in a trade deficit this is what happens with economies when a product cost more then you are willing to pay people will seek a suitable substitute let take the corona beer for example if you like corona and you drink corona and now it cost 20 more to do so do you continue drinking corona or do you find a suitable substitute that cost less looks like i am drinking 30a beach blond ale made in grayton beach florida or maybe a landshark here another thing with the strength of the dollar and the weak peso it basically all equals out anyway with a strong dollar and a weak paso that means we will pay less for products coming in from mexico but we all have to understand this is the opening salvo of a negotiation by our president do you really think he wants to put a 20 tariff on all goods coming from mexico probably not but he will if he has to we are negotiating people so here it is he going to ask the president of mexico to either pay 20 billion for the wall or 20 tariffs on goods coming to united states that 20 billion dollars is chump change to a 20 tariff on 300 billion which equals to 60 billion dollars annually ,2,The_Donald

Grandebabo,i lived in italy for 8 years and the taxes are incredibly high between vat tax gas tax income tax property tax registration and taxation on your vehicles also to include all the other fees and charges from banks to include account tax it is remarkable how italians can have any type of decent lifestyle and go on vacation in august i do not know what it is now but when i live there after all the taxation you would basically pay the government the first seven months of the year your income approximately 65 of your total income goes to taxes that is insane ,2,The_Donald

Grandebabo,if we vote by popular vote in this country i think the democrats would be crying foul every election here why in many states that are red people will not show up to vote and i use myself in this example this is the first election that i voted in since 1992 and voted for ross perot in oh the reason i did not vote since is because i lived in states that were traditionally red states i knew that my vote did not matter this year i voted in florida because i moved here a few years ago i knew my vote mattered in large states like new york and california i think many republicans do not come out and vote for the mere fact that they know their vote does not count and it will not matter if we had a true populist vote believe that the right would win every election and the left would never win another one again this argument could be true in the case of blue states and democrat voters as well but i do not think so so why would the democrats cry foul every election they would be very angry when the states of alabama mississippi louisiana georgia tennessee kentucky oklahoma missouri texas utah montana arizona s carolina n carolina idaho n dakota s dakota nebraska and w virgina are dictating policy to their liberal enclave this point is made in this article by slate it states the electoral college requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal no region south northeast etc has enough electoral votes to elect a president so a solid regional favorite such as romney was in the south has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win this is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president the residents of the other regions are likely to feel disfranchised to feel that their votes do not count that the new president will have no regard for their interests that he really isn t their president and on that note i am signing their petition ,1,The_Donald
