LeSpiceWeasel,there no gripe to be had one vote is not worth more than another one reason for a vote is not more valuable than another because our reasons for voting are entirely subjective such is life in a free society nobody but you gets to decide your criteria for voting we do not have to like it but god damn do we have to respect it if you are the kind of person who does not like it i suggest you get out there are start trying to change people minds as for me i quite enjoy a vast cross section of humanity being treated as equals regardless of status race religion whatever we are all just one vote where you gonna find a fairer deal than that and because of that we as a people will nothing more or less than what we deserve ,0,QuotesPorn

LeSpiceWeasel,one a third does not need to win the presidency congress and your state legislature is more important two third party candidates have won before with more or less the exact same system arguably the greatest president we ever had teddy roosevelt was neither a republican nor a democrat three the point of voting is not to win it vote for the best representative ,1,QuotesPorn

LeSpiceWeasel,i hate how often i have to remind people of this the lesser of two evils is still evil making a deal with the devil has only worked out well for one person so unless you are a fiddle player named johnny it time to start voting for good your vote is the best chance you have to let your voice be heard to give that up in service of evil is god damn insanity also watch how fast fptp disappears once democrats or republicans start losing elections ,-5,QuotesPorn

LeSpiceWeasel,it an overstatement granted but certainly not a vast one the vast majority of the mentally ill in this country lack the resources to help it that just a socioeconomic fact gay people have gotten lynched so do the mentally ill and homeless on top of that it estimated that between 25 and 50 percent of people killed by police have mental illnesses that 4 8 thousand people and that just the police the amount of gay people killed in this country does not even come close to the low end of that then you factor in higher suicide rates higher population there really is no comparison compared to a homeless mentally ill person a middle class gay guy gets treated like a king ,3,QuotesPorn
LeSpiceWeasel,that does not mean you are not trying to cram some stupid bullshit about vegans being persecuted into a conversation where it has no place thus demonstrating why most people fucking hate vegans ,2,QuotesPorn

LeSpiceWeasel,the mentally ill are swept under the rug if they are lucky mental hospitals are understaffed and underfunded across the board programs to help the mentally ill are the same the biggest portion of the homeless are mentally ill people and cities will literally just bus them to another city and make it their problem there are far more mentally ill people in this country than gay people and every goddamn one of them gets treated worse than gay people gay people just get the press because you do not have to get your hands dirty to help gay people you just need a bumper sticker and a some glaad rhetoric and you are set some middle class gay people cannot get a cake and it national news meanwhile thousands of mentally ill people are killed by police every year and even more die alone starving or in pain on the streets ,15,QuotesPorn

LeSpiceWeasel,is not the entire idea behind sanctuary cities supporting illegal immigration those cities actively refuse to comply with the law in favor of allowing illegal immigrants to live there edit he downvoted me and deleted his comment so i guess i am right ,-1,neoliberal
LeSpiceWeasel,those lines are not arbitrary millions and millions of people throughout history died for those lines fighting for and against them you do not have to like the idea of national sovereignty but do not pretend it arbitrary ,-3,neoliberal
LeSpiceWeasel,maybe they are we will probably never know we have heavily manipulated markets and ludicrous anti consumer trade agreements everywhere on the planet right now we literally have entire multinational agencies set up to manipulate that markets let me know when we actually get a free market though right now you are arguing in favor of crony capitalism with a side of oligarchy ,-11,neoliberal
LeSpiceWeasel,if you are quick you can run outside and catch the point you missed ,-4,neoliberal
LeSpiceWeasel,nobody needs you here you do not have to respond to my comments go find another hole to whine about how it not perfect ,-2,neoliberal
LeSpiceWeasel,that does not mean i have to like it you fuckwit ,0,neoliberal
LeSpiceWeasel,gullible about what hating censorship yeah real fucking gullible you were wrong and dumb suck it up nancy ,0,neoliberal
LeSpiceWeasel,yeah i am totally easily manipulated because i hate circlejerks and censorship but what if i am not the type of fucking idiot that gets my political opinions from places like reddit you would not be on reddit on a niche politics sub pretending you know anything about strangers since you are that type of fucking idiot your question is irrelevant though here comes the part where you pretend im a trump supporter and you blindly hate me for that lie because reddit told you to but still pretend i am being manipulated ,0,neoliberal
LeSpiceWeasel,the right to not have the admins put words in your mouth you troglodyte considering you are wrongly pretending i am a trump supporter you would not understand that point so kindly fuck off ,1,neoliberal
LeSpiceWeasel,motherfucker stop going out of your way to miss the point you are wasting both of our time ,5,neoliberal
LeSpiceWeasel,sorry i did not realize you missed the context the rights of us as users of this site no reasonable person would accuse them of violating the constitution ,2,neoliberal
LeSpiceWeasel,generally speaking i like reddit i just think u spez is a piece of shit who should be fired and for the admins to not actively censor people because they do not like their chosen oligarch it almost like there room for improvement and i want that to happen but no you are right we should run away from problems that always makes things better ,2,neoliberal
LeSpiceWeasel,cannot win em all although i would take bombing a couple of jokes over 50 whining pseudo liberal children telling me how much i apparently love trump because i hate circlejerks and censorship ,-1,neoliberal
LeSpiceWeasel,the announcement made by u spez the guy who got caught editing posts in the trump subreddit for his own amusement shitting on the basic rights of all users of this site and then did not get punished for it and now he spends his time suspending accounts of people who bring it up you have to be fucking kidding right now oh wait you unironically brought up the fact that reddit actively censors pro trump bullshit man what the fuck ,4,neoliberal
LeSpiceWeasel,came out almost 5 years ago before valve huge shift into vr and that was really the last game they put out dota technically came out after in 2013 but considering it had been holding million dollar tournaments since 2011 while in beta i do not count that ,-1,leagueoflegends
LeSpiceWeasel,ha memes i get it ,-3,neoliberal
LeSpiceWeasel,that cute you are wrong so you edit your posts to say completely different shit so you do not look like the idiot that you are pathetic to the fucking nth degree ,1,leagueoflegends
LeSpiceWeasel,i would be surprised if anyone in this sub tried to explain anything instead i get jackasses like you acting like even the most basic criticism of a company is somehow personally offensive to you when valve is shitty it gets posted on the dota subreddit when ea is shitty it gets posted on the sims subreddit when blizzard is shitty it gets posted on the hearthstone subreddit who the fuck are you to think your game is special do not answer that i do not care you are not that interesting ,-3,leagueoflegends
LeSpiceWeasel, i really do not see why you would think blizzard is destroying valve i did not say that i said blizzard is destroying riot and valve is not doing anything the dota team is the only part of valve that gives a fuck and they have no real power so it irrelevant valve is not in the business of competing with game makers they are in the business of selling other people games trying to push vr and selling hats for their old shit ,-3,leagueoflegends
LeSpiceWeasel,valves is privately owned so we only have estimates but most analysts estimate it at around 4 billion blizzard is publicly traded so that information is freely available 4 6 billion in revenue in 2015 http www annualreports com hosteddata annualreports pdf nasdaq atvi 2015 pdf ,0,leagueoflegends
LeSpiceWeasel,first of all blizzard annual revenue is more than valve total company worth you are aware that valve is not in the business of making games any more right blizzard will destroy is destroying their market share valve is not doing shit except putting out hats and steam sales ,-5,leagueoflegends
LeSpiceWeasel,that kinda the point they were more than happy to let tencent money in when things were good now that it getting bad let not waste time playing the we cannot blame them for their owners game yes we can they chose their owners you can totally blame people companies for their choices ,-15,leagueoflegends
LeSpiceWeasel,i did not post it anywhere if you think that relevant you go post it there ,-11,leagueoflegends
LeSpiceWeasel, i mean why do this to dota and not overwatch who much more of a direct competitor because riot cannot touch blizzard seriously there is not a goddamn thing they could do without looking petty and sad for losing their korean playerbase and that before you consider that blizzard legal team is probably worth more than league itself ,-15,leagueoflegends
LeSpiceWeasel, furthermore do not see any reason to indict riot or league of legends for tencent failings they are the ones paying to support tencent failings you cannot be in bed with them when things are good then try to hide when things are bad without people noticing and putting 2 and 2 together ,-16,leagueoflegends
LeSpiceWeasel,thank god you were here to explain it to him it would really be a dick move to say it obvious to someone who admits they do not understand but then refuse to elaborate on why it obvious wait ,13,comics
LeSpiceWeasel,sadly it too late for you to walk away since you could not stop yourself from making a dumbass comment oh well maybe you will do better next time ,2,neoliberal
LeSpiceWeasel,oh god you are breaking out the memes i am in trouble now ,-1,neoliberal
LeSpiceWeasel,in addition to poor reading comprehension you do not know what a tantrum is kindly piss off ,-2,neoliberal
LeSpiceWeasel,you came here from r all yes maybe give what i wrote a second read whether or not you subscribe now is completely irrelevant to my point and to me ,-1,neoliberal
LeSpiceWeasel,you are 10lbs of stupid in a 5lb bag ,-6,neoliberal
LeSpiceWeasel,impossible no just like it not impossible for you to put a basketball hoop in your ass probable fuck no ,-7,neoliberal
LeSpiceWeasel,disagree with me on what that reddit blatantly pushes anti trump bullshit circlejerkery to the front page you have fun disagreeing with reality here the part where you look stupid for thinking i voted for that jackass showing your blind hate ,-14,neoliberal
LeSpiceWeasel,you do not know what a dictator is ,14,neoliberal
LeSpiceWeasel,1400 subscribers to this sub this post has 700 upvotes and it showing up on r all reddit is so fucking painfully determined to push trump hate circlejerk it getting fucking gross edit idiots from both sides attacking me for saying reddit does is bullshit meanwhile this got more upvotes than this subreddit has subscribers but hey as long as they are manipulative in the direction you like it fine right gross edit 2 yup keep telling me how much i someone who exclusively votes third party loves trump you dumbasses you are totally not proving my point about the trump hate circlejerk or anything ,-9,neoliberal
LeSpiceWeasel,that some prime r iamverysmart material not only do you completely miss the fact that you are being mocked you somehow relate it to your super edgy religion hate i can see your fedora from here ,3,pics
LeSpiceWeasel,that the point a cop being good at his job is not newsworthy just like how when you or i are good at our job it not newsworthy when someone who walks around armed on the taxpayer dime fucks up it worth taking a look ,2,news
LeSpiceWeasel,good for you do you understand that what you care about does not matter to the rest of the world do you understand that someone engagement picture is not the time for talking about their weight do you understand that some people do not have the same priorities as you ,6,pics
LeSpiceWeasel,in this case it just playing the odds ,6,pics
LeSpiceWeasel,it shallow to care more about someone waistline than whether or not you love them ,4,pics
LeSpiceWeasel, u nanoakron wets the bed and likes putting donkey kong cartridges in his ass those are all facts but they are not really the point here now are they see the issue ,6,pics
LeSpiceWeasel,you should be downvoted not only is it not the fucking time to be talking about his weight it none of your business if someone random stranger waistline is so important to you that you have to comment on it you need to get a fucking life pretending you care while telling him he a fat bastard is the height of disingenuous you prick edit always love it when someone is a prick then cares so much about their internet points that they have to hide it u krehlmar is a coward,45,pics
LeSpiceWeasel,the first one might be but the second is definitely not newsworthy you do not deserve praise for doing your job to the expected standard ,3,news
LeSpiceWeasel,because the bad things end up with people dead what is more important that the police shot an innocent or that the police wrote a bunch of tickets to people who deserved it they are supposed to do good shit just doing your job is not newsworthy ,31,news
LeSpiceWeasel,get in the fuckin car ron,17,SquaredCircle
