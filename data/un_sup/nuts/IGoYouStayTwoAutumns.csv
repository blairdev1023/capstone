IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,i would say it 98 photos 2 text and that being generous to text a few years ago i was knocking it out of the park on dating sites with the long eloquent block of text several paragraphs i had attached to my dating profile women would routinely open me with wow i loved what you wrote here etc nowadays the long text profile just comes off as desperate and needy instead it all about writing two or three sentences tops and you better make sure those sentences are light hearted flippant and essentially meaningless professional parallel parker froyo baseball is life etc we are definitely moving into a post literate society a la neal stephenson the diamond age reminds me of the time recently when a friend of mine put up an ad online looking for a bookkeeper personal assistant and all the women who applied for the job did so with no i do not have a written resume here my instagram instead no joke they thought the photos they would taken of themselves over the past few years were a good and proper substitute for a written work resume enjoy the decline etc etc ,2,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,true i was big into okc and match several years ago past few years though the entire market has shifted women are not really on dating sites anymore they are on dating apps and i doubt they will ever go back the funniest thing about all this i remember when tinder first came out everyone was like this will never work it just a picture how can you go on a date with someone without at least reading a bit about them first i laughed and was like nah women do not care for them it all looks anyway they never read profile text they are gonna love this of course my observation was met with oh so much scorn from all the women in my life girls who were like noooo we like to read we are readers we women need a deep heartfelt connection with a guy and that comes through in what and how he writes on his profile not just his pics and then sure enough about 10 seconds later they all hopped on tinder matched themselves with the top 2 of men going by their pics alone and never looked back ,27,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns, if women and i enjoyed sex the most if i treated them as i perceived it like worthless pieces of fuckmeat then something must have been wrong absolutely women want to be treated like worthless pieces of fuckmeat if you do not treat them that way it a disservice to you both and furthermore if you cannot manage to give them what they want and need the fuckmeat treatment they will go and find someone who will instantly and then tell you all about it over lunch that you are buying the very next day insert cringe inducing flashbacks to my blue pill past here took me a while to get this place of non caring but now that i am here i have realized that for women this is actually how you show that you care by not caring talk about paradox still i cannot unsee what i have seen now and i am never going back ,24,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,this post the goldmund field report not rollo analysis of it reads like red pill porn sure maybe it happened that way kind of sort of maybe it possible it also possible there a pink elephant standing outside my building right now but i am not betting on it i do not know what is been going on lately but every trp field report reads like it was written by a beta imagining what it like to be an alpha and yet clearly has little to no actual field experience out in the real world arena of the modern day sexual marketplace yes people do bang women in the bathrooms of clubs bars wherever and yes it can and often does happen just a few minutes after you meet the girl i have done it myself i have been that guy more than once back in my party days thing is that field report that not how it happens that whole snatch the beta guy girl and then go bang her in the bathroom fantasy it not the smooth perfect process this guy is making it out to be the reality is when it happens you are drunk wasted she drunk wasted you are like come here she like ok she follows you to the bathroom you try to fuck her in the stall it weird awkward embarrassing and honestly just totally ridiculous you do not know if you should be laughing or what often you the guy cannot even come because the position is all fucked up the girl totally checked out again wasted you fumble around for a bit someone starts pounding on the door after 2 minutes like dude hurry up maybe someone has an orgasm usually the guy when he finally just pulls out and gets himself off finishing on the girl lower back or thigh or whatever and that it you straighten yourself up and rejoin the party upstairs thinking with extreme crystal clarity post orgasm well that was a fucking waste of my 5 minutes oh and i really hope i did not just contract herpes aids or whatever the fuck else from this bar slut that a few minutes ago i thought was a solid 8 but now that i just came i am realizing is more like a soft 6 probably a 5 without makeup and here i am not even talking about using coke to lure the girl into the bathroom in the first place probably the most common way to do it and then of course when the guy all coked out he usually cannot get it up and then no one gets laid that how it is gents that the real version of your bar bathroom bang fantasy warts and all yeah they can be fun sometimes i guess but these field reports with the oh so perfectly smooth guy who honestly has some of the most cringe worthy one liners i have ever read seriously everyone let give it a rest i would much rather read the field report in which you are vulnerable honest and true and in which you share what actually happened rather than the porn magazine fantasy of what you wish happened as you are trying to convince a bunch of anonymous readers on the internet how oh so alpha you are certainly we will all learn far more from the former than the latter my two cents for the day ,1,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,yeah i am not sure what her my fiancee exact genetic background was honestly i always thought the whole thing was stupid like you were born and raised in baltimore so that makes you american no that would be like me going around shouting about my mixed euro heritage i am irish i am german i am dutch etc etc when of course i was born and raised in southern california and as for the muslim thing yeah given that she did not pray 5 times a day did not go to any religious services did not know anything about the koran and was a huge drinker to boot an alcoholic actually i brought her into sobriety and given that last i checked drinking alcohol is absolutely forbidden by islam really her whole thing was basically a sham like the ultimate escape hatch an ejector seat that enabled her to bail from any relationship at any time if need be i gave it a chance but he was not muslim like me so in the end i had to run etc i think everyone is always somehow someone alpha fucks and at the same time someone else beta bucks a point that does not get emphasized nearly enough on trp indian girls may go for white guys as the af and then settle for bb indian guys but then i know plenty of white girls that go for black guys as the af and then settle for bb white guys especially out here in hollywood and hell my neighbor a good looking outgoing indian guy is actually one of the most amazing pick up artists i have ever seen the dude is like the michael jordan of gaming chicks he been dating a swedish model for a few years now picked her up off the street with a cold daygame approach he lives with her she rich she supports him and pays for everything he still fucks tons of girls on the side and is very blatant about it she puts up with it all because he the af and that pretty much it i always laugh when i see the trp posts about indian guys being at a disadvantage in the smp i am like dudes you should really come out to la and meet my friend trust me if he can do it anyone can do it but yeah i am with you with on the indian chicks man there way too much crazy going on there too much cultural baggage life too short to put up with that shit ,1,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,yeah almost all plates tend to drop before the 6 month mark that seems to be the upper ceiling and that being generous most plates in my experience do not make it past 2 months maybe 3 if you are really on fire it not your smv hike it up all you want wo not matter it more just the simple fact that women these days are being assaulted from all sides day game night game social circle game and especially social media online game by super chads every second of every day and no matter how awesome you are you have to recognize that while you might be the flavor of the week or month if you have really got your shit together there are just too many new untried flavors constantly lining up behind you so eventually you get bumped back a few rows and then a few more rows and then ultimately you are let go as the newer chads come to the front i think if more men on this sub spent just a few minutes watching the main screen of an attractive woman unlocked phone and seeing the waterfall of compliments praise adulation and worship rolling in every second from the beta males coupled with the straight up wyd hook up texts from the alphas they would be shocked and appalled at the absolutely incredible historically unprecedented myriad of sexual options your typical woman has these days and we are talking about maybe a moderately attractive woman in a mid sized town here when you have an extremely attractive woman in a major city forget it it over so yeah enjoy her while you have her but when she gone let her go only way to do it ,1,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,yeah the fats really help in general when cutting paradoxically you have to put fat in to take fat out they are great for getting you to the feeling of being full quickly and keeping you there for hours cheese nuts avocado all lifesavers on a low carb diet also helps to get your daily calorie count up as well you do not want to go too low cal when cutting as you will be tired lose the ability to concentrate have mood swings etc too many people fail on low carb diets because they do not get enough fat in so the daily calorie count is too low so they feel like they are starving which they are and back onto the carbs and sweets they go shove that fat in however and you will actually have to remind yourself to eat later in the day my fave goto chipotle chicken salad add guac tides me over all afternoon ,3,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,agreed though i think the diet has to come first as someone who lost a lot of weight several years ago my experience was that when it comes to total body recomp ie looking good naked it about 90 diet and 10 exercise get em eating clean and low carb and then get them into the gym and they will be shocked by how rapidly they progress ,3,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,just turned 41 yesterday currently in the best shape of my life never looked better and i am still continuing to improve with each passing year day really when i was in my mid 20s partying up a storm everyone always told me i looked older like mid 30s now that i am in my early 40s and have been clean and sober for almost 7 years everyone tells me i look like i am in my late 20s maybe early 30s tops clean living will absolutely take at least a decade off your appearance try the following minimize the booze cut it down to a few drinks a week or cut it out completely no cigarettes of course occasional pot smoking may be ok but watch it no other drugs coke etc coke is extremely dangerous after 40 by the way friend of mine in his early 40s just died of a coke induced heart attack a few weeks ago do not do it clean up your diet no carbs it all about chicken beef fish eggs green veggies low carb paleo basically with a little bit of nuts cheese and avocado for fat if need be avoid bread rice potatoes pasta cereal fruit sugar hit the gym and lift hard and heavy 3 times a week do your best to get out and be active in general go on hikes hit the beach anytime you have an opportunity to get out and about particularly in a social setting with friends do it if it involves a beautiful spot in nature all the better if you do all this live clean diet well lift hard and get out of the house on a regular basis i am telling you you will have a huge sexual marketplace advantage over other people who do not share the same commitment particularly as you enter middle age the difference between you and the guys who do not do this will be absolutely astonishing you will feel like a rock star just standing next to other men around your age your looks will radically improve the years will drop off you will have more energy than ever before women will be far more attracted to you obviously social engagements will be easier dating will be easier everything will be easier better 40s is not the end man if you clean up your life and make a commitment to healthy living it only just the beginning ,20,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,i just glanced at the other comments in the thread as far as i can tell nobody here is saying they got out of the friend zone hell i have been a regular reader of trp for 3 years now i honestly cannot think of a single post or comment where the guy was like yeah i radically hiked my smv and wow in her eyes i went from beta to alpha she completely changed her mind about me and then we had sex although that would make a pretty funny youtube bit come to think of it as i mentioned in another recent comment of mine go ahead and hike your smv all you want she will never change her mind about you ever once a beta always a beta as far as a woman concerned in girl world there is no possibility of improvement no moving up and down the ladder how you are born is how you are and always will be there are only natural alphas and that pretty much it like i said though i will give you the 1 chance actually it less than that but let just say 1 to keep it easy that when she polarizes you she puts you into the alpha bucket and not the beta bucket great go ahead make a move she will respond in the positive and you are all good but then in that case you were never in the friend zone to begin with you were in the fuck zone all along and just did not know it and she was waiting for you to make a move to get things started but yeah the real reality is women either fuck guys right away or not at all if you have not fucked her by hour 15 chalk it up as a learning experience and move onto the next girl do not waste your time trying to hike your smv hoping she will finally come around and change her mind about you she wo not ,2,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,woujo i am a huge fan of your writing have really enjoyed a lot of your recent posts however i am gonna be a little critical of this one for the following very simple reason there is never ever ever any way out of the friend zone ever under any circumstances ever women polarize men into one of two buckets alpha fucks or beta bucks very very quickly sometimes it happens in a few seconds sometimes a few minutes at the most several hours with 15 hours acting as the absolute ceiling if you have spent more than 15 hours with a woman she has already polarized you into either the alpha fucks or the beta bucks bucket and there is nothing and i mean nothing you can do about it 99 of the time she polarized you into the beta bucks category the nice guy the beta provider simply because well obviously an alpha warrior would not wait for sex he walks up and takes what he wants when he wants to without asking for permission he certainly does not operate on someone else schedule least of all a woman if you are waiting for anything at all you are not alpha you are beta therefore in her eyes you are not worthy of sex but there are occasional and i mean very occasional exceptions to this rule a good looking rich cool celebrity who has spent more than 15 hours with a woman for instance will likely be polarized into the alpha fucks bucket he can hang out with her for a few hours every week for a year and at the end of the year he can say all right i am bored wanna fuck and of course the girl will say sure with stars in her eyes and that will be that point is after 15 hours you have been assigned a category most likely beta and you can never shake this label never no matter what you do for the rest of your life of course when you first realize this it can seem like a terrifying prospect this notion of oh shit i better really watch what i say and or do in those first few hours lest i botch it up and not have enough time to recover before i get tossed into the wrong beta bucket but honestly once you really internalize this it becomes remarkably freeing because then you realize if you have spent more than 15 hours with a woman and she already polarized you and there nothing you can do to change things then nothing else matters at that point so feel free to escalate all you like you will instantly be rewarded with sex or instantly be denied forevermore but that will be that at least then you will know and can move on or enjoy your new plate accordingly here the thing though when testing the waters and attempting to determine which bucket you have been placed in like i said it 99 chance of friend zone but i will give you the 1 chance of her rating you as an alpha just for the hell of it do not under any circumstances verbally ask her sooo what do you think about you and me together you must physically escalate with her slowly casually elegantly effortlessly or it will not work even if you were in the alpha bucket beforehand you will instantly be switched to the beta bucket if you try to verbally rather than physically escalate this is the only set of circumstances in which bucket switching can occur when she realizes you were a false alpha all along and updates her view of you accordingly so here it is gents wanna get out of the friend zone take her hand and hold it for a few seconds that it or if you are sitting next to her at a bar rest your hand on her leg brush her upper arm with your fingertips you know the drill physical not verbal escalation if you are in the alpha bucket and she was just waiting for you to make a move then she will instantly respond in the affirmative and you will get laid a few minutes later if you are in the beta bucket 99 chance she will shudder recoil things will not go well she will give you the i do not see you that way i need more time let just be friends speech at which point you must cut her out of your life forever because there is nothing absolutely nothing you can do to make her attracted to you at that point the decision has been made the imprint has been set in stone and it will never ever ever change no matter what i apologize for all the never ever evers but man i really want to drive this fucking point home as has been said many times on here the best way to avoid the friend zone is to not allow yourself to be put there in the first place and if you slip up and find yourself there accidentally remove yourself by cutting that woman out of your life entirely you can be friends with women despite what many on this sub would have you believe but not with women you are sexually attracted to do not do it guys life too short ,4,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns, deep in their hind brains what they are really worried about is being fooled by the false alpha that exactly it god forbid they get impregnated by the false alpha the beta and then give birth to beta babies that really would be the end of everything ,1,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,the idea that a man can actually get better at something is absolutely terrifying to women simply because they cannot afford to accidently become impregnated by a beta male masquerading as an alpha if the real alpha finds out she will be kicked out of the tribe starve and die in girl world there are only natural alphas and natural betas it all genes your starting position is also your finishing position whatever you appear to be within the first few seconds of her meeting you that when the imprint happens and that how she will see you forever after go ahead and start a rock band cure cancer save the world does not matter as far as girls are concerned once a beta always a beta for them it all about getting access to those natural alpha genes several years ago i had a female friend that at the time i thought i was very much in love with classic one itis hung out for a few months i finally broached the why are not we together question she deflected with well i am going back to england soon why do not we see where we are at when i return in a few months i figured great here my chance to really show her how awesome i can be i hit the gym hard dieted even harder lost a ton of weight like 60 pounds in those few months put on a ton of muscle to boot that took a bit longer and when i finally saw her again almost a full year later her return to nyc was delayed a bit instead of her being thrilled with my radical body transformation she was like oh yeah hey you look great she said it exactly like i would just gotten a haircut that she did not approve of at all and yet was too polite to say anything about it to my face needless to say we hung out once and after i discovered she would been fucking a norwegian pick up artist for the entire preceding year picked her up right off the street with a daygame approach and in nyc no less so she would kept him a secret all that time i was taking her out while he was fucking her for free on the side i quickly cut her out of my life looking back that whole episode was classic trp 101 but yeah learn the lesson and learn it well no matter how much you improve if you look like a beta when you meet her she will always think of you as a beta after that forever and ever and ever nothing you can do nothing will ever ever change that seriously i saw pics of the guy this girl was with and i was like what the fuck i am actually much better looking than he is now but of course from her perspective she sees my awesome new body that i worked on hard for a full fucking year to the exclusion of almost all else and she thinking why is this beta pretending to be an alpha why is this sheep wearing a wolf costume you should always be improving for yourself absolutely but if you are improving your life in any way your body your money your status whatever in order to impress a woman forget it gents her decision about you was already made hint it a no and nothing you do will ever ever change that all you can do is cut her out continuing improving and start over later with a new girl and a clean slate this is one of those things that i really wish was sidebar material so much newbie angst could be avoided if we drilled this in hard right up front ,15,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,i agree with another commenter here do not know why you are being downvoted i just threw you an upvote everything you said is true i was overweight much of my life finally in my mid 30s decided to do something about it read every book did every diet etc and the short version is i say this after i dropped 60 pounds in about 4 to 5 months hit my ideal bodyweight and have stayed there ever since it all about high protein low carb dieting combined with weight lifting 3x week weight loss is about 90 diet and 10 exercise and that exercise should be lifting i agree in principle with the notion that most people take in far more calories than they realize and keeping a rough mental estimate of what you are eating every day can really help re getting your diet and health back on track at least at first but let not kid ourselves not all calories are created equal weight loss i found has everything to do with what kind of calories you are ingesting and when and almost nothing at all to do with the overall number of calories you are taking in every day yeah yeah we all know about the twinkie diet guy fellow who lost weight eating just a few twinkies a day to prove his point that it was all about low cal dieting to that end i will say give that a shot long term say 6 months or a year and tell me how it works out for you as someone who done every diet under the sun i can absolutely say that atkins keto is the only one that effective long term counting calories will drive you nuts and the fact is unless you are measuring out extremely precise portions of your food your calorie counts wo not be accurate anyway anytime you eat out at a restaurant you are screwed far better to just go keto and eat clean chicken beef fish eggs green vegetables maybe a little cheese avocado nuts for fat and a little rice or potatoes for carb 60g day is about right for carb intake basically one serving and you will be fine given the choice to eat whatever i want but in strictly limited portions vs only a few different things but as much as i want i will take the latter any day and honestly every successful dieter that has dropped the weight and kept it off long term as i have will agree ,6,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,totally with you on the coffee as the best pre workout by far i got into serious hard and heavy lifting about 6 years back right after i quit drinking and smoking was on a health kick trained with a guy who would racked up quite a few olympic medals for powerlifting although his main thing was bodybuilding guy trained with arnold and all the golden age bodybuilders should do a post about him sometime but the short version is when i asked him about pre workout what he took what arnold took etc he said one big cup 16oz of strong black coffee and an aspirin and that it having tried all the other options i think i systematically went through every pre workout pill and powder available down at the gnc over the course of several months all a waste of money i can say the guy was absolutely right coffee to pep you up aspirin to thin your blood and you are good to go all your lifts will go up a notch or two if you work out about 30 min after re pot and video games wow that brings back memories i only smoked weed for a few months back when i was 19 i am 40 now and much of that brief time smoking was spent playing video games with a few friends i remember the playstation 1 had just come out as had the sega saturn so we would get high and play wipeout ps or panzer dragoon saturn a few others all games that were at the time these incredibly immersive experiences and of course the pot only heightened that went for a few months and then suddenly the inner alarm went off and it was like oh shit if i do not cut this out i am gonna spend my whole life sitting on this bean bag smoking weed and playing video games nowadays with games likes witcher 3 etc and these huge 85 uhd flatscreens plus extremely high potency weed strains goddamn i cannot imagine the temptation to just smoke and play it must be extraordinary but yeah no weed for me and as for gaming i cut it down to just the biggest highest rated releases of the year and that it just to keep up with the medium i feel the same way about movies in theaters as well do not have time for anything else i have seen a lot of posts in this sub re cutting out gaming entirely and for some well if you cannot control it much like booze drugs or anything else then it has to go but for most i think moderation will work out fine then again as the games get better and better and the designers figure out how to make them ever more addictive have you all played xcom 2 damn that shit is like crack moderation in gaming will become ever more difficult for sure ,1,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,the dj thing is very true and probably worthy of its own post as somebody who studied a bit of music in school at one point i was seriously looking at going into composition for electronic music the whole dj thing even though we all knew it was coming really kind of blew us all away us meaning musicians who studied music like ok at one point you had to learn the instrument s study the theory practice for years and years get good get a band together practice with the band get good write songs tour on and on and then suddenly these guys showed up with their laptops hit the spacebar music came out of speakers music they did not even write themselves and in fact had nothing to do with it was literally just a playlist and everyone loved it chicks especially all the music people were like what the fucking fuck is going on this guy getting more money attention from women career success etc than the people who actually studied music talk about fucked but when you look at it from the trp lens it all makes perfect sense if you are a girl going after a guy in a band if you go to his show you still have to wait down in the audience while he plays his set you can tell other girls that my boyfriend on stage but they will just roll their eyes and be like yeah whatever if you are with the dj however you as the woman are suddenly elevated to an entirely new level skip the line at the door of the hot club free drinks all night and most importantly you can stand next to him while he plays his set and bask in the glory of all the other bitches in the club looking on with envy it really is a pretty hilarious emperor new clothes situation though like the dj is playing music that is not his and by playing of course we mean literally just hitting a button the girl is fucking the dj so she can be associated with him as he the center of attention in the room he only the center of attention in the room because girls want to go some place and get free drinks and dance and the this is only made possible because thirsty guys want to fuck girls and so they go to where all the girls are and buy them drinks or here in la get bottle service so they can hope to have a shot so you imagine a pyramid with the thirsty beta males on the bottom all looking up to the girls in the middle who are then all looking up to the dj at the very top with his groupie s next to him and the most fucked up thing of all the guys at the bottom are spending the most money time energy effort and getting the least amount of reward while the guy at the top the dj is doing the least and yet is reaping all the rewards money fame sex etc it really is the entire trp social hierarchy in a nutshell alpha male on top women who want him right below men who want women below that fascinating stuff ,2,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,now now let not forget the 15 hour rule guys women are generally speaking comfortable enough to have sex with you after about 7 hours of contact if your game is tight and or more likely a few drinks are involved you can shorten this up to 3 or 4 but usually 7 hours is a good benchmark 7 to 10 hours of contact is the prime window during which you can and should escalate to sex after 10 hours you are now in the danger zone between hours 10 and 15 she now thinking well i am ready to have sex what is his problem does he not like me etc etc you can still escalate though paradoxically you will actually get more lmr here because now she also wondering wait did i make a mistake is he a timid beta she will test for your alphahood here more strongly than if you would made a move earlier after 15 hours you are done you are out she has polarized you and there a 99 chance that of the two options alpha warrior or beta provider she has polarized you as a beta provider and thus has put you into the friend zone from which of course there is no return ever i agree with much of op post i too wish i could go back in time and explain to my younger self dude she not playing hard to get she just not that into you move on but the sunken cost fallacy can be a real bitch sometimes still we must also keep in mind not all girls will make it obvious that they are into you at first glance and even girls that are into you might put up a little resistance at first i have had women that i had no connection with at all seemingly on the first date so i did not follow up then the girl follows up i am like what ok i guess we have a second date still nothing no vibe at all no iois nada and then at the end of the second date now it been a few hours i go in for the kill figuring fuck it why not i am never gonna see her again and suddenly wow look at that we have incredibly hot sex that lasts all night long totally unexpected but there it was girl just did not know how to show she was interested you know how most guys do not know how to game well most girls do not know how to flirt either just like there is no game school aside from trp there is no flirt school some girls kind of get how it works early on but most girls really have no idea what the fuck they are doing i am always shocked when i discover later on through friends of friends oh so and so was really into you why did not you ask her out and i am like um what she glanced at me once mumbled something incoherent said something bitchy and sarcastic whatever and that was it and that what passes for flirting jesus fucking christ so yeah just cuz the girl not jumping on top of you 5 minutes after you meet her it does not mean she a lost cause in fact you probably do not want to get with the girls that do jump on top of you after 5 minutes for other reasons but if you have gotten to the 7 10 hour mark you can feel free to escalate all you like if she likes you she will respond favorably if at that point you are still getting a no go then it done cut your losses and move on and again 15 hours is the last stand the final checkpoint beyond which if it has not happened by then it ai not gonna happen ever tattoo it on your forarm gents fuck by 15 hours or it over words to live by ,6,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,well given that exclusive committed monogamous relationships are not really a thing anymore at least not with the younger millennial crowd and certainly not out here in la i am all about spinning plates for the time being actually primarily mgtow these days i focus on my health diet lifting meditation my work the book i am doing my friends getting out going to events etc and after all that if there still time left over for a date every now and then or just a straight hook up if the girl offers and she clearly very into me then i might take her up on it otherwise i cannot be bothered as i mentioned in another comment i am pretty fucked out these days my partner count is already higher than it needs to be for this lifetime sex now for me is something that if it comes along and presents itself and is extremely attractive like i feel a real connection to the girl then i will take it but if it just another meaningless one night stand honestly i do not care i usually pass la women in particular are assaulted from all sides day game night game social circle game online game every moment of every day no matter how high your smv is you rapidly realize that there always a bigger badder chadlier chad out there and look at that he just dmed your girl on instagram they should totally hang out sometime aaaaaaaaaand it gone to quote south park so you learn to enjoy women when you are actually physically with them but when they are out of your sight you have to assume they are having sex with other men because they are once you make that conceptual breakthrough you will realize there is no one right woman there just women in general you might enjoy a few of them for a little bit but do not get attached they will fade from your life or just ghost you completely regardless of your smv as new men keep coming into their lives and you slowly but surely get pushed to the outer rings of their harem and then dropped completely and here the thing your smv does not matter i am gonna ruffle a few trp feathers here but really it is not about how hot you are or how tight your game is it about the old vs the new once you are a known quantity once she had sex with you a few times hung out with you a few times you are old news you cannot compete with the new hot unknown guys that are constantly hitting her up so yeah if you are extremely impressive you might hang onto her for a little bit be a member of her harem for a month or two but if you are hooking up with an extremely attractive woman and i have been with a few fact is you are one of like dozens of guys she considering at any given moment as new guys come in guys she has not hooked up with yet but wants to old guys get pushed to the back of the line and then dropped it not bad or good it just how it is this is the state of the sexual marketplace now so yeah work on your smv to get your foot in the door sure but after that enjoy them while you can and when they fade or ghost let them go that pretty much it ,5,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns, if a girl can sum up your high value in a simple phrase to their girlfriends you have a much stronger smv he in a band he plays football he is an mma fighter martial artist he a marine this is so so sooo true it cannot be emphasized enough i work in hollywood as a writer producer have talked about that in the past here and the biggest single differentiator between the scripts that get made and the scripts that do not is not the writing quality alas but rather the presence of an easily digestible easily repeated simple high concept hook which in turn makes the script easy to present to other people i was hanging out with a well known producer a little while back guarantee you have seen many of his movies guy was talking about this amazing script he would just read but he could not sell it i asked why he said well the writing is fucking awesome the characters are deep it so fucking good but there just no hook i do not know how to explain this thing to someone else and i totally got what he was talking about all he could do if he wanted to get this script funded at the studio level was to tell the top brass i cannot explain it but seriously this script is great trust me read it yeah good luck with that and then the best part after a long pause he says now if your script is about the sun exploding i can sell it bingo we have a winner imagine being in any production office any meeting with top execs hell imagine being out at the coffee shop chatting up the dev girl anyone asks what is it about it about the sun exploding wow i wanna read that sold so yeah getting a look is pretty much the same deal women need men that have a high concept hook built into their characters he a musician or dj music producer is probably the best one going still after all these years rapidly coming up though is he on social media gotta have a few million followers to pull that one off though that probably more of a strictly la thing right now back in nyc it was he in finance or hedge fund manager yep got tens of millions got it sold and on and on of course the musician is actually a waiter and the hedge fund manager is actually just an analyst in a cubicle somewhere but the girls do not know that and do not care all that matters is that you tell them what you are make it short quick and high concept like our guy in the story i am the lead guitar player so they can pass that info onto their girlfriends easily enough and you are all set do not be the deep profound complicated guy with all kinds of inner shit going on or go ahead and be that guy but do not advertise as that guy that like writing the script about the mexican kid growing up on the farm whose dad is an alcoholic and his mom is a whore but still there an ostrich across the road that he teaching how to fly if only he could overcome his learning disability yadda yaddda i am so bored where that script about the sun exploding again i wanna read that one tldr be high concept get laid ,10,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,this is the irony the people who really love music do not really talk about it for them it a deeply personal thing almost like a religious experience if you are meditating and you experience this sublime state of being this absolute absence of thought this one ness with god the cosmos etc etc and then you come back down to earth can you really share this experience in language with someone who never meditated before probably not this is how people who have music deep in their bones feel about it you either get it in this transcendent fashion or you do not and i realize that sounds incredibly pretentious certainly everyone transcendence is different but obviously there are people that live for music and then those that just kind of consume it oh so casually like junk food and then of course you have got the people who look like musicians talk like musicians they bring up their bands all the time these are the guys that are not really into music at all they are into getting laid and they have figured out that dressing and acting the part of musicians or nowadays djs music producers is the quickest and easiest way to do that the ultimate game shortcut but yeah a rich man does not have to tell you he a rich and a great artist is not gonna talk about his art you think brando talked about acting fuck no someone asked robert de niro once about when he hung out with brando if they talked about the method or the craft or whatever the fuck de niro was like fuck that are you kidding me jesus you do your best to talk about anything but acting i totally related to that ,21,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,40 year old missed the first post but i will jump in now with this no matter how hot she is somewhere out there there someone who tired of fucking her and is sick of her shit do not know where the quote originated from but it true every guy should fuck that one perfect 10 girl at some point in his life the sooner the better just to see how unbelievably quickly the whole she hot thing wears off and just how little is left after that happens my first few girlfriends in college were all great but it was not until after i moved to nyc at 25 and started dating what was at that point in my life the hottest girl i would ever been with a model i met on a photo shoot that it really hit home you are dreaming fantasizing about this girl you get with her the sex is not quite as good as you might like but damn she just oh so hot and you puff up with pride a little bit whenever you introduce her to your friends and then after like a few weeks maybe a month or two tops suddenly she not hot anymore it just kind of wears off as men i think we are biologically programmed for this the hotness is supposed to wear off so we are encouraged to get out there and find a new mate keep spreading the seed so if you are dating a girl for her looks alone you are gonna be sadly disappointed never fall victim to the sunken cost fallacy this is a big one perhaps the big one for me if i could go back in time 20 years i would tell my 20 year old self if she is not your biggest fan dump her ass walk ghost her instantly with no regrets and if at any point in the relationship she ceases to be your biggest fan walk same as above i cannot tell you how much time money energy effort i spent trying to salvage relationships with women who were just never really that into me in the first place when i think about the months maybe even years of heartache pain and yes suffering i went through looking back it really was just a whole lot of rearranging the deck chairs on the titanic knowing what i know now post trp girls are basically into you right away or within the first few hours tops or not at all if she is not your 1 fan after 10 to 15 hours she never will be go ahead and start a rock band cure cancer save the world does not matter her imprint of you will never change so do not throw good money and time and energy after bad trying to change a situation that cannot be changed if she not into you stop trying to win her over cut your losses and move on life too short to give your love to someone who does not want it save it save it for someone who does ,163,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,here the thing you do not actually have to play a musical instrument you just have to look like you play a musical instrument and dress and act the part accordingly story time one of my best friends is a beautiful blonde stripper as you can imagine she basically a walking trp masterclass looks like barbie does very well for herself endlessly entertaining to be around for sure but god help the men and there are many that try to lock that one down so yeah i am meeting her and a few of her stripper friends out at dinner one night i show up it like her a few other girls a few other guys and me basically everyone is coupled up it like 3 couples i am sort of the seventh wheel at the table but whatever i take a seat food and drinks are ordered and i start chatting up the guy that my stripper friend is draped around for that night anyway dude is the classic skinny bad boy musician type covered in tatts and piercings funky hair got the whole look down looks like he just stepped out of a late 80s music video with perhaps a touch of classic punk to boot seemed like a cool enough dude at first glance though my stripper friend cycles through so many guys so fast it hard to tell them apart sometimes so we start chatting i ask him what he gets up to and he like i am a musician a guitarist lead guitarist actually yeah i am the lead guitar player in a band lead i am the leader no kidding he says the word lead about 4 times in a single breath i am like i get it bro you are oh so fucking alpha let me bow to your awesome alphaness right here right now the guy clearly saw me as some kind of potential competition and i was just as clearly saying right back dude this chick you are with is like my friend my bro she all yours man have at it but at the same time now i am a little bit curious i studied music myself i was a composer and a producer of electronic music for years as an undergrad took my degree in it so of course i am like so well then who are your big musical influences i was not fucking with the guy i was genuinely curious and just thought it was the easiest way to keep the conversation going to get the guy to talk about himself he says what do you mean i say you know you are a guitar player who was the guy that got you into music like who was your big inspiration starting out he just looked at me blankly i pushed on stating the question very slowly as if talking to a child who is your favorite guitar player he just continued to stare and then it dawned on all of us at the table at the exact same time the guy actually did not have one a musical influence because he actually was not a guitar player that was just something he told strippers so he could fuck them and of course he got all the requisite tatts piercings and leather odds and ends to look the part so now the silence is stretching out and stretching out and getting very very awkward but i am just sitting there laughing realizing wow this guy been running this schtick for years and all this time seriously all this fucking time at no point has even one of the i am sure many many strippers and other random girls he fucked not a one has every actually asked him about his music he looks the part they can introduce him to their girlfriends and say i am dating a musician that enough he said he the lead guitar player they can pass that info along that all that matters so what if it not true it not a woman job to verify he said it so it true they now have plausible deniability all you need so finally to kill the silence i am like dude just say the name of a guitar player anyone another awkward pause and then i am like fuck it after choking down a laugh i bailed the guy out with you know i always really liked prince myself as a guitar player knowing one of the girls would jump on this and sure enough one of the other strippers piped up with i love prince and the conversation got diverted with the onus having then been taken off the other guy but yeah that was when i realized holy shit it really is not about what you do at all is it when it comes to picking up girls it just about what you tell the girls you do and whether or not you look convincingly like the character you are currently pretending to be rollo has a great post on this i think it called get a look in it he references an adam corolla quote where adam says women are like casting directors casting characters in the movie of their own life so you have to pick a look and run with it play that character archetype all the way you do not actually have to develop the requisite skillset that comes with being that character much like an actor playing a musician does not actually have to learn music they just have to learn how to fake it remember for women appearance and reality are the same thing if you look like a musician you are a musician and hilariously enough even if you are a real musician if you do not dress the part then as far as girls are concerned you are not a musician despite the fact that you might have spent your life playing an instrument studying music etc for girls it all about the outward appearance not the internal reality ,153,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,this is absolutely why our society is going to collapse within another generation or two you have fully half the population all women running around with a raging drug problem and yet they are literally at the most basic fundamental biological level completely incapable of owning up to it you will never ever ever hear a woman say my name is x and i have a problem i am addicted to bad boys and it ruining my life etc for women they are always the victim the problem is always some outside force acting upon them the problem is never one that comes from within themselves and thus one they might have to take responsibility for a guy friend of mine lives in a house with several roommates for a brief while one of them was a woman who was a friend of his sister girl was the classic la wannabe actress hot seductive another friend described her as a ferrari designed for sex total emotional trainwreck the whole deal and of course like all la girls of this type she was dating if you can call it that a man who beat her and i mean beat her hard very very physically abusive so one night she texting with the guy it getting hot and heavy whatever clearly she wants to go over and fuck the dude and or get her regular beating which of course by now she is chemically addicted to the guy is stringing her along with texts he not available right now etc etc and then at one point my friend in the house grabs the phone and texts as if he was the girl something like i have had enough of your shit i am calling the cops he starts laughing hands the phone back to the girl she sees what he sent as her and loses her fucking mind and then in classic crazy la trainwreck fashion she proceeds to trash the fucking apartment like no joke she overturns the coffee table breaking it smashes furniture breaks all kinds of shit including this awesome high end coffee maker which i would just given to my friend so no coffee for him alas on and on everyone in the place is like what the fucking fuck i heard the story from my friend the next day he was totally aghast like what the hell was all that about this dude just jokingly sent a text as her just to lightly fuck with his roommate obviously they were all concerned that she was in this physically abusive relationship but she would already made it clear that it was gonna happen no matter what that she was hooked on this guy and it was never gonna stop ever he asked for my thoughts and i just shrugged and said look the beatings he gives her each one is like a shot of heroin she a heroin addict she needed her fix you took the heroin away last night so she lost her shit pretty simple if you ask me he just looked at me and was like duuuuude you are right you are so right think a lot of la women and women in general suddenly made total sense to him after that ,11,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,i have been seeing this more and more in online dating sites and apps okcupid and tinder specifically transgender women which is to say people that are born biologically male but believe themselves to be female will list themselves as simply female on the site or app give you the whole song and dance re i am into puppy dogs and long walks on the beach etc and then at the bottom of the profile it like by the way i am a transgender female and if you cannot handle that and it like um what insert record scratch followed by total silence here and to me what is really fascinating about the whole thing is the implied shaming that goes along with their rhetoric in other words i am a man with a penis but i believe i am a woman i want to date and have sex with a straight man i do not have a vagina it true but if that a problem for you you just need to man up and deal with it because if you think you are owed a vagina etc etc i would like to think i am a tolerant guy but really this is just absolute madness that not to say that i do not think the transgender population should not date hook up etc far from it but there should absolutely be some kind of filter set up on these sites and apps which differentiates people that are born biologically female from people who are born biologically male and believe themselves to be female so that people like me straight biological men who are looking for straight biological women can refine their search results to exclude people they are not looking for such as other biological men who knows perhaps there are straight men out there who are totally cool dating a woman who happens to be in the body of a man if that the case go for it more power to you but as a straight biological man who wants to date hook up with straight biological women the fact that like 25 of my match feed is actually composed of men who think they are women honestly it just absurd and the fact that these companies refuse to put filters in place for this because treating transgender women as if they are not full on real women would be discrimination is even more absurd it a crazy world we live in enjoy the decline etc etc ,1,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns, i did know one woman who went for a clean break agreeing to share the children she was decent and reasonable throughout did not take more than her fair share according to what she would put into the marriage signed off on a co parenting agreement took no money and agreed to work a full time job rather than scamming money off her ex husband every month you know her name miss fucking unicorn i completely made this last one up as an example of something that has never ever happened best thing i have read all week re all of the above totally agree however you left out one crucial element the fucking divorce lawyers had a friend back in nyc several years ago guy was about 40 or so when i knew him good looking dude had his shit together had been kicking ass at work for like 20 years and now was a top exec at a huge company we all know guy got married young mid 20s traditional arrangement she stayed at home handled all the domestic stuff he climbed the corporate ladder made bank that was their deal so 15 years of marriage later they both want out totally amicable they are both friends they both still love each other in a way but the passion is gone and they both want to move on with their lives while they are still reasonably young he thinks ok we are gonna be totally cool about this i am gonna make sure she taken care of he even made a point of offering her more than he was legally obligated to guy had plenty of money we are gonna sign off and then we are gonna go our separate ways then the lawyers get involved her lawyer starts telling her look he offering you x so you should be asking for at least 10x she says but no wait i think his original offer of x was even more than he was obligated to give me like way more her lawyer well it is but if he willing to offer that much right off the bat we should be asking for at least 10 times that just to start so she goes to talk my friend about this he says do not listen to the lawyers they are just trying to drag this out they are paid by the hour hundreds an hour so the longer we negotiate the more they get paid and then he goes on look you know about and have seen every single penny i have ever earned i am already offering you most of what we both have i am totally cool with this just take it and let sign this thing and get it done so we can get on with our lives let not drag this out or they will get everything and you will get nothing he very clear about his but the lawyers continue to work their magic on the girl do not ever talk to him alone without us present we need to act as go betweens we need to negotiate everything he does not have your best interests at heart we have your best interests at heart and of course we are gonna have to drag this one out i am afraid gotta make sure he does not have any money hidden away in the caymans gonna need to investigate this could take some time and on and on long story short the reasonable duo that was all set to divorce and remain friends they hate each other now and they are both broke a divorce that should have taken one day and a few signatures got drawn out to several years the lawyers took everything girl got almost nothing a tiny fraction of what she would have gotten had she just taken the original settlement she was offered and of course the guy my friend ended up with nothing so yeah once the lawyers get involved you are done and when it comes to marriage and the inevitable divorce the lawyers always get involved ,6,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,6 years sober here you are fine going for drinks and not actually drinking alcohol tell the girl to meet you wherever let say for example the coolest bar you know get there a few minutes early tell the bartender you wo not be drinking tonight but your date will be sure tip him well and then order club soda with a splash of cranberry and lime diet coke my fave coffee if you are at a bar lounge restaurant and they do that or whatever you like if you are at a speakeasy type place and they make complicated drinks lavender bee knees etc tell the bartender you want something fruity delicious and non alcoholic they will whip you up a virgin highball or whatever and it will look like you are actually drinking a real drink same goes for the club soda and cranberry when your date gets there she might not even bring it up she will glance at your glass and assume you are drinking booze and then order a drink for herself if it does come up just shrug it off and say oh i am not drinking right now but please do not mind me have whatever you like etc play it down own the frame if she pushes you just hit her with i am on antibiotics or i am training for event x or whatever you like if you end up seeing the girl on a regular basis you can consider opening up to her a bit more at a later date i am a recovering alcoholic i do not drink period but keep it light in the beginning just give her a simple nah i am good not drinking tonight and you should be fine ,9,asktrp
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,i am with you on the hispanic guys but then you also dated asian men as well really as a black female i have to say honestly i have never seen that dynamic before not that it cannot exist mind you just that in keeping with red pill philosophy here you would have to be a very masculine asian male basically playing against type with a very feminine black female also playing against type certainly i have known some pretty buff badass asian dudes and a few pretty feminine black women i dated a beautiful black girl about a year ago for maybe a month or so but i must confess i have never seen the asian man black woman combo good on you if you made that happen i am all for mixing it up re black women i think a lot of them are going to start broadening their horizons re race and dating if only because as hollywood continues to push the black man white woman narrative there are just gonna be far fewer black men around for them to date i already see this out and about in hollywood you have got the hot well put together black guy with his gorgeous white girl and man when a black girl passes by or a group of them it like you can feel the tension the animosity you can practically read their thoughts and they ai not friendly of course it swings both ways when i was briefly dating said black girl a little while back anytime we were out and about every black guy shot me a glance like hey man what the fuck you think you are doing there with the black guy white woman combo everyone sort of like well of course black guys are cooler than white guys why would not she date a black dude but when you are the white guy in a white man black woman combo particularly if the black girl is quite beautiful everyone black men especially is like what the fuck is going on here what is this shit i thought the whole thing was pretty amusing honestly but i definitely had to fend off quite a few street approaches from other black men when i was out with an extremely attractive black girl re asian men being seen as feminine it has to do with their society and the way it set up at a foundational level you are looking at thousands of years of unbroken history over there and generally the more advanced a civilization gets the more collectivist it gets i lived for a year in japan in tokyo and over there it all about group harmony putting the group needs before your own etc to them that just common courtesy it polite it civilized but to us all that let make sure not to step on anyone feelings even if it means making great personal sacrifices just strikes us as very feminine america by contrast is a very individualistic culture we are less about group harmony and more about competition ambition beating the other guy etc more masculine energy less civilized the asians would say but from a purely biological point of view getting back to our caveman roots the man who is less civilized and more ambitious and competitive and thus more masculine is always going to be more attractive to women hence asian men suffering a handicap in the sexual marketplace while getting a bonus in the corporate workplace etc and of course we see the exact opposite for black men ,2,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,by the way i should also say and this is kind of the sad part of all this i made these observations a few years ago and a friend was like well i guess that means that all the single white guys will have to start dating all the black girls no i just laughed and said that will never happen black women have more masculine energy than white men that dynamic will never work i very occasionally see white man black woman couples out and about and i hate to say it because i wish the white guys would step up their game solidify their frame but the fact is it very obvious whenever you see the white man black woman dynamic that the coupling is not going to last no woman can maintain attraction to a man that is more feminine than she is it just ai not gonna happen this is one of the reasons why hollywood wo not touch this movies with black male leads dating white women fine we are all about that movies with soft white guys dating tough black girls not believable the biology just is not there not to say it impossible my neighbors are a couple he a mixed race white ish guy and she a black woman but the dude is alpha as fuck and she is extremely feminine there are exceptions out there for sure but yeah generally speaking think there are gonna be a whole lotta single and lonely black women wandering around in the very near future ,1,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,come to hollywood it all black men dating white women out here may change at some point in the future but that very much what the scene is right now in fact i was out at a well known diner here in the area a little while back saw a white couple sitting a few tables down and i actually pointed it out to my friend it was that unusual i was like wow hey look a white couple out in public he actually gave a surprise huh and we both stared for like 10 seconds it was that strange like seeing a unicorn out in the wild as to why this is i can hazard a few guesses there an extremely strong push right now in hollywood and all media for the black man white woman dynamic the new star wars movies every hbo flagship show every music video everything is black men with white women hollywood will tell you it in the name of diversity do not believe it the truth is it because white men have now become so feminized that they just cannot pull their weight on camera anymore no gravitas casting directors have been complaining about this for years it one of the reasons why even when we have an american superhero we have to go to australia or england to cast him american white men have just become far too girl y black men naturally i believe have more of a masculine presence than white men again a lot of this goes back to the fairy tale tropes the mmbm the mystical magical black man the classic black mentor character who helps the white hero tap into his intuition his mojo see morpheus in the matrix etc but basically black culture and energy is generally speaking more about the bottom chakras if i can get new age y for a sec while asian culture is all about the top chakras and white culture seems to be somewhere in the middle what that translates to is simply bottom chakras down near the groin are about growth sex emotion feeling the individual is emphasized independence top chakras up towards the head are all about the intellect creativity the spirit the collective is emphasized interdependence we are all red pillers here tell me gents what is more attractive to a woman a guy who thinks about putting others first or a guy who feels and fucks for himself first obviously there are exceptions to this rule but that the cultural trope as it stands and i really do think the general energy dynamic tends to bear that out as stereotyping as it may seem black men sexualize the frame immediately a female friend of mine very cute white girl works at a bar on the same block as my building bar has a huge black clientele we actually think the whole thing is a money laundering operation but that another story every black guy who walks in which is every guy walks right up to her and says you ever been with a black man before first words out of their mouths no exceptions she even has a comedy bit about it she retorts i do not know you ever been with a black girl before zing white guys will beat around the bush work their covert contracts tell the girl let go out sometime let work on this project together let do a shoot together etc etc black guys wanna fuck right out of the gate with black men there is no beta bucks i have a few black male friends they are all pretty well off not a one would every spend one fucking penny on a chick that he was not already fucking hard all the time and even if they are fucking i still do not think they spend any money at all it strictly come over let fuck that it it alpha fucks from beginning to end beta does not exist in their mindset in hollywood gangsta rap and rap culture in general fashion etc is pedestalized and obviously black men pull this off better than white men so if you are a girl and you want to date a guy who currently a part of the pop cultural zeitgeist you have to go black now that women are up front about their alpha fucks requirements they have no shame in saying out loud black men have bigger muscles and bigger dicks that what i want that what i am going for i know quite a few white girls who exclusively date black men for exactly these reasons i use the word date loosely here the reality is they are of course members of a black man harem do not know about the genetic reality of all that but that the female take as it stands all the white guys are becoming more and more girl ish with each passing day and the girls are becoming more boy ish there no more sexual polarity hence no more attraction i am a pretty manly white guy i hope but even i am finding it harder and harder to muster up any attraction for most white girls these days the half shaved heads the tatts the pierings the purple hair black men however because their masculine energy is more pumped up from all of the above find more attraction with white girls and of course this is a 2 way street and so on point is if i was a white girl living in la and looking around at all the soft pasty white guys waddling around with their ridiculous man buns and feminsit sjw causes and all the rest of it clearly attempting to pull off their covert contracts and then a good looking black dude rolled up and with blazing confidence came out and said hey you are fine let go back to my place i would probably go for the black dude too it just how the sexual marketplace is right now white men have become too feminized and only black men are left to carry the masculine torch it does not help that the mainstream media is pushing this with everything they have and yeah as for the diversity thing as someone who works in hollywood i will believe it when i see a movie or a tv show starring an asian man dating and fucking hard a black woman in fact hell maybe i should write that script and pass it around town see if i can force the sjws to get it produced in the name of diversity would not that be hilarious until then i call it what it is pop culture pedestalizing black culture as the last bastion of masculine energy ,8,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,takeaway watch out for russian women when it comes to the sexual marketplace they are mercenary well you could argue that all women are mercenary when it comes to the smp that red pill 101 but russians somehow seem to take it to a whole new level they are absolutely ruthless ,2,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns, i have been in plenty of situations many times in which i knew more about my current condition than the doctor did at the time i saw him simply because i did a quick google search and spent 5 minutes looking around recent example had a physical doc says blood came back i have a kidney problem a major one in fact my kidneys are not working at optimal levels we are gonna monitor and see what is up i say hmm that odd is it because i am eating more protein lifting weights yep that must be it he says too many protein shakes it killing your kidneys but doc i say i am eating my body weight in protein grams every day that nothing tons of people do this all the time no problems nope he says gotta cut back no more protein so i hit the internet do some research 2 min turns out if you take creatine which i do a common supplement many lifters take you will have creatine in your blood obviously if you have kidney problems you will also have more creatine in your blood see what happened here i go back to the doc hey doc did 2 seconds of research did you think i might have kidney problems because of my elevated creatine level yes he says that it well doc did you consider that it maybe because i am taking creatine every day nope he says did not think about that in that case you are all good i mean jesus fucking christ right so yeah do your research always as much as you can i am not saying docs are stupid obviously but i am saying that because their training is very wide they must be able to clock hundreds thousands of symptoms it is also not very deep anyone who been through med school and is a practicing physician will tell you the exact same thing you are ultimately responsible for your own health not them and yes many times your knowledge will exceed theirs just because you have more experience and have done more research on your one particular issue than they have witness nyc best pulmonologist who misdiagnosed me as having adult onset asthma rather than a life threatening blood clot say no more ,2,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,it partly the way the whole healthcare system is set up it a for profit enterprise and there no money to be made in preventive care the system makes its money off of sick people not healthy people so ideally you are just a little bit sick and taking their drugs to fend of symptoms all the time i know doctors and a lot of them most i would say got into it because they want to help people usually they knew somebody a friend a family member who was a doctor and this person inspired the next one to go into medicine but then you actually get there work the crazy hours see how insane the whole thing is and it becomes more about just get this person stabilized and get him out of here get him home they do just enough so that you do not actually die right in front of them and then off you go in a way it hard to blame them if you are the guy complaining of chest pains and then suddenly some other guy comes in and he bleeding out from a gunshot wound they are gonna run to the second guy you are on your own problem is there always a guy coming in with a gunshot wound or whatever too many patients not enough doctors to go around so care suffers as a result ,2,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,american healthcare is fucking fucked up there a lot i love about this country and i have lived and traveled all over the world as critical as i often am about the states it could be so much worse compared to some of what i have seen out there but the fact is we are absolutely behind the rest of the world on this one we all know we are behind and yet there seems to be very little we can do about it as long as a few very rich people can get just a little bit richer the system is unlikely to change ironic since this may be the very thing that ends up killing america in the long run like a cancer that eats its host but then ends up dying in effect killing itself when its host dies ,2,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,i have a few photographer friends lot of guys do it as a side thing out here in la and i always implore all of them all the time back up all your work both online and on its own separate physical external hard drive make sure that if anything ever happens to you that separate physical external hard drive with everything you have ever shot on it ends up in the right hands so your photos are not lost to time ,2,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,held up at gunpoint damn that would be near enough for me but yeah very few people can really appreciate i think just how seemingly random and out of nowhere the end of your physical life can come like you are cruising merrily along had a good day got some work done gonna go see a movie tonight and then suddenly it like oh there a car that ran a red light he about to hit me i am gonna die in about one second or oh i do not know what is wrong i suddenly cannot breathe am i having a heart attack i am too young i think i am about to die and that it people who have these experiences but then somehow manage to skate through them and live to tell the tale your perspective is definitely reset climbing the corporate ladder making money ambition for its own sake these things usually end up taking a backseat it becomes more about the quality of your relationships with the people you love and respect in your life how you affect them in a positive way and what you are going to leave behind you on this earth after you die not to say that making money is a bad thing far from it just that most nde survivors i know who pursued money for its own sake ended up dropping back taking less money for less work and pursuing more of an overall quality of life thing rather than let see how much money i can hoard etc we are definitely a generation of thrill seekers no doubt about it much of this sub is about seeking the next thrill the next big thing fucked an 8 last week gotta fuck a 9 this week made 100k last year gotta make a mill this year and so on i think it great to have goals and if there are certain benchmarks people want to hit more power to them what i think so many fail to realize though is that hitting these goals will not bring any lasting long term happiness in fact quite the opposite i lost a lot of weight several years ago about 60 pounds did it for a girl initially should do a post about that some time girl did not work out at any rate once a beta always a beta in a girl mind does not matter how much weight you lose or how much money you make later on the initial imprint can never be changed but i remember stepping on that scale one day after several months of hard dieting and exercise i would finally hit and surpassed my goal weight and it was like that it that all there is why do not i feel happy why am i not elated it was just a digital number on a screen big deal i actually felt kind of sad that the process was over you know when i felt real happiness that first initial week when i lost my first several pounds for the first time the journey had just begun it was all so new and exciting it was all out in front of me i had discovered something new but after that it was just tedious and when i finally got there i did not really care anymore so yeah for me it very much far more about enjoying the journey now about setting up my daily routine to be as enjoyable as possible than it is hitting any sort of grand benchmarks in life do work you love spend time with your friends that sort of thing life will pass quicker than you think and as the cliche goes no one who was about to die ever said gee i wish i would spent more time at the office ,2,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,yeah a lot of people warned me about russian women in general and my own russian fiancee in particular when we were about to get married of course i ignored them all well entrenched in my blue pill denial i was oh so convinced that my special little snowflake was different had to be different funniest bit is after the blood clot put me in the hospital thereby forcing me to skip my own marriage ceremony in moscow i knew something was up that universe had other plans could not fly to russia to bring my girl back so she had to get back to the states on her own steam finally made it back several months later moved in i tried to make it work with her for like a month or so but it was hopeless she just was not into me could not stop cheating she was really into black rappers i was a green card to her a path to citizenship nothing more finally broke up with her she moved out and a month later i heard through mutual friends she married a black rapper the backup guy obviously or one of them at any rate even better years later i hear black rapper guy did not perform as expected never got his big break in music so as soon as her citizenship came through she filed for divorce the very next day upgraded to yet another bigger better more successful black rapper dude back then i would have been like what is going on here now of course post trp it like dual sexual strategy check briffault check hypergamy check check check ,2,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,i have not read up on it or studied it formally but from what little i know of it think i have read a post or two in the man o sphere summarizing the big points i may be a default stoic as are i would argue many of my fellow nde survivors after you have been close to the death process your pov usually switches to do not waste time worrying about that which you have no control over ,1,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,i actually like reading longer posts they stick with me more than the shorter ones do much like 2 hour movies tend to stick with me more than 30 second commercials i know we are all about the just hit us with your 4 point bullet list and get the fuck out schtick around here but honestly those types of posts to me they always smack of shiny over produced bubblegum pop like a katy perry song i like the longer stuff that meanders around bit the unpolished garage album with the long guitar solos someone posted a long ish story on here just a few days back read the whole thing loved it really hit home guy spent 2 800 hours in skyrim goddamn i guarantee i will remember that guy and his tale of woe long after i have forgotten the other ten 2 paragraph posts i read that day obviously i do not want to encourage more bad writing but if someone got something to say and thinks it gonna take more than a few bullet points to say it my opinion is by all means share away spill your guts i wanna read it not like we are killing any trees around here by the way i think it pretty awesome that someone told you i was near death and it made me rethink absolutely everything i thought i knew about life here what i learned and you are like nah man that looks like a dozen whole paragraphs of text if you cannot condense your whole philosophy of life down to like 2 sentences or better yet a bumper sticker well then i just cannot be bothered says more about you than me no ,2,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,it was absolutely higher guidance i have no doubt about that none at all doctor came in near the end of my recovery and told me i could not fly for at least one year i told him doc i have a wedding to go to in like a few weeks he tells me sorry guess you are gonna have to tell your friend you cannot make it no doc you do not understand i say it my wedding he takes a good long look at me puts his hand on my shoulder and says i will never forget this maybe this is the universe way of telling you you are not supposed to marry this person funniest thing is i was actually in russia like a month before in moscow tried to marry my fiancee and bring her back to the states the authorities in moscow actually would not let us get married did not believe we were a real couple finally they said come back in 2 months if you still want to do it we will let you get married guess they saw too many drunk american sailors coming in with russian babes who were using the americans for greencards and a way out of russia so yeah i was all set to come back 2 months later and marry the woman who i knew was cheating on me at the time but goddamn it i was gonna double down triple down on what a nice guy i was show her how great i could be how much i was willing to sacrifice for her etc etc and then by golly she would see the light and finally love me for who i was every blue pill fantasy you name it i was doing it but then the blood clot hit knocked me out of action right before our wedding date at the immigration office in moscow or wherever it was so i could not fly over to moscow thus no marriage no cheating wife and no divorce rape talk about dodging a bullet sometimes these seemingly terrible things that happen to us they really are blessings in disguise ,4,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,on the contrary i think the fact that you can get it together so quickly means you are on the right track i was kinda surprised that after i handled the succession of my script and called my then fiancee i felt pretty much done with everything and knowing what i know now i would have skipped the call to the fiancee ideally i would like to be at a place where if someone were to point a gun at me and say you have 2 seconds then i am gonna kill you i would be like go ahead pull the trigger my affairs are all in order now obviously i want to live as long as possible accomplish as much as i can see and experience as much as i can etc but yeah the more plot threads you have wrapped up in the movie of your life the easier i think it is when you finally see the end coming we all want to live longer there no getting around that trick is to keep everything in your life handled cleaned up as you go then when the end comes and hits you by surprise from out of nowhere you are ok with it when it happens ,2,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,absolutely i was also hesitant to quit drinking at first was afraid that once the alcohol stopped the babes and the random one night stands would stop as well and the fun and the parties and the friends i was afraid all of it would go away i knew i had a problem or at least i was going to have a problem if i did not quit but i did not want to risk giving up my social life truth is once you quit your social life will get better not worse there will be an awkward and sometimes painful year or so while you get your sober legs underneath you and re discover who you really are but after that you will be good it will still be harder gaming girls sober is definitely harder than doing it when you are both wasted then it effortless but the quality of your women and your relationships will go up well worth the trade off in my opinion ,1,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,yeah i learned a lot about how the whole negotiate your medical bills thing works far too late unfortunately i would paid off the bulk of the first round of medical bills when the second round came in about 6 months later the hospital will trickle out your bills rather than hitting you with them all at once lest you file bankruptcy in an attempt to get out of paying anything so you think you are pretty much done with it all and then suddenly wham another mountain of bills hits you like a week later as the second round came in i was like fuck this and at the same time happened to bump into a woman whose job it was to negotiate medical bills on every bill there is a number like a code designating what the bill is for code 904 or whatever medical bill negotiators can look up this code in a special binder of medical services and see what the service actually was so for example one of my random bills was code 501 or whatever the number was 904 the woman looked up the code and told me yeah that bill is for when the nurse came in looked at your chart on the wall for 2 seconds and then left that what 501 means i could not believe it so many of the bills i would been receiving and had already paid off at face value without negotiating were all ridiculously high a lot of them were just nurses glancing at charts apparently for a couple grand a hit it a pity i did not know any better earlier on and did not have anyone fighting for me from the outset when i got the first round of bills i managed to negotiate it down slightly but that was it the hospital did not really same to care they were like this is the price take it or leave it you are getting billed this amount whether you like it or not later on i might have saved a few dollars with the second round of bills but yeah the way the whole system is set up to just absolutely fuck you from the start it crazy you are trying to heal to get better to get on with your life and then there all this financial bullshit piled on top you have to deal with no wonder so many people just say fuck it and do not pay at all ,1,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,i have heard about the long waits from other people who live in countries with free healthcare canada etc obviously that not ideal either i am not an expert on the subject i wish i knew more had more facts and numbers on hand but surely there must be a better way some kind of middle ground maybe you pay out of pocket a reasonable fee to visit the doctor for minor things that prescription for antibiotics whatever but for major things you are hit by a bus broken limbs 500 000 hospital stay the state takes care of it or almost all of it maybe you kick in a tiny bit all i know right now is that this for profit health industry thing is ridiculous it not a free market when you have no choice whether or not to buy the product or service being put in front of you and when the doctor tells you as i was told well you do not have to pay you can just die that not much of a choice either we do not pay for the police when they show up to our house it covered by our taxes same for the fire department etc so why are we paying this much for healthcare it does not make sense well it does if you are the one making money off it it does not if you are the typical tax paying american citizen ,3,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,i was fortunate to be in a place where i was basically good with all the close people in my life if there were amends that needed to be made though i might have made them time allowing but then only after i made sure the script was secure first you are right though for you personally how you would have spent those last five minutes says a whole lot about you as a person the fact that you would have called all your close buddies and told them how much they mean to you i think that awesome that says what your priorities are for me hell maybe it just means i did not have that many super close friends at the time i actually had a few i think but like i said we were basically good on all fronts there was not anything terribly dramatic or interesting to say there at the end what was most important i thought was making sure i did not die without leaving anything worthwhile behind for you that worthwhile thing might have been a conversation for me it was the script for others maybe it their photo collection with all their friends for everyone it different but one thing for sure when you only have a little time left what exactly that one important thing is will become very clear very quickly ,2,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,absolutely my fiancee did not give a fuck in the slightest that i almost died in the hospital took her a week to finally get around to calling me from russia and when she did it was like you are still coming over here to marry me right so i can get back into the us did not care about my condition at all i was just a means to end green card for her so yeah like i said did not work out with that one ,18,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,totally agree and the worst part they are actually attempting to change the laws now wherein you can no longer file bankruptcy to get out of paying medical bills think about that something totally random happens you get sick end up in the er they can charge you whatever they want 5m 10m does not matter and if you are thinking well i will just file bankruptcy to get around it they are like nope sorry not allowed we are just gonna take everything you make for the rest of your life it really is modern day slavery not sure if that law passed or not but quite a few lawyers i talked to a few years ago brought it up ,2,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,that what is so tragic about the us we cannot afford to give everyone free health insurance even though it actually far cheaper in the long run then the economy collapses oh look we found 2 trillion dollars just lying around here you go banks take all you need and if you need more just let us know give me a fucking break ,2,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,i have actually thought about going into politics and i hate politics just to push for free healthcare in the united states every other first world country on earth has free heathcare for all its citizens except the us it outrageous but as long as big corporations are making tons of money on it not being free and bribing um excuse me lobbying our congressmen to keep it this way things are not likely to change anytime soon the real kicker is that it actually more expensive in the long run i actually paid my medical bill over the course of a year this is very rare most people in my situation they come to the er with no health insurance the doctors have to treat them docs have to save your life they cannot turn you away the patient stays a few days then leaves and does not pay their bill obviously because they do not have 85k or whatever so who pays the bill ultimately the american taxpayer so you have a whole bunch of people that have medical issues which if they could go to a doctor for free as soon as they develop symptoms would get treated and cured right away but they cannot go for free they cannot afford it so they wait it gets worse and then they end up in the er and then they do not pay their bill because again they do not have that huge amount of money lying around all us american tax payers pay so yeah we really really need free healthcare for all in america ,6,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,shocking i know i asked the same thing many many times how could you all have missed this fact is medicine is very much just throwing random darts and seeing what hits unless you are physically cut and bleeding or have an obvious broken bone etc if there something wrong on the inside it very much a guessing game and doctors often only know slightly more than you do these days with the internet you might actually know more than they do if you have done a little research they just saw a 30 year old who looked and seemed healthy but who claimed he could not breathe very well did not even occur to them i might have a clot since that more of an old person thing it took my friend sister a doctor to finally put it together from my symptoms and call it out correctly if not for her i might be dead now since my friend would not have dragged me to the er when she did i might not have gone and thus could very well have died in my home that night or the next day there a lot that can go wrong with the body and doctors when they see and hear symptoms are really just making random semi educated guesses as to what it might be even with all the fancy gadgets and high tech toys they have at their disposal ,3,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,damn and i thought i had a tough time waking up in the er with a broken neck sounds like you went through hell man glad you made it and are here to tell the tale re doctors you know they kinda fucking suck sometimes do not they every doc that saw me was like yeah you are gonna be chained to this bed for life i was like fuck you i am gonna be walking in a few months you will see granted it took a little while but i got there chained to the bed for a few months then sitting up for a few months wiggling around then slowly getting out of bed inching down the hallway eventually i learned to walk again and now i am fine but those doctors jesus whatever happened to bedside manner maybe they are just so jaded with all the shit they have seen they are like sorry bro you are fucked just telling it like it is thank god my attitude was different i was just like no you are wrong stop talking and i got about the business of making myself better but yeah you have to wonder how many people could have gotten better but when the docs told them this is it you are screwed for life they just kind of mentally gave up and wound up lying in a bed forever after we preach attitude quite a bit here on trp confident positive attitude whether it be picking up women going for that job lifting that weight etc but this is doubly true when it comes to physically healing your body attitude is everything ,3,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,i think the big takeaway from the whole wow i am about to die thing is that crystal clear realization that you are not the hero of the movie you are just a background actor and if you get taken out of the picture the movie will continue on without you the world wo not stop turning just because you are not there sounds kind of obvious when i put it like that but it really true you feel it in your bones like damn i am just one guy one person amongst billions my life means very little i am a grain of sand on the beach that it nothing more just a little blip in the cosmos in a way this can be terrifying because then it like jesus i could die at any moment a few friends would be sad for a few days and that it you realize that your life really does not have that much consequence in the grand scheme of things but then at the same time you also realize how free you really are you do not have to be stuck in that dead end job you do not have to put up with that bullshit relationship you are totally free to go wherever do whatever it quite a gift then when you look at it like that ,1,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,it a low budget indie drama think bergman etc almost had 5m cobbled together at one point to get the thing made but then the financing fell through very typical in hollywood movies almost come together then do not then almost come together again then do not for years on end we may still get it made at some point but the hollywood market for specs original material is very tough these days if you are not doing star wars or marvel it basically ai not gonna happen unless you pay for the shoot yourself looking at doing it super cheap like under a mill we shall see ,1,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns, i would recommend a health scare to any man definitely puts things in perspective life too short to put up with this shit etc my fiancee who was cheating on me at the time she did not last too long once she came back to the states after my little stint in the hospital ,1,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,damn man sorry to hear that hospital sent me home too early as well did not have health insurance so in situations like that they are like get this guy out of here asap was not feeling fully tip top but the docs assured me i was all good ready to take on the world etc i stumbled out of there took it easy for a bit and then a week later stupidly climbed a single flight of stairs almost fainted felt like i was having a heart attack like i was dying called the ambulance back to the er only stayed a day the second time and that was another 15k or whatever added to my medical bill but yeah one thing i have learned docs are not really into healing you all the way just enough to keep you from dying right there in front of them once you are basically stabilized out you go then you are on your own ,2,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,absolutely knowing what i know now if i could do it over again i would have looked into insurance that basically er visits only i rarely went to the doctor otherwise and on those few occasions when i did it was always i have a sinus infection give me an antibiotic etc super basic stuff i would be fine paying out of pocket for that a walk in clinic visit might be say 50 and then the drugs are another 20 or whatever it the er visits that really get you so yeah if there are younger guys reading this and you are generally healthy and do not need to visit the doc too often and you cannot currently afford health insurance in america look into getting a cheaper plan that covers you for er visits like anything 20k and above you may never need it but man if something happens you will be glad you have it example friend of mine back in nyc well off guy inherited several hundred grand from his family was chillin actually thought he had health insurance but did not turns out when his company got bought by another company they dropped him without notifying him guy slipped on an ice patch one day fell and broke his hip had to pay for hospital rehab etc all out of pocket wiped out his entire fortune in just a few months all that money gone fun fact more than half of all bankruptcies in america are from medical bills get health insurance ,3,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,the pulmonologist who misdiagnosed me actually came to visit me in the icu i did not contact him one of the docs working my case must have tracked him down somehow guy just came in looked at me lying there shook his head and left i could tell he felt bad but of course there was nothing he could do at that point talked to lawyers about having the docs i saw before visiting the hospital pick up my tab thought their malpractice insurance would have covered that nope in america if you cannot afford health insurance you pay out of pocket the price is whatever they ask which is to say whatever they think you can afford and if they botch the job too bad you still pay anyway ,2,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,it only cruel from the male point of view from the female point of view it just common sense if your job could not keep paying you you would not keep working for free you would go and find another job if you were offered two identical jobs same tasks same responsibilities etc however one paid slightly more than the other you would take the better paying job it all about whichever work scenario imparts the greatest benefits to you that it so it is with women and relationships think back to caveman times a pregnant woman is totally at the mercy of her environment she cannot afford not to be hitched up to the very best possible man she has access to if bogg is not bringing home the meat he too weak cannot run fast enough to hunt properly etc she will drop him in a second for ogg who bringing in a fresh supply of meat every day even if this means she ogg 4th wife while bogg ends up with no one of course we are not living in caveman times anymore but our genes developed there and we are still running that 200 000 year old hardware kind of like why men are attracted to big tits it means the woman is fertile and can nurse children means absolutely nothing in our modern era with modern medicine but the attraction remains the same hardcoded into our dna see also high calorie foods etc ultimately the sexual marketplace like evolution like mother nature is neither kind nor cruel it impartial anything else you see is just projection on your part ,1,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns, often i look at the wives girlfriends of celebrities and think to myself that it with all the status he accumulated that who he ended up with i have met and interacted with a few celebs here and there and occasionally their wives girlfriends as well in every instance the girl just a girl nothing more or less possibly no one you would even glance at twice on the street but usually very warm funny outgoing gracious etc etc when these guys settle it usually with the nice housewife y type of girl and not their female movie star equivalent a supermodel etc of course the housewife type is no guarantee of long term success but it stacks the odds in your favor try to wife up a supermodel pop star movie star etc and you are just asking for the woman to cheat on you within 2 years or less not to say that male celebs are paragons of virtue but they seem to be better at managing a wife while getting a little strange on the side every now and again female celebs on the other hand have one quickie with the hot bad boy bartender think they are suddenly in love they found their soulmate and then trash their marriage to their celeb husband like a week later what if a guy busts his ass snags a 9 2 only to have her drop her panties for a guy just slightly more alpha than him a few weeks later this is a big problem i have with this sub actually i think the theory is absolutely on point when it comes to a straightforward how to increase you lay count scenario implement these rules however counter intuitive they may seem and see an instant improvement with how well you do with women got it did it myself still do it works totally on board problem is too many men on here seem to think that they are gonna hit the gym dress better earn more money master game rip their way through a few dozen easy lays and then wow lo and behold they are gonna meet that one special snowflake the one who not like the rest and then they are gonna settle down in an exclusive committed monogamous long term relationship keeping their woman devoted and faithful by using red pill relationship game strong alpha lead dread game tactics when needed etc and i hate to be the bearer of bad tidings for everyone here but it just ai not gonna happen you will get the girl for as long as you get her and when she meets someone new which happens every day and this person tickles her fancy which at some point very soon he will she gonna sleep with him and there nothing you can do about it does not matter how alpha you are how ripped shredded jacked you are how tight your game is your women will cheat end of story monogamy only works in a society in which the rules are enforced by everyone from all sides and breaking those rules results in severe consequences now that we live in a society where non monogamy sexual promiscuity is not only accepted but actively encouraged from all sides particularly by and for women it become quite a bit more difficult add in smart phones and mobile hook up apps which make finding a newer better partner just a matter of tapping your phone a few times and you have the death knell for relationships truth is if you have really swallowed and internalized the red pill if you really get the theory about what is going on between the sexes how intergender dynamics really works then you realize that ultimately mgtow is the only possible endgame out of all this consider hypergamy briffault law dual sexual strategy emotional primacy awalt add all that together plus the infinite always on connectivity that social media and hook up apps like tinder provide and the math only adds up can only add up one way women will continue acquiring new sexual partners at an ever increasing rate until such time as they hit a kind of time wall at which point it just a matter of i cannot fuck any more new guys this week i just cannot squeeze it into my schedule i had a new guy for lunch another right after work and another right before bed every single day this week plus a few more here and there that more than 20 guys i am beat i need to break for a day gotta catch up on my sleep all this will happen automatically by the way with ai digital assistants that will do it all for you women will enter their preferences i only want guys who are 9 8 or higher within a 20 minute radius and the app will just send them on over whenever she indicates she has a free 15 minute window to bang that will be it you will have a few jacked studs running around each and every city having sex as their full time jobs and all the other men they get nothing can you really blame women nope not all if us guys had the opportunity we would be doing the exact same thing hell some men i know celebs among them who have vast amounts of money and fame actually do this exact same thing albeit with escort services i know a famous male pop star who has la finest escort service right on his phone every night he just taps a pic or two or three and the girls show up they do their thing and then off they go so he racking up one or two new chicks every day at least but then you think well he a famous pop star of course he does that what no one considers is that all woman are now famous pop stars too and they act and have sex as such i honestly do not think the average man is any better at resisting temptation than the average woman slightly better but not much i have been reading tarot for 20 years now have had many clients most of them women asking about relationships but i have basically seen and heard it all at this point somebody asked me once men and women who cheats more and how much i thought for a second and then said we are talking about long term relationships here like marriages 75 of all men cheat 99 of all women cheat the querent asked me why not 100 of women i said well actually it probably is 100 of women i just want to allow for the fact that there may be one exception to the rule one black swan out there somewhere one unicorn a woman who never cheated but in my 20 years of reading tarot and interacting with hundreds possibly thousands of clients honestly i have never seen it nor do i expect to that

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,the best is how guys actually have to misspell words on purpose now when texting because to use proper spelling grammar and punctuation implies too much interest was having lunch with a female friend a while back she had a fuck buddy rendezvous all set up for that night got a text from him right in front of me rolled her eyes blew him off well that not gonna happen she said i asked her what up and she said something like yeah everything spelled correctly he obviously waaayyyy to into me this was the first i would heard of this was a couple years ago and as a writer who freaks out about typos i was like umm what best part was she admitted she intentionally misspells words on purpose as well so as not to telegraph too much interest on her end the whole thing is fucking retarded note also you must not capitalize the first letter of a sentence even though imessage will do this for you seriously you have to go back and manually de capitalize the first word otherwise too much interest and never use question marks implies a rising tone at the end which indicates lack of dominance no questions statements only it all good though i say pretty soon we will revert to some kind of primitive monkey esque emoji sign language at any rate ,5,asktrp
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,i think the key takeaway from the article is to look at that graph and look to the very right of the x axis where you see the top notch guys the fifth line okc uses a 1 5 star ranking system for all profiles note that at the top ranking the 5 star guys they account for 4 of okc male profiles now consider this the 80 20 principle often talked about on here applies to itself as well so yes 20 of the men are having sex with 80 of the women but then on top of that 4 of the men 20 of 20 are having sex with 64 of the women 80 of 80 is not it wonderful when the numbers line up so beautifully i think it important for men to self improve absolutely get to the gym lift dress better educate yourself practice a little game if it pleases you but gents seriously if you think you are gonna hit the gym for a few months buy a new outfit then roll on out and start banging 9s i have got a bridge in brooklyn to sell you again look at those numbers unless you are in the very top few percentage points of all men within say a 20 minute drive forget it you are out it ai not gonna happen that not to say it totally hopeless and you wo not get laid ever but i really do think people on this sub need to open their eyes a bit with regard to how ruthlessly efficient and optimized the sexual marketplace has now become for women particularly with regard to online and mobile dating if you are not at the very very top it going to become increasingly harder if not impossible to get anything at all and i say this as someone who does pretty well in one of the toughest smps in north america la one of my best friends is a beautiful stripper worthy of her own post surely nothing will red pill you faster than having a stripper escort for a bestie we were hanging out recently and i mentioned how if given the choice a hot guy a 9 would rather hook up with a 7 girl that available right now as opposed to gaming a 9 girl for weeks on end and who let face it might not pan out at any rate my friend was totally shocked when i said this like to her why on earth would you take a 7 when you could possibly have the 9 at a later date i told her look for men it all about convenience the sure bet particularly when you get older if a bunch of women present themselves to a guy he going with the first available one within limits after you get down to the 6s it like eh why bother but yeah a guy will always take the easier thing absolutely but to her she just could not wrap her head around it like why would you not hook up the best possible option if given the chance because for her that all she knows anything below a 9 does not exist guys who are 8s and below they are like furniture to her like a table lamp they just are not a part of her reality and what is really fascinating is how finely tuned the hypergamy radar becomes example a 9 5 guy says let hook up right now a 9 6 guy says i am busy let hook up in 3 days in this situation where she can only pick one let say they are best friends the girl will opt for the 9 6 she would rather be the 2nd 3rd 5th even 10th choice of the 9 6 than the first choice of the 9 5 i am not even kidding here i have seen this play out with her in person many many times that my friends is how ridiculously efficient the smp is these days roosh had a post once about how in the future the only guys who will get laid are the one that 1 do steroids 2 are mini celebrities and 3 spend their lives spam approaching i think we are coming up on that day sooner than any of us would like to think but yeah enough of this top 20 nonsense it not enough guys top 4 or better and really it more about the top 2 if you really wanna get going ,5,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,i am gonna go against the grain a little bit here and say this from the tone of her voice what she reported so far and the general slant of the story i am guessing that the older guy has in fact not actually had sex with the girl yet hence his willingness to drive all that way to see her i am a 40 year old guy i have much younger women in my life around op girlfriend age some i have slept with and some i have not but probably will eventually but the thing is once you have had sex with them even one time then it like meh whatever been there done that if they wanna come to me great if not i cannot be bothered i will just hook it up closer to home at 40 it all about a combination of ease simplicity and convenience combined with a desire to experience the new if i have not had sex with the younger girl yet however and she hitting me with we have to get together etc you better believe i will go out of my way to make it happen so she probably thinking to whatever limited extent women can think ahead in a linear fashion and plan for the future rather than live in the moment oh wow cool that guy i know who totally into me wants to see me we are gonna hang out and see what happens if he totally hot and i am totally turned on i am gonna fuck him and if i am not feeling it then i wo not it a win win for her either way possible sex with a new older experienced guy and if not that then at the very least an evening of free dinner attention praise adulation etc etc as for her past and the various narrative conflicts therein sorry op i have been there we have all been there this is a classic case of bpd borderline personality disorder my ex had it lot of girls i have dated had it actually us nice guys seem to attract that kind of girl the hot crazy slutty type and the symptoms are always the same her past what she tells you about it changes every 10 minutes it not you or anything you are doing wrong it just how they are prescription let her see the older guy make light of it poke a little fun at her if you want but let her go at the same time make sure she knows you are gonna be catching up with an old female friend as well and be sure to show her said friend instagram profile this will of course be the hottest girl you are connected to be very casual about the whole thing even if she backs out of seeing the older guy make sure you are unavailable on that evening anyway you are out catching up with your friend it is what it is oh and finally demote her to plate status remove all emotional investment if she steps out of line in the slightest ever like any drama whatsoever at any point this will probably happen very soon ghost her sorry man when it comes to bpd really the best plan is to just not get involved in the first place even as a plate ,3,asktrp

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,wow that sucks man sorry to hear that there is a silver lining here though now that you have swallowed the red pill or at least been exposed to it you can make a more informed choice re relationships marriage all the rest of it a far more informed choice you have access to information now about how the sexual and relationship marketplaces really work not how society wants you to think they work but how they actually work up until just a few years ago before i came here i dreamt of getting married one day this was my whole life up until 37 i am 40 now now i just do not see it knowing what i know post trp i just do not think it can be done you cannot unlearn what you have learned you cannot unsee what you have seen i really do think marriage as we know it will be extinct within the next generation or so it will be a good thing in some ways yes fewer men enslaved to the system for one but on the whole with the complete and utter destruction of the family unit i think our entire society is about to collapse and the funny thing is only a few people in trp see it coming ,6,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,these days it easier for everyone to jump ship at the first sign of trouble absolutely but two things to keep in mind you should have read everything on the sidebar already this is basic trp theory men and women love differently a man love is romantic sacrificial idealistic fairy tale if a man woman gets sick he will likely stay the course and see her through it women on the other hand love practically their love is one based off of utility off of benefits received as we often say here real love flows down men love women women love children children love puppies think of your relationship with your parents this is how women love men they expect to be supported taken care of they do not want their men to show signs of weakness think how scary it would have been if when you were 10 years old both of your parents came to you and said we lost our jobs it up to you to support us for the next 6 months while we figure things out pretty fucked up relationship right that how it feels to women when their men get sick get fired get depressed or find themselves at any other low point in life because of all this in general women are much more likely to branch swing find a new relationship at the first sign of trouble as opposed to men who are more likely to stick it out also consider this it much much much easier for women to find a new relationship especially these days than it is for men to do so like i said if you are a woman tap your phone a few times and a new great looking guy is delivered to your door in 10 min ready to serve you however you like if you are a man there so much more that goes into the process of course this is how it should be mother nature wants it this way men pursue women resist problem is now that the sexual marketplace has become deregulated as with any total free market economy all the energy rushes to the top in just one or two generations and so here we have a situation in which all women are having sex with and sharing just the top 2 of men trp keeps saying top 20 i think this is absurd it really more like the top 2 and getting smaller every day while the bottom 98 of men are left out in the cold so yeah get the flu you are probably fine get cancer however and your woman gonna bounce a sick man as far as she concerned is not in the top 2 and given that she can instantly have sex which in her mind will potentially lead to a new relationship with a guy in the top 2 anytime she wants remember social media we are all connected now why would she stick around and support cancer man when she could be banging cancer free chad thundercock that very night it sounds cold i know but once you understand female logic and how it all works honestly it will not only make total sense to you but you will see how it really could not be any other way mother nature wants it this way unfortunately we do not want to play by mother nature rules living like animals like savages out in the jungle we want civilization which ironically gives rise to things like iphones and social media this is why from the beginnings of civilization constraints have been placed on female sexuality virgin until marriage arranged marriage stay with your man until you die etc and severe consequences from women who break these rules it not about oppressing women it about keeping society on track and making it function because otherwise when you have a free for all like we do now women never stay with any one man for more than a few weeks they just keep hopping from branch to branch no relationship security for the men no commitment no marriage no family no children the civilization dies out we have seen this happen before a few times and we are seeing it happen now yet again the great wheel always turning but yeah if you are top a 2 guy and you do not want a relationship and just wanna hook up with as many women as possible it never been better and easier than it is right now same for all women but for the bottom 98 of men sorry you are outta luck and for anyone who wants a committed monogamous exclusive relationship mostly men in my experience but some women too you are also outta luck ,13,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,it happens it just becoming an increasingly rare phenomenon and a woman tolerance level for what she will put up with re how ill you get and for how long has certainly gone waaaaayyyyy down and will continue to decline ever further as we become ever more interconnected and a woman options for instantly acquiring a new mate begin to approach infinity if you are a good looking guy who killing it at work and at life and you get the flu and end up stuck on the couch for a week watching netflix chances are your woman will see you through it but if you get hit with something major cancer for instance yeah i do not know very few women these days would see you through that process i would think look at my situation from 10 years back i could hardly breathe for months finally ended up in the er almost died barely made it through and all i got from my fiancee at the time was soooo are you still gonna come to russian and marry me so i can get out of here no you cannot fly for at least a year ok bye that briffault law for you perfectly illustrated a few generations ago women did not really have any choice branch swinging just was not an option that was available to too many maybe if you lived in a big city had a wide social circle etc you had a backup guy or two if you were in a small town forget it everyone knew your business you were pretty much stuck with your one guy and that was that if he got sick you had to see him through it if only because there were no other men around for you to branch swing to these days however no matter where you are in the world if you are a woman acquiring a new gorgeous guy at any moment is just a matter of tapping a few times on your phone tap tap tap and look at that ten minutes later there a new guy a model he always a model ringing your doorbell ready to fuck ready to take you away from all that pain and suffering you are going through nevermind the guy who actually has cancer fuck that dude am i right ready to save you at least until he fucks you once or twice then he gone too but hey look at that there another guy right there on your phone ready to come over and ring your doorbell and this one will be different from the last one for sure it like it never ends i have seen this happen a few times now and at first it was pretty disheartening to say the least now post trp it like well of course she left the guy he got sick why would a woman stick around in a situation that is in any way disadvantageous to her remember as a guy you are just a job to her a means of receiving benefits if you get sick and the benefits stop then the relationship stops that it briffault law above all else ,11,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns, they only need to appear better not actually be better than you absolutely as we have said here often enough women mistake appearance for reality if he looks better he is better if he looks like a guitar player he is a guitar player looks like an outlaw biker he is an outlaw biker expensive looking watch shiny shoes he must be rich photo of him mountain climbing he must be a daredevil your comment is absolutely worthy of its own post by the way the real endgame of tpr mgtow i think a lot of guys come here to learn frame and game thinking they will run through a bunch of easy targets get a feel for the sexual marketplace and then at long last they will meet that one special snowflake who not like the rest tm settle down get married live happily ever after but not a typical beta marriage rather a strong alpha marriage where the man is the leader and the woman bows her head and does what he says dammit what is funny is that no one ever talks about what happens after the happily ever after part one of my favorite movies stanley kubrick eyes wide shut deals with exactly this thing is these days it does not matter if you are mr alpha awesome around the clock 24 7 at some point after weeks or months or years together you are going to slip maybe you will get fired maybe your business will hit a low maybe you will get sick and when you do well branch swinging has never been easier a few taps on her phone and my my look at that a younger hotter dude is on his way over to bang her right now and golly gee whiz there a pic of him with a guitar he must be a rock star so he clearly better than you the sooner everyone here realizes that now that female sexuality has been given free license to do whatever it wants whenever it wants to female hypergamy unchecked monogamy is now impossible in the modern age now difficult impossible that thing where she gonna stick with you through thick and thin it does not exist even if you find yourself married to that one special snowflake you are really just spinning a plate like you always were just one plate now but still a plate regardless or rather she spinning you and when that plate drops wow look out ,35,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,yeah the 5 minute thing probably deserves its own post especially now in the digital age when all of our valuable work etc is sitting in a hard drive on our desk i feel too many good things are being lost when people die without being properly prepared back in the day if something happened to you friends and relatives would go through your desk or what not and find the notes to the manuscript you were working on half finished paintings letters to loved ones all the rest of it now they just find a laptop with likely a password lockout that no one knows and thus everything on it is lost forever people really need to think about this the fact that you will probably die much earlier than you think it will almost certainly come as a complete surprise when it happens and when you do what will happen to your digital life ,2,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,oh i was the king of bp no doubt about it i was the guy who when i found out my best friend was fucking my girlfriend i would be like hah hah gosh you two wow you really got me hah hah hah seriously i could not have been more of a doormat you know how they have the darwin awards i have often thought they should have the bp awards as well just so we can all once a year take a step back laugh at ourselves and at the same time see how far we have come but yeah the funny thing is you know i do not blame her at all for the way she acted i really do not at the time i was devastated sure and even now i do still feel some emotion come up when i review my memories of what happened but looking back at it all now through an rp lens it like well of course she did not care i was just an expendable asset to her i was her ticket to a green card there was no emotional investment there i was the solution to her problem and as soon as i was taken off the table she was like ok we gotta find a new solution here that it i totally get it to be honest i actually included her as part of my 12 step amends process about 2 years back bumped into her totally randomly out here in la talk about a crazy coincidence all these years later and then i reached out and said look i get it now i totally get it and i want you to know i am sorry that i was not stronger for you back then that i was not more of a man for you etc etc i basically apologized as best i could for being a bp pushover not knowing what was up the whole deal of course she just kind of shrugged it off and did not really care the amends was more for me to clean up the narrative on my end but yeah damn remembering all that it like wow i cannot believe that i used to be so ignorant so blind so yeah thank god for trp this place really is one of the best things that ever happened to me ,1,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,i absolutely agree this was a more extreme case and it true that not all women will be this ahem practical about such matters but at the same time we must remember awalt all women have the potential to be like this just like all guns have the potential to be loaded ,3,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,my analogy was meant to reflect the attitude of you do not go to work because it fun or because you love being there etc you go to work because you get paid if your boss told you pretty soon we wo not be able to pay you anymore but we would love it if you kept working here for free you would start looking for a new job the very same day so it is with women and relationships they are in a relationship with you because they receive a benefit from their association with you much as your paycheck is a benefit of you going to and doing your job maybe the benefit she receives is that you are ridiculously good looking and she can show you off to all her girlfriends and make them jealous maybe you are quite wealthy and you can shower her with gifts though this increasingly is more a path to the friendzone than any kind of sexual relationship as women these days will peg you as a beta provider you are correct in asserting that women have their own money now and thus do not need men to seduce them with dollars in fact it often a turn off maybe you are hilariously entertaining and she just loves being around you because you are so funny the benefits come in a wide variety for sure but make no mistake there is a benefit there or the relationship would not be taking place and as soon as the benefit stops the relationship stops imagine a girl is dating a guy they have nothing in common they do not really like each other nothing to say but he in a semi famous band so she brings him around shows him off to all her friends repeats over and over i am dating a musician he in a band x soooooo hot etc then one day the guy is like yeah i left the band well i got fired actually they found a new bass player but whatever it cool i am over music anyway i need to get a real job i am gonna go to school and learn to be an accountant and that it no more music the guy done now tell me how much longer do you think that relationship will last answer it already over she not gonna stick with the guy while he starts his new life as an accountant the girl already looking for a replacement musician once you really grasp and internalize this concept us men we are just jobs to women you will see the sexual marketplace in a whole new light ,6,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,you know i used to think like you did almost my entire life in fact such a hopeless romantic when she down i will support her and when i am down she will support me because we are in love and that how love works a truly equal partnership and you know what it got me the woman in the story above not just once but every single time then i swallowed the red pill i opened my eyes and saw intergender dynamics for what they are and you know what strangely that terrible woman in my story the one i kept getting into relationships with over and over again not the same girl mind you but the same type of girl and the same type of relationship yeah that not in my life anymore and never will be again funny how bout that it almost like all women are exactly the same if only we had a word or some kind of shorthand to use around here to describe exactly this phenomenon hmm also you must be new here welcome the sidebar is over to your right please read before commenting ,1,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,indeed a man love is sacrificial a woman love is not i cannot tell you how many couples i have met interacted with where the woman like yeah we make a great team and then about a minute later you realize what this actually translates to he does stuff for me that his part and i let him do stuff for me that my part thus everybody wins and the funny thing is it actually makes sense this is how mother nature wants things to be the man provides and the woman receives the masculine puts out the feminine takes in even sex itself is physically set up this way perhaps then we just need a word other than team to describe the process if relationships were labeled more in terms of a hierarchy or a chain of command far fewer men would be left confused and floundering that not to say that there are not some couples out there where the woman is pulling her weight for from it certainly i know a few but i have to say it becoming an ever rarer thing these days as modern women become ever more entitled with each passing day i want the freedom to fuck whoever i want whenever i want to as if you and i were exact equals and i want you to pay for everything and take care of me as if i was your submissive dependent all at the same time ,1,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,awesome comment man thanks for posting and at the risk of sounding trite i am sure you have heard this before but i will say it again anyway i am sorry for your loss re your big brother i went through something similar about 10 years ago although my process was not quite as long and drawn out and i did not die obviously though i came very very close i was engaged to a woman at the time a young russian girl who i thought was the one so you already know where this is going was friends with her for almost a year before we finally started dating major red flag right there little did i know at the time dated for a couple of months and then she hit me with i am going back to russia to visit my family if i get stuck there you will come and get me right you will marry me and bring me back to the states right sure i said thrilled that my one itis and i would be tying the knot shortly of course the girl got stuck in moscow could not come back to the states visa problems i flew over to marry her and the authorities actually would not let us do it despite the fact that i had all the paperwork etc because get this they did not believe we were a real couple there another red flag for you when a total stranger does not believe that the girl sitting next to you could possibly be your real girlfriend the woman who worked at the marriage license office said come back in 2 months if you still want to get married then we will let you do it no prob i said see you in two months so i get back to the states start having trouble breathing i would already had it for a few months but now it was getting really bad like i could barely walk saw a bunch of doctors nobody knew what was wrong with me and then finally one day i physically collapsed just getting out of bed rushed to the er turns out i have the most severe case of blood clotting they have ever seen docs cannot believe i am still alive cannot believe i am even breathing they want to do open heart surgery asap like crack my chest open in the next 5 minutes and start scraping a friend pulls me aside and says i overheard the docs talking they do not think you are gonna make it anything you want to do in the rest of your life do it now you have 5 minutes i told my friend where to find the screenplay i would just finished and who to get it to then i texted my fiancee and said call me right now i am going into surgery and i may not come back out they do not think i am gonna make it she knew about my breathing problems and that i would been seeing doctors all over new york so she would have known this was no joke thankfully a new doc rushed in a minute later and recommended they put me on blood thinners for a few hours first to see if that would help dissolve the clot surgery postponed for now i am wheeled to the intensive care unit where i sit for 10 fucking days seriously people who would had full on heart transplants came after i did and then left before i did it was that bad the next day my mother arrives the hospital against my wishes had contacted her telling her flatly your son is not gonna make it come get the body as soon as you can i joked yep still here i guess they miscalled that one and of course all this time no word from my fiancee finally after almost a week in the icu i get a call from her how am i doing she asks like nothing wrong at all not a cloud in the sky still alive i say though barely i ask why she did not call earlier there a loooong pause on the phone and then get this she says baby you know how it is the phones here in russia that an exact verbatim quote i will never forget it never i say so let me get this straight i tell you i am dying in the hospital and you are telling me that you could not call me because you could not find a working phone in moscow i could not fucking believe it and then here the best part you are still coming to marry me in a few weeks right we are still on for that right i tell her alas no can do thanks to my life threatening condition which i am still recovering from i wo not be flying anywhere for at least a year doctor orders oh she says all right fine feel better bye and that was it so the girl i thought i was in love with was gonna spend the rest of my life with etc etc as soon as i would exhausted my usefulness to her i was forgotten in an instant the fact that i would almost died did not matter one bit briffault law above all else the relationship continues so long as the woman continues to derive practical benefits from said relationship when the woman can no longer derive benefits from the relationship the relationship ceases to exist if you are in the process of dying all she thinking is right this guy done gotta find a new provider let see here and the hunt begins anew this assuming she does not already have backup guy in place which she almost certainly does i like to think of is this way a woman finding out her man is dying is like a man finding out his job is going to stop paying him soon if your boss called you in and said hey man we love the work you are doing here but just to let you know we wo not be able to pay you anymore starting 2 months from now you would start looking for a new job right away right so it is with women and their men we are just jobs to them practical providers of products and services nothing more ,189,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,all the successful creative professionals i know which is quite a few do this honestly paying for sex is the cheapest simplest easiest way to get it yeah you do not get that connection etc yadda yadda but after a certain age and a certain amount of experience in the sexual marketplace you finally realize that so called connection is pretty much all illusion anyway better to just put it on the table and treat it like the business deal that it is then everyone knows exactly what is expected deliverables and no one is disappointed and like charlie sheen says they leave after this is a good thing ,10,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,wow i am surprised this is still a thing i am a 40 year old man was at a friend bday party two nights ago spent about an hour chatting up a beautiful 21 year old got her number have already traded a few texts date forthcoming was not a big deal did not think about the age difference did not even occur to me or anyone else there fact is women are aging much faster these days thanks to the millennial penchant for rampant promiscuity today a 21 year old woman has likely already had far more sexual experience and partners than a jaded 40 year old would have had just a generation ago women can deny it all they want but the fact is this does age women at a much faster rate you can see it in their eyes the so called thousand cock stare you can feel it in their energy and you can certainly tell in the bedroom a friend of mine asked me just recently what my dating age range was we were talking about tinder and he wanted to know what settings i was using he said for you like 25 to 33 right note he already assuming a much younger spread i laughed and was like bro 18 to 27 and to be honest 27 a little old for me these days really you want to concentrate on the late teens early twenties he nodded yeah that sounds about right re the post above it seems like it actually less about him hypothetically wanting to date a younger woman and more about him calling the women out on their double standard women hate this fact is if you are an older guy who dates younger which if you are smart and especially if you are red you should be doing it usually fine if you just laugh and shrug and totally own your process frame if you do not care then no one else will either ,2,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,6 years sober here i have written quite a bit on trp re drinking and dating etc i am also writing a book right now called 5 years of sober dating in new york and la all about quitting drinking and then dating in recovery so yeah this is very much in my wheelhouse here the deal you may not be hooked yet but you will be soon enough everyone addiction threshold is different but if you maintain a constant buzz on a daily basis you will move from functioning alcoholic to non functioning alcoholic in fairly short order yes it is easier to daygame and nightgame and any kind of game when you have that nice amazing buzz going on you feel unstoppable king of the world al pacino now sober said there no better feeling in the world than that feeling between the 2nd martini and the 3rd martini totally agree you feel invincible the hero of your own movie picking up women it like snapping your fingers particularly if she buzzed as well then it just effortless thing is though there no such thing as a free ride you have to pay the piper eventually you think you are having the time of your life but the sober people around you are likely looking on going hah hah wow check that guy out what a wreck what a loser what a mess you get a few drinks in and start hitting on that cute girl and us sober guys sitting a few tables down are watching like check it out the drunk slob is trying to pick up the fattie and he does not even realize believe me i know i have spent plenty of time on both sides of that fence your i am just buzzed is often everyone else wow that guy wasted the drunk dreamworld can be a blast yes it a great time but it very misleading you think you are making headway but you are not you think you are connecting with someone but you are not you think you have bagged an amazing woman but you have not you think your life is going somewhere but it is not alcohol in seduction is like training wheels it can be extremely useful at first when it comes to getting you out of your shell up and on your feet out there moving around mingling socializing cold approaching god knows it helped me a very shy introverted teen get into my first few relationships but eventually you have to take the training wheels off and do it for real leave the dream world behind leave the buzz behind and do it stone cold sober otherwise you will never understand what a solid real authentic connection actually looks and feels like when i was in your exact position years ago i thought i would never give up drinking i discovered booze at 19 at and went pretty hard for 15 years quit at 34 i am 40 now i definitely had a lot of great times for sure but eventually i had to quit eventually you realize it all fake it all reruns your life is going nowhere fast that and you just cannot take the hangovers anymore if i could do it all over again i would have quit sooner much sooner every alcoholic says the exact same thing oh and here the big takeway re sexual strategy etc why we are all here the sooner you quit and learn to game sober the sooner the quality of the women you are with will increase drastically trust me on this one girls you think are hot shit now you are wo not glance at them twice once you have got a year or more of sobriety under your belt your friendships will get better your women will get better everything will get better but hey if someone told me all of this while i was living buzzed and having the time of my life i would have totally blown this off too so maybe my advice is falling on deaf ears all i will say is i have been where you are now many of us have been there and we all agree that while it was fun for a bit it got very bad very quickly as they say first it was fun then it was fun with problems then it was just problems the sooner you get out the sooner you can actually start the rest of your life and if you like start learning game for real ,4,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,i had a one itis 10 years ago back when i was blue pill as could be made me wait like months and months before we even got to the first kiss i truly thought she was the most special snowflake in the whole wide world i remember going to one of her shows she a recording artist right after we started dating met this dude who i can only describe as the hottest black guy in the world of course it turns out that the guy met my then girlfriend while shopping at a target a little while back picked her up right there on the spot and banged her like an hour later so you can imagine how i felt after that oh and the best part she actually tried to go home with the guy in front of all my friends after the show was done i looked at her incredulously and she was like oh come on honey you know how it is but yeah that the lesson every guy needs to learn the one big one that will force the red pill all the way down your throat and make you swallow your special snowflake that made you wait for 3 months for a kiss and 6 months for sex or whatever during that waiting period she banged a chad 20 minutes after she met him guy picked her up off the street fucked her and kicked her out and she loved it more than she will ever love having sex with you it a real bucket of cold water over the head and goddamn if it does not wake you up right quick ,2,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,boyfriends are not really a thing anymore not for millennial women i am surrounded by girls in their late teens my building is full of them and the one thing i hear over and over conversations in the hallways at the fire pit on their phone whatever is always i am not looking for anything serious right now i do not want a boyfriend i do not want a relationship etc etc woman ese translation i am on the cock carousel and absolutely loving it now way in hell am i gonna give up the ability to hook up with a new hot guy whenever i want just to be with the same man over and over no fucking way of course it always really funny when i see these young guys also late teens come around and hit on the young girls the guys are always the ones pushing for a relationship and the girls are like eww no gross i will fuck you sure or at least blow you but no way can you take me out somewhere in public and do date y stuff with me forget it the one exception to this rule that i have seen in the past 3 years here in hollywood was when a young girl i knew hooked up with an extremely famous social media star that lives in my building then of course she changed her tune to oh my god we are soulmates he gonna be my boyfriend i just know it of course the dude forgot about her approximately one second after he banged her they never got together again but yeah one new guy a week is a pretty safe assumption i see that backed up time and again little bit less so for older women but anyone born after 1990 who grew up with mobile apps that pretty much it i will grant that some girls in way out of the way places may still be attempting to do the boyfriend thing but even then it pretty short lived no and they are still hooking up with chads on the side it just that their new partner acquisition rate drops to like 1 every month or so rather than the typical 1 a week ,2,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,the joke used to be take whatever number she gives you and multiply it by 3 then for a brief time it was multiply by 4 truth is though that only applies to women in their mid teens nowadays who for example might report less than 20 as their notch count when the real number is in fact closer to 80 or so after a woman hits the 50 benchmark however which again i would estimate happens to most millennial women by the time they are 18 years sold for some it even earlier like 16 all bets are off women just do not keep track anymore after that not even by a very rough estimate you could be talking to a 23 year old right now and if you put her on some kind of magic never wrong mind reading lie detector you would get yeah i have been with hundreds of guys could be 200 could be 500 i have no idea and i do not really care but yeah i do think this info really needs to be drilled into the trp newbies hard when they first come in here like that one special supposedly virginal good girl snowflake you have one itis for the one who 19 yeah sorry man 150 sexual partners easy and she stopped counting 100 partners ago and out of that 150 she remembers like 5 chads and that it the other 145 have been deleted from the memory banks of course as sad as all that seems fact is if we guys could get away with that behavior we would be doing the exact same thing imagine every time you feel like sex being able to whip out your smartphone tap it a few times and have a beautiful woman delivered to your place for a quickie she arrives in less than 30 min you hook up and then she out the door a minute later this is what it like for women now and it only going to get worse or better actually if you are a guy in the top 2 as the technology that connects us becomes ever more efficient at finding us on demand partners for the moment enjoy the decline etc etc ,2,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,i think the whole numbers thing as in how many men has she really slept with should absolutely be on the sidebar here too many times i have seen posts re oh my god i found out my 25 year old girl has slept with 20 men what a slut and i am like buddy assuming she started at 14 or 15 which she did she was well over 100 by the time she hit 18 at 25 she probably over 300 by now get over it guys figure it out eventually the radical promiscuity of today modern woman but sometimes it takes a while for the illusion of the special near virginal snowflake to drop away completely but yeah just wait until the next generation when we have ar digital assistants shadowing us doing everything for us connecting us to whatever or whoever we need in the moment women will get up to several perfectly matched new partners each and every week thousands over the course of their lifetimes and the world will change quite a bit as a result and not for the better ,3,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,women these days have about 1 new sexual partner every week minus the week they are on their period so about 3 new partners a month or 36 a year i usually just round off to about 100 new partners every 3 years this number goes up if she in a major city and up even further if she extremely attractive glad to see your separate analysis reached the exact same conclusion ,5,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,one of my favorite twilight zone eps i remember this one standing out when i watched them all as soon as the series hit netflix and yes i absolutely remember thinking we are totally going to be in a similar situation as soon as these elite sperm banks hit and every woman in america and soon the world ops to become artificially inseminated by one of the top few donors that are available do you want brad pitt or george clooney to be the father i am sorry these are your only two options one sci fi twist that will also become a reality as a result of this if two people do decide to get together and have an actual natural baby will be very rare but not totally unheard of they will have to undergo genetic screening first to make sure that they are not too closely related there a sci fi story for you young boy and girl fall in love in a world where love is not really a thing anymore but then they find out they share the same dad along with everyone else in the neighborhood and so they cannot have a kid after all imagine the dating app of the future it automatically screens out people who are genetically your half siblings cousins etc one could easily see with elite sperm banks a man having to travel halfway around the world just meet someone who was not his genetic half sister ,3,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,right there with you buddy as soon as i mention the internet company i used to run or more likely a friend brings it up in conversation as dhv esque as it may seem at first ultimately it always puts me in the beta bux provider pile took me awhile to catch on but thank god i finally did now i just give a much more vague i write and produce and then talk a bit but only a little bit about whatever project i am working on at the moment mention anything tech y or internet y and it like the nerd alarm goes off and she thinks oh you are a smart one eh yeah i will be keeping you in the wings for when i hit 38 and start looking for my post wall cash machine i always thought the promoter thing and the female fascination with it was truly hilarious i live in hollywood so it seems that all any guy does at here or at least that what they claim to do like so your job is to talk to girls and get them to come to some random club one night a week they drink for free and you get a few bucks a head and that it post trp of course it all makes sense these guys grant or deny access to the scene so they are flush with the kind of currency women actually want as opposed to say intellectual currency or actual monetary currency ,3,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,great comment i have been shouting very much the same thing from the ramparts for a while now myself i honestly do not think that society government really anybody aside from us few blessed souls here in trp has any idea what sort of absolute civilization destroying crisis we are in for here when millennial women start hitting the wall in 10 years or so and there is no one there to catch them when they do all the betas all checked out sorry ladies we all read the trp sidebar we are all good over here playing our video games which will be ultra realistic vr at that point complete with first person pov porn etc you gals just go and do your thing alone with your cats you stay over there we will stay over here all good alrighty then i am already seeing a bit of this with a few of my female friends i am 40 a gen x gen y cusper and a lot of my same age women friends are just now starting to realize in their late 30s oh wait i may not be able to pull this off when the girls hit 45 that when it really over when they know they are done but late 30s it like i still think christian grey is gonna come for me any day now fact is though a lot of them do still pull it off many of my female friends hard cc riders for 2 decades finally got off the carousel at like 37 38 married a beta popped out a kid a year later thanks to fertility drugs and treatmeants pics on facebook look great all good but it like a 50 50 thing now let be clear though this is it this is the last of it the last generation to marry have kids have families the millennial women those born after 1990 it just ai not gonna happen they grew up with social media wherein every single women is a movie star starring in the never ending picture of her own life i have posted this here before but i will say it again the average woman on social media these days receives more attention than the average 1950s movie star did all that praise all that validation all that worship they only have sex with alphas hell super alphas really they are all fine to ride the cc now but when they start longing for a little somethig more say 10 years hence really i just do not see it they will have a taste for chad and only chad and when chad shockingly does not want to settle down and have kids he just wants to keep on fucking these women will not compromise the heroin addict does not go back to just drinking white wine the wine wo not do it you either keep doing heroin and die or you go cold turkey and get 100 hardcore sober so it will be with the sexual marketplace these women will fuck chad as long as they can and then that it they will check out completely cat lady from there on out no millienial woman will ever ever settle for a beta those days are gone it chad or nothing meanwhile the guys will be happily drugged up and playing video games see the herbivore movement in japan and as no one will be reproducing the population will plummet japan has already declared a state of national emergency citing that they expect their population to drop in half by 2100ad i think that actually pretty optimistic i also expect america will follow the same route no one going to reproduce anymore the only way out that i can see is elite sperm banks a sci fi sounding concept which could actually work and be a huge business women ride the cc until 35 and then hit the chad bank get some chad seed paid for by uncle sam of course your tax dollars at work and have their chad babies also raised by the state more of your tax dollars at work the family unit done single moms from here on out of course one funny and terrifying side effect given that women move in schools of fish you know they are all going to want the same few chads with the 1 in demand sperm changing with each passing season you will walk in state a racial preference black white asian whatever and then the lab tech will say here are the top 5 hottest white chads we have right now pick one and as a result we will have an entire generation of babies that were fathered by just a handful of alpha dads a complete return to the caveman era here hoping one good disease does not wipe everybody out in a day ,8,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,this is why society is going to collapse soon as trp awareness spreads and more and more men in the new generation aspire only to be personal trainers standup comics musicians djs bartenders drug dealers etc basically all the female friendly gina tingle inducing occupations and the stem fields run dry because who wants to build the new iphone when your prospects of getting sex over the course of your life drop to 0 much better to learn how to pour drinks then your sex prospects hit the roof that when we are really gonna be in trouble societal collapse dark ages for a while then a new ultra conservative traditional society born out of the ashes happened before it will happen again so turns the great wheel ,5,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,beta males encourage slut culture because they think great more for me they hide their agenda under the guise of various pro feminist you go girl female empowerment mantras but really just underneath the surface it you should absolutely sleep around with all the men you want me being one of them what they do not realize of course is that women absolutely will sleep around with all the alphas they want one of the most cringe inducing examples i have ever seen of this was a youtube clip i saw a while back some sort of geeky nerdy comic convention that actually offered geek speed dating at the event so we meet this guy in the clip we see him chatting up this girl and he clearly thinking i am in i am no prize but then neither is she we are basically at the same level so we are totally gonna get together plus we have all this stuff in common etc etc meanwhile the girl in her post speed dating interview is like yeah i was not feeling it he was not hot enough too much of a geek dork nerd whatever basically even though i myself am an overweight female geek i am only into hot bad boys with 6 pack abs and the fact that this guy thinks he in my league totally hilarious and keep in mind the girl saying this was like i do not know a 5 at best all made up on a good day i showed the clip to a friend and we both had a laugh everybody wants chad he said even the fatties i said if only that guy could find his way over to trp ,1,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,i have never been to burning man but ever since i became red pill aware all i can think is you know the only reason girls are into this thing is that it like this extremely high concentration of chads all in one place for a very short time women always have casual sex with random strangers when they travel gotta bring that genetic variation back to the tribe and it ai not with irwin the aerospace engineer ,1,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,sometimes and i mean like very occasionally they actually do have boyfriends like guys they live with have been living with for years are in love with are engaged to etc etc most of the time though the my boyfriend line is just a shit test she referring in her head to that one amazing chad she hooked up with one night stand months before and now she wondering can you top that funny thing is if it the former situation the girl who actually has the boyfriend they almost never mention him he never comes up in conversation she lives with this dude all the time why in the hell would she talk about him when he not there she probably thrilled to get away from the guy for a hours and innocently flirt with someone else for a change if the guy any guy does come up in conversation however you can be almost certain that she just bringing it up simply as a hurdle a test for you to jump over here a great example was at a friend bday just a week ago stripper friend party was full of beautiful women girl sits next to me on the couch lovely woman we start chatting i hear my boyfriend blah blah blah in the first 2 min maybe the first 30 seconds i mentally roll my eyes whatever i know she full of it i wander off and a few hours later i leave with someone else next day i am chatting with my friend the bday girl she mentions that first girl the boyfriend girl i was chatting with and how she left with someone else right after i took off from the party so yeah point is my boyfriend means absolutely nothing if you are interested escalate regardless you will be amazed at how often you score ,2,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,it not the hipster thing it the brooklyn thing i used to live in nyc 12 years downtown in tribeca and believe me nyc brooklyn is the most advantageous sexual marketplace for men in north america right now way too many single women running around not nearly enough single guys case in point one guy i know friend from here in la he lived in silver lake the brooklyn of la dude could not get laid to save his life out here despite the fact that he was a cool good looking guy surrounded by easy hipster chicks i told him to try nyc he went met a girl within 10 minutes of simply standing outside a bar his first night there she walked up to him said hello smoked a cig she took him back to her place blocks away they hooked up everyone happy guy said he had three hook ups three new girls within his first week there no gaming required he just stood there and they approached him that like a year worth of game in la it all about the male female ratio and right now nyc is king for men with brooklyn likely being the best neighborhood out there ,2,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,there are different schools of thought on this but generally speaking i consider 60g of carb day my soft floor with 50g my hard floor and 100g of carb day my soft ceiling with 120g my hard ceiling so basically i try to get down as close as possible to 60g a day without going under though i allow myself a little leeway if need be arnold by the way advocates the exact same protocol get as close as you can to 60g of carb day without going under his attitude is you want to get as close as possible to ketosis without actually going into ketosis find that line and ride it right to the edge i think the scientific consensus is that low carb is 60 or less of your current body weight taken in grams carb grams every day so if you are a 200lbs male as long as you are under 120g of carb day you are technically low carbing it it a bit of a spectrum though the lower you go the more rapid the weight loss but then the tougher it is to maintain low energy irritability mood swings etc you just have to experiment a bit and find that perfect number that works for you though again anything between 60 and 100g day and you should definitely be fine for the long haul ,1,asktrp
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,the two optimal times i found to do it are 1 immediately after rising in the morning can do before or after shower whichever you prefer and or 2 immediately before your final meal of the day like right before dinner different schools of meditation have different general guidelines about this transcendental meditation tm for instance advocates 2 sessions of 20 min each day one in the morning and one in the late afternoon early eve while other schools think you are better off with a single daily session that more like 45 min i have been through quite a few different schools and experimented with a lot of styles ultimately you are gonna have to just get in there and see what works for you much like lifting there is no one perfect way some people like more sessions that are shorter others prefer fewer sessions that are longer these days for me i kind of work off an as needed basis i usually skip morning meditation and if i am really kicking ass with work writing etc during the afternoon i just push straight on through and do not meditate that day if i find myself lagging a little bit though in the afternoon or early eve find myself a little tired attention wandering etc then i meditate sometimes this is every day sometimes it a few times a week it just depends ,2,asktrp

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,in no particular order low carb diet get your body fat down women say looks do not matter but looks are everything lift get on a program and start lifting hard and heavy with intensity make it your church there is no one there are many ones abundance mentality if you like a girl go for it if she turns you down just wait another one will pop up shortly stop drinking this was a biggie for me maybe less so for others the sooner you stop drinking drugging partying etc the sooner you can get serious about making your mark on the world liberal arts useless i went to a great school and had a great time but never once used my degree in life ever go stem or better yet drop out and take the entrepreneur route learn a musical instrument again this is just me but not a day goes by when i do not curse myself for not having picked up a guitar when i was younger great way to express yourself great way to meet women drop people who are not your fans and i mean big fans goes for guys and girls if someone in your life is not a huge fan of yours cut them off life too short to deal with the negative the cynical the doubters the haters do not orbit women find your mission do your own thing if you see a girl you like invite her to join you on something that you want to do and are already planning on doing if she declines let her go meditate i have been off and on with this one but i will say that when i really buckle down and commit to a regular meditation schedule life gets better get your money sorted obvious in hindsight but i did not become religious about tracking money in and out until much later in life get on it asap find your mission your passion may take a few tries but if something interests you pursue it if it then bores you drop it and go to the next thing your mission may change a few times throughout life this is fine just do not waste your time pursuing things that are not and cannot possibly be your life purpose take more chances it a cliche because it true you will regret the things you do not do far more than the things you do do so approach that girl take that class write that book start that company etc hope this helps ,43,asktrp
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,something to keep in mind though from the final lines of the chapter bold emphasis mine but no matter how effective the lesson was i never really used it after that i did not enjoy doing it that way but it was interesting to know that things worked much differently from how i was brought up in other words feynman was blue pill all the way then had a red mentor briefly show him what was up ever the scientist he tried out the new hypothesis saw that it worked and that his old model of reality was in fact inaccurate and yet at the end of the day he admits despite the fact that it red pill tactics worked he just could not shake his lifelong blue pill indoctrination brainwashing ultimately he just did not enjoy doing it that way negging women down in order to get into their pants updating the worldview it a bitch ,16,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,also thinking about it now i do not know what my partner count is think we are closing in on 200 certainly it over 150 but out of all those women the number that have actually asked to me use a condom like it came up right away at the front end of the process i have to say is probably like 5 certainly less than 10 so percentge wise out of all the women i have been with let say about 5 insisted on a condom while the other 95 were like eh whatever who cares let just do this get it in i am std free and plan on staying that way because i am religious about condom use but usually what happens is that we are making out the clothes come off the woman just goes for it and you are like whoa hold on there slow down for a sec let me get something and then the condom goes on fact is in any one of those 150 situations i am sure i could have just kept on going finished my business and the women absolutely would not have cared at all i also recognize i am an exception to the rule lot of guys just do not use condoms and do not care and are somehow shocked when they get stds and or knock the girl up a month later think about that all those chads all that unprotected sex women are having all those stds getting passed around so yeah if you take nothing else from this forum besides do not get married take this use a condom every goddamned time no matter what ,1,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,the first shocker is when you realize that the average woman today has about 3 new sexual partners a month about 1 new one each and every week often with a week off when she having her period for a less attractive woman living in the middle of nowhere it might be as low as 1 or 2 new partners a month for an attractive woman living in a major city it often gets up to 6 or even 8 new partners a month 2 new partners a week the second biggest shocker is when you realize that none of these women ever use condoms some are on the pill to prevent pregnancy and just do not worry about stds they think it will never happen to them others do not even bother with the pill at all they just rely on the guy to pull out in time once you realize that the average woman is running through several new chads each and every month and that chad does not use condoms in fact women do not want their chads of the moment to use condoms as subconsciously they want to be impregnated by his seed it soon becomes clear that in the very near future you are going to have a few select std ridden chads running around giving stds to all the women in the world be right back gonna go invest everything i have in companies that do std research and treatment ,1,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,westworld hbo show is covering a lot of this territory right now robots that started out robotic metal innards but eventually became artificial humans basically indistinguishable from real human beings and so now what are their rights if any etc it a common science fiction trope been around for years but honestly as red pill awareness spreads and the sexual marketplace continues to evolve towards this winner take all paradigm one alpha at the top reserving all the women for himself a return to the caveman dynamic we really are going to realistically start looking at artificial programmable women as the only sensible logical way to date and marry in the coming years women real women will of course march in the street demanding the sexbots be banned but i think all it will take is one fairly good looking well put together guy who comes forward and says i am 35 i am a good looking guy who cool and makes a lot of money i am educated have a lot of hobbies great friends donate to charities and all the rest of it and i am a virgin this is a problem how do you propose we solve it and of course the women will have nothing to say they will all be busy too fucking the same 9 9 guy they wo not have time for the 9 5 and that will be that it will be a fight but a short one and once the sexbots come in that will be it for real women one sci fi kicker free sexbots except they do not fuck you unless you spend a certain amount of money at the local shop down the street etc as a way to kickstart the economy i think the women will be cool with it though after a while by then we will have elite sperm banks for the all the single gals who want to be moms they can go and get inseminated by the chadliest chad in the world pick your racial preference we will do the rest and everyone will be happy in fact they will laugh about how back in the day men and women used to court go on dates etc etc like wow what an inefficient ridiculous process can you believe men used to live with women who disagreed with them can you believe women used to bear the children of men with inferior genes just because the men supported them and so on ,3,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,this is the future of relationships for men and it coming sooner than you think as augmented reality ar starts shaping up to be the next big thing the defining technology for the next generation google is betting their entire company on this virtual assistants and companions will start to replace real life friends and lovers imagine you come home and sitting there on your coach is an absolutely gorgeous photorealistic girl waiting for you naked beautiful beyond belief and designed exactly to your specifications blonde redhead tall thin petite curvy whatever you are wearing your ar glasses so you see her glasses off she vanishes glasses on she re materializes she can hold a full conversation fluent in english better than anyone you know because of course she knows everything about you she the perfect girlfriend in every way you cannot touch her of course but then again when the last time you and by you i mean the average blue pill beta male in the bottom 98 touched a girl anyway is not it so much better to have a perfect gorgeous companion to talk to then to just come home to an empty house and then think about this wherever you are she is if that what you want not just at home but on the street in the store on that hiking trail she always there whispering in your ear teasing giggling wearing whatever you want her to wear or indeed more likely wearing nothing at all and only you can see and hear her all the good times you two have had all the inside jokes you both share and if you do not like her look that day tweak it do not like her personality another tweak she really is the perfect companion is not she never tiring always there except when you do not want her then it off with the flick of a switch eventually of course we will start overlaying these holographic ar girls on top of sex robot mannequins and then it really will be all over but that an entirely different thing but yeah it seems strange to us sure but for the next generation who grows up with it it will be totally normal in fact i would imagine for most of them it will be like eww gross you used to date real women yuck they are so disgusting why on earth would you do that and we will all laugh and be like i do not know son that a good question i do not know ,2,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,there a great quote from a course in miracles never thought i would be quoting acim on the red pill but here ya go paraphrasing slightly to play the victim is to do nothing more than to attack others while professing your own innocence simultaneously rape happens yes but it far more rare than the media would have you believe last i checked the doj listed the current rape stats at 6 out of 1 000 maybe someone can offer me updated numbers on this if things have changed that right around one half of 1 of the female population the fact is people who have been raped actually raped almost never come forward and talk about it i know this because i a man was raped by my older male cousin when i was quite young it went on for quite a while i do not know how many times it happened but it was a lot my memories are hazy i was just a young child my family was in complete denial about it and still is to some extent and no one ever talked about it ever least of all me being a rape victim it kind of like being a war vet or at least i imagine i have never been to war thankfully you do not go around shouting out loud about the horrors that you have seen you do not really talk about it all in fact except maybe with a good therapist you just suck it up and get on with your life roosh observation was it roosh think it was that all public rape accusations are false i totally believe it totally true my own experience as a young child raped by an older family member i think for men is actually much more common than society would like you to believe but we never hear about it certainly i never talked about it later on life because 1 we the victims feel guilty ashamed like we did something wrong though i would like to think i am over most of that by now and 2 even if we did come out and say something who would care society says you are a man we do not care if you were raped suck it up and deal with it so we do and society never hears a peep but women when a woman screams from the ramparts i was raped what are they really saying just like in the quote above they are attacking other women while professing their own innocence simultaneously the attack is sorry ladies but i am more attractive than you i am more desirable the alpha wants me more so much more in fact that he willing to risk imprisonment to have sex with me that how desirable i am that how intoxicating my body is the alpha took me ravished me impregnated me i am his i have his protection my babies will be safe this winter i am the number one bitch in this tribe and do not you dare cross me all of that is inherent in the public i was raped cry and then at the same time this but no i am innocent of any wrong doing i am not attacking anyone i am just stating how things are it incredibly twisted but as a form of attack as of a way jockeying for position it actually incredibly effective those who have studied martial arts will tell you the indirect attack is usually more powerful and effective than the full on frontal assault anyway yeah we have got a lot of guys on this sub i wonder how many of you also have examples of sexual abuse in your past from an older relative a mentor figure whatever and i wonder how many of you spoke up about it i am guessing very few and those of you who did i wonder how much society cared i am guessing not very much and so you just learned to bear it silence it sucks guys i know i hear you i have been there i guess you could say i still am there but it is what it is like a war vet or anyone with ptsd you just learn to live with it and move on as best you can it a pity though is not it that the women are taking all the headline space with their false rape accusations all so they can appear more attractive more desirable to their peers all that for a little attention all i can think is wow what a shame that we give them all exactly what they want attention while completely ignoring the real rape victims all the while because they do not have the courage to come forward ,1,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,had a beautiful plate a little while back girl absolutely loved sex we hooked up first night and like all beautiful girls who love sex naturally she was running around getting laid left and right which i did not mind except she just could not stop talking about it every time i saw her she would go on and on about all the guys she was hooking up with of which i was one of course but still laughed it off at first then asked her to tone it down a bit and finally i was like you know i really do not want to feel nauseous every time my plate comes around so i moved her to the back row occasional plate girl kept coming around though and finally i was like fuck this i gotta dump this chick she making me ill and so for those who have not yet learned the lesson re never show vulnerability let me say this when you are about to dump a plate this is a prime window of opportunity to have experience be a most excellent teacher in my case the girl was nagging me to open up with her a bit more telling me you are always so closed down around me etc and since i had no intention of ever seeing her again anyway i was like fine let test this theory out i told her actually i do have problems and then went on to talk about how my latest script did not sell for big bucks like i thought it would the film market was changing hollywood was changing and i was in the middle of figuring out how to adapt my career as a result of these changes nothing big nothing heartrending just telling her actually i do have problems and while i know i am going to handle them just fine i always have my life is not totally perfect as you seem to think it is she responded thank you for telling me this and that was it i never heard from her again female translation i thought you were the perfect alpha i tested your frame to make sure you faltered and admitted that you were not perfect beta thank you for confirming your fault so i can move on and not waste my time with someone less than perfect maybe back in the day you could get away with being vulnerable and confessing your problems fears etc to your girlfriend or wife and she would stay by your side regardless this is not because women were better back then it because women had fewer options back then they had no choice but to stick it out with you because there were no other better men around to branch swing up to but now when every woman has an infinite number of options at her fingertips via smart phone all the time if you show any vulnerability at all for even a single second you will be replaced instantaneously no exceptions never show weakness gents that for your close inner circle of guy friends occasionally and your therapist if you have one that it edit slight formatting tweak ,5,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,one of the most instructive moments of my life 16 years ago i was 24 blue pilled as could be had oneitis for this one girl thought we were going to eventually end up together was just a matter of time meanwhile i continued to orbit and orbit for months and months of course my best guy friend rolled in at one point nailed her after a few days and rolled back out returned to his fiancee back home a few weeks later i will never forget though at one point he literally swept her off her feet and made some crack like responding to something she said oh yeah that just what a slut like you would do she giggled she loved it days later the same girl the one i had oneitis for and i were talking joking laughing and i said almost exactly the same thing my friend had said just a little while before something to the effect of oh yeah that just what a slut would say etc she immediately hit me with how dare you do not you ever say that to me ever again i was floored had not i just said the exact same thing someone else had already said and in the exact same manner tone of voice etc lesson learned it all about the context the art is defined by the frame in this case it all about who exactly is doing the action giving the speech etc alpha man gets away with it beta man does not edit tyler durden of rsd actually has a great video about this how women judge men women double standards exposed https www youtube com watch v hgeo6ig8wsm in the vid his beta buddy chats up a girl makes some comments re how hot her legs are etc she shuts him down with how rude that harassment and then tyler pops into the set gets the kino in gets her laughing establishes the frame and then says the exact same thing the beta guy said and she like tee hee hee you are so cute best part is he actually calls her out on it definite must see viewing ,10,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,been waiting awhile for the new post glad to see you are publishing again i think in the near future as rp awareness spreads and men become ever more finely tuned to the realities of the sexual marketplace the only things that men will really need to study and the only jobs that they will end up pursuing are bartender drug dealer musician dj rapper music producer promoter nightclubs personal trainer jester dancing clown ie famous comedian on social media or some combination thereof perhaps i am a little biased coming from the la mentality all the men out here have already adapted to the above scenario sometimes people tell me that i am just blinded by the hollywood mindset my response is that hollywood is just a little ahead of the curve and that soon all of america and then the world will be in the same bucket but looking back on all the schooling i had quite a bit vs how much of it i actually used in life none of it and in particular how much my career success influenced my success with women not at all it like wow my god to think of all the time i could have saved knowing what i know now i would have dropped out of high school asap gotten my ged skipped college entirely and gone right into bartender rock star mode assuming my goal was to fuck as many girls as possible which back then was certainly a priority nowadays not so much this idea that society instills in you the notion of keep your head down study hard do not rock the boat get a degree get some more degrees get out get a job work hard keep your head down still do not rock the boat still work harder amass wealth amass possessions be a good citizen be honest do the right thing etc etc and then lo at long last women will find you attractive want to date you want to have sex with you want to marry you and stay faithful forever it just all lies useful lies yes without them we would not have iphones iphones do not get built by snake the tattooed bartender they get built by irwin the pudgy engineer but now that the source code is out and we are all reading it i really do think this is going to have vast damning consequences for society on the whole when every man in the world is a bartender drug dealer aspiring entertainer who going to be left to you know make society actually run we joke about enjoy the decline here all the time but me i actually like civilization i like air conditioning and uber and big flatscreen tvs those things do not happen without a whole lot of betas to build them and betas do not happen without a whole lot of the great lie in order to make betas in the first place quite the conundrum great post keep it up ,5,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,40 year old here live in hollywood surrounded by women late teens to early 20s can confirm there are girls who prefer younger guys although always a few years older than themselves but are open to dating older guys there are girls who prefer older guys but are open to dating younger and then there are neutral girls but the fact is nothing and no one is ever really off the table i have been with quite a few women in their late teens never had a problem never had any of the eww ick gross you are an older guy thing that i sometimes hear about on here granted you get a few looks sometimes always from older women when you are out and about with your much younger fuck buddy but that about it fact is if you do not care neither will they if you approach the younger girl like it the most natural thing in the world like of course you two should be together why would not you be then you are totally fine it all in your emotional state ,3,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,indeed guess that tells you a bit about the smv disparity with those two alpha dude was wayyyyy above beta guy in every respect so yeah he had no problem laying it down without fear of reprisal plus i think it may be a cultural thing middle eastern for them like it not an insult it a favor hey man to man just so you know this girl is not right drop her etc again lacking tact for sure but i get where he coming from hell i have been in beta dude shoes before 10 years ago might have actually been nice to have a big alpha guy lay it out for me might have saved myself a lot of time and trouble re girls that were just all kinds of bad news but then i doubt i would have listened just as this guy did not listen not long ago ,1,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,there was no possibility of physical violence just the big alpha middle eastern guy pulling aside the poor beta dude with the crazy girlfriend who had just minutes before fucked the alpha dude and telling him look your girlfriend is a whore send her back to where you found her obviously he could have delivered the message with a bit more tact but funny thing is i am sure the alpha dude thought he was doing mr beta a favor and in a way he was telling him i just fucked your girl she came over and blew me for drugs and then we had sex this is the type of girl you have on your hands you need to drop her like the bad habit she is different culture for sure but i actually applaud the guy for laying it out like that usually the alpha dudes just kind of snicker and roll their eyes when mr beta comes around this guy stepped up and was like no more denial buddy this is how it is i am telling you to your face it was not a power move i am sure he thought he was helping but alas it did not work any more than my multi hour red pill 101 talk with the guy beta dude still with the chick women certainly do not have a monopoly on the hamster ,1,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,well that classic af bb all those women you mentioned the ungrateful lazy chicks sponging off the awesome but beta guys the girls are all being supported financially and sometimes emotionally by those guys yes but they are getting their sexual needs taken care off by the hot bartender down the street our very own proverbial chad thundercock another couple i know in this building quite the opposite of the one i mentioned above is in an extraordinarily emotionally abusive relationship as well girl drinks is totally crazy has had sex with everyone in the building i am the only holdout it would seem guy knows it still takes care of her she lives with him pays the rent feeds her pays for everything turns a blind eye when she does not come home for like 3 days hell one of the dudes in the building even pulled him aside after fucking his girl he literally exchanged sex for coke had a mini intervention told him imagine a big middle eastern man saying this we have man to man talk now you know you girlfriend she is whore yes drug addict and whore yes you put her on plane back home one way ticket yes this was seriously the alpha guy laying it down to the beta dude like minutes after he would just fucked his girlfriend funny thing was i talked to the beta guy about all this one night soon after i usually stay out of this stuff but finally i was like all right man here the deal and i pointed him to the red pill gave him a reading list walked him through all the main concepts explained exactly why this was happening and how he could fix it my solution was to put the girl out on the street and start fresh total life reboot i talked to this guy for hours in my kitchen that night thought i had totally gotten through to him gave myself a pat on the back for another life saved went to sleep with a smile on my face next day ding dong doorbell rings there the couple the beta guy and the cheating crazy girl beta guy has this smile on his face like he got a gun pointed at his back and the hostage taker is telling him just act natural he looks at me and says sheepishly soooo we are back together yay that last word he just squeaked out barely so all my talk of the red pill in one ear and out the other lesson learned interventions do not work i do not care if the addiction is alcohol heroin women or men if you are a woman whatever the realization that you have hit bottom has to come from within then and only then will you do something about it everything else is just white noise ,4,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,by the way i should probably comment here the above example the alkie who beats his girlfriend on a regular basis not a friend per se i probably should not have mentioned him as being in my social circle he a guy who lives in my very large very social apartment building i see him around sometimes and yes we are all aware of what goes on between him and his girl another friend of mine this girl an actual friend who i spend time with who also lives in the building asked me once re the relationship should we do anything should we call the police what do we do back in my bp days i would have been all about the intervention etc now post trp i am like it sucks i know but there nothing we can do she a drug addict he the heroin she will never leave him never he will drink and beat her for a few more years and then he will leave her when he finally gets bored and trades her in for a newer younger model of course the story she will tell is that she finally found the strength to leave him etc but the real reality will be one in which he just replaced her effortlessly and that that like i said chaps it a dark world ,3,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,of all the rules we talk about here on trp this was the first one for me the level 0 rule the foundation upon which all others stand ignore what they say look at what they actually do where i and most of the blue pill world got tripped up for so many years was our oft observed huh that weird this girl says she wants a nice guy but then she only hooks up with dudes who treat her like shit the disconnect occurs when all of your friends all the media all of society everyone tells you yeah ok that one girl is like that but she the exception to the rule most girls are not like that most girls do in fact want nice guys you just have to keep being your nice ol self and eventually the right nice guy seeking girl will come along find you and you will live happily ever after and then you find trp and you realize oh shit they all lied to me those girls were not the exception to the rule they are the rule all women are like that the single most useful exercise i ever did re proving trp make a list of all the couples you know in life all of them rank each couple in order of how devoted is the girl to the guy on a scale of 1 to 10 1 being he a doormat she walks all over him cheats on him constantly etc etc 5 being meh she kinda likes him sometimes i think though she obviously looking to upgrade and 10 being she worships the ground he walks on would never even consider being with another guy etc etc pretty standard stuff now organize your list in descending order the couple with the most devoted girl at the top then moving down to the least devoted woman at the bottom now look at the top couples what do they all have in common most importantly with the top couples how does the guy treat the girl i could do the exercise in my head right now and i will tell you the truly hard painful truth warning gents for those who have not fully swallowed this is the last bit of the red pill going down out of my entire social circle and i know a lot of people with a lot of couples in there the couple in which the woman is the most devoted to the man by far a 10 on our couple scale is the couple in which the man is a full fledged active alcoholic and drug addict cheats on her constantly more than any man i have ever seen he literally cannot let a woman pass him on the street without trying to pick her up and he physically beats her hard all the time like no joke blood all over the apartment and on the floor beats her it is absolutely the worst relationship dynamic i have ever encountered in my life and yet out of all the couples i have ever seen or met when you see these two together you have never seen such worship such love such adoration on her part coming out of her from woman to man it is truly something to behold oh and the real kicker he a broke aspiring actor she a model from a rich family she pays for everything and supports him entirely a lot of guys on this sub i think and i was like this for a while have this mentality like oh i am gonna be the good alpha i am gonna enforce boundaries not let people walk all over me go lift go after my career goals etc etc the strong good man and that great more power to you what i do not think they realize is that the good alpha will always lose to the bad alpha does not matter how strong you are how much money you make how good looking you are how much you dread game her etc etc if she meets a good looking angry bad boy who it clear is going to cheat on her and beat her throw in a substance abuse problem for good measure oh so much potential drama oh such a roller coast to ride oh so many tingles i am sorry guys but you are done she gonna fall in love with the bad boy now here the really fucked up part all of society will tell you she a unique snowflake that most woman are not like that she has self esteem issues etc once you realize that all women are like that that they are biologically hardwired to be this way to go for the bad guy over the good guy that when you have really fully completely digested the red pill and what is left is a sad dark reality indeed ,15,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,countries all over the world have free universities is this really how it always ends up hell i met some scandinavian girls in nyc years ago who were studying there on their country dime and us americans were just flabbergasted like not only was their education in nyc being paid for but all their travel and living expenses too they were like yeah we are students our country pays for us if we want to go to uni at home and if we want to travel and study abroad our country pays for all that too as someone who dumped about a quarter mill into his education and got nothing out of it save a pretty awesome party that ran for several years and i want to some of the best schools in the world never ended up using any of it in real life though you could argue that my fault for picking the wrong degree i always thought uni should be free for all provided you maintain a respectable gpa obviously if you are just there to slack off and drink all day and you cannot make it in your classes you are just wasting everyone time and should get the boot to be honest this is a subject i wish knew more about had more hard data on and i do not i agree if there are limited slots and if it a simple meritocracy the rich kid is gonna have the advantage getting in because the rich parents are gonna hire expensive tutors to see that the kid aces the admissions process i really do believe that education should be the great leveler that everyone should have it starting out within reason if you want to go to rock star school that on your own dime but yeah how to implement it so it truly open and fair to all that a tricky one again how do all the other countries do it ,0,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,wow could have written your comment myself exactly glad to see i am not the only one around here feeling fucked out just turned 40 a few months ago found trp almost 3 years ago was already kind of getting towards done around that time but after reading everything here and having my lightbulb moment damn honestly i do not know how anyone on here can even entertain the thought of an ltr ever again given what we know now the philosophy we debate here our current knowledge of the smp and how it works the state of american women etc etc i truly believe mgtow is the ultimate endgame of the red pill i probably owe the sub a post on this at some point not the unabomber type all alone in a cabin in the woods mgtow but something between level 2 rejection of ltrs and level 3 rejection of all short term relationships and only polite civil contact with women i am still open to one nighters here and there and still have women over on occasion even a date every now and then but honestly since i dropped the whole gotta find the unicorn thing i have been a whole lot happier for it or no not happier necessarily but more content peaceful if a hot woman comes my way great we will see what is up sometimes we hook up sometimes we do not total outcome independence either way but if i have to pursue it forget it honestly i would rather push on my career work out hang with friends pursue hobbies etc etc women just are not worth it right now and this i think is unlikely to change in the foreseeable future in fact it only going to get worse and really the fact that more people on this sub do not feel that way it kind of bewildering no but then again maybe i am just the old guy now granted my partner count is well into the triple digits so yeah if i was quite a bit younger like late teens early 20s and had only hooked up with 20 or 30 women in my life and found the red pill maybe i would still be all about gaming women and getting them into bed as well who knows for me when it comes to women in general it all feels like a bad drug habit that i at long last finally managed to kick ,2,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,completely disagree i am usually about as apolitical as it gets but even i got involved a bit with this one fact is bernie was the only real revolutionary on the stage a man who gasp wanted to offer us free healthcare and free universities you know those things that every other first world country in the world has had for a long time now but some very rich people might have been slightly less rich after all that so of course he was knocked out right up front as for the trump narrative it easy to have iron frame when you truly do not care whether or you win or lose i had a beautiful plate for about a year a little while ago a 6 2 model blonde beautiful rail thin the whole works really liked her but just was not connected enough to her to push for anything serious we had almost nothing in common all of my friends marvelled at how easily i handled her my absolute idgaf attitude but i always just laughed and was like no you do not get it i am not mr stone cold ninja over here the reason why it so easy to own the relationship is because i truly do not care if we keep seeing each other or not really liked the girl sure but within our dynamic i was the one who cared less a lot less absolutely and so as a result i ran the whole show trump of course is the exact same phenomenon a guy who got into the race not only with no expectation of winning but no desire of winning either it is a well established well documented fact google is your friend everyone that when he talked to the kasich camp auditioning vps he told them your man will be in charge of all domestic and foreign policy he will be the most powerful vp in american history so basically the dynamic w shared with cheney w was the face cheney ran the show the kasich camp came back with well what are you doing to do then trump i am gonna make america great again ie i am gonna handle what i always handle and what i do best branding and marketing all the tough policy decisions i will leave to you i think it remains to be seen just how conservative trump views actually are we also have video clips of him saying if i ever ran for office i would do it as a republican because they are just so stupid they will believe anything and then a few decades later well look at that he got the republican nomination and won the election but for all the conservatives who voted for him ask yourselves this do you really believe trump is not a liberal really do you a man a wealthy elite in fact the very definition of wealthy elite who was born and raised in new york city my old hometown where let me assure you all the rich and powerful are quite liberal we just had a great post on here about dunbar number and how when you are a city boy you tend to lean liberal while when you are a rural guy you go conservative tell me gents honestly what is more likely that trump really believes in overturning roe vs wade banning the teaching of evolution in schools and that climate change is a vast liberal hoax which somehow every scientist in the world is in on or that instead he just told you all what you wanted to hear so he could get in the running and use the presidential race as a way of increasing his profile and extending his brand exactly as other rich businessmen have done in the past the pizza guy hermain cain did exactly this just a few years ago trump could afford to have iron frame in the election not because the guy got balls of steel but because he never wanted the job in the first place the run was just to extend his brand nothing more the fact that he won it by going to a few swing neighborhoods full of poor white working class people and pretending to be one of them for 5 minutes well that just the icing on the cake but if you think he has any interest at all in making or passing policy sorry guys he had 50 years to get into politics the fact that he never held office nor ever expressed any desire to serve ever in his entire life should tell you exactly where his real interests lie well that and him telling his potential vp i have no interest in politics whatsoever if i win i am giving all the policy decisions to you but yeah his winning the election i agree total red pill game triumphs everything even the facts even truth donald win really was just so incredibly instructive re gaming women and what we talk about here when we talk about sexual strategy nobody cares about facts least of all women the real reality does not matter we really are living in a post truth age i have seen a lot of this in la in the past couple of years every single young kid who approaches a female friend of mine is like yo i am a billionaire let go out or yo i own this nightclub come by etc etc yo i have a private jet let go to vegas these are obviously broke kids who just got off the bus coming in from nebraska or wherever the fuck do not even look the part but they like donald have finally realized that the truth does not matter at all tell her you are a billionaire and you become a billionaire then she can tell her friends i am going out with this guy tonight he a billionaire translation sorry ladies my guy is higher up the totem pole than your guy i win you lose the end the real truth that the guy is homeless and sleeping on his friend couch does not matter she has sex with the billionaire and then moves onto the next billionaire and that it the real reality never intrudes because honestly who wants that the illusion the lie is so much more exciting anyway yeah big victory for red pill philosophy all the way calibrate your game accordingly everyone from now on you are a billionaire who when he not running his vc is a rapper dj music producer motorbike racer on the side it all fair game now but the fact that our country is now about to be run by a guy who has zero political experience and never even wanted the job in the first place and will be handing all major policy decisions down to his vp a bible thumper who does not believe in evolution or climate change yeah that a little scary interesting times to be sure ,4,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,well that the whole point there is no getting there the journey never ends there is no final yes i have reached enlightenment stage like i said do not look too far ahead keep your attention on the here and now as for daily practice tm the first meditation practice i learned recommends 20 minutes twice a day ideally just before sunrise and just after sunset though the times do not matter too much on an empty stomach i did this for a while and it was a good start 20 min sessions are pretty easy to handle however nowadays i get more bang for buck out of 30 to 45 min sessions once a day mid afternoon it a nice way to break up my day there is no one right way to meditate just like there no one right way to work out but generally you want to shoot for at least once a day and do it as long as it feels comfortable 20 min at least and if you can do 30 to 45 min great more than an hour you are probably spinning your wheels at least at first if you want to meditate more than once a day great go for it if not keep it to one session a day do not get caught up in the details right now just get into the daily habit rest will take care of itself ,2,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,great comment re plausible deniability the only thing i would add is that while it might work to fly under the radar on the initial approach guys should definitely assuming they get past the first couple of minutes sexualize the frame as early possible so they do not get polarized into the friend zone before they have even realized what is happened i have approached plenty of girls with innocent indirect openers in the past the women always responded favorably but far too often when it started off on the friendship tip hey what are you reading etc it also continued on the friendship tip and then when i tried to shift the frame hey let me take you out sometime it often did not work out truth is most men overthink this stuff if you have to actually think about what opener to use you have probably already lost trick is to just walk up open your mouth and whatever comes out comes out it really is much more about the energy and the attitude at any rate not so much about the words themselves you are communicating emotion and feeling not information ,5,asktrp
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,hey if you are ever in la i am down for coffee re sobertrp aka aa level 2 it probably overdue i just do not know if i have the time right now to start and run a whole subreddit then again maybe it will be like 10 people and that it talk about exclusive working on the book now which is all about sobriety and trp perhaps when that done we can kick it off do not know if the book will sell more than a few copies but if it does certainly i will be sure to send all the readers to sobertrp then again i do not know maybe we just need like trp 2 0 in general like trp but without the sexual strategy stuff just everything else so you have regular trp for the i wanna understand intergender dynamics and use this knowledge to get laid crowd and then you have advanced trp trp 2 0 for those of us who are like yeah i am all good on the getting laid part now what else can we talk about from a trp perspective health sobriety business travel fun friendships family etc etc ,1,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,there was actually a funny post just recently to the effect of i love going out getting trashed and fucking chicks so what is wrong with that get off your high horse and stop judging me reading the thing i could not tell quite how tongue in cheek the guy was being but it got me thinking you know it is kind of ironic that though trp claims to be a self improvement sub so much of what goes on here maximizing the male sexual strategy revolves around the consumption of alcohol ie the more you drink and the more she drinks the more likely you are to realize your strategy and get to sex but then at the same time you are basically consuming a poison that puts on weight has all kinds of negative physical side effects my hangovers got very bad at the end and as for looking and feeling your best yeah alcohol ai not so great thing is though if i took all the men who would ever come to the red pill and then took all the women that all of these men had ever slept with and put them all in a giant bucket so millions of women here i would assume and then i said ok guys now go back through all these women and anytime you had a single alcoholic beverage at any point during your eduction of this girl take this girl out of the bucket sorry she does not count i wonder how many women would we have left i know for me before i got sober the number would have been next to zero and i was well into the triple digits at that point all of those women nailed while i was buzzed or drunk or in some cases even totally blacked out so yeah for all the theory that tossed around on this sub great theory i will say this sub has changed my life for the better in so many ways at the same time i cannot help but think that so many guys come here absorb some useful knowledge at the abstract level tell themselves ok got it abundance mentality now i am gonna go out be cocky and funny and self assured and non needy and i am gonna get laid and then they drink a lot find a girl that night who also drank a lot they fuck and that it another notch whoopie fucking doo thanks trp i learned so much repeat the process ad infinitum do not get me wrong drinking was great and god bless the people that are young and can still do it if i could still do it and have the life i want i would be doing it to believe me i loved every minute of it starting at 19 and running right up to 34 when i finally realized i just could not do it anymore i could not drink and manifest my health and career goals simultaneously it was one or the other so the drinking had to go tried to moderate that lasted about 10 seconds and so sobriety it was and then for the first time it was like shit now i have to get these girls into bed sober how in the hell am i gonna do that since i would never done it before nor seen it done i thought it was basically impossible that alcohol was the necessary ingredient to any seduction a few short months later though after i started dating again about 18 months into sobriety and lo and behold i cracked the code and started going out having dates having fun and hooking up all without the booze i also stumbled onto a ton of core red pill principles all on my own a few years before i found this sub talk about enlightening when i finally found trp then it was like coming home and then it was like goddamn i wish i would learned this skillset when i was a teenager maybe i could have skipped the whole booze thing entirely since i only drank to get laid in the first place so yeah definitely think a sober red pill sub would be a great idea fact is when you are drinking you are using the training wheels and while it can be great for a while letting you coast down the hill without any real effort never really learning how to ride the bike at some point you are gonna have to cut down the booze or drop it entirely you cannot party like a rock star forever and then you have got these guys who were in exactly the same position i was in like ok no more booze now what how do i this trp has mentioned here and there things like do not use alcohol as a crutch to get laid etc but i do not think the point is driven home nearly enough if you cannot get the girl without the booze then really you cannot get the girl it the booze getting the girl not you and something else they do not tell you once you lose the booze you may realize you do not even want the girl in the first place re aa if you are in and out of the program trying it for a bit then drinking then back in the rooms then out drinking again it means your bottom was not low enough you have to have had a really bad experience like life threatening usually before you will come into the rooms and stick it out everyone low point is different for me it was the simple recognition that i was wasting my life and if i kept drinking i was never going to accomplish any of the things i wanted to accomplish for others it losing a job or a spouse or god forbid killing someone in a car accident etc trick is to get sober before you are hit with that awful terrifying bottom the true hell of having done something that cannot ever be undone realize that the longer you drink the greater the likelihood that that moment will come and then you will get and stay sober pretty quick anyone want to start a sober red pill let me know i will be first in ,2,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,i wonder how much longer the red pill sub and red pill theory as we know it will continue on before everyone finally comes to the inevitable conclusion that exclusive committed monogamous relationships ltrs are a thing of the past and that furthermore no amount of sexual strategy however utilized will solve this problem this is just how the world is now this is what women want there no going back and going forward there nothing we can do to change it it is what it is op i am sure readers here in the comments are gonna debate ad infinitum what you should and should not have done but the fact is women are only as faithful as their options and when you take a cute girl and stick her in the middle of one of the biggest highest energy cities in the world one in which she has an infinite number of options then of course her ability to remain faithful will instantly drop to zero remember this it does not matter how you played your cards she would have cheated anyway there was nothing literally nothing in the world that you could have done to stop that that having been said nyc is absolutely the best place in all of north america perhaps the world for single men right now it really is a plate spinner paradise i do not know what your financial situation is but if you can swing a place there by all means do so every man should live in nyc for at least a few years at some point in his life i moved there at 25 spent 12 years there i am in la now and it was one of the best decisions i ever made ,7,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,two of my closest guy friends recently had kids one has a two year old daughter the other a one year old daughter both live with their girlfriends the mothers of their daughters and in both cases neither couple is married interestingly enough in both scenarios it was the woman not the man who laid it down up front we are never getting married period apparently both women had been married before found it to be absolutely hellish got divorced and never wanted to do it again in contrast neither one of my guy friends has ever been married each couple has been together maybe 6 years now one couple is still madly in love the other has their ups and downs but even the downs are not that bad just my buddy occasionally complaining that his girlfriend seems to be more interested in the kid than in him par for the course i would say i do not know if either couple is going to make it through the full 18 years of raising their kid i would say probably yes to one of them maybe to the other but fact is neither couple is married both couples have kids both couples basically present themselves to the world as being married when asked for specifics they have no problem being honest about not being married but if it does not come up then it does not come up and everyone happy hell last time i was out one guy house the girlfriend and he were talking about the phone bill and how much they would save if they were on some kind of family plan and the guy laughed and was like hey sorry hon this is what you wanted a situation where either one of us could walk at anytime sooo it was a funny moment but the message was clear because they are not married they are both in effect dread gaming each other indefinitely and as a result this is actually doing wonders towards keeping the attraction alive long term so yeah tldr do not get married not only is it totally unnecessary when having kids as far as the overall quality of your relationship goes it will probably work in your favor ,11,asktrp
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns, these days women are incredibly easy to get into bed and incredibly difficult to keep around long term even plain jane is approached physically in real life or virtually on the internet and social media dozens and dozens of times each and every day and out of all these suitors at least 1 in 20 is gonna be a chad ie qualify for i would fuck him in a heartbeat just being a woman now basically means you are a celebrity and you are treated to the same amount of adulation the same amount of fan mail that once upon a time only celebs received in such a climate then as a guy no matter how high your smv you are not gonna keep a woman interested for more than a little bit you might be a perfect 10 but after she gets to know you you are a 9 then an 8 she starts to see the real you with all your flaws meanwhile there that hot new guy hitting her up on instagram he a perfect 10 and it game over for you of course we on trp can bitch and moan about the state of affairs but the fact is if i had 20 women hitting me up each and every day and at least 1 was a genuine super hottie i would be fucking a new girl every night as well or at least a few new ones every week if there was one i really liked i would keep her around for a few weeks but honestly after maybe a month tops were things to continue at the same rate she would get lost in the shuffle as more and more new ones continue pouring in this is what it like to be a woman now are there exceptions yes but here on trp i think we should be all about playing the odds yes it possible that you are with a woman with a low n count who is not a raging party slut but generally speaking this is a pretty rare thing if you think you found one great just remember treat all guns as if they were loaded awalt yadda yadda re regional differences if you are a girl in a major city like nyc or la then yes you are going to have more partners then if you are stuck in the middle of nowhere a woman hypergamy is limited only by her circumstances by geographic and technological limitations take a girl and put her in a small village without a smart phone she will still be having sex with as many new partners as she can find that pass the chad test if it one every two months then it one every two months great that the maximum number of new guys she can find just through going out social circle game etc take the same girl and put her in la now armed with a smart phone tinder etc and the number of chads instantly becomes unlimited so now it just a matter of how often she wants sex there are no more artificial constraints time distance are no longer a factor and with most girls i find it tends to work out to about one new partner a week some get up to a bit more than that but one new partner a week is a pretty good assumption to hold ,6,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,actually that exactly what it does as a woman partner count goes up her ability to pair bond to fall in love goes down every single culture in the history of our planet over thousands and thousands of years has independently come to this exact same conclusion today we recognize it as a very real well established well documented biological phenomenon women just cannot fuck around the way that men can or at least they can but not without severe consequences men on the other hand are much more suited for a high partner count it not bad it not good it just is what it is the fact that we live in a world now though where we pretend that women can fuck just like men when in fact the biological reality is very different quite the opposite really this is what is so troubling and what is going to absolutely ruin the current generation and many generations to come and if you disagree please show me a woman with a partner count well into the triple digits that you honestly feel going forward is capable of committing to one man and only man long term hint they just do not exist ,3,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,i do not think it a matter of men wising up the simple and sad truth is that young women these days just do not want to be in relationships period roosh actually had a great post about this a little while back to the effect of we used to say that in the sexual marketplace women held the keys to sex while men held the keys to commitment but the fact is these days women hold the keys to both sex and commitment i read that and thought bingo could not agree more i have a lot of young women in my life and not once ever in i do not know how many years have i heard a single one of them say wow gee i wish i had a boyfriend not a one does not matter how high the guy smv is and some of these girls bring around guys that are incredibly good looking cool high smv guys no young girl i know nowadays would ever dream of hopping off the cc why should she why would a young girl today commit to only having sex with the same guy over and over again when she can have sex with a brand new high smv guy each and every night of her life all just by tapping on her phone does not make sense and then on the other hand i seem to have a lot of guys in my life who are like fuck man i am so tired of the chase i wish i could just find a nice to girl to settle down with and chill for a while and of course they cannot does not matter how high the guy smv is the option just is not on the table the whole idea of boyfriend that so last generation women are the new gay men there are no exclusive ltrs as far they are concerned the idea of a committed monogamous relationship is something their grandparents did something they have heard about and seen in movies not something they would ever consider getting into themselves these days it just a bunch of friends who occasionally hook up with each other and that it and this is how it going to be for the foreseeable future ,9,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns, women hit the triple digits with their n count before they are even legal these days i live in a building full of young teenage women hollywood lot of young aspiring actresses pop stars etc quite a few 18 and 19 year olds running around some as young as 15 and 16 gotta get an early start in showbiz you talk to or overhear the 18 year olds for example they have all been sexually active since 14 average starting age and they all have sex with a new guy every week or so and keep in mind these are the numbers they are reporting and by their own admission they are not counting handjobs blowjobs fingering anal the guy they hooked up with in the club bathroom whose name they did not get so he does not count etc etc do the math and you quickly realize these girls are at the 200 mark by the time they turn 18 300 by the time they get to 20 and again we are just going by the average number of new partners each month that they are reporting not the real number which as we all know is obviously much much higher i do not think society at large really understands just how radically promiscuous women of the millenial generation have become it is truly unprecendented in history and it going to have absolutely devastating long term consequences for our civilization over the course of this coming century and the saddest part of it all you meet these girls who are not even 18 yet who have already had sex with hundreds of partners and have felt zero emotional attachment to any of them their pair bonding mechanism is not just broken now it competely shattered and has been since they were 14 or 15 and you realize damn this girl is never going to have the love experience her brain literally can no longer manufacture the chemicals required for her to feel love not now and not ever my views of love have certainly changed since coming to trp a few years ago but at least i got to enjoy the illusion of love a few times over the course of my life before finding this place and having the illusion stripped away forever but these girls shit they are going to grow up grow old and die all never having once felt the love experience at all or even a facsimile thereof shame ,13,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,no one alpha all the time or beta all the time i am sure the movie star was pretty alpha when he cold approached her brought her back to his place isolated her made his move obviously it worked they hooked up and dated for months after she was clearly his 1 plate or at the top of the rotation years later when he wanted her back yeah maybe he was a little beta when he came out and admitted i miss you i have been thinking about you what do think about us being together etc compared to the waiter guy she was with at the same time who had the total red pill did not give a fuck alpha mentality this must have been quite a contrast and so of course she went with the waiter instead i do not think people are alpha or beta i think actions are alpha or beta and depending on what you are doing at any given point in time you slide back and forth over a kind of alpha to beta spectrum context is also key here plenty of great men who are incredibly alpha in their business lives and yet incredibly beta in their love lives elon musk is a great example of this ,1,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,yeah once i heard the phrase trickle truth for the first time right after coming to trp it was like everything just snapped into focus that described like half of my long term relationships right there they never came out and said i cheated it was always me thinking yeah i do not know she been working late a lot or she went to that party at the guy house and did not invite me etc and then you think about it some more and finally bring it up she always starts off with oh nothing happened silly grow up get over it i am not like that then it ok he made a move but i shut him down do not worry and then ok so we made out a bit but it did not mean anything i was drunk and then ok fine i blew him in the bathroom and then jesus christ fine we have been fucking for like two months ok are you happy now every time it always a ramping up to the big reveal and it always starts with my spidey sense tingling saying something not right here we all ignore it thinking we are paranoid but the truth always comes out in the end of course post trp now i just assume every woman i am with is having sex with someone else the second they are out of my sight which they are makes life easier and simpler ,1,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,actually the girl in question the hb10 made some very overt passes at me quite a few times over the years i always laughed and gently turned her down every time my fave we would always hot tub at my place she would shower up afterward and then prance around my apt naked seeing if she could get a rise out of me was not anything personal of course i thought she was great and like i said one of the most beautiful women in the world i just was not into asians i seem to have some kind of weird anti asian block i do not know she was asian so that was pretty much it by the way i am sure a lot of guys on here likely those with a bit more experience on the field can relate to this sometimes not often but every once in a while you just get an extremely beautiful woman who into you and you are not into her and there really nothing to be done about it you sometimes think you should be into her you try to talk yourself into it even but you just cannot ever seem to get there but you like her so you friend zone her and of course that just makes her want you all the more in some of these cases you end up sleeping with her i had an extremely beautiful plate for more than a year who was just like this right after i moved to la as far as i was concerned she was a friend i slept with sometimes a classic plate she knew this of course and wow talk about tension talk about her needing to overcome the obstacle but usually even if you have slept with them a few times or a lot even the sex wears off eventually and then it just friend zone from then on out re my stories the only thing i have a resentment about is the fact that my friend the hb10 did not get back with the movie star seriously i have bumped into a few celebs do not get starstruck very often but i really liked this guy and was kinda psyched to think that he might be joining my friend circle assuming my best female friend was gonna couple up with him but alas she was not feeling it so there goes my big a list connection there is a reason some guys make so much money or are so famous and that is probably because they are better than those who fail to do so disagree come to hollywood and spend a few years here working in the biz celebrity has nothing to do with talent hard work etc etc maybe 2 shocking i know but the fact is like 98 of it is just right place right time it a fluke you get struck by lightning some god from up on high likes you and waves his magic wand and you are in the club forever after that it i have sat on both sides of that fence better has nothing to do with it should you work hard yes but in the end that all you can do work hard do your best and just pray for lightning to strike ,1,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,i think it just has to do with drama and the basics thereof and what excites us conflict drama drama excitement and entertainment when we are really involved in a story a movie a book a game with a strong narrative it usually because we have 1 a likeable underdog protagonist who 2 is saddled with some kind of impossible seeming quest he is then 3 hit with all these seemingly insurmountable tasks each one harder than the last until finally 4 he gets to the end slays the dragon with the magic sword kills the evil wizard gets the princess etc etc obviously stories are the best the most involving when the stakes are the highest and the hero is in a situation where we just cannot imagine how the fuck he gonna get out of the trap or whatever and then somehow he makes it out the higher the stakes and the more dire seeming the low point the more euphoria we feel when the hero comes out triumphant at the end another way of looking at it is a sporting event if the greatest pro basketball team in the world plays an amateur high school team well that no fun right that not interesting we know who gonna win right up front but if the two greatest teams in the world play and the score goes back and forth back and forth and then tied goes into overtime that some serious drama right there some major tension and then on top of that imagine you have a million bucks riding on the outcome wow talk about investment i think relationships are the same way for women in particular they want they need the challenge the obstacles to overcome the drama the tension the triumph if you as a guy just show up and say i am all yours regardless of how much smv you have it just not gonna get her hooked but if you show up and say you cannot have me or even better i love you but we cannot be together because of x and y and z reasons obstacles look out you are gonna have a stage 5 clinger on your hands that shit like catnip to women ,2,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,agreed but then the security guard wannabe rapper was blue pill as well and still got the girl see that the thing and the reason why i specifically laid out two separate case studies with the same hb10 girl to control for variables i really wanted to illustrate here what is possible when you maximize this whole tension thing i would argue that in all of my above examples the only red pill guy was the waiter musician he was cool distant aloof obviously spinning plenty of plates of which the hb10 was one and all in all just did not give a fuck he liked hooking up with her but made it pretty clear through his actions and his general attitude not his words that they were never gonna be in an exclusive committed monogamous relationship unlike the movie star who just ran in and said ok let do this i wanna be with you forever and ever the musician playing hard to get was like nah i do not think so he placed an obstacle in her path gave her a challenge and she loved him for it now contrast this with the security guard rapper guy he too was blue pill this is the point i really want to stress he was blue to the core still believed in the whole disney princess fairy tale romance thing he was very young and yeah he had the whole bad boy bit going for him but between him and the girl he very bluntly told her right away you are the one i want to be with you let do this marriage babies everything hell he pursued her harder and in a far more bp fashion than the billionaire the reason he got her though when the billionaire lost her is because again there was obstacle in between them in this case it was not something he placed there himself on purpose which the musician did by plate spinning but rather the simple fact that he was just too young for her he knew it she knew i knew it we all knew it they could never be together hence the presence of an insurmountable obstacle his age hence uncontrollable passion as a result as she tries to beat the game that cannot be beaten just take a look at any romance novel this is the stuff all the great ones or at least well known ones are made of romeo and juliet i wanna be with you i love you more than anything but we cannot ever be together because our families are at war twilight i wanna be with you i love you more than anything but we cannot ever be together because i am a vampire and you are not and i am sooo into you that if we had sex i would literally lose control and rip you in half that how strong my passion is nope not making that up that actually the set up of that book 50 shades i wanna fuck you but no you cannot be with me because of my fucked up childhood but let me spank you anyway and maybe eventually i will grow to love you maybe in all these stories there always this intense attraction coupled with this seemingly impossible obstacle that both parties must somehow overcome the basics of all drama really the bigger the attraction the bigger the obstacle the bigger the passion and that what women really want and need at the end of the day so yeah even though our young security guard hispanic eminem in training pursued the hb10 in a very blue pill way he still got her because the obstacle between them too young for her was impossible for her to overcome hence oh so much passion of course it did not work out in the end but the point is we are here to talk about sexual strategy and if you all want to up your game and up the quality of women you are hooking up with consider throwing an obstacle in between you and your target your mission other women you are seeing anything you will be amazed at the results you get guaranteed ,2,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,i used some pretty extreme examples in the post above but even if we normalize it a bit i think the theory still holds think of it this way how many women do you know that have left or turned down the single successful professional works hard has money has a career he loves has great friends cool hobbies etc to be with the not single not successful broke unemployed guy no job no ambition no friends sits on the couch all day alcohol and or drug dependency etc i can think of many examples of this how many women do you know that have left or turned down the not single not successful broke unemployed guy to be with the single successful professional honestly i can think of none not one ever there no game for the women to play when they get with the single successful dude no barriers to entry no hurdles to overcome but the broke unemployed guy with a mountain of problems now that a challenge i cannot wait to play that game sign me up ,1,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,the most interesting thing to me in all of this in the two case studies i offered above the guys who ended up with the hb10 doing so solely by utilizing game and beating out the guys who offered wealth and status it like they were not actively trying to game her they were not thinking about it they were not working on it calculating it out like a chess game like some sort of grand master plan but rather the game all happened automatically like it was all on autopilot i do not know about the rest of the people here on trp but i am certainly not a natural i suspect precious few of us are or we would not be here studying i can apply game as needed here and there to speed along the seduction process every now and then but i am still pretty conscious of what is going on when i do it it far from reflexive at this point but these guys the waiter musician and the security guard rapper if you even mentioned the word game to them they would be like what is that what are you talking about it would be a completely foreign idea as far as they are concerned they are just being themselves and girls show up and there nothing to think about it reminds of rollo post on the alpha buddha that aussie kid that just had rock solid frame imagine talking to that kid about gaming women he would be like nah man i am just me you know they do not think about it analyze it it all happens automatically because of the nature of their dynamic with the woman in question both musicians both down on their luck both with troubled pasts both cannot be with her for x and y reasons so it like forbidden love etc etc that always the real kicker when you have the hb10 girl chasing the guy happens more often than people round these parts would like to believe i am sure you think damn this dude must have the most amazing game in the world and he does kind of but it always just sort of part of who is natural effortless oh the laws of power rather than something he actively consciously applies to his life on a regular basis ,3,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,yep the hb10 is getting on in years true she asian though so genetically speaking i would say her window has been extended a bit past when it would normally be closing that combined with optimal diet and exercise she looks 10 to 15 years younger than she actually is but yeah the wall comes for them all eventually ,3,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,yeah the red pill mantra seems to be looks money wealth status honestly though looking back on my own experience it seems to me like it looks game and that pretty much it wealth and status do not really play much of a factor in seduction and in fact as we have talked about in the past can actually work against you girl thinks your broke finds out you are rich and then slams on the brakes like whoa hold on we are not hooking up yet you gotta date me first i gotta extract some resources outta you perhaps wealth and status were more of a thing generations ago when women actually had to rely on men for money but these days no one cares i have seen too many good looking well put together single successful professional men lose their women to good looking fucked up not single broke loser guys with nothing at all to offer save a great story the girl can tell her girlfriends looks and attitude gents nothing else matters ,6,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,yep jail for the win one of the biggest dhvs you can offer a woman means you have a high risk tolerance willing to break the rules step up take charge etc oh so alpha ,3,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns, hmm if the guy had actual game as opposed to merely looks and fame she would have been barking like a dog for him in his hotel room whenever he snapped his fingers yeah i thought about that like well maybe he just did not game her properly but then he would already been with her for several months years before perhaps he already thought he was past that phase and wanted to just be real with her etc again beware the beta backsliding it happens even for movie stars celebrities are a funny beast they have looks wealth and status but precious few have any game to speak of i suppose they have a kind of passive game that comes from their supreme i do not give a fuck attitude but as for active game like approaching and seducing women forget it most are terrible at it it not a skillset they have because they have never had to learn celebs usually just point at the girl then point at themselves and then mouth the words wanna fuck and that it 99 of the time that works for them but then let say hypothetically speaking that the movie star in our example was in a complicated domestic family situation which if he wanted to be with my friend he would have to somehow extricate himself from tricky tricky he calls my friend and wants to know clearly up front if i do this are you in or are you out i mean i am not a movie star but honestly considering he had history with this girl i probably would have done the same thing i mean what is he supposed to do neg her she would have just hung up on him and been like wow what a creep so glad i am not with him anymore he cannot take her out date her etc because then the cat would be outta the bag everyone would know what was up so he really kind of boxed himself in with that one i do not know what i would have done differently in his shoes but i do know that the lack of tension in the dynamic was the big reason why she just could not muster up any interest any feeling for the guy how he could have upped that tension though that the big question i suppose she would not have gone for the mistress thing ,2,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,if you live in la and work in showbiz you will bump into these sorts of people eventually the really high smv women you are not gonna meet them out on the street at the grocery store at a nightclub at a bar at 2am etc they are all locked away in their ivory towers and rarely descend to mingle with the mortals trick is to set up your life in such a way that you have these women in your work and or social circle and the rest tends to take care of itself if you are on office drone it probably ai not gonna happen if you are a photographer whose job it is to shoot beautiful women all day you are pretty set etc re bad boy energy that a tough one probably my own biggest sticking point right now in fact i am pretty adept at getting women into bed these days when i can be bothered enough to take an interest but it getting them to stick around for more than a few weeks that exceedingly difficult and it pretty clear looking back on my dating history that my lack of creating tension in the relationship is the prime cause of them making a quick exit thing is though i look at some of my more attractive female friends and they are all dating these angry and not terribly smart bad boys these guys that are just super pissed off at the world they sort of just sit there simmering brooding and i think um yeah that not me i have had rough times in the past sure but i am in a pretty good place in my life right now i am pretty content so for me it like well do i act like i am really angry like these other guys so i can up the tension and turn them on i mean what do i do here and usually it just comes down to fuck it i do not care i do not feel like wearing the mask and pretending to be someone i am not and inevitably my plates drop pretty quickly as a result because well why be with the guy who pretty content when you can be with the guy who a total fucking disaster the latter situation obviously has a lot more tension built into it the bad boy thing then while you might mimic it for a few minutes it really something you are born into or you are not it also coming from a very negative place which is really not where you want to be i think the only way to up the tension in a positive manner is just to focus on your mission first spin plates and come in with an abundance mentality and that it fact is though you are still probably gonna lose out to the authentic bad boy i remember this one girl i was dating for a few weeks back in nyc years ago had a great time together but eventually she went back to her ex an alcoholic musician who beat her i tried to up the tension and keep things interesting but really who were we kidding the ex was so much more of a challenge for her i never stood a chance shrugged let her go and moved on but i remember thinking pre trp quite a revelation for me wow it not the better guy who wins is it it the one that creates the most tension the most drama the most conflict that always gets the girl food for thought ,2,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,it all about the validation aspect like social media on steroids all the women i know who are on tinder they are just there to see who into them precious few use it as an actual hook up app that one friend of mine i mentioned in another comment the extremely beautiful 18 year old she will hop on every now and then for like 2 min just to see who out there she will flick through like 100 guys and match one of them dude always a superhero in every respect he immediately responds with whatever pre canned opener he has at the ready but then she just giggles and shuts him down blocks him whatever these girls do not need tinder to get the lay they have 20 dudes they know in real life already lined up when they want to have sex they just mentally roll through all the guys penned up in their stable ping the hottest one currently available and that it tinder for extremely high smv guys to go slumming and match up with extremely low smv women really the more desirable women just do not need to be on there ,2,asktrp
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,i just thought it was astonishing that the guy arrived at pretty much the exact same percentage breakdown that i did and that tyler durden of rsd did as well check out his famous post the sex club where he also comes around to the top 2 of men banging the top 50 of women conclusion but again do not know if getting caught up in the exact numbers should be the main focus here just the idea that unless you are superbly hot dating hooking apps are not for you for the doubters out there i always encourage guys find the hottest female you know or hell any girl but it definitely more instructive the hotter the girl is and watch her use tinder for 5 minutes talk about a peak behind the curtain this will be some of the most useful red pill knowledge you will ever receive women just swiping right past guys that are obscenely good looking and high status and every great once in a while they are like oh look a chiseled greek god with a cute dog who rock climbing with his ferrari in the background i will swipe right and then it like instant match followed by 2 seconds later a message from the guy wanna hook up absolute total insanity once you see this kind of shit in action over and over again you are like well fuck it know matter how high my smv gets there always a bigger fish hypergamy etc so what is the point the real hilarity here is that tinder knows this all the dating apps know this they are designed to keep you single as that how they make their money if you got into a relationship you would get off the app and they would lose the traffic it all about dangling the carrot in front of the donkey cannot ever let you get the carrot though then you would stop moving forward stop pulling the cart ,2,asktrp
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,congrats on getting past the first 90 big step next checkpoint at 6 months truth is once you are done counting after 90 the rest of the year really flies by your one year anniversary will be on you before you know it gym is a great way to fill the hole left in your sched once you take the drinking out took me about a year of sobriety before i got into lifting but once i did i realized it helped enormously with keeping me grounded sober sane keep up the good work ,1,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,i put the link to the data in another comment here there are always going to be outliers sure i have been one of them myself point is tinder overall is not a good strategy for most men attempting to get laid these days ,1,asktrp
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,here the data i was referring to scroll down until you see the blue and pink graph tinder male attractiveness level females will like vs female attractiveness level males will like https archive is mcmmt pretty sobering info eh of course there are always outliers i would not consider myself in the top 3 but then i have still managed to match with the occasional super hottie every now and then it never goes anywhere however just a match and maybe a single text exchange never leads to a date i think the point to emphasize here though re the post above is that we need not necessarily get caught up in the exact numbers with all this the big takeaway is basically look if you are a guy unless you are extremely good looking tinder is probably going to be a waste of time if you wanna get laid get out and meet people these days that probably your best bet ,2,asktrp
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,they actually just published this data i cannot seem to find the link but basically it went in order for a man to get a match with a 4 he must be an 8 or higher in order for a man to get a match with a 5 he must be a 9 7 or higher and so on now when i saw 4 on a scale of 1 to 10 i mean that particular woman is more attractive desirable according to tinder and the swipes she gets on her profile than 40 of all other women on the app and less attractive than 60 of all other women on the app so for the guys if you want to match with a woman who is exactly average a 5 which is to say she more attractive then 50 of the women on the app and less attractive than the other 50 you need to be a 9 7 so literally in order to match with the very definition of plain jane as a guy you must be in the top 3 trp talks a lot about the 80 20 rule how the top 20 of men are getting with the top 80 of women i always found this to be totally absurd honestly my own pretty extensive though admittedly anecdotal experience with the sexual marketplace lead me to conclude long ago that it was actually the top 2 of men having sex with the top 50 of women and while i am by no means a player other guys i have known who might fit that description have backed me up on this when tinder put out these numbers gotta say i gave a little smile like yep there it is gents all the confirmation we need but yeah unless you are a professional male model athlete rock star etc with the pics to back it up tinder and other dating hookup apps are basically worthless at this point in time almost every guy i know here in la has long since deleted them and the few that still have accounts like myself do not really bother with them anymore maybe like 5 min a week tops just to poke around never leads anywhere these days if you wanna meet girls it all about daygame and social circle game skip the apps get outta the house do some cool stuff meet some cool new people and see what happens edit grammar spelling,5,asktrp
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,i actually tried that line a few times back in college long time ago back in the late 90s of course it was usually at one of my own house parties so all the girls were women i vaguely knew through friends of friends etc but yeah i think it worked pretty much every time of course we were all wasted and like i said neither party was completely unknown to the other these were all girls on the periphery of my social circle do not know if i would try that one with a total stranger dead sober but if you can get the line out with a straight face fire away you might be surprised at what turns up ,2,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,remember men are microwaves women are ovens the latter requires a little more time to heat up some women will let you know right away they are dtf it in the way they smile or check you out or maybe how they very noticeably get the kino in right away i have always found on dates sitting next to a girl at the bar if she touches my arm or leg at any point during the date i am definitely sleeping with her that night but most women you will end up sleeping with over the course of your life you wo not really know for sure if they are into you right away it will take a little while longer maybe 30 min maybe 2 or 3 hours of course you will always know for sure after several hours tops 7 hours is a good checkpoint as i mentioned in another comment but if you are nexting women after just 2 minutes because well she clearly was not into me and i did not want to waste my time you are almost certainly dropping some potentially perfectly good plates do not waste your time yes i agree but do not next out on a girl just because she is not sucking your dick in the bathroom 5 minutes after you meet her at the bar give it a little time see what develops ,7,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns, fuck her first friend her later my entire life i always tried to friend em first and then fuck em later thing is if you are successful at the first one you will never get to the second looking back all the women i had the sex always came first and then the relationship if there was one after i have talked about this before but most women are comfortable having sex after knowing you for about 7 hours in many cases you can even get this down to 3 or 4 anything less usually requires quite a bit of intoxication but hey if you are wasted enough you can bang em after 20 mins or even 10 seconds just depends on the intoxication level of both parties assuming you are relatively sober however i do not drink these days so this is my camp 7 to 10 hours is the prime window of sexual opportunity it not an accident that 3 separate dates will take about 7 to 10 hours total running time hence the three date rule this is followed by the danger zone of 10 to 15 hours if you have known her for between 10 to 15 hours you can still make your move and get her into bed but it tricky she thinking i was ready hours ago why has not this guy made his move yet hmm maybe he a beta and i better make my exit and if you wait more than 15 hours to make your move forget it you are done she now polarized you into the friend zone an alpha would not have waited that long so clearly you are not an alpha but a beta hence no sex for you we talk about this here all the time but it bears repeating get to rejection quickly that not to say that you should walk up to every cute girl you see and say nice shoes wanna fuck and if she scowls just roll your eyes and say next and move onto the next one you need to apply a little bit of artistry here a little flirtation a little give and take a little push pull seduction is a game a tennis match serve volley etc etc it supposed to be fun shocking i know and as such you need to allow the interaction a little room to breathe and to escalate but that having been said far too many men and i am guilty of this myself a lot take way too much time to start the escalation and then waaaaayyyyy too much time on top of that to clearly push further into the i am interested in being more than just friends category thing is when you realize that you are probably good to go re upping the escalation after 3 to 4 hours of interaction and definitely good to go re full on sex after 7 hours then there no reason to wait any longer than that just get to it and make your move in a cool confident manner if she rejects you great you have just saved yourself a ton of time money and energy pursuing someone who was not into you in the first place and if she does not well then that what we are all here for right ,21,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,that happens to everyone you have a bad experience you swear never again i am done for good this time a few weeks or months or years go by the memories of how awful that bottom was fade and you think ok it been a while now i got this i can control it this time and then you go out and start drinking again what happens when all these people relapse it always the same single stunning realization oh shit there no reset i took years off from drinking and now after one drink i am back to exactly where i was when i quit several years ago the big book has a great example of this guy was a raging alcoholic quit for like 19 years or whatever it was really long time finally thought ok it been a looooooong time i got this started drinking again he was dead from alcoholism a few months later this happens to everyone everyone thinks the alcohol meter drops back down to zero with enough time off and so they can go back out and drink like normal people once more every meeting i have been to where someone spoke about their relapse their stories are all exactly the same they took years off got sober did 12 steps did everything figured they had it handled figured oh it just one beer why not and 2 weeks later they are in the er having their stomachs pumped lest they die from alcohol poisoning it scary shit and one of the benefits of aa meetings is that hearing these horror stories over and over again it definitely helps to keep your desire to relapse in check remember one day at time just think ok today i am not gonna drink do that everyday and you will make great strides ,1,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns, it also hard to learn to drive the thing with no other driver around to even give you a clue how it works and it especially hard when everyone around you is not a race car driver has never been and never will be a race car driver and yet they all tell you exactly how you should be driving the thing even though they have never even been in one themselves turn the steering wheel to the left in order to turn right etc you follow their instructions and keep crashing and then finally you wake up and realize holy shit they have just been lying to me all this time not necessarily intentionally mind you they really thought they knew how to drive the car i mean they have seen it done on tv but yeah from now i am only listening to those who have a proven track record in racing and who are faster than me with a crash free record that for sure anyway i think we have beaten that metaphor to death but yeah thank god for this place finally some men got together and started comparing notes re what is actually happening and what actually works in the sexual marketplace re being if maximum service you cannot do that if you are bogged down in a dysfunctional parasitic relationship then again one might argue after having spent enough time on trp that you cannot do that if you are bogged down in any kind of committed monogamous relationship whatsoever there was a great post from a little while back re all the great men throughout history basically saying if you get married you cannot develop your mind to its fullest potential cannot pursue your art all the way cannot build your business all the way on the one hand a lot of the artists i admire kubrick for instance they all got married right away and that was it kubrick had a few marriages as did james cameron another hero of mine but they all bounced from one marriage to another very quickly one thing they did not do is spend all this time hunting around in the sexual marketplace going out night after night looking for conquests hoping to find the one always disappointed instead it get married get back to work looking back on my own life i wonder how much further ahead i would be right now not if i was married necessarily but if i would checked out of the sexual marketplace say 15 years ago at 25 rather than just recently i do not know food for thought but yeah if you have really digested the red pill i think ultimately you realize that any real ltr in today modern dating climate is basically impossible i know i know i too dreamt of that great sober girl that i could do the whole aa thing with and then go out for coffee with after i even had that at one point we were gonna get married and everything then she ghosted me 6 months later but now i do not know man if you really want to be of maximum service maybe consider the fact that the many hours you will spend supporting an ltr that will likely not even be of any benefit to you whatsoever could instead be many many hours spent helping other alcoholics get sober helping other trp newbies see the truth etc etc something to think about but yeah glad you are doing aa and it working for you like i said never was quite my cup of tea but i do still pop into the occasional meeting every now and then may even hit one soon we will see ,1,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,yep a lot of my life repair revolved around women too a few i did not treat as well as i should have but the overwhelming vast majority obviously was me forgiving women that had traumatized me in the past either face to face or in some cases when i reached out and never heard back simply doing the best i could to forgive them offer an amends in a kind of one way conversation and then moving on with my life funny thing is if i would known of the red pill if it had existed when i was in my early to mid teens i could have skipped almost all the female trauma over the next few decades entirely it like getting in the race car not knowing how it works not knowing how dangerous it can be driving far too fast crashing right and left but somehow always surviving though not without broken bones and scars aplenty you finally concede you have to give up driving the race car because you know you will die otherwise and then after all that you finally get the fucking instruction manual and it like oh that how it supposed to work i was applying the brakes all wrong not taking corners correctly and my gear shifting was completely out of whack truly like a cosmic joke the fact that i now finally know how to drive women thanks to trp and yet i just do not care anymore though perhaps the former is a direct cause of the latter who knows congrats on nexting the ltr if you are sober and she a big drinker it just is not going to work no exceptions ever you can be sober and date someone who has a drink every once in a while but if she boozing hard and you are in recovery nope not gonna happen next re aa level 2 for men trp is i think the beginning of something fact is though i feel like most of the readers on here depend way too much on alcohol to get the bang if i may be so crude and would be terrified of trying a single cold approach dead sober let alone imagine bedding women and spinning plates on a regular basis all sober i know it took me years to push through all that and if i did not have to give up drinking i would absolutely still be using it to fuel all of my seductions so many guys on here are like yeah man i went out last night met this chick brought her back to mine and fucked her brains out i smashed it i destroyed it i am a red pill seduction god and i am like no wait actually here what i suspect really happened you got wasted she got wasted you both were wasted you fucked neither one of you really remembers any of it the end that not gaming that movie watching that you sitting back and passively observing your life unfold before you wild as it may seem once you get sober you realize you were not in control of any of it it was all auto pilot you were just along for the ride so yeah maybe a sobertrp subreddit is due who knows certainly i would be the first to subscribe ,3,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,sounds like you have not truly hit bottom yet which is why you are still occasionally relapsing once you have that one experience where you are like my god this is so bad that it come to this i will do anything to get sober in fact i would rather die than continue drinking that when sobriety sort of happens automatically and like i said it does not have to be your wife leaving you or you losing a job or burning down the house for me it was just the recognition that i was never going to do anything with my life never going to realize my dreams if i did not quit drinking entirely for other people though it not until they are out on the street homeless before they have that light bulb moment it just depends if you were a big party guy and that was basically your whole identity then yeah you are basically starting back at zero when you quit drinking i was in the exact same boat my whole life all my friends it all revolved around booze so when i quit it was like i had to rebuild my entire personality from scratch at first it was kind of terrifying but then once i realized wow all this freedom i have i can be anyone now i can do anything there are no limits that when it actually became kind of exciting it really was like starting a whole new life so think of sobriety as starting a fresh chapter or indeed a whole new book and not losing an old one and besides did you really want the old one anyway have not you been there done that are not you over it by now keep getting out there try some aa meetings if you like make some sober friends if you keep relapsing when going out with your drinking buddies then stop going out with you drinking buddies simple enough everyone triggers are different i had no problem hanging with my old crew and remaining sober other people cannot even step into a bar or hell even walk by a bar without drinking again it just depends ,2,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,yeah looking back it hard to believe i used to push my way into these unbelievably crowded tiny dark obscenely loud little bars wait 15 minutes to get my 25 drink after tipping out all so i could maybe have a shot at chatting up a random not so attractive girl for just a few seconds once you get sober you realize the whole system really is rigged against you it not designed to help you have fun and get laid it designed to fool you into thinking that a totally miserable experience is actually a fun time when it is not and the whole hang out here drink enough and maybe you will get laid thing is just the carrot on the stick to make the donkey move or in this case the promise of the banana to part the monkey from his money once you realize you do not need the booze to talk to the girls then you realize oh i do not need the bars the clubs i do not need to wait in line and spend the money i do not need any of that i do still go out though not as often as i used to but now when i do it all on my terms which i quite prefer ,2,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,yeah once you realize you are in reruns same night out same people same conversations same jokes over and over again like a hamster on a hamster wheel just running place that when you realize you have to quit if you want to make any real forward progress in your life ,2,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns, my social circle has decreased dramatically down to personal choice i now only surround myself with my true life long friends which are few as a therapist of mine once said i would rather have 2 good friends than 20 bad ones congrats on whittling down the circle too many people these days have too many fairweather friends and not enough true hardcore mates that will really have your back when the chips are down when i was younger and boozing i wanted to see how many friends i could have making up for my lonely isolated childhood when i did not really have any now that i am older and sober it like you gotta really be in it to win it if you wanna be in my circle be a part of my world much like with my women in fact the application process and my own qualification process is a lot longer and more involved than it used to be all for the better it really is eye opening once you climb out of the abyss and see things the self destructive behaviours of yourself and those of the people around you for what they really are absolutely once you sober up it hard not to look around you at all the drunk hijinks going on and feel a little bit queasy a little ill i can never judge though i get it that used to be me now when i see drunk people out and about lot of young girls here in hollywood who are just completely wasted all the time total trainwrecks i just kind of shrug and laugh it off like well i hope she figures it out sooner rather than later i do not begrudge them their fun but i am also so glad i am not a part of that world anymore coffee the bomb for sure re gambling be careful you do not trade one addiction for another it is very common for people who quit drinking to suddenly get into another vice sex with prostitutes gambling overeating etc etc it like that game whack a mole you whack down one addiction but then another one pop ups right next to it do be sure to stay on top of that and keep the demon in check ,3,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns, i have actually gone over some triggers of mine over the last few years for me it when i am lonely when i am sad when i am depressed or when i am isolated one of the more useful tools i took from aa a little phrase called h a l t stands for hungry angry lonely tired as in you are much more likely to drink or relapse if you have been sober if you are undergoing any of the aforementioned and if you have more than one in play at the same time you are really far more likely to drink so stay fed keep your blood sugar up get your sleep do not isolate get around people and so on can totally relate to drinking having friends and not being alone i was always the shy quiet kid growing up was never quite a nerd but never really fit in with any crowd either just had a few friends but no one really close was very much an outsider lot of time alone single mother who never paid attention no siblings lot of books and video games that was me until i went off to college early at 16 few more friends then but still generally isolated it was not until i discovered alcohol at 19 that it was like wow holy shit i am suddenly mr popular the life of the party so this is what it like to have fun to have friends to socialize to have sex as you can imagine i converted from non drinker to big time everyday drinker over the course of about one single evening and i never looked back at least not for 15 years then i finally had to look back and give it all up so yeah for many of us drinking is all about the popularity the camaraderie the magic of instant friendships instant lovers particularly for those like me who had shit childhoods growing up booze is like the magic cure all that says no you are not the loser you think you are you have got it all wrong you are popular you are a winner see look at these people around you look at all these friends see how they all love you see how they laugh and carry on is not this amazing it takes a while before you realize oh wait it not real is it none of it real you are in the matrix it an illusion the booze world is not the real world it all a lie a fun lie a wonderful magical lie but a lie all the same and one you can get caught up in for years decades before you finally wake up re distraction in early sobriety by all means game away grab a copy of the witcher 2 witcher 3 and both witcher 3 dlc expansion packs and just get in there and devour that world that will be 2 months of your life right there assuming you play through all of them back to back check out metal gear solid v the tomb raider reboot and its sequel rise of the tomb raider lot of great games out there and while i do not think you should dedicate the rest of your life to it in the early stages you are gonna need all the distraction you can get to stave off temptation from going back out again so i think in this instance trading the addiction of alcohol for the addiction of games is totally fine though you will eventually get off the games as well get your netflix get your hbo get into a cool new tv series and invite friends over non drinking friends if you have any to watch it with you drink coffee while you do it i love coke zero too it all good just keep your mind off yourself in the early stages right now it all about letting your body reset at some point you will want to get into exercise as well but maybe wait a little bit on that you will know when you are ready to get to the gym and start lifting hard and heavy remember one thing at at time do not try to quit drinking and get into lifting simultaneously that just too much shit for anyone to deal with re women as i have said to a few others in the comments here absolutely do not worry about it get sober go to some meetings get distracted get into some games and or other hobbies get out and meet new people during the day in non drinking places like in a yoga class or out on a hike or whatever keep yourself busy and sober and i promise you that soon enough the women will come and best of all they will be newer better women than the drunk bar girls you had before re chandelier yep i think all us drinkers can relate to that one i never got why some people drank at home alone i never did for me it was all about being the life of the party drink enough booze and it just happens automatically but you are starting a new adventure now and part of this adventure is going to be learning to be the life of the party without the booze you can do it it a little tricky at first but you will catch on soon enough congrats on your decision to quit drinking we are all here for you backing you supporting you get to a meeting and remember just take it all one day at a time today i am not going to drink that it that all you need by the way i just celebrated my 40th birthday here in hollywood a few months ago 6 years sober now so of course i did not drink had dozens of people over to my place think the guest count was like 40 or 50 total all close friends all great friends almost all drinkers no huge drinkers though just cool people who had a few cocktails and you know what it was totally awesome no one cared that i did not drink the party was great probably the best bday party i have ever had in my life and that including all the parties i had totally wasted so yeah there your proof you can party and be surrounded by totally awesome people who love you without alcohol it ai not gonna happen tomorrow but it will happen just put your time in and you will get there best of luck ,1,asktrp
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns, i though i would sleep better and lose a lot of weight and i have not it may take your body a few months to adjust i actually gained a bit of weight as many people do my first few months of sobriety pigging out on desserts sugar etc once you cut off the sugar supply from the alcohol your body wants it any way it can get it so you are looking at a lot of cookies cake and ice cream if you were a big drinker and suddenly go cold turkey sleep as well may take a while to adjust but do not worry you will get there a few months from now your weight will stabilize and then drop and your sleep will improve drastically as for getting laid do not worry about it focus on not drinking let the sex thing take care of itself i promise you it will once you have your sober legs firmly underneath you ,1,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns, for anyone who thinks they have a problem just go to an aa meeting and listen and be open listen to some of these people talk about how they spent time in jail because they could not control their drinking so true i heard a great quote once something like if you fucked a zebra go to an aa meeting and listen to some stories chances are there somebody there who fucked two zebras gotta agree i was lucky enough that my bottom was actually pretty high i just could not take the hangovers anymore and realized i was wasting my time and my life that was basically it but holy shit some of the stories i have heard in aa you just cannot believe people can get so low and still go on living loss of job loss of spouse loss of children homelessness people who drove drunk and actually killed other people it totally insane and very very humbling so yeah if anything aa will definitely ground you absolutely but yeah like you i found aa in general just too depressing for my taste i am glad it was there for me in the beginning but after i got the whole i am not drinking thing under control i was like ok now what and nobody had an answer for me there was no aa level 2 which is to say there was no we have got the drinking thing handled now how do go out and live a fun happy sober life my sponsor even told me you should totally start a whole new thing aa level 2 when you do let me know i will be the first to sign up my experience you go to all these meetings and over and over and over again you hear i just cannot stop drinking vodka i do not know what to do my heart goes out to these people it tough i get it but that just not me the meeting i wanted to go to was the one where everyone said ok i have stopped drinking in fact i have no desire to drink anymore it cool i am good so now what how do i kick ass in my work life in my love life now that i am sober alas i never found that meeting as far as i know it does not exist funny thing one of the reasons i loved trp as soon as i found it 2 5 years ago the red pill for me in many ways was what aa was supposed to be but never was a sense of community brotherhood a life dedicated to self improvement making new friends is tougher as you get older for sure i never made any friends in aa never any close ones anyway lot of acquaintances so congrats on getting out and making it happen like i said aa can be fine when starting out but i think a lot of people and this never gets talked about i am gonna hammer it home in my book just sort of quietly outgrow the program they drift away from it yet still stay sober they just get tired of all the depressing shit they say all right i got this and move on with their lives anyway yeah get that hike in get that meeting in and go for 90 days it only gonna get better from here on out ,1,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns, i think the most important thing to remember is this your recovery is a process of redemption it should be celebrated perfect way to put it you are not losing something but giving up alcohol you are gaining something and this should absolutely be celebrated ,1,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,that the thing every once in a while the demon whispers in my ear too come on just have a drink one or two drinks tops you can totally handle it you can totally moderate you have got this shit man you own it the alcohol does not own you live a little go on that date with that girl and just have a drink or two things will be so much easier but then i think well wait a sec i could technically go out and probably have just one or two drinks and then stop but then why would i want to where the fun in that for me all the fun was in getting totally wasted and then bouncing around town trying random bars talking to everyone seeing who i might go home with if i am gonna cut myself off at one or two drinks before i even get my buzz on then why even drink at all and then i think well ok maybe i will have like 4 drinks and then stop so i will get a nice buzz going but then drink no more and then it like bwah haw hah hah haaaaaa yeah right four drinks nice buzz and then stop man that has never happened in the history of anything ever i could have an appointment to go to the moon tomorrow morning first thing and believe me when i say that if i was four drinks in the night before i would keep drinking until i passed out and then miss my moon appointment as i said in another comment quote from the big book when i controlled it i could not enjoy it and when i enjoyed it i could not control it for me that pretty much ends the whole moderation debate right there ,1,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,if you were sober dating within a month and did not relapse then my hat off to you you were one of the exceptions to the rule my experience with quite a few people i have known over the years coming into aa is that the no dating during your first 12 months of sobriety rule is like many of the rules there for a reason because people feel great amazing in their newly sober lives they go out date everything is wonderful and then it does not work out somebody leaves somebody else and the newly sober person is like well fuck this and starts drinking again i agree that no one program of recovery can be one size fits all and still be effective everyone has to find their own path what works for them everyone told me if i did not hit aa meetings every day i would surely drink again i hit meetings a few times a week for a while then finally realized i was not getting anything out of them i would learned all i needed to and i moved on still sober that having been said i will absolutely stand by my statement that if you know you have a problem with alcohol it a big part of your life but you just cannot do it anymore you need to stop and then you do stop there is going to be a big gaping void in your life where all that drinking used to be you must fill that void with something and this thing whatever it is can change over time for me it was briefly video games for others it can be exercise for many obviously they fill the void with aa point is nature abhors a vacuum and if you do not replace the drinking with something than the drinking will surely resume it just the basic math of how it works i have seen it over and over and over again did not know there was a stopdrinking sub but of course i should have suspected reddit had something like that never been but just like aa for all the people who want to quit out there i would say check it out if you like it stay if you do not then leave but you lose nothing by having a look ,1,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,congrats on 5 years welcome to the long game ,2,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,definitely a genetic component i think the jury still out on the exact science but my own admittedly anecdotal experience seems to revolve around the fact that alcoholics process sugar differently from other people every other alcoholic i have talked to has agreed with me on this and yeah when you quit drinking holy shit do you really get into the dessert scene for a normal drinker you drink a little bit get buzzed drink some more and then your body is like ok sugar overload we are getting fucked up here better stop drinking now so we can get back to normal for an alcoholic drinker you drink a little bit get buzzed drink some more and then your body is like more give us more more more more there is no automatic push to normalize it like the thermostat in reverse when the temp goes up instead of the ac kicking on to bring the temp back down the heater kicks on instead which makes it even hotter which makes the thermostat go up even more which makes the heater blast even hotter and on and on in a terrible never ending cycle the wires are crossed and you just drink until you pass out maybe one day we will have a magic pill or surgery that will correct for this and then i can have a scotch or two and my newly corrected body will be like ok that enough stop drinking now but until that time looks like it sobriety from here on out ,1,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,too true it not just the quality of women that goes up it the quality of your guy friends as well ,1,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,awesome comment man thanks for sharing wow now it does feel like an aa meeting in here i have been reading trp for two years i know the theory i know exactly what you are supposed to do in all types of situations but i have yet to master one thing a high smv i suspect that describes the majority of trp readers in fact guys love to come here and gorge on theory taking notes on lift routines pick up strategy etc but how many actually go out and lift how many go out and start chatting up girls precious few i think remember gents an ounce of practice is worth more than a ton of theory i have been told to get a sponsor and i did then he basically said a week later he was too busy i said fuck it and started drinking again i too had a few false starts with sponsors aa is free and you absolutely get what you pay for which is one of the problems i had with the program it too bad there is not a high end more responsible more professional paid version of it thing is though while it sucks your potential sponsor was not there for you you cannot blame your relapse on not having a sponsor or anyone or anything else you can only blame yourself you and only you are solely responsible for whether or not you choose to drink re chasing women since your ex left yes when you are drinking when you are a drunk especially chasing women chasing fun chasing the high chasing instant gratification that what life is all about and it can work it can be effective for a while but ultimately as a drunk your smv is gonna be capped at a pretty low ceiling and if you want the more impressive women you are gonna have to clean up your act get sober lift work on yourself get some awesome hobbies make some money push on your career etc if you really want to start getting with the women at the very top of the pyramid that not to say that drunks cannot have beautiful women quite the contrary plenty of active alcoholic addicts are dating beautiful girls but then they are all examples of extremely unhappy dysfunctional relationships and certainly that not where you want to be kudos on re acquainting yourself with your passion the hiking sounds pretty amazing actually i am in la and hiking is huge out here but i never really got into it been meaning to get out and about more often though so maybe i will look into joining a group etc seems like the perfect way to meet sober grounded together and potentially hot women re going to bars to get girls works in your 20s little bit in your 30s but by the time you hit 35 you just think man i am too old for this shit that particular aspect of the game has lost its luster besides all the great women i have met have not been in bars at last call it always through friends friends of friends hobbies house parties social circle game etc it almost never been a cold approach at bar that fine for the quick hook up but for me i have had enough quick hook ups in my life now i am very selective about the women i sleep with and honestly most women in most bars just do not make the cut i feel like every guy who sobers up agrees on this congrats on the three days of sobriety now you can make it stick this time or relapse yet again the choice is up to you but remember it is always your choice whether or not you take that first drink so many people always forget you do not have to drink they make it so complicated and it actually so simple wake up in the morning and say today i am not gonna drink maybe tomorrow i will have one sure why not but today i am just not gonna take that first drink and that it before you know it 90 days have passed then a year then 5 do not worry about hiking your smv right now that will happen automatically as you get and remain sober best of luck drop us a line when you hit 90 days ,2,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns, now i do not even want to bother with the other 90 though i should to improve my game i read that you are an introvert as well what are some good techniques to get through that this is pretty much my whole book so i wo not get into a lengthy discussion now but the short version is you have been relying on the alcohol to carry you through the seduction process it worked great for a while sure almost like magic you did not really have to do anything just sit back get wasted and let nature take its course but once you sober up that when the training wheels come off and you really have to push to get the whole process started and continue pushing to keep it on track sober seduction pick up i found is very much like going to the gym in the beginning it like wow i really do not want to do this but i know i should so i am just gonna force myself to go and get through it all somehow and then you get there and it painful for a few minutes but then you get warmed up you get into it and before you know it an hour has passed and you are feeling great amazing alive pumped going out and talking to girls sober works the exact same way plenty of nights when i have had friends say come on out and i am like nah i just want to stay in and play video games watch netflix etc but i force myself out anyway i make myself go the first few minutes can be a little painful and awkward but once i settle into the group get my diet coke or coffee or whatever start talking with my friends loosening up then it all usually goes just fine sometimes i am bored and miserable sure sometimes i am just not feeling it and i leave early but sometimes i go out and end up chatting with people and before i know it hey there a hot girl in my bed you just never know without the booze it more of an uphill battle sure you are climbing up the mountain rather than sliding down it drunk pick up but then the interactions you do have you will find are much more meaningful as a result because you worked harder to get them ,2,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,as they say one day at a time keep it up ,1,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns, i am literally my ultimate self when drunk like god mode when i hit a certain point can say anything completely understand the game picking up girls when you are drunk and they are drunk is the game on easy mode hell it the game with the invincibility cheat code turned on so it not really even a game at the point more like a movie that you just sit back and watch instead picking up girls when you are sober and even more difficult when they are sober now that the game on hard mode or impossible legendary it takes a lot of practice to get that good but when you do get that good you will be better than everyone else at the game guaranteed the number of girls you sleep with will go down sure but this will be by your choice this is a good thing you will look back on some of the ridiculously unattractive women you took home during your drunk days and think my god i fucked that what the fuck was i thinking what a waste of my time my life with sober pick up you will hit on fewer girls for sure but the girls will all be far more attractive it takes a while to learn how to while sober exhibit that fearless drunk confidence but you will get there and let me assure you we talk about frame all the time here at trp once you learn and master sober pick up man frame of fucking iron ,2,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,one of my favorite phrases from aa sick and tired of being sick and tired on the plus side if i may be so bold at least you know now you have a problem only you can really decide whether or not you are an alcoholic and whether or not you need to get sober as a result there is no official scientific cut off for alcoholic vs non alcoholic it is only a self diagnosis situation for me there was a long time where i was like am i an alcoholic i do not know i finally crossed that line but man it took a while probably because my bottom was never really that bad something i should be grateful for in retrospect but with you let be clear judging by the symptoms you mentioned above you are an alcoholic you are at your bottom right now there no doubt about it you know it i know it every alcoholic reading this comment in the sub knows it we all know it it extremely clear to all of us so now that you know for a fact that you have the disease do you want to get sober now or later or never because the elevator you are on only goes down but you can decide when and where you want to get off your bottom this can be it right now or it can get much much worse there is no going back up no reset just where you are now and then progressing even further down down all the really bad things that can and will happen in your future if you continue i got sober it was the best decision i ever made everyone else in this sub who got some sober time i am sure they will all agree now it your turn do not wait another day go to an aa meeting and check it out as i keep saying you may love it hate it or not care either way but it free and easily accessible so you should at least have a look there a whole new life ahead of you if you want it it can all be yours you just need to take that first step i just do not want to live this way anymore here the beauty of it you do not have to ,1,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,i remember john cheese think he got sober right around the time i did in fact he had a lot of great articles on cracked re the whole process etc but yeah when you first get sober those first few months when nighttime rolls around it like jesus what am i gonna do with myself your mind just boggles at the seeming lack of options like well if i am not drinking what else is there to do now in life it takes a while to realize that there are so many other things to do besides drink you just have to reframe your entire life narrative before you can properly see all the options in front of you now looking back it like damn i cannot believe i spent all those hours drinking how did i ever get anything done the answer i did not get much done actually which was one of the reasons i had to quit ,1,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,congrats you are not an alcoholic ah you lucky devil enjoy the highland park 25 that used to be one of my favorites as for the rest of us alkies believe me if we could drink like a normal person in moderation we would and to be fair there were many times when i would go out and have just one or two but then there were times when i would have 12 or 14 or 20 i just kept going and going and going and then i would lose 3 days to recovering from my hangover three days of my life when nothing got done no work no pushing on my mission nothing thing is as you get older those nights when you just have one or two they become fewer and fewer and those nights when you have 10 or 12 they become more frequent and thus those 3 day hangovers become more frequent alcoholism is a progressive disease some people know they have it right away sure but for most of us me included it creeps up on you on very slowly you can actually have it for a very long time without even realizing it like oh i am still basically a functioning member of society i am not homeless or anything so i cannot be an alcoholic right it funny i just addressed this in another comment but your observation of why do not you just drink in moderation was something i said to an alcoholic friend of mine right after she quit drinking but before i had gotten sober when you are still drinking that how the world looks just drink less right but then you try it yourself and you realize oh shit i really just cannot handle this most people are fine and can drink in moderation sure no prob i was like that for a long time myself but eventually i hit this tipping point where i just could not do it anymore the binge nights far outnumbered the moderation nights and it was not a matter of willpower every big drinker knows willpower is not even part of the equation i hate the word powerless but you know what that what all alcoholics are in the face of alcohol powerless there no way around it no cheat code the only way to win the fight is to walk away from it entirely but hey i tell everyone who wonders am i an alcoholic do not quit right away try drinking in moderation first believe me when i tell you we have all tried it and we have all failed that why we quit drinking in the first place if i could still pop out twice a week and have a drink or two i would but i cannot it too dangerous so i cut it out entirely ,6,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns, some of my friends have problems with it fuckem they feel to me like the people who do not want you to start lifting because they are worried you will be better looking than them never thought of it that way before but that exactly how it is and you know what the shitty thing is i have been on both sides of that fence one of my closest female friends back in nyc and off and on plate for several years quit drinking a little while before i did so you can imagine going out with this awesome party girl that i used to sleep with all the time suddenly she like nah i am good no drinks for me this girl used to drink me under the table pretty impressive and i am like what come on now just have one or two i badger her and badger her and finally she like look i am a recovering alcoholic i am in aa i am never drinking again it ai not gonna happen so i am just staring at her thinking damn i just lost one of my biggest party going friends and plates and then here the classic line i wail well fuck come on now why do not you just drink less of course now that i myself am in recovery it so funny looking back at that and seeing how many of my big party friends used the exact same line on me come on man you can have one or two just drink less and you will be fine and i think oh jesus fucking christ you are a genius why did not i think of that i should just drink less damn people are stupid sometimes but hey it not their fault they do not how it works they do not understand that for alcoholics sugar is processed in the body differently and once you get going you just cannot stop but you are right once you sober up and start making forward progress in your life it possible that a lot of your friends like crabs in a bucket are gonna try to pull you back down exactly like taking up lifting they know you as a certain kind of person and when you change they are gonna be like who does this guy think he is to be fair all of my guy friends were very inspired by my change i quit drinking quit smoking lost 60 pounds put on a ton of muscle the change in my face and body was extraordinary every one of my guy friends was totally blown away some even a bit inspired some of my girl friends same thing but many of my girlfriends this probably deserves a post of its own were downright offended by my progress like oh hah hah look at the beta pretending to be an alpha how cute a sheep in wolf clothing i cut those girls out pretty quick after that so yeah the short version is do your thing your real friends will follow and the rest fuck em seriously life too short to spend any time at all with people who are not totally supportive of your goals and dreams congrats on your upcoming 90 days the first 3 months is the hardest it gets much easier after that ,2,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns, you realize that it not sustainable if you want the kind of life where you reach your full potential or happiness that how it was for me i realized i would pretty much hit my ceiling re how far i was going to progress in life creatively speaking i was in the film business if i kept on drinking at my then current rate i was always gonna be on the amateur circuit was never gonna get on the playing field with the big boys and go pro it was just never gonna happen that the thing with us big drinkers there a whole lot of talk but very little action i extrapolated out to the years decades ahead and was like oh damn this is it this is all i am ever gonna do a few screenplays written but no big sales and certainly no produced credits shit something gotta go and then it was like decision time do you want to keep drinking or do you want to take a shot at living your dream because you cannot do both so i quit the drinking the ceiling went away and up i went ,2,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,agreed sex is a completely different experience sober when i was big drinker it was how many women can i sleep with now that i am sober 6 years it how few women can i sleep with i have gone from a quantity mindset to a quality one perhaps going against the grain a bit here in trp with all that but believe me i have had my time banging drunk bar sluts well into the triple digits now i am far more selective with my partners and honestly i find i turn down far more sex than i choose to engage in these days and i am much happier for it all thanks to sobriety ,7,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,i am the same way i took what worked for me and dropped the rest honestly i could boil the 12 steps down to just 2 steps and i think the system would work just as well if not better step 1 people fucked with your shit you need to talk to someone about it and get it off your chest step 2 you fucked with other people shit you need to reach out to them and make amends that pretty much it that all the life repair you need to get and stay sober the rest is just window dressing ,1,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,congrats on 5 years now you are in the long game this is where a lot of people relapse years 5 to 10 so do be on the lookout for that drunk people are definitely annoying when you are sober the game changes significantly as i am sure you have found once you give up the former and become the latter will post a link to the book when done for sure ,4,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns, if you stick out and your goodlooking you will get laid in bars but you will very rarely meet nice sweet girls that are worth investing time in agreed i have met and slept with plenty of women in bars but the more impressive women you are not gonna bump into them during last call at the latest dive y hipster joint with the edison bulbs and the vest wearing mixologists etc one night stands sure but if you want a little bit more of a connection you are gonna have to get out during the day take up new hobbies and work that social circle game all things ideally done sober ,8,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,if i could just drink socially i would and to be honest there were many nights when i just went out and had a drink or two and that was it problem was there were also many nights too many nights when those just one or two drinks turned into a dozen or more and put me out of action for days on end totally unacceptable as it was keeping me from realizing my life goals if you can socially drink by all means do so for me and for all alcoholics we just cannot not reliably not 100 of the time sometimes we are fine but sometimes it just gets very very bad i was tired of the latter so i found it was easiest and best just to cut it out entirely great quote from the aa big book when i controlled it i could not enjoy it and when i enjoyed it i could not control it that was me in a nutshell i am not getting off on having just one or two drinks anyway so my thinking was why even bother then why the temptation best just to go all in sober for sure ,2,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns, i am one of those who are incapable of drinking a couple of beers this is one of the biggest if not the biggest giveaways that you are a full blown alcoholic welcome to the club my friend time to get sober hit the ol google find an aa meeting near you and check it out if you like it stay and hang if you do not then feel free to leave but as i said in my post if you do not do aa you must still do something to fill the hole got the whole rest of your life ahead of you and it will all be so much better than what you have now i am sure other sober people in this thread will back me up on this do not wait to get to the next chapter start today now ,16,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,yep this is what most people do not realize nobody knows you are not drinking that diet coke in your hand could be a jack and coke that sprite could be a g t nobody knows and nobody cares it takes a bit of practice particularly if you are an introvert like me but after a while you can learn to blend in socially with the drinkers just fine now obviously if your crowd is getting absolutely hammered then after an hour or whatever you are probably gonna wanna jet they will just be on a completely different wavelength from you and real conversation will be impossible but if you are sober and all your friends are having 1 to 4 drinks that totally fine nobody will really notice or care assuming you are not a totally glum bastard obviously the biggest thing is getting over the nervousness to approach girls when you have got a major buzz going on the whole thing just sort of happens automatically like tigger from winnie the pooh you just bounce in and are like hey ladies what is happenin super high energy super excited when you are stone cold sober not so much but then you can control the interaction much better much more keenly when you are sober and thus even though you may approach less when not drinking the girls you do approach will be hotter and your closing rate i would argue will actually be much higher it like using a sniper rifle with a high powered scope as opposed to using a shotgun blindfolded a much improved experience ,3,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,congrats on getting out early aa did not ultimately do it for me though i may return one day who knows but i do have quite a few friends who swear by it just depends on the person and the meeting i suppose ,4,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns, i figure every time you stop drinking it takes about 3 days to recover yep once you are in your 30s hangovers can be up to 3 days long that a lot of time to not be working on your mission ,9,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,if you can get away with moderate drinking that awesome you are one of the lucky ones for me i could moderately drink sometimes but then there were those times when i would go out saying ok just one or two drinks and next thing i knew it was like 4am i was taking a cab home with some random girl i did not even know or like probably 14 drinks in and a few hundred bucks lighter and then i would lose the next 2 days as i sat around slowly recovering with no creative work getting done in the meantime kudos to the 2 beers just watch that that number does not start creeping up on you sounds like it might run in the family ,4,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns, the only advice i can dish out to anyone of you that stuck with an addiction it an everyday thing absolutely there never a time when it like that it i beat it i beat my addiction i won the video game each morning you wake up it like you start the whole thing over again it does get easier over time sure but you can never truly let your guard drop ,3,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns, alcohol has been my major crutch with girls and i actually do not know who i am without it yep had the exact same experience whenever i went out with friends in nyc it was always a pretty tame quiet time when first starting out for the evening have a few pints and after about 3 or 4 it like ugh i am feeling pretty bloated here let switch to jack and cokes this is also right about the time my buzz would really start kicking in have a jack and coke or two might start eyeing a few of the girls at the bar but it was not until i was like 4 to 6 or even 8 jack and cokes in that i really started to just randomly open chicks and man more often than not by that point i was truly on fire or at least i thought i was that shy guy that could barely look people in the eye when he first walking into the place that guy was gone now i was fucking james bond baby smooth and dapper and hilarious and outrageous all at once all thanks to the jack women were approached picked up brought home fucked just like that it was not until i finally sobered up that i realized watching other men go through the exact same process through my now sober eyes that 1 i was not james bond i was a ridiculous drunk clown though women often loved this god help them and 2 the women i brought home often were not that attractive one of the consequences of getting sober the women you find hot will drop by like 90 add trp to that and it goes down like 99 being in my 30 hangovers are getting worse today was an all day hangover and i could hardly function had to smoke weed just to feel remotely better absolutely i remember my last hangover ever very very well three days long never again you know the routine by the time you are in your 30s it can take almost 72 hours to truly recover you go out friday night get shitfaced and all day saturday you are sitting on the couch sweating out the crap fighting off panic attacks trying to manage your depression at the same time watching movies desperate for a distraction just praying for the day to end so you can finally go to sleep again sunday day 2 is better but it still like you have a mild cold you are not gonna go out and take over the world or anything by monday you are basically ok again and monday night wow look out you are tippy top once more feeling great hey i know i have an idea let go out and celebrate drinks for everyone and so the cycle continues over and over again that was me in nyc for about 10 years going out drinking 3 to 4 times a week and usually one of those times was a pretty epic bender and maybe once every month or two blackout thank god nothing truly bad every happened but that was part of my wake up call i knew beyond the shadow of a doubt that it was only a matter of time until the very bad thing happened and i knew when it did that i would not even remember it that would be the worst part about it all truly a jekyll and hyde situation i dont have an off switch congrats you are officially an alcoholic get sober now and live get sober later and live a little bit less or get sober never and die these are your options but make no mistake alcoholism is a progressive disease just like cancer level 1 level 2 etc up to level 5 or whatever when it finally just kills you there is no going back and there is no reset button and just like cancer the sooner you treat it the better your odds are of living through it my main problem is fomo snapchat and hb9 inviting me out to drink with them fomo was my biggest problem as well i was surrounded by all the beautiful people in nyc how was i going to keep having sex with everyone without alcohol to fuel the party fact is you will learn how to do it like juggling 9 balls at once it seems totally impossible then you see someone else do it and you know it can be done you are like oh that person can go out and have fun and get laid without alcohol so it is possible so i guess i can do it too after that it just practice re excuses you do not need the whole antibiotics thing just go with i am on this new health kick training for a marathon getting in shape losing weight etc and people will most likely just shrug and let you off the hook do not tell them you are never drinking again just be like nah i am good not tonight diet coke please i got away with this for months before my friends were like dude are you ever drinking again and even then i was like eh i do not know i am kinda enjoying this whole sober thing we will see no one ever knew i was hitting aa several times a week people are not as concerned with your drinking as you think they are it all in your head trust me they are concerned with their drinking and whether or not they are getting laid that night keep this in mind and you will be fine ,6,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,plenty of people we call them normies or civilians can go out and drink and party every once in a while or even fairly frequently and not have it negatively impact their lives or at least not to any significant degree to them i say hey that awesome if i could still do it i would be doing it too it a little easier when you are younger you can party all night come home at dawn shower and then go right into a productive work day but once you get into your 30s man those hangovers last like 24 hours or 48 your body just wo not do it anymore that coupled with the nagging feeling of you know i keep talking about doing all these great things but i never actually do any of them after a while you realize that in the tv show of your life you are in reruns and then it like well do i want to do this forever drink and drink and drink some more live a life of mediocrity and die with none of my big goals having been met or do i want to strike out into the unknown the undiscovered country test myself explore someplace new and realize my full potential if the latter then yes you have to get sober that pretty much all there is to it ,35,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,not a bad idea may do that ,2,asktrp
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,op with all due respect to theredstoic i am sure his heart in the right place this is actually terrible advice here we go do not tell anyone you are quitting you are going to have to tell everyone you are quitting do not trumpet it from the rooftops do not make a big deal about it just say when people offer you a drink nah i am good i am on this new health kick i am getting in shape losing weight etc so no drinking for me for a little while alas laugh about it do not take it seriously do not say i think i am on alcoholic i am never gonna drink again etc etc all of which might be true by the way you just do not need to share this information right now your drinking friends simply will not understand and the pressure for you to continue to drink will be enormous break them in slowly but tell them you are not drinking go out and party without the drinks do not throw down for anything see if you still have a good time oh jesus god absolutely not no no no no no do not attempt to go out and party without drinking at least not in the beginning you are going to have a horrible time surrounded by drunk people you do not know how to handle and that assuming you actually do not drink which is very unlikely here what will most likely happen instead friend hey man have a shot you nah man i am good friend aww come on dude drink you fuck it ok the end if you do not have a good time invite them to join in new hobbies that are not drink centered your drinking friends are not going to join you in non drinking activities they are not going to go hiking with you go to yoga with you or whatever the fuck you decide to get into for a great movie scene that exemplifies this check out trainspotting that bit where tommy newly sober tries to drag all the heroin addicts out for a hike in the mountains they just bitch him out and then go do more heroin you are going to need new friends but that ok i promise you that once you are sober they will come and they will be better friends than the ones you had before if you cannot enjoy yourself with them because they offer nothing more than drinking you will have to cut them out you actually do not need to cut them out of your life entirely but you do need to reframe your interaction with them i am 6 years sober and am still in touch with many of my old drinking buddies but we are not as close as we once were my closest friends now are either sober or only drink occasionally no hard drinkers fact is you are embarking on a whole new life when you get sober treat this transition with the respect and gravity that it deserves do not attempt to go out and just hang out at bars with your drinking friends like you always did in the past as if nothing at all has changed only this time without a drink in your hand it will not happen you will be drinking again in 5 minutes you need to take yourself out of the scene entirely and get some serious sober time in then and only then can you hop back into the bar scene and drink your diet coke ,5,asktrp
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,so i was in exactly your position 6 years ago my sober bday is sep 7 2010 did not start drinking until a little bit later in life 19 moved to nyc at 25 downtown manhattan man what a scene and partied my ass off nonstop for almost 10 years it was not until i was 34 that i finally realized oh shit wait a sec this is it this is my whole life all those dreams i have of finishing that script making that movie being a hollywood success story none of that will ever happen if i continue to drink at the rate i am currently drinking a lot of people think that alcoholics have to hit this kind of horrible bottom before waking up and realizing they are alcoholics like i lost my job my wife left me i ran over the cat with the car i found myself homeless etc etc the fact is the only bottom you need to hit is the realization that your drinking is keeping you from properly making your mark on the world that it whether it your dream to be an artist an entrepreneur whatever it may be once you realize that you cannot drink like a champ and at the same time actually be a champ that when it clicks and you realize the drinking has to go so a few things when you first decide to give up drinking you are going to think wow am i going to lose all my friends all we do is drink together if i stop drinking are they all gonna go away right after that you are going to think geez am i ever gonna get laid again all the sex i have ever had has been me drunk getting with drunk girls the booze always provides all the horsepower to the seduction how on earth am i gonna go on a date let alone hook up with a women totally sober i am actually writing a book about exactly this right now called 5 years of sober dating in new york and la i will be giving it away for free on trp so check for that later the answer to both of the above questions is yes your social circle will absolutely change but for the better and yes you will get laid again after getting sober and the attractiveness level of your partners will actually go way up in both cases however it requires you learning a skillset that you have not yet learned being social without drinking however you can learn it and you will learn it but i will tell you right now it going to take a few years so just accept right now that your first 18 months of sobriety is gonna be just you getting your sober legs under you and rediscovering who you are as a human being after that maybe in year 2 or 3 you will take a look around and realize wow i have all these great new friends and wow i am getting laid all the time but it wo not happen overnight like many things preached on trp lifting learning game etc this is a process a transformation that will take several years so plan accordingly so to go to aa or not to go to aa basically yes i highly recommend you at least check out some alcoholics anonymous meetings in your area google for more it free there no reason not to check it out if you love it then stay if you do not like it you have lost nothing you can always get up and walk out at any time i recommend going to at least 5 meetings before deciding if aa is right for you me i went to aa a few times a week for the first 2 years or so of my sobriety never really liked it never really felt like i belonged but i am glad it was there and i did pick up a few useful tools that having been said you do not need aa necessarily despite aa claims to the contrary but you do need something drinking has been a huge part of your life a huge time money energy sink if you do not replace it with something else you are going to start drinking again there is no way around this one of the reasons aa can be useful in the beginning it gives you someplace to go and something to do a few nights a week when all your mates are out drinking honestly if you asked me how i get sober i would say fallout 3 metal gear solid 4 and mass effect 1 2 my first few months i pretty much just sat on the couch and played video games talk about a time sink but you know what it worked it kept me out of the bars especially at night clean and sober after a few months i felt like i could go out again and not drink and i did and it was fine but that first few months that time is sooo crucial get a hobby find your thing and stick to it video games movies cooking gardening i do not care just pick something to get obsessed about that is not drinking and get obsessed it that obsession that will get you through the first phase of your newfound sobriety and if your new obsession is aa as it is for many then great but it does not have to be these days i go to aa once a year just for the hell of it so like i said aa for me was somewhat useful in the beginning though i never really dove in all the way you may love it or you may hate it but definitely check it out and give it a chance you owe it to yourself as for sex do not even think about getting laid during your first year if it happens it happens but do not spend any energy pursuing it the first year is all about you your health your body there will be plenty of better hotter chicks waiting for you once you are sober in the second and third years and beyond i will be writing up a longer series of posts re sober dating etc once i have wrapped the book but this should get you started for now any questions etc feel free to ask in the comments best of luck and know this your whole life is still ahead of you every person i have ever known who quit drinking myself included we all say the same thing i wish i would gotten sober sooner do not put it off anymore do not wait for that special occasion to quit today the day start right now take the first step and the rest will take care of itself ,6,asktrp
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,agree with you if it between a white chad thundercock and a black steve urkel the girl gonna go for the white chad every time that having been said and i may be a little biased here living in la the bad boy capital of the world given all that as the societal constraints are all coming loose and female sexuality is becoming ever more completely unshackled more and more women are finding it completely ok to go for the baddest bad boy they can find and in a very public fashion at that a little while ago most women still maintained the pretense of the good girl you publicly dated the nice guy sure kept up appearances etc and then you just quietly had sex with the unemployed alcoholic biker bartender drug dealer musician on the side nowadays the latter is the public persona and not only that it seen as something to aspire to i have actually been around women who in a group conversation brag about the amount of drugs their guy has sold only to get one upped by yet another woman in the group who like oh yeah well mine deals coke and spent 6 years in jail for armed robbery sooo of course it always phrased like a complaint the girls always roll their eyes like oh the things i have to put up with but any student of trp knows what is really happening here the women are status signaling one is saying my boyfriend a bad boy a risk taker a rule breaker an alpha male i win and the next girl is calling her out and saying oh no my boyfriend is all that and he spent some time in jail he a bigger rule breaker thus more of an alpha so i win and on and on one interesting side effect of this living in a city in which all the guys are bad boys is that you have to become a kind of super bad boy just to get on the radar these days when every guy in town has tattoos piercings rides a motorcycle deals drugs and is a combination rapper dj music producer promoter personal trainer how do you stand you easy you stand out by being all that and being black too of course in my previous comment i jokingly mentioned that soon white men would be dyeing their skin just to get access to the sexual marketplace but honestly you can see where that observation however much in jest comes from white men mimic black men black culture black speech black everything all the time they do it because it ups their bad boy ranking a white man who says aww ite instead of all right implies a galaxy of things about himself with just that one word i am from the hood i grew up on the street i have a criminal past i am street smart i am a mover i am a hustler i know what is up i get things done i know how to survive etc etc and all of these things raise his apparent sexual market value as far as the women is concerned it not an accident it a very real thing and so you end up in situation where you can be a white man imitating a black man as most white men in la do right now judging by their style of dress musical choice cultural taste etc or you can just be lucky enough if that the right phrase to be a black man in which case you get an automatic smv boost of course it was not always like this decades ago you lost a few points for being black but now that all popular culture is drenched in the black aesthetic and black culture pretty much owns pop culture music fashion etc and the black image is seen as something to aspire to obviously being black in such a climate gives you a huge competitive advantage in the smp it like steroids on the bad boy meter this is not to say it impossible to get laid in la if you are white quite the contrary just that in my experience black men as of right now have a huge advantage when it comes to getting women and keeping them around if only because in a city where every guy is the bad boy being black gives you just that little bit of extra bad boy edge to push you to the front of the pack ,2,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,i was never much of a conspiracy theorist but the fact that seemingly every piece of television and movie media these days has the main couple as a black man paired off with a white women the new star wars the leftovers house of cards that adele video from a little while back on and on and on i do kind of wonder now anyway the culture certainly has taken note here in la in hollywood walking down the street it all black men with white women literally like every single couple i was eating out with a friend a few weeks back saw a white man with a white woman sitting at the table next to us i am a straight white male by the way and i thought wow huh an actual white couple i have not seen one of those out and about in oh i do not know how long i even pointed it out to my friend who nodded in surprise it really was that jarring case in point every white girl i know in la right now who in a relationship which is almost all the women i know is currently in a relationship with a black man of course by in a relationship i mean in that particular alpha male harem but of course that another conversation entirely i do not know if it so much about some grand evil conspiracy to brown ify the population however probably more about the fact that white men thanks to the media whose instructions they dutifully follow have become so feminized that black men are the only taste of any kind of masculinity that women have left we have straight white men with man buns walking down the street wearing dresses non ironically and meanwhile the black guys are just laughing their asses off like nah dog fuck that shit you pair the white girl with the big black guy and this is la here so we are talking the rapper dj music producer archetype always and it like well why would not she date him be honored to be in his harem he taller bigger stronger more sexually aggressive more take charge more manly wears more flashy shit his muscles are bigger other ahem things are surely bigger you look at the pasty sensitive white guy standing next to him and you are like huh yeah if i were the girl knowing what i know about how women work i would probably go for the black guy too and i am not a bad looking white guy saying this and then of course every once in a while just to pretend that it all about mixing up the races political correctness etc and not you know the lack of masculinity in white men hollywood will try pairing a white man with a black women hbo the night of just did this and man you laugh and laugh like yeah that would every happen chris rock said it best black women just are not attracted to white men period why this is my own theory not chris rock because their energy is more masculine than that of a white male not less no polarity hence no attraction it gonna be really funny if in the near future white men start dyeing their skin black a la robert downey jr in tropic thunder just to get access to the sexual marketplace hell think we might have a funny little indie movie on our hands with that one ,5,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,yep this exact same thing happened to me just a few weeks ago had a beautiful girl over to my place we are vibing making out on my coach she putting up some resistance but not too much normally i would have just pushed on through it but given that i would already spent several hours with this girl turns out we had a ton in common a rare find in la and i actually liked this one i figured hey what is the rush i do not need to fuck her tonight we can just make out enjoy each other company i will get her all revved up and thinking about me and then we will hook up after date 2 in a few days figured that was the best way to demonstrate my oh so cool super alpha totally laid back lack of neediness so at 4am i walked her outside we made out some more while waiting for the uber she a great kisser she hopped in and off she went texted her a few days later re how the sched looking for the coming week etc she texts back yeah i do not know really busy with schoolwork all week long and then as for the weekend i do not know and i realize shit i am out damn that was fast one of my hardcore dating rules if you see or hear the word busy from her even one time in any of your interactions you are done next still i liked this one so come the weekend i texted once more i know it a hail mary pass at this point hey what is up for tonight she like oh i do not know no plans really surprising it was a saturday i say we are all gonna be out later we have friends in common come on out we will catch up she says oh wait i am actually going out with a bunch of friends later me now i know it truly a lost cause i am just pushing to fuck with her at this point oh no prob give a shout later maybe our groups can link up since we are all basically gonna be in the same place her yeah i do not know i think i am gonna be busy all night i just laughed and let it go after that and the funniest thing was when she left my place days before she was clearly very into me yet give it just a few days apart and she like um who are you again yeah go away stop bothering me gentlemen always always go for the bang asap establish the sexual narrative frame for the relationship from the get go there plenty of time to get to know her as a friend after you have had sex with her at least 2 or 3 times do not wait although hell these days you are lucky if they stick around for more than a few weeks ,6,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,will check out right concentration for sure thanks for the recommend re enlightenment certainly you can have moments of enlightenment where the ego the self the sense of i drops away and you become one with whatever you are concentrating on the catch though is that as soon as you realize hey i am one with this thing then of course you are not one with it anymore there an i doing the observing and you fall back out of your enlightened state i have had moments like this and more extended periods in the state but all in all it always been a pretty brief experience admittedly i am not nearly as advanced as some meditators who have really put in just years and years of non stop practice but at the same time i have met a lot so called gurus studied with many of them etc and despite claims of enlightenment and all the rest of it as far as i can tell they are just guys like the rest of us the only difference is that the number of seconds they have of in enlightenment during any given week will be a bit higher than mine due to their trained minds but other than that they still get irritated they still complain they still have to think about and analyze things they still make mistakes they still feel emotions positive and negative etc it not like they live in some kind of permanent state of never ending bliss like a single nonstop cosmic orgasm of course one brings this up when on a retreat or whatever and it always like well this enlightened master is somewhat enlightened but then his master who off in the mountains somewhere he the real deal truly enlightened now that guy is in a permanent state of untouchable bliss so basically no matter who you meet they always end up being a regular guy who happens to have clocked a lot of hours sitting in meditation but then you are always pointed to some other guy supposedly one more rung up the ladder like this guy now he will show you the way to enlightenment after a few decades of this you finally get the joke there is no state of enlightenment only moments of enlightenment that come and go and the more you meditate and the sharper your mind becomes the more moments you have overall in your life but that pretty much it but hey who knows maybe that perfect state really is out there i just have to found the right guru i heard there this one guy babaji he like 2 000 years old and is chilling out on top of a mountain somewhere in the himalayas hold on be right back i gotta check this out ,5,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,been meditating off and on for 20 years you name a style school of meditation etc i have done it best book i have ever read on concentration meditation is a fairly new one called the mind illuminated on amazon the way it breaks down the different levels of meditation almost like a video game if you are experiencing this you are on level 1 if you are experiencing that you are now on level 2 etc is quite brilliant most highly recommended that having been said do not worry about the jhanas the bliss the achieving enlightenment some of us are little skeptical that such a thing even exists by the way think of it like working out if all you are worried about is my god i have to lose 40 pounds you are gonna drive yourself nuts if on the other hand you just focus on the current rep one two three honestly that really all you need to do so it is for meditation do not think too far ahead in fact do not think ahead at all just focus on the current breath if your mind wanders as it will a lot do not berate yourself instead congratulate yourself for catching the mental wandering and then gently return to the breath that it people make it so complicated but the whole point is that nothing could be simpler ,22,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,1 not in touch with any childhood friends and if by school colleagues you mean college chums then yeah i am still vaguely in touch with a few mostly via social media like facebook many are married and settled down a few are traveling wandering the world some are doing creative things some are raising families whatever it all good fact is most of your social circle after college is going to come from where you live what kind of work you do what kind of after work activities you explore hobbies athletics etc and that pretty much it you should definitely expect your current circle of friends to fade away and a new crop of friends to come in every few years at least this has been my experience you might have a select few friends that stick around long term but honestly most of your crew will probably change out every 3 to 5 years it happens people grow apart change move away take new jobs get girlfriends get wives get kids get divorced and depending on what the people you know are going through good or bad you may or may not want to spend more or less time with them example i quit drinking several years ago and my friend circle changed pretty radically as a result 2 never had a problem with libido lucky me i just turned 40 i have guy friends older than me mid 40s even 50s and no one ever reported a problem though to be fair if i had older guy friends who did have a problem they might not be talking about it who knows seems pretty clear though that regardless of your age if the woman is hot and into you i am pretty sure assuming you are a straight male with a pulse you will be ready to go that having been said i lift hard and heavy several times a week eat clean follow a high protein low carb low cal diet with occasional cheats when i am eating out with friends so i am definitely in better shape than most men out there and intend on staying this way forever so no problems in the libido department thus far nor do i expect any in the future ,2,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,for women there no such thing as i am just not ready to jump right into another relationship if you are the right guy i do not care if she just got out of a 10 year relationship 6 hours ago she will get into a new one with you right now fact is you are attractive enough for her to have sex with but not attractive enough for her to consider you as relationship material basically you are her fuck buddy once upon a time the whole i am just gonna fuck you but not commit to you schtick was very much solely the province of men these days it all women they all want multiple fuck buddies and no one wants a boyfriend unless the guy is both good looking and incredibly high status musician dj promoter social media star etc keep in mind op this does not mean that you are not an attractive dude per se just that as far as she concerned you do not fit her idea of what her boyfriend should look like boyfriends for girls are basically accessories like a purse or a pair of shoes it has nothing to do with who you are or what you do and everything to do with what you look like the character you play the costume you wear what you say you do your general attitude and how all of that fits together into a kind of internally consistent archetype that she can show off to her friends hey everyone i am dating a music producer dj rapper here a pic is not he hawt etc this is why you are feeling insecure because deep down you know this is true you are good enough for the bang but not good enough for the relationship and you know it just a matter of time before she upgrades all good my man welcome to the red pill just keep working on yourself enjoy the time you have with her while you can do not get too attached and when she leaves which she will let her go and move on to the next one and if you doubt any of this just think about the last time you told a girl yeah i am just not ready for a relationship what were you really thinking i am betting it was babe you are hot enough to fuck but not hot enough to parade around my friends and get me all emotionally invested in you sorry well there you go ,7,asktrp

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,this has been my whole red pill journey right here and i imagine for quite a few others as well we talk a lot about the 5 phases re grieving the loss of the blue pill fantasy but for me i never went through denial or bargaining it was just a very brief intense flash of anger not at women but at society for having lied to me my entire life and at myself for having so stupidly believed it for so long and then a very long drawn out depression which i am still in right now and that pretty much it i found trp 2 5 years ago and i still do not see any light at the end of the tunnel and as far as i can tell with the vast amount of information i have absorbed here over the past few years it gonna be depression with occasional albeit brief anger flashbacks from here on out how anyone can truly get to acceptance is absolutely beyond me or perhaps i should say i am definitely at the part where i accept females for what they are what they do what they are capable of and i accept female nature for what it is i am at the point now where i can accurately predict any woman behavior 100 of the time women simply never surprise me anymore quite a turnaround from a few years ago but now that i know the score why would i ever engage with a female ever again expecting anything like a monogamous committed long term relationship particularly in today modern climate where female hypergamy trading up is so actively encouraged where divorce rape is actively encouraged where any woman can acquire yet another new sexual partner by just tapping on her smart phone for a few seconds and thus we have most reasonably attractive women averaging a new sexual partner every week for decades racking up hundreds and hundreds of partners knowing all this why would any man invest in any woman at all have sex with them yes enjoy them while they are with you fine but once they are out the door forget it they are having sex with someone else acknowledge it and move on and honestly is not that depressing am i really the only one here who feels this i accept it yes but much like your snake analogy once i acknowledge that the snake wants to bite me that that is its biological nature ingrained in the snake over millions of years of evolution once i know that the snake is like this and will always be like this why would i ever want to have this snake as a pet it always going to try to bite me no matter what i do so i can admire the snake from afar i can say my what a beautiful snake but as for taking the snake into my home feeding it caring for it trying to domesticate it fuck all that i honestly think the only acceptance phase i am going to have is accepting the fact that mgtow is the real end game of the red pill so many men on here once they have absorbed the material are like ok now i am gonna go be my best self and fuck a lot of bitches but ultimately i still wanna find that one unicorn and settle down and i just read all this and laugh and think wow man have you not been paying attention if you have really swallowed the pill then you realize you become your best self you fuck a lot of bitches and that it there is no settling down there is no unicorn they do not exist that was part of the blue pill lie and even then eventually you get tired of fucking bitches this is where i am at right now you realize that eventually once you would had enough partners yes even men can get all fucked out sex is just like brushing your teeth it like watching old sitcoms reruns and then you start looking for something else you get into the arts or into spirituality etc so yeah i can accept that women are how they are absolutely but as for getting to that zen happy place when it comes to thinking about women i do not know man it was depressing when i first came here it still depressing now i do not know how it not gonna be depressing several years from now hell the fact that it is so very depressing is probably why they invented the whole blue pill lie in the first place because the truth is really really fucking depressing but it is what is it welcome to the desert of the real ,1,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,this was the single biggest light bulb epiphany moment for me post trp that all of human civilization has basically been about controlling female hypergamy keeping it in check once your remove the shackles on female behavior we rapidly revert back to the primal state women do not want long term relationships monogamy marriage commitment on the contrary women are actually happiest being in an alpha harem and bearing his alpha babies it their natural state if we allow women to follow this impulse then we end up in a situation which we are approaching now in the modern day where a few top alphas are having sex with all the women while the bottom 98 of men the betas are left out in the cold involuntarily celibate so the vast majority of men end up checking out of society stop producing why should they work make money contribute sex love all those things are forever out of reach they lay about all day distract themselves as best they can start grumbling the grumbling gets louder and then one day they all rise up and tear the system down that or we just get invaded and taken over by the bigger stronger tribe next door the one that practices and enforces monogamy if you look at history you see this over and over again we start out conservative we enforce marriage often arranged marriages society flourishes because the men are forced to work their committed wives and kids will starve otherwise then we get more liberal we let women do what they want they follow their natural biological impulse and suddenly we are back to the caveman dynamic and all of society collapses yet again see the viconian cycle which joyce used as the template for finnegans wake honestly i used to be pretty liberal before coming to trp a few years back but now i just do not know i am pretty split these days on the one hand i am all about maximizing freedom and i cannot deny that in some ways i have greatly benefited from the non monogamy thing as i have had a lot of amazing experiences with a lot of beautiful women that i would not have had otherwise but on the other hand it just so clear to me now that all of us engaging in this wild seemingly never ending orgy is just prelude to yet another collapse we always joke here about enjoy the decline hah hah hah but really i do not want the decline i enjoy civilization i enjoy my iphone and my flatscreen and my air conditioning and my clean water and electricity i really do not want to live in a mad max wasteland but seriously with things going the way they are going all the math i have done here says we are heading for another centuries long dark age no hyperbole just my honest assessment of the situation and there just no way to stop it ,6,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,keep in mind with all these stats women that we at trp would consider single will usually report themselves as being in a relationship while guys that most of society would consider in a relationship will oft report themselves as being single example girl meets drunks alpha at club he takes her home they have sex he boots her out she tracks him down on social media the next day grabs his best pic his abs are incredible makes it the desktop on her phone shows it to all of her friends for the next 6 months hey this is my boyfriend is not he hot he a model meanwhile the alpha literally deleted her from his memory bank the second he pushed her out the door 6 months prior we at trp would consider her single obviously but on a relationship survey she would check the in a relationship box because as far as she concerned she in a relationship with this guy even though she only had sex with him one time 6 months ago source yes this actually happened with a female friend of mine honestly i did not know whether to laugh or to cry meanwhile that same alpha is spinning a few plates at the moment there a girl he really likes he been seeing her for 12 months say has no intention of ever being monogamous with her or anyone but she basically his first position plate meanwhile he has 2 or 3 backup plates and the occasional randoms on the side this was my own exact scenario up until a little while ago in fact society would consider him in a relationship but on a survey he would almost certainly check the single box because he has not officially committed to anyone right i mean there no ring sooo ,5,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,all you have to do is spend a few minutes with an attractive woman while her phone is out on the table in front of you watch those texts come rolling on in i was with a new girl a few days ago out with a big group for a friend birthday met the new girl we hit it off we are back at my place making out on the couch it like 1 45am that time in la when last call is happening everyone is getting kicked out of bars and of course all the guys who did not manage to score in the field are madly texting all their plates trying to see whose place they can swing by for a last second bang so the new girl and i are getting comfy on my couch feeling each other out very beautitful woman by the way and this being la i have no illusions re her status on the cc and of course her phone laying out on my coffee table starts vibrating again and again and again finally i glance over and see this tidal wave of texts from between like 1 45am and 1 53am and they are all from guys like hey you home can i come over etc etc i smirk and say something like wow looks like someone popular tonight she rolls her eyes ugh that guy what does he want i notice that guy has a big giant happy face emoticon next to his name so clearly he one of her plates fuck buddies finally the phone stops buzzing and the new girl and i do our thing but yeah color me not so surprised when i hit her up a few days later to get together again and she like yeah really busy with school work this week not sure about this weekend translation it was nice hooking up with you the other night but you had your turn and i now i have other newer men to hook up with best of luck the biggest irony how many of you wanna bet that when i texted her late one afternoon she was already getting with a new guy and when my text re getting together came in she saw it rolled her eyes and said ugh what does that guy want ,39,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,assuming a woman is fairly attractive worth banging and lives in or near a major metropolitan area she is already having sex with 4 to 6 men on a regular recurring basis and any one of these men her plates she will have in play for 2 weeks to up to 2 months before exchanging them for new ones looks like op girl is right in the middle of the bell curve exactly average here this is one of those things that newbies to the red pill have a hard time swallowing but older experienced players just take as a given and calibrate for accordingly you really have to have quite a few attractive female friends friends who you yourself are not attracted to in any way so you really are part of the club before you get to peek behind the curtain a few times and start putting it all together a female friend of mine back in nyc once mentioned you meaning all girls should always have 3 guys to hook up with whenever you want to no more than 3 though cuz that would be totally slutty and of course the real size of her harem varied between 4 and 6 depending on the day it always does ,16,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,abso fucking lutely one of the manosphere writers roissy at heartiste maybe had a great post about this phenomenon called the bitch shield basically a woman bitch shield rating is equal to her smv multiplied by the number of times she already been hit on that day so in other words an hb9 who already been approached 5 times that day current bitch shield rating of 45 will actually be easier to game than an hb7 who been hit on 10 times that day with a bitch shield of 70 fact is most men do not approach high smv women because they just assume 1 she totally out of my league so why even bother i am wasting my time 2 even if she is maybe in my league she already been hit on a million times today so i will just be yet another annoying face in the crowd or most commonly 3 she sooo hot obviously she already has a boyfriend who likely standing right nearby ready to mate guard so again why even bother paradoxically then the hb9 actually gets hit on a lot less than the hb7 the latter has every guy in the world thinking hey i may have a shot here and so they get hit on all the damn time that having been said the hb9 certainly gets approached constantly on internet dating sites mobile hookup apps social media etc all approach avenues with built in rejection buffers they just do not get cold approached quite as much out on the street in real life an exception to this would be la where i live where all the guys have ferocious daygame and approach anything and everything all the time ,3,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,was engaged to a russian woman for a year about 10 years ago i was 30 and blue pill as could be she was 23 and having been born and raised in moscow had a much keener grasp of red pill relationship dynamics than i had at the time and of course my fiancee was ridiculously unfaithful throughout the course of our engagement like many russian women she had a thing for black rappers and working in music herself was very much about allowing herself to be passed around that community what can i say i knew how to pick em back then so i am seeing a psychotherapist at the time a jungian analyst to be precise lot of talk about dream interpretation etc and of course much of the narrative thrust behind my therapy is doc this chick i am in love with is cheating on me with every black rapper in nyc what do i do looking back if there was darwin awards for the blue pill i certainly would have been a contender one day i was regaling him with whatever her most recent sexual adventure not with me was and my therapist looked at me and said you know she really lucky that you all do not live in a latin american culture why that i asked because given what she done to you if you two were in south america for instance you would just put a bullet in her head and drop the body in front of your house out on the street and when the cops show up and ask what happened you would tell them my fiancee was cheating on me and they would nod take the body away and that would be that did i mention my therapist was a buddhist and he telling me this so yeah when it comes to husbands murdering their wives if you do not wanna be that guy do not get married or engaged or monogamous or attached in any way in the first place ,3,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,wow i wish i had more than one upvote to give you it just a bad time to be a beta period it a reversion to animalistic reality and away from previous civilization absolutely if i had to give a one sentence distillation of the modern day red pill this is pretty much it as a species we are getting away from all the traditions rules shackles that made civilization possible in the first place and returning to the primal caveman dynamic relationship wise ie the idea of one single alpha having sex with all the women in the tribe while the rest of the beta guys from the second best on down get nothing and we are doing it because women want it that way once you realize that women do not want marriage never wanted marriage never even wanted monogamy that they actually are most comfortable being one member amongst many in an alpha harem that this is their natural state and that monogamy and marriage are artificial social constructs designed to get betas motivated to work by saddling them with a wife and kids and thus to get civilization on track well after that light bulb goes off you realize what with smart phones hookup apps etc today and the sexual marketplace becoming ever more hyper efficient it pretty much over for the betas one commenter here made the rather astute observation just a little while back that in the very near future only celebrity men would get laid every other guy would be left out in the cold roosh had a funny and insightful post complete with venn diagram about this as while like in the future it all gonna be steroids micro fame and spam approaching could not agree more i work and live in hollywood and while some might say la presents a rather distorted funhouse mirror version of the world i honestly think la in terms of many things relationship models included is the city of the future and that really we are just a few steps ahead of everyone else i live in a building full of social media stars viners instagram celebs who have tens of millions of followers they really are the new movie stars and i cannot tell you how many times i have seen a young kid doing pretty well with a girl and then the insta star walks up says hey and that it the first guy done he out the girl just got within 10 feet of someone with 10m followers and so now she has to have sex with the famous guy there no amount of game that the first guy can utilize to recover once celebrity is introduced into the mix that it game over whoever has the most celebrity points we have now quantified it via follower count gets the sex and that all there is to it i just finished a big sci fi screenplay about this very thing in fact so imagine my surprise when i looked around and saw it coming true years before i thought it would it fine and well but a lot of these girls do not even realize they are broken by time they are barely out of high school from all of the dick they have had i am 40 but as i said i live in a building full of younger aspiring stars and a few real ones it would seem girls just out of high school late teens some of them still in high school mid teens and just hearing these girls talk amongst themselves and with the guys it so clear that sexually speaking they are all broken beyond repair by the time they are 18 many by the time they are 16 think about that girls are now ruined for life at least as far as pair bonding goes before they can even legally have sex as an adult every young girl i have met in this building and in this city really all the girls who are like 18 19 etc they all have partners counts well into the triple digits sex to them is like brushing your teeth hot guy comes up wanna have sex although usually it sounds more like yo wan come ovah and suh mah dih or some equally horrifying low iq version of wanna suck my dick and the girls are like yeah ok there absolutely no filter anymore i mean hell from the girl pov it a brand new dick why would not you suck it and then fuck it there are no consequences right also let not forget the girl who has the most sexual partners is now considered to be the most desirable quite a turn around from a few decades ago and so we have the fallout all these girls have the thousand cock stare and they have it before they even turn 18 i mentioned in a comment just recently how i was hanging out with two 18 year old girls one a friend from the building and also her friend and her friend was like i slept with 4 guys last month that not a lot right and i laughed and said nope one new partner a week that exactly right for girls these days she laughed and said yeah that what i thought girl been sexually active for several years now no boyfriends relationships etc soooo what is that at around 50 partners a year maybe 200 partners by now at the age of 18 even allowing for breaks here and there i would certainly put her over 150 it a tough world indeed for the beta and as the requirements for alphahood get ever more strict thanks to hookup apps allowing women to find the hottest most alpha guy within 10 miles with but a single tap it only gonna get tougher from here on out ,4,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,indeed one of the biggest lies we have all been told from the very beginning show her what a great boyfriend you would be and she will fall right into your arms re cucking the betas i kinda think that going out of style these days up until fairly recently yes as a woman you would fuck the alpha and then arrange to get taken care of by the beta but nowadays all the young women i know are like nope i just wanna fuck alphas and that it it not like a few years ago when women would say yeah it would be nice to be in a relationship have a boyfriend be taken care of etc and then they would quietly hook up with alphas on the side now it like yeah i am not looking for anything serious right now i just really enjoy being single translation i want a new alpha every week betas no longer required i can take care of myself thank you very much ,6,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,i have never been married but obviously the alpha fucks beta bucks dynamic is still in play forever if you are working and slaving away for your wife this triggers her uh oh i am with a beta alarm and thus she going to do her best to avoid having sex with you remember women are biologically programmed to avoid becoming pregnant with beta seed mother nature wants it that way evolution wants it that way that how it is on the other hand if you live for yourself first and foremost make your own wants and needs your very first priority your mission is 1 and then put your wife second or third or fourth then you trigger her ooh wow i am with an alpha mentality and you get all the sex you want in fact she will likely want it more often than you do there are not that many alphas out there so when you are exhibiting alpha tells rest assured any woman in your proximity is gonna eagerly hop on that ride ,0,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,tyler durden owen from rsd had a great talk about this he kept taking all these rich successful hollywood exec type guys out into the field the guys were learning pickup getting good at the game they would get the girls back to their awesome pad up in the hollywood hills or wherever and then the second the woman steps out of the car and sees the place let alone inside the place it like whoa hold on there cowboy i do not put out so fast you are not just gonna bang me tonight you gotta date me first and the poor guy is like what happened she was all ready to go 20 min ago back at the bar she was practically begging me to take her home and fuck her brains out on the couch after a while they figured it out if a guy has nothing to offer then there no reason for the girl not to have sex with him right away if on the other hand a guy has a lot going for him money career etc then the girl is far better served withholding sex for as long as possible in an attempt to extract as many resources from the guy as she can dinners dates gifts etc obviously this is not a calculated decision it all happens at the subconcious level so yeah despite everything we have all been taught big surprise the broke deadbeat loser living on his friend couch is gonna get laid a lot more often than the bigshot living in the fully paid off mansion once again thank you trp for showing me the light ,122,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,i answered all my questions honestly maybe ran through like 200 or so and that was that my experience has been that match percentage on okc has absolutely no bearing on how well your date is going to go nor how quickly you will hop into bed with said date if at all i have had dates with women where we had absolutely everything in common and it was doa the second she walked in the door i could just tell and i have had other dates with your pink haired punk rock chicks nothing in common yet we were in bed hours later and the sex was amazing so you just never know it a lottery do not worry too much about the questions just put your best foot forward and start getting on as many dates as possible also do not know your financial situation but do definitely work on dropping the whole only a fool would marry me bit that also carries over into only a fool would date me which is baggage you do not need so you have debt so what you should see some of the dirtbag losers that these girls in hollywood all around me go out with no money no future nothing at all going for them yet they ooze attitude and thus still manage to get the girl i actually have a post about this i am about to put up in the next day or two so do not worry about your finances just work on yourself and in the meantime get into the dating field and see what happens besides if you have been reading this sub at all you should well know by now do not get married under any circumstances ,1,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,yeah i am 40 and i list my age as 40 a lot of guys my age will subtract a few years especially as the younger girls will often put the search cut off at 39 but for me i much prefer to just be honest about age up front i hate drama and age lying is bound to just bring up more drama at some point down the line honey you know how i said i was 35 well actually etc i am fine with omitting certain telling details my sober status for instance but with age i feel like i am better off just keeping it real up front that having been said your mileage may vary ,2,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,my okc profile has the absolute bare basics straight man 6 2 jacked white speaks english attended university does not have kids that it everything else re politics religion astrological sign drinking smoking drug use married or not wanting kids or not etc etc all of it been taken out truth is i do not drink or smoke or take any drugs and i do not want kids which may change one day but i doubt it now imagine being a woman and looking at my profile and thinking hmm does not drink smoke or take any drugs no fun and does not want marriage or kids no responsibility yikes pass so i very rapidly learned to leave out anything that might harm my chances of a reply just save all that stuff for later fact is it will almost certainly never come up because even if you do get them out on the date and then into bed girls these days are not gonna stick around long enough to get into the whole sooo how do you feel about kids debate you will hook up a few times enjoy them for a few weeks and that pretty much it then they are onto the next chad best to just present yourself as the blank slate then and let them project whatever they like onto you make it as easy as possible for them to hop into bed with you the rest will take care of itself agree with you re younger women i am 40 and i leave my age search range wide open 18 to 39 but honestly my target is basically 23 to 27 these days anything over that and they are harder to bed and just much more serious overall usually not worth the effort keep it young and keep it fun save the serious for your work your passion your lifting all that you may have been a white knight once but then most of us i feel at trp were at one point i only woke up a few years ago that like 37 years of white knighting for me enough to last a few lifetimes surely most important thing is you are here your eyes are open now that all that matters as for marriage you know the drill do not do it ,8,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns, does not have kids does not want kids leave that part out i am in the same boat no kids and no desire to have any also near your age as i just turned 40 but would never ever mention that on a dating profile why start the race with a 50 pound weight on your back same goes for your religion your politics even your astrology sign yes that will turn quite a few women off leave it out keep it light funny above all positive and just leave the rest out give it a try and see if you do not notice a sharp upswing in responses as a result ,38,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,experience is the only real teacher you really have to go back and forth a couple of times date 1 you pay for everything and see what happens date 2 you split the bill and see what happens date 3 once again you pay for everything and see what happens etc to really appreciate the contrast and finally realize that the more you spend the less respect you engender from women and the less sexual success you have as a result it a pity too because i actually really like dining out at nice restaurants and i really like doing so with beautiful women it too bad almost all those women ended up friend zoning me obviously i have since learned my lesson meanwhile all the women i just split drinks or coffee with on date 1 ended up hopping into bed with me an hour or so later go figure guess we gotta keep the fine dining option a strictly bros only thing from here on out ,2,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,by the way great example from my very recent dating history case study 1 she pays for everything met a girl on dating app hinge like tinder except that the girls you see are all friends of your friends on facebook beautiful middle eastern girl persian i am in la persians are everywhere out here and after a few messages back and forth we meet for coffee drinks etc at a bar here in hollywood i drink coffee i quit drinking alcohol almost 6 years ago she has a few glasses of wine bill comes 2 hours later she insists on paying for everything which kind of made sense since her wine was probably like 50 and my coffee was like 5 we walk back to my place only steps away hang out for a bit start making out have sex total time from first meet to hopping into bed maybe 3 hours turns out we have amazing physical sexual chemistry we end up fucking like rabbits all night long many orgasms are had by all so yeah as far as first dates go this is about as good as it gets total spent by me zero not a penny end result amazing sex and a lot of it case study 2 i pay for everything now about a week later i am on another first date with yet another middle eastern girl i think may have been indian was hard to stay dark skinned with asian features like my last first date the girl quite beautiful yet unlike my last first date i agree to meet her at a place of her choosing not my style to surrender the frame like that my first of many mistakes here but honestly i was tired of hitting the same few places in my neighborhood over and over again though certainly that strategy had proven to be effective thus far so i agreed to meet this new girl downtown at a place of her choosing vegan spot another giant no i have learned thinking hey why not let try some place new we sit at the bar i drink tea she has one beer we get some food since i am starving i made yet another mistake of not eating beforehand but thinking what the hell it a new restaurant i will try some new things here we chat for like 2 hours it all seems to be going well very well in fact we are fliriting the kino is there etc basically identical to my date the week before with the other girl however this time around when the bill comes i pay do not know why just figured what the hell i was feeling magnanimous so i grab it and say oh i have got this it was about 100 and took care of it she says oh wow thanks and i think we are all good we walk around her neighborhood for a bit after i drop her at her place we do not really have the vibe yet girl seems to be extremely conservative so i do not push on coming up thinking she much more of a hook up on the second date not the first kind of girl so i give her a kiss on the cheek and off i go in my uber thinking we will close on the second date in a few days for sure few days later i get a text from her hey i am not really feeling it think we are much better off as friends but good luck etc etc total spent by me 100 or so result friend zone now one could argue that the first girl was just a lot more into me and the second girl was not but honestly mentally reviewing both dates in my mind they were basically the same date with almost the same girl the only difference was that the first girl paid for everything while the second girl paid for nothing and i paid for everything and yet the first girl could not wait to get me into bed while the second one friend zoned me as soon as i was out of sight she just was not feeling it and why was not she feeling it because when you pay for a women this is the biggest beta tell there is so yeah take it from one who knows save your money guys pay for yourself and that it you will get laid a whole lot more as a result ,6,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,on the contrary the more you spend on a girl on the first date the less likely she is to have sex with you if you want to maximize your chances of having sex on the first date simply spend 0 on the girl you are with it really is that simple think of it this way when you are out with a girl having drinks maybe some food as well etc and the check comes and you casually toss down your credit card and say you wanna split this you are communicating you are equals you are not to be taken advantage of you have healthy boundaries you are both full fledged independent adults neither one of you owes the other anything etc etc you are maximizing your alpha tells women love this almost every time i have split the bill or accepted a woman offer to pay for everything which happens on occasion i have found myself in bed with the girl an hour or two later on the other hand imagine the following you have had a great time you have had a few drinks maybe din the bill comes you smile and say oh i have got this and immediately hand your server the bill along with your credit card taking care of everything you are immediately communicating to your date you are easily taken advantage of you think your money impresses her you are trying to buy your way into bed with her and on and on all of it very very beta she thinking wait i barely know this guy and he insisting on paying for everything hmm he must not have much going on then if he feels like he has to buy my affections he must not have any other women in play he must be desperate he must be beta it a hard pill to swallow gents since we have all been brainwashed from birth to think that the more we spend on women the more they are going to like us but the truth is if you want to maximize your sexual strategy you really should insist on splitting the bill 100 of the time no matter what it still possible to get laid after paying for everything certainly i have done it but you are making it a lot harder on yourself for sure just split the bill this is what every couple on every date in every other civilized country in the world does all the time by the way all except for the us and get her back to your place asap you will be amazed at how much more easily the seduction goes after that ,12,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,i would argue it more like the top 2 and not the top 20 as everyone here in trp keeps saying but regardless it absolutely true that women blame the whole 100 of men for the oh so scandalous alpha behavior of the top 2 because for women the top 2 is all they see it all their entire world is composed of the bottom 98 literally does not exist for them hence why we call these men the invisibles for a woman a beta male bottom 98 er is not a sexual option on her radar any more than your couch is an option on your radar your couch is a thing an item a tool to be used to serve you so it is with women and beta males ,2,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,i hang out and interact with a lot of younger women on a day to day basis i live in a large very social apt building in hollywood full of late teens early 20s women all freshly arrived in la hoping to make it big etc and for me as a 40 year old male it been fascinating just listening to these women talk for them the idea of a boyfriend of having sex with just one person for any extended period of time is such a completely alien foreign concept they all have smart phones which they are glued to constantly and sex with the hottest available guy within 10 miles is available to them any time 24 7 with just a tap of the finger a new guy every time so indeed why would anyone ever want to give that up i think the interview you mentioned is correct in that many of these girls do somehow in some way seem themselves traditionally married at some nebulous point in the far far future like they will ride the cc of course they do not call it that for them it just having fun being free doing what they want and then at some point well into their 30s they will meet the perfect guy he will instantly propose and somehow they will just magically turn off this casual sex lifestyle like flicking off a light switch they will marry mr perfect who been waiting for them all along and everyone lives happily ever after what they do not realize and what is extremely clear to me and anyone else who played the field for a bit is that hookup culture is not just something you turn off in an instant any more than 20 years of heroin addiction assuming it does not kill you is just something you can shrug off and walk away from whenever you feel like it i do not doubt that at some point many of these girls may try a monogamous relationship just to see how it feels i also know for an absolute fact that given they have been hooking up with at least one new guy every single week since they became sexually active at 14 or 15 so we are talking about hundreds upon hundreds of men here the idea that they can shut that off and commit to just one person is totally absurd they can try but one week into said relationship they will get a text from a new hot guy who found them on social media saying hey which is code for wanna have sex tonight and that will be it game over the attempt at monogamy will be aborted just days into the process this is one of the reasons why i am always preaching a combination of level 2 plate spinning and level 3 monk mode mgtow philosophy on here so many men on trp think if they just improve themselves enough if they lift enough if they make enough money if they master enough game they will finally land an ltr with a great girl like they will finally become worthy of a monogamous relationship with a beautiful woman what so many fail to understand is that ltrs do not really exist anymore that was the last generation honestly it all just gonna be plate spinning for everyone from here on out ,8,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,totally agree with the no straw thing i am 5 years sober and my goto bar drink is diet coke you typically get it in a tall glass with lemon and a straw and for while i would just suck away oblivious to what i might have looked like or what impression i was giving off it was not until i saw crazy stupid love and ryan gosling makes the observation when he trying to turn steve carell into a ladies man what are you doing get that straw out of your mouth that i realized oh damn it far better re establishing a masculine frame to sip from the glass rather than suck from the straw so yeah for all you non drinkers out there get that diet coke in a tumbler with a rock or two as if it was a whiskey no straw ,0,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,agreed i forgot about how back in the day all women were synced up to the moon one alpha impregnating all the women in the tribe within a space of a few days that a tricky one there were probably a few lesser alphas hanging around behind the scenes ready to pounce when the main alpha was napping in between sex sessions was never really sold on the 80 20 thing though i agree with the phenomenon absolutely i just do not like the numbers in my experience it really more like a 98 2 split these days with the 2 getting smaller with each passing year as the market becomes ever more efficient mobile tech letting women find the absolute best looking guy in 10 miles etc i think back in caveman times i read that it was like a 94 6 split something like 1 in 16 is that math right of our ancestors was male the rest female but however the exact numbers break down generally speaking yeah we had a very few select men having sex with all the women and the rest of the guys just got cut out of the reproductive cycle wonderful for the gene pool very bad for civilization which depends on all men being motivated to get off their ass and do things usually to impress women ,1,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,i have an acquaintance she a writer out here in la known for writing about dating relationships etc in one of her books she mentioned how when she was quite young she was dating a guy who right after she broke up with him went on to become one of the biggest movie stars in the world so for like 20 years after everyone she dated they could just never measure up because of course she could only move up the ladder not down movie star was now the floor for her dating experience as far as she was concerned fast forward a few decades she now in her mid 40s still dating still playing the field i was reading something she wrote recently or maybe it was a podcast cannot remember she was talking about going out with yet another celebrity think it was a big tv star this time she really pushing for a relationship with this one making him wait for sex etc they finally hook up she demands exclusivity right afterwards and the guy was like um what and then dropped her like a hot potato and she was shocked like no joke this mid 40s woman who clearly had been kicked out of the dating pool 10 years before though no one had told her could not believe that she was not able to secure the commitment and exclusivity of a famous hollywood celebrity at her age with her extremely high partner count and obvious alpha widowhood etc etc it like women honestly believe that regardless of their smv they are still worth more than any man regardless of his smv a women who a 2 is still worth more than a man who a 10 and when they put this philosophy into practice and it completely backfires they just do not understand what is going on what is wrong with the world why wo not this perfect 10 commit to me but it always his fault never hers the funny thing is if my acquaintance above came here and read the entire trp sidebar i wonder what she would think mind blown denial is not it interesting how the world is full of women who make their careers off of writing about love dating sex and relationships and yet we here at trp seem to be the only ones actually making any headway into figuring out what is really going on honestly i have so many women in my life who would benefit so much from coming here and just spending 2 weeks reading everything too bad they will never find the place or they would just close their eyes and plug their ears if they did ,1,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,well i think back in the cavemen days there was not as much sleeping around a woman was born into a tribe of like 100 people say 50 men and 50 women of all ages there was pretty much one alpha who did all the fucking and that was it women took one glance at all 50 men say 35 of them were in the proper age range to have sex the rest were children or elderly their hypergamy kicked in and it was like yep gronk is the alpha of the tribe he has the highest muscle mass lowest body fast squarest jaw runs the fastest is the best with a spear brings home the most meat and oh wow he has a necklace of shiny gemstones no one else has that he the one i want to have sex with and have babies with so we can have more little gronks running around would not that be amazing and of course every single woman in the tribe felt the exact same way female hive mind they all wanted gronk no one wanted any of the other less than the best options even if it meant being gronk 10th choice as opposed to beta bonk 1st choice the problem nowadays is that everyone and no one simultaneously is or could be an alpha there no way of really telling at first glance anymore it not like the caveman days where you took one look at the whole tribe once you were a sexually mature women and that was it it was obvious and you never met anyone else outside the tribe in your entire life now we live in an infinitely big tribe with potentially an infinite number of alphas out there some of whom may even be more alpha than others so of course the female hypergamy instinct goes crazy it as if your one big mission in life was for example just to go north to reach the promised land and you have a compass that points north you and follow it and follow it some more only ever day unbeknownst to you the big n on the compass is constantly shifting direction so you think you are always walking north getting closer and closer to your goal when in reality all your doing is walking in circles forever it a big problem and one that we have only managed to solve throughout history by imposing monogamy at large on society but periodically this system breaks down as societies inevitably become more liberal as they age and ultimately more decadent people revolt against it we revert back to our caveman ways back to just a few alphas having sex with all the women as is the case now all the beta males stop working and check out because they know they will never get any women at all no matter what they do so why bother society collapses we have the dark ages and then a new society arises out of the ashes a conservative that once again rigidly enforces monogamy and so the great wheel turns ,1,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,it absolutely about women much preferring to enjoy a wide variety of men growing up we were all brainwashed into thinking men are shallow men are pigs men just want to have sex with as many women as possible etc etc while at the same time hearing women are deep women are wonderful women are nurturing caring creatures who really want nothing more than a nice emotionally fulfilling satisfying relationship and of course in reality quite the opposite is true men actually seem to be the ones that crave the stability and security of a long term relationship while women are the ones that want to have sex with as many men as possible this is anecdotal of course but these days it seems like all i hear from my guy friends many of them good looking successful guys who have already amassed a fairly high notch count you know i am really tired of playing the field at this point honestly i just want to settle down i just want a girlfriend etc and a lot of these guys are only in their 20s while all of my female friends 20s and 30s lament yeah i am seeing all these guys i do not want anything serious though there this one guy i think he wants to be my boyfriend or something but i was like ew gross um no we are just having sex but i am not gonna be your girlfriend i am not gonna go out on dates with you and spend time with you nooooo way ,2,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,i was in college almost 20 years ago it was already pretty crazy back then and we did not even have mobile tech and hookup apps just email and basic internet no online dating there was definitely a hookup culture beginning to take off late 90s but it was all social circle game it was still all on you to actually meet the person first through friends parties group activities etc there were no apps to automate that first introduction step for you nowadays with tinder etc i cannot imagine what the college experience is like a few attractive men definitely have it a bit easier for sure but for all the women good god it must be an all out roman orgy though of course they are all being passed back and forth between the same few alphas ,1,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,i think women have always been promiscuous and craved variety just like men it just that much of our civilization for thousands of years has been all about establishing rules that attempt to keep said promiscuity in check now that those rules out the window we are beginning to see the effect of female hypergamy unchained couple that with mobile tech and soon ar tech which allows women to connect and have sex with a new man whenever she likes all with just a single finger tap and it not surprising at all to see these extremely high partner counts in fact i wonder if compared to the rest of history the women of our time and place have the highest overall average partner count ever would be an interesting thing to look into ,2,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,i never wanted kids however two of my best guy friends recently had children one has a daughter who almost a year old the other daughter is about 2 i think about them growing up out here in la what it going to be like for a teenage girl living in hollywood 10 15 years from now and honestly knowing what i know about women thanks to trp and looking at where society is going and all the wonderful technology that is making casual sex oh so much easier to obtain with each passing year i just cannot imagine what these kids are going to be going through pretty soon it will be like every teenage girl is going to be a porn star with her videos up on online for everyone to see and every teenage guy at school will watch all the vids they will trade these videos back and forth like baseball cards and there will be upvotes likes for best oral best threesome best anal best gangbang it sounds like dystopian sci fi when i say that 14 year old girls or 12 how young can we go will be uploading ever more graphic and degrading porn clips of themselves all in order to one up each other in the attention based teenage social marketplace and yet is not this obviously where we are headed like becky put up a threesome video over the weekend all the boys are talking about it i better get a gangbang clip up soon steal some of her thunder this spoken by a 14 year old girl it sounds absurd and yet i can totally see this happening in fact i do see it happening more so than any other possible future i wonder then is there some theoretical limit to all of this at some point when it all just one continuous non stop orgy does it all just become white noise ,3,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,these studies are all wildly inaccurate because women are psychologically incapable of accurately reporting their real partner count even as part of a scientific experiment even anonymously the truth is they honestly do not know that girl i mentioned who said she would had 6 partners in her entire life when the reality was she would already hooked up with more than 6 guys in my very building in just the past few months i bet if we put her on a lie detector and she said 6 she would pass with flying colors she honestly believes to the very core of her soul that she telling the truth when she says 6 she not lying that her real reality in that moment and so it is true for her now as far as the objective reality goes the only way to get a truly accurate estimate of women partner count these days is to actually befriend and get to know a lot of women ideally if you are here on trp this is in the casual fuck buddy sense not the beta orbiter sense hang out with them often and then observe how many men they bring in each and every month find out when they first became sexually active and do a little math then and only then will you reach something like the real number ,7,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,could not agree more and honestly i am always rather awestruck at the number of otherwise seemingly intelligent people here on trp who for whatever reason denial radically underestimate the partner count of today average woman you see a post like oh i found out she had 20 partners i was shocked devasted and i feel like commenting no buddy put another zero behind that number and then you will be getting closer to the real thing i have talked about this before but i will lay it out again here partner count for women and the top few men is heavily influenced by what generation you grew up in and in particular what communication technology dominated that generation if you a woman were born between 1960 and 1975 gen x and grew up with television reruns you likely had an official reported partner count of 7 or 8 while the real number was about 35 if you were born between 1976 and 1989 gen y and grew up with video games email and the internet and internet dating you have a reported partner count of less than 20 while the real number is somewhere around 60 or 70 if you were born between 1990 and 2005 millennial and you grew up with mobile phones texting and apps and app based dating and hook ups while it a little too early to say this gen is just now getting into the sexual marketplace in earnest the likely reported partner count for a typical millenial who will be say 28 in about 10 years will be less than 100 you will be considered not a slut as long as your reported partner count is still in the double digits while the real number will be 300 400 500 depending on your attractiveness level this sounds shocking i know or at least to our older readers some of our younger players probably think this is pretty obvious but i cannot emphasize this enough millennial women having grown up with internet porn casual sex hookup culture and mobile app technology which connects everyone to everyone else all the time have become promiscuous in a way that i am guessing we have never seen before ever in the history of our civilization i live in a large social apartment building right in the middle of hollywood and i am surrounded by women just out of high school dozens of attractive girls all in their late teens and early 20s all hanging out by the pool in the hot tub by the fire pit etc i talk to and overhear them all the rate at which they acquire and discard new partners is absolutely mind blowing these are women aged 18 22 who are already well into the triple digits unbelievable not really if they are racking up 3 new partners a month or about 100 new partners every 3 years and they have been sexually active for 5 or 6 years sooo you can do the math on that one and then extrapolate forward another 10 years of course they do not see it that way most of these guys do not count one girl late teens brought up her partner count recently unasked for as being 6 i laughed and laughed i know for a fact she slept with more guys than that in this very building in just the past couple of months and she been sexually active for several years i have been hanging out with her off and on for almost a year now she like the rest of them brings in a few new guys every month and these are just the ones we know about all simply by tapping on her phone you might say la and hollywood in particular is the exception and i might agree but make no mistake la is just a little ahead of the curve here the rest of america and the world is rapidly going to follow suit and when the next gen comes up the augmented reality ar gen when we are all walking around with google glasses bolted to our faces and we all have holographic hotness rankings floating over our heads and ai digital assistants ready to direct us to the next willing sex partner no game required the ai does it all for you forget it it over i honestly do not think that the world is prepared in the slightest for the societal fallout that is going to ensue men unable to get sex unless they are the top 0 01 with a hotness ranking of 9 999 out of 10 good luck with that and women becoming fucked out and literally incapable of feeling love forever years before they are even legal adults it going to get very very lonely depression and suicide will be rampant so will violence rape and mass shootings as inevitably happens whenever men are denied sex en masse i wish i had a solution for this i wish i could just kick back and laugh and say enjoy the decline but the truth is i am very very worried for the future and i am just not sure what if anything we can do about it ,69,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns, any woman you interact with for a long amount of time in a non sexual manner who is not already head over heels for you is not a woman you will ever sleep with so true women are usually comfortable having sex after about 7 hours of knowing you often you can get that down to 3 or 4 if you know what you are doing but 7 is pretty standard it also about the length of 3 dates once you hit 10 15 hours however you are now in the danger zone and after 15 hours if you have not moved into sex territory by then that it you are done she polarized you into the friend zone and you will never have sex with her regardless of what you do after that go ahead and make a billion dollars cure cancer join a rock band save the world none of it will matter once in the friend zone always in the friend zone there is no getting out took me years to figure this one out but once i did i cannot tell you how much easier and better life became once you realize that a woman you have known for more than 15 hours yet still have not had sex with should automatically be nexted no matter what because at that point she will never have sex with you no matter what it like having the ultimate cheatcode to life the time money energy and heartache you save it truly beyond measure ,36,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,this is the problem with caveman living in a tribe of 100 people 50 guys and 50 girls all the girls save the children and elderly of course are going to have sex with the biggest strongest fastest guy the top alpha and the other 49 guys are cut out of the reproductive cycle from a purely genetic standpoint this is a good thing mother nature wants this evolution wants this because it means the next generation will be the biggest strongest fastest possible generation the problem lies in the exact set of circumstances you pointed out however in a system in which you know for a fact that as a beta male one of the other 49 you will never ever ever have a chance at sex ever and if you even approach a woman about the possibility the woman will run screaming to the alpha male who will then beat you and kill you for attempting to mate with his property well then what is the point of doing anything why better yourself why contribute to the tribe why not just lounge around all day drink beer amuse yourself as best you can and then eventually die this is how it starts the betas all withdraw from the tribe they become bored restless frustrated and then eventually as is the case whenever there a complete sex drought they band together overthrow the alpha male rape and pillage everything the tribe falls apart and it utter chaos until another alpha male rises up and gets things going again so basically under pure natural law the primal state the one women prefer you have utter chaos all the time if you want civilization however then you have to start enforcing rules very specific unnatural rules like we know all you ladies want to fuck the same top guy but experience has shown that does not work because all the other guys check out and then revolt and overthrow society so how about this the top girl gets the top guy and that it the second top girl gets the second top guy and so on every girl gets one guy no more harems rigidly enforced monogamy and suddenly all those beta males that before were not contributing are now forced to contribute hunting deer inventing the new iphone whatever because they now have a wife and kid to feed what is fascinating is that in the modern day as the shackles of marriage and the very idea of monogamy are being thrown off we are now returning to the primal state looking back at the entire history of our world you start to realize that all successful societies have basically been attempts at combating the single most destructive force in the entire universe no exaggeration female hypergamy of course saying female hypergamy is like saying round sphere but you get the point many societies manage it for a while but all eventually let loose the chains in the end and then you have a return to caveman dynamics all the women mate with the top guy for the best genes and every other guy is cut out of the sexual marketplace so they withdraw society suffers and then ultimately collapses as i have said before just wait until we all have hotness rankings floating over our heads augmented reality and that will be it whenever a woman wants sex she will just ping her app and say show me the hottest guy within 10 miles available for sex in the next 20 minutes in this environment a few years away but it coming if you are not a 9 999 you are not getting laid ever the perfectly efficient marketplace will see to that and once you realize you are never going to get sex as all men are going to very quickly why do anything at all why start the new google why build that spacecraft to mars just get a fun job bartender surf instructor whatever hang out have fun drink and die you wo not be having sex you wo not have a family so just earn the bare minimum to get by and that it this is the real collapse that we all know is coming and honestly as someone who been thinking about all this since i first heard the word hypergamy and found trp 2 years ago i really do not think there any way to stop it i really think we are due for another dark age period that will last centuries until another conservative society rises up out of the ashes in the year 2500ad or whatever crazy when you think about it but there it is ,14,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,i should also state here i absolutely believe neil would as he claims continue to love his son just as much as ever even if he were to discover at some point that the child was not biologically his i know parents that have children who are biologically their own as well as adopted children and they all say that there no difference between the two you love them all the same it just what neil very blatantly implying here that absolutely terrifies me this notion that well if i found out my child was not mine i would still love him all the same therefore it does not actually matter if he not mine or not therefore go ahead ladies and get knocked up by whoever you want as your man i will happily stand by and do my part to raise the child regardless scary scary stuff ,6,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,i was actually watching a q a with neil strauss on youtube not too long ago he was promoting his new book the truth when an audience member brought up exactly this talking point and then followed it up with i am paraphrasing a bit here so if this is where it all going open relationships polyamory etc if my wife gets pregnant how can i be sure that my son is really my son and not someone else child the woman on the panel she was pro polyamory obviously chastised him with what is this thing that you men have where you just have to continue your own genetic legacy why are you so attached to that ie why cannot you just raise someone else kid what is wrong with that and then here the best part neil piped up with oh yeah i agree if i found out today that my son was actually someone else that i was not his biological father i would not care in the slightest i would still love him just as much i am telling you i think this is the first time in my life when my jaw actually hit the floor i just could not fucking believe it it was like there it is everyone the collapse of our entire society right there in a single sentence make no mistake gents in the very near future the idea of a woman bearing the child of the man who she in a relationship with being taken care of by will be considered ludicrous in the extreme first it will be the normalizing of cuckoldry already starting then it will be elite sperm banks fathers raising sons that are biologically related to them will be considered very very unusual as in you will be shamed for it at parties social gatherings etc why are you being so selfish continuing your genetic line do not you want your kid to be as tall as possible as handsome as possible etc on the plus side the entire population is about to get extremely attractive every single boy will genetically be a chad thundercock interesting to see what this will do to the smp when everyone a chad we will need a new breed of superchad in order to stand out on the down side since every child in the world will now belong to just one of a few dozen elite sperm bank chad fathers there goes genetic variation and i am guessing we will be inviting in a banquet of consequences with that one ,25,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,fact is if you are pursuing a high value high smv woman who has her shit together and has a lot going on simply commanding her drinks at bar x 9pm be there is not going to cut it i usually find the best course of action is to give her a few like two specific options and let her pick one that way she feels more involved and owns the choice but also it much more likely that she will actually be available since the time frame has a wider spread actual example i used a few days ago to set up a date me how drinks and a nibble wed or thurs eve her ohh yes wednesday me perfect let do fig tomorrow at 8 her excellent see you there and now i have a date tonight in fact you need to establish the frame sure but there no reason not to allow her a little freedom to maneuver within it if you get her involved you get her invested ,2,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,as bill maher put it a little while ago paraphrasing here gay is ok transgender is ok it all ok now except one thing older men dating younger women that really is the last taboo of course as the red pill spreads and the manosphere eeks its way into the public discourse i wonder how much longer that will be true i never had a problem with older women per se for me i will consider a woman of almost any age it really a case by case basis sort of thing but that having been said i turned 40 about 2 weeks ago and about a day later i adjusted all my online and mobile dating preferences hard cut off for the women at 27 and under though honestly i find myself giving all my attention to those 24 and under fact is most women just are not aging well these days too much easy one tap on the phone access to unlimited free booze drugs sex etc and thus more and more you really have to get them pretty young if you want to feel even a hint of attraction whatsoever since by the time they get to their late 20s they are pretty much fucked out as to the negative commenters on the linked article they can crow all they want but you know any one of them would trade places with mel date in a heartbeat and now if you will excuse me i am gonna go rewatch braveheart one of the greatest movies ever ,12,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,the car analogy is actually very apropos for how women view men as well imagine you live in a densely populated urban environment work from home only need to drive short distances a few times a week i tell you there are two cars you can choose from both are free one is a ferrari the other is a honda civic here the thing though you share the ferrari with 10 other drivers the ferrari basically looks and feels new ish and performs fine but whenever you are not driving it and you only get it for a few hours each week someone else is the honda civic on the other hand is all yours no one else drives it ever you and you alone own it free and clear which car would you take i am guessing you went with co owning the ferrari and now you know why women would rather be in a harem with an alpha male than the sole and exclusive choice of a beta the alpha male is the ferrari yeah they are sharing him with a dozen other women but who cares while they are together for an hour she gets all the status praise and validation that comes along with owning a ferrari the beta is of course the honda civic cheap reliable never breaks down always there for you but then no one gonna glance at you twice when you drive down the street ,7,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,women think all alphas are genuinely that way they never needed to practice piano much like good will hunting they could just sit down and play if you are the guy the trick is to never let on that all your alpha characteristics were acquired not inborn let the woman think that by taking your alpha seed your amazing guitar skills that you never needed to practice that were magically born with will thus automatically pass on to her firstborn son slip up once let her peek behind the curtain to see the real you the one that worked oh so hard to get where he is and she will be off to find another real alpha seconds later ,41,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,the easiest way to toss a plate just show a few seconds of vulnerability had a plate a few months ago beautiful woman sex was great and she really had her shit together too career wise unlike a lot of the trashier women out here in la but for whatever reason i just was not feeling it with her which of course only turned her on even more i am sure so i never upgraded her from plate status during the brief time we were together few weeks in the girl starts getting on my case a bit why do not we ever go out do anything together etc also little arguments popping up here and there and drama is something i never tolerate in a plate not for a second and i realize i am probably gonna have to cut her off soon but then i think well maybe i should just get her to walk away and then all the work is done for me no and the easiest way to do that why show some vulnerability of course something she would been on me about for a little while anyway claiming she was into new age y sensitive men etc so i take her up on the challenge knowing full well this is gonna be the death knell which i am totally fine with and i say yeah well things have been kind of tough lately i came out here to be a screenwriter i spent years writing this big sci fi project finally put it out there i was so proud of it so sure it would take the town by storm and now turns out it might not even get sold or optioned let alone made hollywood has changed no one is buying original material anymore and honestly given the state of the market i really do not know what i am gonna do next etc etc all of which was true but typically would be information i would never share with a woman she takes all this in says thank you for being vulnerable with me i appreciate it and then vanishes into the night and i never hear from her ever again now granted this worked in my favor as she was a plate i was gonna drop anyway but i am sooo very glad that i had the opportunity to try this little experiment and see the results firsthand when women say they want vulnerability it a shit test gentlemen never ever show weakness maybe years ago when women had fewer options you could get away with it every now and then but these days when a new fuck buddy for them is just a single tap on the iphone away forget it you will be left behind forgotten in a heartbeat ,6,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,true looking back on it now i am sure whatever interest temporary fascination i held for her due to my blowing her off would have evaporated just a few minutes into any interaction we ended up having together my unwitting alpha tells would have been revealed to be the smokescreen they were and 10 minutes into our date with her beta warning system suddenly blaring away she would realize oh wait he does think i am hot shit after all guess he does not have that harem at his beck and call like i thought he did hmm i wonder who else is around tonight and that would have been that ,10,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,ah the red pill once you see the code in the matrix you look back and realize damn so many missed opportunities years ago one of my best friends was a male model aspiring actor married to a well known fashion designer in new york city lot of parties lot of booze and blow lot of models mostly female couple of guys hanging around etc etc one night at their place i am chatting up this absolutely gorgeous girl a model my friend wife was working with at the time we are totally vibing and she gives me her number with yeah let stay in touch next morning i look at the number for about 2 seconds and then literally just toss the thing out figuring why bother it not like i am gonna date this chick or anything i was a pudgy bastard at this point with just a touch of game but mostly i would just stumbled into a situation in which i had a few cool friends and thus i was sorta cool by association all i could think was me with this stunningly gorgeous thing forget it why waste my time even trying so a few weeks go by and we all end up out at whatever the hot nightclub is at the time bunch of friends from the industry and there the model chick from before she slides into our group comes up to me and says sooo what have you been to i rattle off something evasive and noncommittal oh busy etc and then she hits me with yeah i have been waiting for you to call me no joke exact quote and the funny thing is she actually sounds a little hurt when she says it now here the best part i am so bowled over terrified really when she says this that now in a state of total shock all i can do is just shrug and say something like huh really and then here the total cringe factor part hilarious in retrospect i just turned around and walked away seriously my young mind was blown it was like the little rainbow ball on the mac when everything freezes and i did not know what else to do right then except beat a hasty retreat could not imagine the girl would have been interested in me at all i was not nearly as good looking as the rest of the crowd so i did not even entertain the idea of calling her let alone taking her out etc looking back now though it was that very nonchalance that honestly probably would have gotten me a pretty solid date tao of steve was right we pursue that which retreats from us lesson learned display those alpha tells the cool aloof zero fucks given attitude and you are already halfway to home plate ,65,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,it clear the guy lacked game but here i think the answer is even more simple and clean cut he did not get the kino in up front so she put him in the friendzone that it as someone who did a lot of dating just a few years back and took a whole lot of notes after each date the single biggest deciding factor i found re getting to sex was breaking the touch barrier early and often if we sat at a bar side by side and over the course of 45 minutes i lightly touched her thigh right next to mine her mid back her upper arm her thigh again and left my hand there a bit longer the second time that was pretty much it she was good to go and we usually had sex at my place less than an hour later if on the other hand we sat across from each other a table between us and thus i had no opportunity for touching lest i have to reach all the way across and grab her hand or what not which was usually terribly awkward sex almost never happened i could not figure out why some of my dates were resulting in instant closes while others resulted in there no spark let just be friends as all the dates went pretty much exactly the same and i seemed to have chemistry with everybody until i consulted all these notes i took i was approaching my dating marathon as a kind of scientific experiment trying to crack the code did a meta analysis of everything going on and realized huh every time we sat side by side and i touched her i got laid and everytime we sat across from each other no touching at all i did not years later i found trp and now the why of it absolutely makes sense but at the time the simple realization of get the kino in asap or you will fail this was completely mind blowing ,6,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,was ghosted by my fiancee a few years back and this post definitely shed some light on a few things met the girl speed dating we slept together on our first official date the next night saw each other every day and night that following week i proposed at the end of our first week together she said yes crazy in retrospect i know but love will do strange things to a man we swore we would never be apart forever and ever it was the whole blue pill disney esque fantasy relationship continued for 3 months best relationship i would ever had was sure i would found the one my soulmate and then one day she was gone no fight no argument nothing one moment we were going to spend our lives together and then suddenly it was from her this is not working we are done single phone call all of 2 min and she was out stayed gone for 3 months i do not i even gotten off the couch in the meantime i was so devastated and then one day she came back sorry i was crazy but now i am better let try again i took her back soulmates once more we even got sober together i brought her into aa her sober birthday was 2 days after mine 6 months of bliss and then like clockwork exact same thing ghosted gone not even a call this time just a text you will never hear from me again good luck with your life and that was it no fight the relationship was going perfectly fine we were totally in love did not matter she just vanished no explanation it was rough though i cannot say it was as bad as the first time second time around well i guess you are kind of expecting it even though you are in denial at the same time my friends were sympathetic to an extent but how could they really know what it was like i tried to explain to them the dread that you live in being in a relationship where you know to the very core of your being that your girlfriend could vanish instantly without any warning whatsoever and then when it happens that feeling of the floor dropping out from underneath you of not being able to trust anyone or anything anymore one of my closest guy friends scoffed that just the girl you chose they are not all like that maybe next time you will pick a better chick imagine his surprise when his girlfriend ghosted him in the exact same fashion also 6 months after their relationship began they also went from we are gonna spend our lives together to this is not working we are done all in a 2 min phone call just like the one i got also no fight no argument etc the girl just decided she was out and so she was the guy was shocked ruined every once in a while i have a friend remind me of that ghosting episode like someone will ask so whatever happened to that one chick the crazy one that vanished without a trace you ever find out what the deal was i always just shrug nope never found out never will do not know do not care now that i have found the red pill i can perhaps explain her behavior somewhat but the bottom line is when she told me every day i love you and we are gonna be together forever what she really meant was right now i feel like i love you and we are gonna be together forever however my feelings could change tomorrow or even in the next 5 minutes this post only cements what i already knew investing in these women in any woman is like investing in a stock which can spontaneously implode at any moment generations ago there were checks and balances in place to keep this from happening nowadays not only is it not frowned upon by society it actively encouraged go on girl do it who cares if you are destroying another human being so what it your happiness that counts yolo besides this new guy is like one tenth of a point cuter than the last one and that the most important thing right great post op looking back i do not know what sort of story my ex fiancee invented which justified her ghosting me but i am sure it was an elaborate sweeping epic inner monologue which painted me as the evil villain and her as the long suffering heroine i wonder what the trigger was for the light switch flip though new cute guy at work friend suggesting she can do better in the end i guess it does not really matter gents enjoy your time with them but do not get attached they can and will walk at any time and you will get no warning the switch will flip eventually and when it does you are done ,11,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,nyc favors the men to an extraordinary degree i actually wrote a long post about this search dating hooking up in nyc vs la but the short version is too many single girls not nearly enough single guys and thus the guys call all the shots add to that the fact that my friend the pay for your own slice guy is an extremely good looking hipster living in brooklyn guy a foreigner to boot he got the whole dark mysterious stranger thing going for him and yeah he absolutely closes on the first date 100 of the time though to be fair i think he going after the 6s and 7s he much prefers the low hanging fruit of course the whole fuck you bit is kinda his thing and he gets away with it because he an arrogant musician bad boy this was years ago i do not know if it would still work these days now that we are all a little bit older but to be fair i have seen heard men do far worse on a first date and still get the lay it just has to be congruent with the image you present to the world the chubby nerd cannot pull off the fuck you bit if he tried he would be slapped but the broke bad boy musician sure easy ,1,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,i feel you op i went through something very similar about 5 years ago quit drinking quit smoking started dieting and lifting hard and heavy net weight loss 60 pounds total body recomp about 80 pounds of fat off and 20 pounds of muscle on got the body i always wanted landed a huge writing assignment made a bit of money all over the course of about two years first year for quitting drinking and smoking second year for everything else a radical transformation for sure short version is most of my guy friends were cool with it some were quite proud of me in fact a few were not whereas most of my female friends were not cool with it many were downright offended even actively hostile while a few were ok with it the quitting drinking thing was the big one without that nothing else would have followed you often gain weight right after getting sober i did but just a bit i was already pretty heavy but after about 6 months to a year of being off booze once you finally have your sober legs under you then you can get serious about tackling diet exercise your career women all the rest of it socializing without the crutch of booze is a huge hurdle for sure at first it will feel like walking on your hands while attempting to juggle with your feet simultaneously your first few dates sans drinks will feel like pulling teeth but you will get better like playing the video game on hard mode you will crash and burn a few times when you start but pretty soon you will be a better player than most others out there as for your old friends many of them may not make the journey with you into this new chapter of your life that perfectly fine to be expected even let them go they see you one way it likely they have known you that way for many years and they cannot just unsee unlearn all that they think they know about you overnight and suddenly start thinking of you in a whole new way some can but many cannot let them go like i said above most of my guy friends were thrilled when they saw the new me i cannot tell you how many times i caught up with a male friend after a few months away and the guy would be like dude you look amazing seriously actual quote got this exact compliment many times but the women forget it men see you doing well and they say hey you are clearly kicking ass how do i do that and they grill you for diet and fitness tips women on the other hand see you doing amazingly well and though they smile politely they will completely ignore refuse to acknowledge any progress you have made at all and on top of that they think to themselves why is this guy lying to me why is he pretending to be someone he not for this reason you will almost certainly drop most of your female friends you might keep a few of your guy friends but if they are friends from your old boozing days the connection just wo not be the same and many of them will slowly fade away this is a good thing remember for men it all about the climb about doing better and better if you are obviously on the climb then many men assuming they are not stuck in the negative feminine should be inspired by your example and want to join in on the climb with you i had other male friends drop a lot of weight right after i did it was pretty awesome gotta say but for women as far as they are concerned all human beings both men and women are born how they are and that it there no moving up and down the ladder there is no climb you are born at a certain rung on the ladder and there you stay throughout your entire life that bad boy tattooed pierced guitar player in that punk band he did not get those tattoos to get girls he did not have to learn and practice guitar to get girls he was just born that way he just naturally knows how to play guitar it his genetic gift like magic and if she has sex with him and gets impregnated with his alpha seed she will have sexy sons that have all these traits too just like he does likewise the chubby nice loveable loser he was born that way too that his rung on the ladder and that where he stays forever and ever cut out of the reproductive cycle for what woman would want his sons and if you the chubby loser should shed those unwanted pounds take up guitar and join a band god forbid the girl will be absolutely horrified like what are you trying to do you are not this person you are whoever you were the first moment i saw you all those years ago so why are you lying to me right now why are you beta pretending to be an alpha that all they see a sheep in wolf clothing take off the disguise sheep go back to your honest self your true self that nice chubby lovable loser she met way back when otherwise she might accidentally have sex with you thinking you are an alpha and impregnate herself with your lovable loser beta seed and you know we just cannot have that ,2,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,this one works wonders every time i have had a female friend say oh i would never go out with a man that did not take care of me did not pay for everything on our date etc i always reply oh really that funny i would have pegged you as a feminist inevitably they say i am a feminist at which point i reply well then do not you believe in equal work equal pay all of that woman of course absolutely and then i say sooo why do you expect the man to pay for everything then i am sorry i do not understand maybe i am missing something here it important that you deliver this in the most honest sincere tone you can muster then i sit back and watch as they get all flustered begin to stammer and a few moments later the hamster breaks down completely and everything just kind of stops rather like watching the rainbow ball spin on your mac forever and ever and that it the conversation is over seriously next time you are worried about getting shit over splitting the check just whip this one out never fails should also note here every girl that ever hit me with this by the way and most of my female friends fall under this category all of them without fail end up denying sex love romance intimacy of any kind to the men who spend any money on them at all and at the same time they always always lavish all their attention sex love desire on men that spend nothing on them and in many cases the women actually end up paying for everything alpha warriors do not spend money beta providers do if you spend any money on her at all even something as little as buying her a drink she will automatically peg you as a beta provider and thus put you in the friend zone someone to extract attention validation and resources from but never someone to give sex to if you want to be perceived as the alpha warrior and thus worthy of sex you have to stop spending money on women contrary to everything society has taught us from birth re how to treat women but there you go welcome to the red pill ,8,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,archwinger left one of the best comments i have ever read here on trp just a little while ago i will re quote here the biggest angriest lie that keeps beta men in check is the belief that women need to feel some kind of emotional connection with a guy before they will be willing to have sex when a loser man learns that his wife girlfriend was a super slut who cannot even name or remember over half the people she fucked or messed around with it hits him like a truck all of that crap about how a woman needs to feel safe comfortable special loved and emotionally intimate is bullshit she fucked all kinds of guys she barely knew just for fun then it dawns on him even more all of the times she rejected his sexual advances because she did not feel special comfortable loved emotionally intimate that was all bullshit excuses to cover the fact that she just plain did not want sex with him at all if she wants sex she does not need any of that she just fucks for fun but she not into him so she uses those excuses those lies he believed his entire life to hide her lack of attraction to him then he feels used exploited tricked i know it been said a thousand times but i will say it again anyway op you are sooo ahead of the game if you are getting this information now as opposed to later i went through your exact same situation not once but many many times over the course of my life and each time i thought well ok that one woman was a terrible human being a total slut but i am sure the next one will be different it was not until i was in my late 30s and well into the triple digits re notch count that i finally started to suspect something odd was going on and of course soon after i found the red pill and everything finally clicked awalt and all that if you have already found this place at your age let me assure you you are going to have an awesome amazing life as other commenters have mentioned i know it no comfort to you now but bear with me be grateful that you have already been given a chance to peak behind the curtain and see what is really going on in the feminine psyche it sucks i know and you are gonna have to reformat your whole worldview here and you will be bitter and angry and alone for a little while after just accept it as a phase that you have to go through we all went through it and get to reading lifting eating right improving yourself etc two years from now you will be a completely different human being five years from now you will look back on this girl and laugh to yourself and think oh my god i cannot believe once upon a time i got myself into such a twist over a cheap worthless fucking slut man that is hilarious truly it will be like night and day best of luck with your journey now get to reading everything on here and then hit the gym after ,2,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,was talking about this very thing with a friend the other day unlike everything else in life the arts sciences business etc in which generally speaking the more you put in the more you get back women seem to be the one exception to this rule the less you put in the more you get back i think this is what trips a lot of newbies up certainly my red pill awakening came a few decades late for this very reason as everyone prone to thinking of women like everything else in life as if they were some kind of incredibly difficult video game or business case or science engineering problem to be resolved the more time energy effort and money you throw at the problem the more likely it is that eventually you crack the thing open get to the top of the mountain rescue the princess etc etc unfortunately as we all ultimately realize or perhaps fortunately i should say assuming we do realize it at some point the exact opposite is true the best and only way to get the girl is to subtract your investment from her completely all your time money energy and dump it all into yourself instead make yourself into someone she would want to be around and the rest will take care of itself you wo not have to do a thing she will come right to you when it comes to getting girls it all about law of attraction not law of promotion ,9,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,guys if you take nothing else away from this sub more important than awalt more important than hold frame or hypergamy does not care or alpha fucks beta bucks or never marry by far the single best most important lesson you can learn here if you have not already is wear a condom every single time you have sex no exceptions ever i do not care if she says she on the pill i do not care if she swears she std free and has the papers to prove it i do not care if she a virgin wear a condom every time i have been religious about condom use throughout my entire sexual history and the one time the one time i had sex without a condom the girl got pregnant thank god she was a good friend and longtime fuck buddy neither of us wanted kids at the time she wanted children one day but not then i wanted children never and so we took care of it as they used to say and that was that bullet dodged but goddamn i was sweating bullets for a few days there like what if she just decided to go ahead and have the child there goes my life completely derailed forever and aside from the whole pregnancy thing you all know all too well if you have been reading here how hypergamy works we have got a couple of top tier std riddled alphas the top the 2 soon to be the top 1 10 of 1 running around fucking almost all of the women who of course much prefer being a member of an alpha large and impressive harem as opposed to the sole exclusive choice of a lowly beta and as a result std rates amongst women are skyrocketing particularly since with mobile tech and social media it now so incredibly easy for women to find and hook up with the local neighborhood alpha these days more and more in the coming years if you are having unprotected sex with a woman you are going to catch something statistically it just a matter of time that perfect little church girl you managed to get back to your place after 2 5 dates is the same girl who hooked up with dj bikdik4u at the club two nights before exactly 18 minutes after she met him and i am pretty sure that guy did not break out a condom when he bent her over the bathroom sink and took care of business and so now by having sex with that same girl you are in effect indirectly having sex with the alpha she just hooked up with or at least you are picking up the same stds he has through the women you are unknowingly sharing with him wear a condom with every girl every single time no exceptions ever ,2,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,true after reading fooled by randomness nassim taleb guy who wrote the black swan i thought the same thing maybe it all just confirmation bias you only see and meet the winners so you assume that all there are winners the losers are not out and about shouting about their losses so we never see them so we assume they are not there still the older i get and the more people i meet the more it seems like financial success and formal education really are not nearly as directly correlated as i would once thought which is to say as society had told me they were my entire life will have too look more into this ,2,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,someone needs to do a post about this lately i have been noticing it seems like all the guys with the multiple advanced degrees the dual law mba types etc while they are doing okaaayyyy money wise it seems like more and more the really well off guys i am meeting the ones really killing it are the ones who said fuck the system academically early on dropped out of a college if they even went in the first place started a business often a really boring straightforward one like i sell toilet paper to hotels and they are just absolutely killing it making money hand over fist think this was one of the big points in the millionaire next door as i recall i used to live in nyc and if you met someone in their late 20s they were likely just wrapping up school and only then looking to finally get into the job market out here in la i met a guy who was 27 a little while back dude owned several extremely well known well attended bar lounge restaurants and he was already working on his next clearly he got on early start as someone who spent a long time in academia it been pretty eye opening to see the number of people who have fairly little formal education and are just killing it in an entrepreneur sense definitely a topic worth exploring more ,5,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,robert glover no more mr nice guy talks about this in one of his podcasts may have been in the book as well cannot remember where he says get to rejection as quickly as possible tells a story about asking a girl out and how many of his readers clients and i used to do this to would often fly under the radar when approaching girls not making their intentions clear at the outset like you want to date the girl but you are afraid she will turn you down that just coming out and asking how about a date will scare her off so instead you are like how about we grab lunch this week and talk about that one creative project you are working on etc and all the while the girl is wondering sooo is it a date then answer unless you say this is a date then it not a date glover mentioned how one time he asked this one woman out and made it clear right up front that it was going to be a date like there this live band playing saturday night at 8pm let grab some drinks and check them out etc i think he might have had some some sort of biz relationship with her beforehand so he had to make it clear this was not biz this was entirely personal the woman knew it was a date glover intention was clear and she turned him down but and here the great part glover says right after the rejection man when i heard that rejection i pumped my first in the air like yes i got to rejection and gents i have to say when i heard that on the podcast i actually laughed out loud and the whole thing suddenly made sense i fucking love the fact that the guy gave himself a fist pump for getting turned down because really that exactly what we all should be doing here owning our desires acting on them not flying under the radar but being clear and above board about our intentions and if she says yes to the date then great and if she says no to the date that great too you win either way because either way the victory is in successfully expressing your desire that the only part of the process you control the outcome her saying yes or no is not up to you so do not worry about it get to rejection as quickly as possible that victory ,8,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,came here almost two years ago skipped the denial phase spent about 5 seconds in the anger phase skipped the bargaining phase pretty much went right to the depression phase been here ever since want to get to and through acceptance but just cannot ever seem to cross the threshold every once in a while i read a post like this one that starts off with let talk about how to get past depression and into acceptance and then i read the post and look at the final conclusion and think yep still in depression hell i am even more depressed now the thing is maybe depression is not the best way to put it exactly as i am actually pretty content with my life right now i think disillusioned might be the most apt descriptor for the phase i am in and i am wondering really if there anything beyond that ever maybe then disillusioned is acceptance am i already here without even realizing it is contentment the most you can ever hope for after swallowing the pill as the matrix so eloquently put it neo there no going back is there morpheus no but even if you could would you want to also seems to me the current relationship market is very much a mirror of the current financial market take all the financial regulations out of the economy unshackle the traders on wall str etc and watch the law of attraction kick in as all the money energy rapidly accumulates around just a few people at the very top of the pyramid the people who already have money attract more money while everyone else who has little or no money attracts more little or no money likewise remove the shackles of monogamy from society and watch all the sex energy rush to just a few alphas at the very top same exact thing ,2,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,was walking down the street yesterday afternoon looked up saw a giant black billboard had a single sentence on it nothing more in huge white block letters it said on behalf of all men i would like to apologize not an ad for anything that i knew of just that and i thought jesus fucking christ really but whatever shook it off got home a few min later signed onto reddit for a quick hit and saw on the front page at last a cause i can get behind clicked on the link and there it was another billboard this one saying how do you stop a 30 year old man from beating his wife talk to him when he 12 of course the joke was that somebody had scribbled support time travel or something like that underneath the sign but regardless yeah there was something about being hit with two billboards in a row just a few min apart i started to get very very angry and i am like the most chill guy you will ever meet i mean you really have to dig deep to get under my skin but this was just absurd i just sat there and thought wow i am really really angry right now and then almost fascinated looking at and analyzing myself i realized they really are getting very good at pushing my buttons are not they do not know about the rest of you but i am finding it harder and harder these days to take in anything having to do with the mainstream media i cut my cable a few years ago now it just netflix and hbo cut all my social media save facebook which i use mostly to see what is up with friends back home and keep up with a few social groups but even then despite the fact that i do not watch tv do not watch ads and stay out of most of it still i am being hounded by billboards on the street and by facebook shares of course the digital equivalent all to the effect of men are evil women are good let praise women let denigrate men etc etc and honestly i like to think i have some pretty thick skin here but with each additional offensive billboard i see or fb share or online ad or reddit post i find myself being nudged just one more inch towards men going their own way and that for me is the scary part i do not think us men are all gonna rise up together as one and scream out loud and make our voices heard as the women have done for generations i think what is gonna happen is that we are all gonna just finally hit our breaking point the gladwellian tipping point shrug our shoulders and say yep all right we got the message you do not want us fine we will all just leave adios and that will be it only we wo not even announce our leaving we will just leave one by one and then suddenly all at once like the intellects and captains of industry following john galt off into galt gulch all vanishing without a trace and the thing is i do not want to take myself out of mainstream society it not like i do not want to participate in the conversation but when i am in a situation as i am now where i feel like i am slapped in the face everywhere i turn everywhere i look and on top of that when i know for a fact that i am not even allowed to bring up the fact that i am offended in any kind of polite conversation because doing so would imply that i am being critical of women which again is something you are simply not allowed to do in mainstream society media for any reason being the eminently practical man that i am i think does not it just make more sense then for me to avoid the constant slaps by not showing up in the first place i do not know never fancied myself a mgtow but honestly if this shit gets anymore over the top it may be the only logical place to go bonus my building had a giant billboard right on top of it for months that said no more he was just asking for it horribly fucking offensive and i had to look at it every single day i came home to my apt building yeah that was fun ,2,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,i quit smoking more than 4 years ago do not mean to sound flip about the whole thing for those who have had trouble quitting in the past but honestly it was one of the easiest things i have ever done in my entire life i really do believe the whole it sooo difficult to quit smoking schtick is just a thing invented by cigarette manufacturers to keep their customers from even attempting to break the habit fact is once you stop smoking the nicotine is physically out of your system in 72 hours and psychologically you are pretty good after two weeks and that it that all it takes me when i finally got around to thinking ok this is it i am feel like i am gonna quit soon i did not put any particular time limit on it i just knew i just felt that my time with cigs was coming to a close friend of mine told me to check out allen carr easy way to stop smoking most highly recommended book and video pretty much said exactly what i wanted to hear it easy you just decide to quit and do so and then a few days later one morning i was smoking a cigarette and i suddenly realized huh you know what this is my last cigarette and so it was it was just obvious the time had come i chose to make quitting easy and that was exactly my experience no patch no gum no drugs no withdrawal no cravings nothing i was just done it really can be that easy is that easy if you want it to be ,1,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,a lot of entrepreneurship is simply having the nerve to overcharge people and see if you can get away with it fact is if you know even slightly more than the customer about whatever product or service it is that you are selling than sky the limit go ahead and shoot for the moon when it comes to pricing who knows you just might close the deal example had a friend who had a company several years back friend wanted a new website for said company pretty basic affair like 6 pages or so the usual intro about us case studies our team contact us etc also wanted all new text on the new site so i told him i would write the text had to get to know the industry interview everyone at the company etc and i recommended a web designer friend who could do the actual site design and layout all in i think the guy budget was like several grand i took 2k if memory serves to write the copy and the web designer was getting like 5k a bit pricey but she did excellent clean design and we both agreed her aesthetic was a perfect fit for the project so fast forward a few weeks and we are at the web designer place this absolutely killer loft in midtown manhattan by the way which i recognized as having been used in a number of movie shoots turns out she was in the process of getting divorced so maybe the loft was a divorce present who knows so the guy who runs the company me and the web designer are all sitting around this table checking out the new site making sure everything working and at one point i click on a link and say hey we really need this link to open up in a new window as it is now it takes us away from the main page the web designer woman furrows her brow nods slowly and then as if really thinking carefully about all this says hmm yes i see hmm well i think we can do that for you but it gonna involve a major redesign let me think yeah we are gonna have to add 785 to the budget for that i forget the exact number but i remember it was in the 700s i shit you not this woman is sitting there looking us straight in the face and quoting 700 to tweak a single line of code now of course she did not know that my friend and i were both fairly technically inclined so to give her the benefit of the doubt before totally calling her out on her bs i said no i think you misunderstand we just want these links to open up in new windows that s it that all her yep got it we can do that 785 me sighing yeah ok hold on give me ten seconds and then right there in front of both of them i pulled the source code typed target blank in front of the link my html is a little rusty but it was something like that literally like 10 keystrokes reuploaded the code and we were done problem solved whole tweak took less than 10 seconds my friend just looked at me like are you fucking kidding me suffice to say we rapidly ended that meeting paid out the designer and never dealt with her again but here the thing if i had not happened to have known basic html then her request of pay me 785 so i can overhaul the entire site for you and give you what you want might have seemed totally reasonable never mind that what we were actually requesting was a simple code tweak that took a few keystrokes we might not have known that and she might have profited greatly off our ignorance and you know what s really funny and kind of terrifying as we left her building and my friend and i were talking about what just happened we both were like holy shit do you know what this means anytime you deal with anyone who knows slightly more than you do about whatever you are trying buy whether it be a web designer doing your site or an auto mechanic fixing your car or a plumber doing your toilet or whatever if you do not know what is going on they can charge you anything they want and there absolutely nothing you can say or do about it scary indeed so yeah if you re the customer do your research and get to know the basics so you won t be taken advantage of and if you re the entrepreneur bone up on your acting skills and your nerve and try tossing out a hugely outlandish number who knows you might just get away with it ,9,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,i am the exact same way was technically raised by a single mother but she could not have been more disconnected reality is i was actually raised to use the word in its proper sense by video games and what is really funny it all totally makes sense too if you think of it in terms of mother comfort succor escapism and father instruction guidance course correction then really video games were my mother when i was very young they gave me the relief and the escape and protection from reality that i needed and many years later the internet eventually became my father giving me guidance when at long last i realized i could not go any further without it though certainly i had to seek it out first sucks that we missed out on some key instruction growing up but hey better late than never and honestly in some ways i kind of think the late instruction has its advantages like the difference in coming to religion spirituality late in life after you have studied deep and wide versus getting it in your youth when you do not know any better at least now i know there are no holes in my education and if there are i can clock them immediately and plug them accordingly ,2,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,the neurons that fire together wire together the more time you spend thinking about a woman the more likely you are to become addicted and develop oneitis may sound a little hardcore and a touch new age y but honestly policing your thoughts starting with simple awareness meditation can help enormously with this is the best defense if you find yourself thinking about the same woman over and over again realize that you are thinking about her acknowledge what is happening no judgment on yourself just a simple acknowledgement and then gently divert your thoughts to something else giving into thinking about her for any length of time is like giving into the hot fudge sundae when you are trying to cut fat it feels good for a few moments but the long term repercussions are never worth it keep your thoughts clean and healthy your reality will follow suit ,22,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,gonna go against the grain of some of the comments here and suggest that while the wall thing is possible it far more likely that she in the life repair phase of either a recovery program aa na etc or in the middle of a transformational workshop like the landmark forum the 8th and 9th steps of any 12 step recovery program involve getting in touch with people from your past and offering an amends for any wrong doings you might have committed and of course workshops like the landmark forum are all about life repair going back through the past and cleaning up your messes etc it a pity that this process is not more in the public discourse if it was perhaps fewer people would freak out about it when contacted by a ghost from the past fact is you handled it just fine op the best response when someone gets in touch and offers an amends is simply great to hear from glad you reached out yes of course i accept your amends best of luck with everything and that it keep it short and sweet and then get back to your life do not under any circumstances invite them back into your life i tried this with a few amends it was an absolute disaster every single time simply gracefully accept and move on also do not worry about this notion of oh my god i accepted her apology does that mean i reverted back to my beta ways here it not about that it about the spiritual high ground acceptance forgiveness closure a wonderful thing and when you look back on the brief conversation you had with her recently you will probably realize that you got some much needed closure as well all good ,2,asktrp

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,absolutely this as well i forget which seduction archetype it was but one of them that greene talked about in the art of seduction basically involved the guy charging out of the starting gate at full sprint acting as if he was already incredibly unbelievably over the top in love with the girl and this after just having gazed upon her visage for but a second casanova maybe like oh my god you are the most beautiful woman i have ever seen i cannot live without you you are my soulmate etc etc think italian men doing street approach in italy any fellini film given that women out here in la are so used to player esque dudes not giving a fuck being totally outcome independent etc i am guessing this might be a kind of new anti game that some dudes are running this i am so into you romeo and juliet style of pick up which while i do not know if it will last is definitely something different to say the least she probably just shocked by his unusual approach and is enjoying the roller coaster ride as a result ,2,asktrp
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,points 1 and 3 do not work in this case alas her last guy who she was with for quite a while was almost but not quite equally loser ish hence my shock at this possibly becoming some sort of trend and it seems he actually does give a fuck she showed me their texts guy about as beta as beta can be talk about mr clingy think point 2 is definitely on the mark though women really do not need a beta provider anymore as they have their own money so they do not need a guy to pay for things and they get all the emotional validation they need from social media this girl has quite a presence so now it all about being different with your selection of men like being different in your selection of fashion stepping outside the mainstream etc i remember being kind of surprised years ago when hipster fashion was coming in showing my age now thinking um wait so the object is to dress down and to come off as poor as possible so you want to look like a homeless person why to be different of course never mind that everyone else is doing it as well kind of the same thing happening here when girl 1 is like well my guy is homeless and girl 2 is like my guy is homeless and a drug addict etc it almost like they are convincing themselves well this must real our relationship must be true honest and authentic because why would i be with him otherwise definitely curious to see how long they last but yeah does seem to be the trend these days edit spelling ,2,asktrp

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,white guy here was engaged to an indian woman several years ago met her speed dating in nyc went on a proper date the next night slept together on the first date said our i love you s and proposed to her after just one week of our being together it was that obvious to me at the time thought i would met my soulmate etc girl says yes but then tells me while we are lying there in bed of course i should probably get divorced first so that red flag 1 turns out she currently married but no worries they are separated and in the process of filing the papers for divorce he was an arranged marriage the girl was an indian muslim from a conservative indian muslim family who naturally insisted that she marry another indian muslim she saved herself for him until she was 25 looking back post rp yeah right they got married turns out he was gay so that did not work out girl and i were together for three months did not spend a single night apart true love the whole bit then suddenly one day she ghosts me just gone vanishes without a trace i am heartbroken girl comes back 3 months later sorry don t know what happened guess i was a little crazy but that s ok i am all better now bonus she a child psychiatrist i take her back bring her into sobriety i would just recently quit drinking and recognizing that she was an alcoholic as well made it a condition of our getting back together that she also get sober she agrees again did i mention she was a muslim who was also a heavy drinker do the math on that one for me gentlemen and tell me how it works out we both do aa and actually it absolutely wonderful like true paradise i have finally found my one my unicorn a woman who smart and beautiful we do our thing get along brilliantly spend every day and every night together i ve never been with a woman this amazing never connected with anyone on a level this deep before yadda yadda yadda and then sure enough 6 months later another ghosting this time for good one day she just doesn t come home we never spent a night apart not in our whole 6 months i don t see her for a whole week i am tearing my hair out wondering what happened to her kidnapped murdered and finally i get a text you will never hear from me again good luck in life that it no argument no fight no explanation nothing just gone i would thought the rest of my life was going to look and be a certain way with this woman by my side always and forever and suddenly in a heartbeat she was gone and the rest of my life was suddenly all going to be very very different told my friends what happened and not one but two of them separately these two friends did not know each other said yeah indian women do that they are like lovediggers love that word they go out and have these pretend love romantic relationships with white men but it all a sham it just something to do until they settle down and marry the brown person that their parents have already picked out for them i said no you do not understand my ex already had her arranged marriage the guy turned out to be gay she assured me that my being white wouldn t be a problem that it would be different this time that she would be allowed to marry a white guy nope sorry friend she lied that whole thing she had with you or that you thought you had with her it was all a lie she had another arranged marriage lined up in fact she probably ghosted you like a week before she married the next guy it just how they roll confirmation these two separate friends both white guys both planning on getting married to indian women both ghosted in the exact same way i was one after a year with his fiancee the other after about a year and a half with his so maybe i got off easy with just six months so yeah takeaway if you are white enjoy your casual fling with the indian girl but do not get attached and certainly do not plan on any kind of relationship or marriage you are not brown you will never be accepted by the family or the culture it just isn t gonna happen do not even go there trust me on this once you have been ghosted by your fiancee this is not something you recover from it like losing an arm it does not grow back you just somehow eventually learn to get on with the rest of your life and everything everything is just a little bit darker after that ,4,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,i do not doubt you can pull women off of tinder and okc out here in la though again i have generally found it significantly more difficult and time consuming than doing it in nyc my big thing is i just have not found any attractive women online out here honestly how would you rate the 7 women you pulled in the last five months 6s and 7s how many solid 8s and 9s have you seen online let alone pulled out on dates maybe i am just looking in the wrong places but okc seems like a post apocalyptic wasteland of overweight 5s and 6s tops tinder has the occasional 8 maybe but then there the link to the instagram profile and it like oh they are just looking for ig followers etc if you have found a way to dig up high smv women online out here in la absolutely let us know write a post because seriously i just ai not seein em out here thus far ,1,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,surprising you are the first person i have ever met or heard from that has had any success with using online dating sites in la probably should have qualified my statement above and specifically said no high smv women in la are online using online dating sites obviously there are women using these sites match okc etc but every time i hopped on and took a look the search results were just horrifying you do a wide open broad search in nyc and almost all the women that come up are fairly attractive some of them are extremely attractive here in la you do the same wide open search and you are looking at like 3s 4s if you found a way to find high smv attractive women online out here in la and then on top of that actually found a way to game them out of their caves and cajole them out onto dates then my hat off to you you should absolutely write a post about online dating in la i would love to read it my own experience out here has just been quite different for me it all been about meeting people by going out moving through various social circles etc that and the fact that several of my closest friends out here are high smv women and none of them are on any kind of dating site or app contrast this with nyc where all my high smv female friends were online dating all the time in la if you are a high value chick you just do not need online dating you are approached by hot high smv guys every 5 minutes of every day there just no need to get online and search for more your real life inbox is already overflowing as it is i mentioned in another comment how one of my best friends out here lives right next to me is a beautiful blonde stripper and i can assure you that for her the whole notion of a hot babe having to go online to meet men in la would be totally ludicrous same for all her friends but yeah man if you have had a different experience i would love to hear about it honestly my online game is pretty tight and i certainly prefer it to cold approaching at bars online lets you cast a far wider net i have just found all the women online out here grossly unattractive and even if you find a semi cute one they are far more difficult to get out on dates as compared to nyc where they just pop out after a single message but if you have found otherwise please post and share like i said i would love to read it ,1,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,nyc for me was all 8s and 9s la oddly enough has been full of like 6s and 7s though i am seeing a high 9 right now biggest surprise for me i thought the la girls would have been far hotter overall but that really has not been my experience thus far i am a big face guy though for me i am all about the model esque features high cheekbones great teeth a big white perfect smile in nyc a girl with a 9 face usually had a 9 body an 8 face had an 8 body etc it was all consistent here in la it weird you have all these girls with 9 bodies running around but then you look at the face and it like a 6 maybe a 7 with makeup it like someone took a really beautiful girl wacked her in the face a couple of times with a frying pan and there you have it the typical la chick of all the girls i dated hooked up with in nyc i was actually really attracted to quite a few out here in la on the other hand i find i am attracted very very rarely again do not know why this is just been my experience so far ,5,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,girls are fine going to a bar by your place as long as you really sell them via text on the merits of the space paint a picture with words this bar is amazing the entrance is hidden down a back alley you go in and it a circus theme with acrobats there even a dwarf magician and a monkey that runs around and sells cigarettes or whatever getting the girl back to your place is easy provided you have a solid reason for her going back sometimes you can just hit her with let head back to my place in fact this will usually work but just in case you might want to hedge your bets with you have to meet my pet hedgehog frank etc it does not matter what you say and she will never call you out on it once you get through the door point is you just have to establish for her that she not coming back to your place to sleep with you she coming back for some other alternate reason and when you do hop into bed well it just happened right she could not help it it was fate ,2,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,no high smv women are on dating sites out here precious few are on mobile they just do not need to be it true that they are all on social media and many use instagram as another kind of tinder but strictly speaking re dating sites and apps la women just are not into it hop on okcupid and do an la wide search for single women aged 21 to 39 you will be shocked and horrified at what comes up ,3,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,great username i am right there with you my man took 60 pounds off right before i started my big nyc dating experiment years ago high protein low carb low cal and lift you will get there in no time ,2,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,yeah i thought the same thing but then all nycers know the official stats and then the real stats the official stats make it look like a pretty level playing field if not skewed just a little bit more towards the men what the official stats are not taking into account however is the fact that an enormous percentage of the women being surveyed like all of them are saying they are currently in relationships but they are actually not no women wants to admit she not with a guy even if it anonymously and just on paper does not fit in with her view of herself and the world girl thinks well i did have sex with that hot guy last night so yeah i am totally in a relationship marks it down accordingly trust me i do not know what the actual ratio is but everyone who lives in nyc will tell you it at least several to one in favor of the men check it out you wo not be disappointed ,4,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,totally everyone got a raging six pack out here not a carb in sight if you are not rockin sub 10 body fat you might as well be part of the furniture honestly i am kind of shocked i have hooked up with as many women as i have out here and it really has not been that many looking at some of the guys running around in my building alone they really are the best looking guys in the world no game at all though but then it would seem they have never needed it ,3,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,great question and i actually have a great answer for you full post on this coming soon i live in a high end luxury building right in the middle of hollywood said luxury building has what i humbly refer to as the most amazing hot tub in all of los angeles i spend a lot of time in this hot tub daily and soon after i moved here i began chatting up this girl who was always in the hot tub with me right around the same time every afternoon girl is a really beautiful blonde stripper welcome to hollywood also my neighbor right down the hall ended up becoming one of my best friends out here never had a thing for her i can see how she hot if you are into that but just not my thing we hang out all the time etc so to answer your question every time we are hanging in the hot tub and some random dude approaches her or anytime we are out anywhere doing anything at all in this town and some random dude approaches her which happens all the time i actually get to hear the cold approach in full each and every time it happens of course the approach always starts with so how do you two know each other i always quickly offer up oh we are just friends we live right next to each other and then i take a step back grab a seat get the popcorn out and watch the guy go to work and man i am telling you i have rarely been so purely entertained as when i watch these young dudes go to work on gaming a stripper a woman who by the nature of her very job listens to and applies and deflects game on a daily basis for a living it is truly honestly hilarious and amazing all at the same time so yeah hanging out with this chick for like the past year and a half and all her stripper friends believe me i have seen and heard it all by now that why i brought up the whole nightclub owner routine there was this one weird week where like every guy that rolled by our hot tub our building always has random dudes coming and going and they all always hit on all the chicks ran the nightclub routine was it like the routine of the week on some pua site or something and this girl my friend and i were just laughing and laughing like oh so you are an owner in club x too how funny we have met like 10 of your partners already this week thing is even though the girl know it all bs or suspect it is oftentimes they do not seem to care provided the guy is hot enough you would get shot down in a heartbeat for trying to pull that in nyc but here in la the chicks are like yeah he full of shit but whatever he a dirty tattooed guy and i am kinda into that i am we are gonna hookup anyway so maybe that old game adage is true it not lying it flirting ,8,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,i met plenty of 8s and 9s online in fact my last year in nyc looking at my records i would say it was a pretty even split between high 8s and mid 9s they are definitely out there you just have to spend a little bit more time looking through that mountain of thumbnail photos on whatever site or app you are on of course you will meet the occasional 9 in public just going out or whatever but really in my experience it was much easier to track them down on whatever dating site in nyc you just need to do keyword searches for yoga fashion etc and they should pop up accordingly never was a fan of tinder myself but i know all my high smv female friends back in nyc definitely prefer it now to online dating so there you go all the top tier girls are going mobile means you have to as well fear not if your photos are up to snuff they will definitely be eager to meet if girls are flaking on you it just means the smv of your photo set is not high enough time to take some new photos keep swapping them out until you find a combo that works i used to like match i actually liked the pay wall high barrier to entry meant less flakes for sure lately though all the top tier girls have left it at least from what i noticed in favor of tinder guess the ladies do not want to drop dollars anymore on something they think they can get for free never used cold street approaching in nyc everyone just in too much of a rush for me that having been said i know it does work i know guys that are great at that just not my thing my best success in nyc was 1 tracking down the hotties online followed by 2 chatting them up at bars etc ,3,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,agreed getting to know all the promoters etc is key out here never really was into clubs did all that back in nyc in my mid to late 20s kind of over it now in my late 30s but a lot of my female friends out here all mid to late 20s are into it so i am dragged out on occasion it all about who know perceived status all that funniest thing is i do not think any of the girls actually enjoy being at these clubs it like they go just because they are supposed to go like it the thing to do gotta get out gotta see and be seen etc i was at a hot fairly new club just a few week ago friend of mine was doing an art thing there and i came along she tight with the promoter one of her old fuck buddies who has his own table bottles etc i sit down with my diet coke my friend trots off to do her art thing and i am left alone at this table with like a dozen stripper model types and all of them every single one was just staring at her phone tapping away texting the bad boys they were planning on hooking up with later that night like no interaction amongst themselves whatsoever i chatted up a girl sitting next to me for all of a few min but most of these girls really there just nothing there no connection nothing to talk about i mean she was totally nice and pretty and amiable enough i suppose but really you could have swapped her out with any of the other girls there all like 8 5s and 9s and i doubt i would have known the difference one fake titted bleached blonde looks just like another especially in the dim club lighting hung out for a few more min and then made a hasty exit just was not my scene guess i am much more into hanging out with girls and chatting them up over coffee drinks etc in a semi quiet cool bar lounge type space but then the la social scene is so club centric or maybe that just hollywood makes it tough to go out at night unless you are really into all that which i am not like chris rock says you do not wanna be the old guy at the club do not think i am quite there yet but it rapidly approaching for sure ,17,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,i have heard the exact same thing apparently the ratio is 7 to 1 re single guys to girls which makes sense considering tech is very male centric etc one of my best friends is a hot asian female back in nyc i keep telling her move to sf she will totally clean up have her pick of men be dating the head of google or whatever in no time ,3,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,yeah average one bedroom prices are pretty steep think soho tribeca is now well over the 5k month mark for a spot in a decent building thing is you have to prove your income as being at least 40x your monthly rent before you are even allowed to apply which means showing an income of 200k just to get in like i said it great if you can afford it just might be tricky to start here for the younger crowd unless of course you are pulled out of an ivy and drafted right into goldman sachs etc ,15,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,i was a writer but to be fair i came into the city with a little bit of money already in hand nyc is one of the most expensive cities in the world and last i checked my neighborhood tribeca was the most expensive hood in fact all the downtown hoods are getting pretty pricey these days so yeah come prepared to spend a lot if you want to break in finance seems to be the default career for the downtowners there was a little bit of tech going on back in the day silicon alley when i first moved there in 2001 but do not know if that really still a thing or not my experience right before i left was that the whole city was basically turning into a few hedge fund managers and the thousands of servants who worked for them with the occasional russian oligarch and saudi oil baron tossed in for good measure if you have a lot of cash then tribeca is awesome best restaurants soho as well best shopping though it gets touristy on weekends if you are on more of a budget you will likely be looking at brooklyn etc but then some people like brooklyn more actually more of an artsy edgy vibe over there though again much like downtown the artists are steadily getting pushed out to make away for all the finance people nyc is awesome and if you can manage living there for even just a little bit i say take a shot it really is like no other city on earth ,9,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,i live and work in hollywood it the exact same way with acting gigs you have this amazingly talented highly trained actor come in read for a part he totally nails it owns the role and then he like on the way out you know i just want to say really i am just sooo grateful for this gig and so thankful that you all took the time to see me today etc etc director feeling the desperation coming off him in waves is like um yeah ok well thanks for coming in moments later some douchebag who never stepped in front of a camera before in his life comes in gets his lines out but just barely director is like so what brings you here dbag blazing with confidence oh i do not know just thought it would be fun to try out do not really care if i get the part at all actually think this whole thing is kind of lame but whatever call me if you want i do not care later peace and then he walks out seconds after that casting director turns to main director and says you know i really liked that second guy director i know what you mean he just had a certain special something right let bring him back in outcome independence it everything ,3,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,absolutely guy i traveled the world and ate tons of great food and had sex for an entire year publisher who cares girl i traveled the world and ate tons of great food and had sex for an entire year publisher sounds like a book to me nyt bestseller list here we come guy i actually stopped having sex for an entire year publisher wait you did not get laid all year so basically that pretty much means you are just a regular guy right girl same publisher oh my god that incredible how did you do it how did you survive let get your story into print asap guy i had sex with lots of different people over the past year even though i am still married my wife did not approve but i did it anyway what could she do fact is i am the one in control here and what i say goes publisher you are disgusting human being filthy a monster you should be ashamed of yourself girl same publisher such a fearless adventure of self discovery i am seeing a book talk show appearances lecture circuit t shirts coffee mugs movie rights and of course in this case guy i consistently drank to the point of blackout and ended up having lots of casual sex with random strangers over the past god knows how many years publisher so you are an alcoholic this is not interesting girl same publisher such female empowerment and so it goes ,15,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,39 year old here discovered the red pill about 18 months ago 37 at the time so take heart it never too late fact is every time i come here and read a post that starts with i am only 23 or i am only 18 or i am only in high school i think thank god thank fucking god that some of these guys are starting this early now and getting this absolutely priceless information right out of the starting gate if you are under 25 or hell under 30 and reading this sub let me assure you just by being here you already have a huge head start in life i cannot emphasize this enough it like a shot of steroids into well everything looking back on my own life process thinking about all the decisions i would have made differently in my 20s and early 30s had i even just had access to the sidebar here wow it mind boggling tempting to think i would have been unstoppable invincible but hey no regrets right every decision i made was necessary to get me to where i am now here and honestly i could not be happier at the moment and if you are older and are new to the red pill 40s 50s do not you feel the same way also i really do believe partner count has nothing to do with your alphaness or betaness etc when i stumbled onto this place 18 months ago my count was around the 150 mark and i was absolutely at the time the king of all betas as beta as beta could be ironically since i found this place i have probably had one of my slowest years yet think my count has gone up only by like 5 or 6 and that it partly because i moved to la from nyc it s a tougher scene out here post to come on all that shortly partly because i have stopped actively pursuing women in order to push hard on my career partly because i am currently seeing a beautiful women who while i am not exclusive with her and she technically a plate fills all my needs at the moment and thus i am not really out gaming other girls on a regular basis though i am open to it but mostly because honestly after swallowing the pill i just do not care that much anymore if women come to me great if not no worries i have got plenty of other things to do in my life and honestly most if not all of those other things are more entertaining and far more fulfilling than what the vast majority of women out here are capable of providing for me at this point in my journey so yeah you can be the ultimate alpha and theoretically have a partner count of 1 or you can be the ultimate beta and have a partner count well into the triple digits source me or at least the old me with regards to the latter i say do not worry about the n count it s really all about your attitude and how you decide to approach the world the rest will take care of itself and again if you are a young guy reading this pat yourself on the back you made it you are free and you are going to have an amazing life i promise ,16,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,the golden rule you do not have to protect a woman from herself if she tells you she wants a long term relationship but then sleeps with you anyway as long as you have told her even just one time that you do not want a relationship you are in the clear a woman s ideal might be a long term relationship that does not mean she might not let go of that ideal for a good fuck in the moment this from robert glover no more mr nice guy podcast on being an integrated man whore highly recommended as are all of his podcasts really had trouble with this one pre trp felt guilty for leading my plates on etc post trp i cannot imagine any other way to live ,5,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,absolutely mystery talked about this in the game he called it cat string theory if the string is just lying there on the ground within easy reach cat does not care if the string is way up high several feet out of reach cat does not care if the string is just out of reach like 2 or 3 inches cat goes crazy trying to catch the thing in its paws so it is with women ,3,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,exactly the article interviewed a few alphas and then a whole bunch of women looks like they skipped the part where they interview the betas and the guys are all like yeah i have been swiping right all day long here for a few weeks now got like 3 matches so far none have written back yet but i am still hoping granted in nyc the odds are heavily in your favor as a man but still this article was almost a parody of itself like meet mr awesome only 25 years old president of big cock capital and yacht racer extraordinaire women are dying to have sex with him right and left but for some weird reason he just does not want to settle down so i interviewed him and asked him why i mean jesus ,75,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,could not agree more just posted a comment here that echoes exactly this buddha says if you want to find water dig one well that 6 feet deep not six wells that are 1 foot each in nyc you have got all these women wandering all over the desert all of them digging a thousand different 1 inch wells and then wondering why they are dying of thirst funny and sad and it only gonna get worse from here on out ,58,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,been in la for the past 2 years but before that lived in nyc for 12 downtowner in tribeca 39 years old now and absolutely could not agree more re the dating scene in nyc tinder was not quite out yet when i was there it was all match and okc but regardless you had like 6 single women to every 1 single guy or 10 to 1 some kind of outrageous ratio like that as a result i was doing extremely well in the hooking up department but when it came to any kind of real honest meaningful relationship forget it hell when it even came to dating like just going on a single date taking a woman out to dinner or an art opening or a play or whatever forget it they just do not want it there is no wall in nyc women ride the carousel from the moment they arrive until about 44 and then one morning they wake up get two cats and call it quits that it there is no seeking a beta phase it just alpha fucks all the way and then a hard slam into the wall right at the end and you know the funniest thing is myself and most of the guys i knew we were actually looking for relationships or at least open to the idea running around is fine in your 20s and early 30s but once you get to the mid 30s it like ok i would really like to see someone for longer than 2 weeks here just to know what it like so let see if i can find a great gal and girlfriend her up let s just try for something longer term and see how it goes and then the craziest thing you would think the girls would want this since you know they all say they are not looking for casual sex with random strangers that they really do want a real relationship with somebody great but when you offer that to them or even suggest it they are gone it an instant ghosting and we are not talking about a desperate be my girlfriend here we are talking about hey let s grab a bite sometime and the younger the girl the more horrified they will be at the mere suggestion of anything that even resembles a date text her at 1 30am and have her come over for a quickie then boot her out 20 min later and she totally fine with that suggest that you go out some place and you know talk to each other for a bit and good god you might as well have suggested the two of you run a barefoot marathon through a field of broken glass and it not even an smv thing either i was rockin and rollin back in nyc kicking ass in my career best shape of my life etc but it just did not matter the girls despite all their protests to the contrary just did not want to be locked down and dating in the traditional sense as far as they saw it was just a step in that direction casual sex fine but do not you dare suggest that you two go somewhere and do something fun together because that might mean you like her which clearly means you are a beta which means she should not be having sex with you which means you are out was not just me every guy i knew in nyc had the exact same experience and some of these guys were extremely high smv like top of the pyramid and still nothing couldn t hold a girl for more than a few hookups maybe 2 or 3 weeks tops if that women just did not want to date they wanted to have their little harem of bad boys 4 to 6 chads at any given time swap out 1 or 2 every few weeks repeat for 25 years hit the wall and retire alone to be fair i had an amazing time with the women in nyc and i tell every guy i know that if he never lived there now the time to go the ratio is just getting better and better for men do not mean for this to come off as any kind of rant at all as i really did have a great time back there i think in the end what really pisses me off about articles like these however is the gross misrepresentation of women they interview a few chads who giggle at how easy all the girls in nyc are and then they interview a few oh so innocent young women professional careers girls we are so awesome we are gonna take the world by storm who endlessly lament oh gosh golly gee whiz i would love to go out on dates fall in love and have a real relationship with a great guy but all the guys want is sex sex sex sooo um no all the girls want is sex sex sex the notch count for nyc women is now a badge of honor they are competing with each other to see who can hook up with the most guys simultaneously seriously they are far worse than the men now and on those few occasions when the guy actually likes the girl and tries to get her out on a proper date even suggesting it he ghosted instantly saw this time and time again this is the hilarious catch 22 actually girls i believe actually do want to go on dates but the thing is they only want to go on dates with chad and if you re on a date with chad then you re not actually with chad at all because chad by definition of being chad does not go on dates it s rather like one of those zen koans if you think about it so yeah the new thinking is only betas go on dates alphas just hit it and quit it and kick you out 5 min later and we all know which of those two the ladies prefer girlfriends in nyc anyway are a thing of the past it just random hookups from here on out and do not even get me started on la ,88,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,by the way i should also mention women are friends with men they like women have sex with men they do not like when a woman tells you i do not like you you are very very close to having sex with her all you have to do at that point is get her in a situation where you can slowly steadily physically escalate rest will take care of itself ,3,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,i was in a situation similar to yours not long ago had a very high smv woman back at my place making out on the couch for a good 10 min or so she really warming up to everything straddling me etc when suddenly she pulls back and says you know we are not having sex tonight right just like the lmr in your story without batting an eyelash i just barked out a laugh long and loud and said of course we are not having sex tonight you cannot have me that easy reframe it took her a good couple of seconds to process this like um what did this guy just turn me down she just looked at me and then said in a very small sad quiet voice oh ok you could hear the disappointment for miles i immediately followed this up with hey i think you are great and all but i am kind of just enjoying this making out right now are not you we will get to all the sex stuff later but i actually really like you so we are gonna take things sloooooooowwwwwww here ok she processed that for a few seconds and then her face completely lit up and she was like oh ok i like that and then we kept making out and kept making out i kept escalating fully knowing where this was going 10 minutes later with my hand between her legs she says wow it getting really hard to resist here i laughed again and said i know too bad we are not doing anything tonight but it all good another few min of escalation and surprise into bed we hopped sex was had and out the door she went a few min after girl did not even stay over even though i would have been happy to host if that was what she wanted point is and this is particularly true with the high smv girls if they are at your place and you are making out you are already at the final level staring at the final boss it just a matter of figuring out that boss particular weakness in order to beat the game and get the princess tell her you are going to have sex just not that night you want to enjoy the process the anticipation you want to build it up tease it out for a little bit then just keep escalating accordingly been using this for years as an lmr breaker before i even knew what that was thus far it never failed not once give it a try next time you are right at the finish line and let us know how it goes ,5,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,women always have casual sex with random strangers when they travel it all about bringing genetic variety back with them when they finally return to the home tribe this is also why she offered to have sex with her boyfriend as soon as they re united it had nothing to do with her feeling contrite in caveman days it would have been 1 have sex with attractive alpha male while briefly visiting faraway tribe 2 return to home tribe and immediately have sex with caring beta 3 wait a month while the two sperm armies fight it out amongst each other 4 get pregnant from the strongest sperm almost certainly the alpha 5 congratulate caring beta on becoming a new father 6 caring beta raises son of alpha from neighboring tribe as his own devoting all the time energy resources etc at his disposal never knowing the child is not actually his and finally 7 women sexual strategy has been optimized she got the genes of the attractive warrior alpha which will in turn make the child more attractive and so the cycle continues see sexy sons hypothesis and the protection of the caring provider beta all at the same time classic textbook alpha fucks beta bucks check out sperm wars by robin baker for more on this fascinating book and required reading for all red pillers also did not roosh have a post about this not too long ago guy waited years for his virgin girlfriend to give it up to him she kept putting him off and putting him off one day girl took a trip to a foreign country and ended up losing her virginity to some random guy like days after they met perhaps someone can post a link here in the comments ,12,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,the alpha and beta designations are not absolutes it really more of a spectrum along which you will slide back and forth over the course of your life feel like this does not get talked about enough around here so glad rollo pointed it out in his post one women alpha is another women beta context is everything ,18,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,this is actually really useful advice if a girl you are into is dating or just hooking up with a total douchebag we have all been there the last thing you want to do is point out out loud oh my god that guy is so gross what a total douchebag as you will just get her even more attracted to the man instead say oh my god yeah i love that guy he such a nice guy is not he so sweet really totally reliable you just know he would be there for you in a pinch kinda guy that would have stayed up all night to help you with your calculus homework back in school you know such a sweet nice guy guaranteed she will break up with him the next day ,12,asktrp

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,spend some time in nyc my friend best city in the world for single men right now that 10 single women to every 1 single man ratio will be just the ticket guaranteed i met a guy out here in la through mutual friends we all went to the same college right after i moved here guy had never lived in nyc before and having just come from there myself naturally i was extolling the wonders of the new york singles scene for men guy ended up taking a trip there to check it out came back a few weeks later and no kidding sold his company packed everything up and decided to move there asap he just could not take the dating scene in la anymore wanted a change and new york he would found was just absolutely incredible quick example he said on his very first night there he was standing outside a random bar in brooklyn a beautiful girl cold approached him on the street they were chatting for a few min and less than an hour later they were back at his place right nearby hooking up dude just could not believe it was that easy he did not have to pretend to be something he was not he did not have to brag about his industry connections he did not have to neg her or game her all the stuff you have to do get and maintain any sort of attention from women in la he was just his own easygoing casual self open and honest girl totally loved him and they got together right away took all of an hour zero effort zero investment all he had to do literally was stand in one place i told him yeah man that nyc for you single guys rule the world in that town and like i said dude was so blown away by the contrast he ended up moving there asap still think la is the better city the ultimate city really for creative work these days but when it comes to dating nyc is absolutely where it at check it out ,2,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,right before i moved out here a producer friend of mine said i hope you enjoyed getting laid in nyc my man cuz once you get to la you are never going to have sex ever ever again would not say it worked out quite like that but yeah it definitely tougher for the guys out here for sure in nyc i think it some insanely lopsided ratio like 10 single women for every 1 single man here in la it 2 single guys for every 1 single girl and the guys are all ferociously aggressive with their pick up out here both street level and online so the ladies are certainly never lacking for attention still it not so bad my number for my last year in nyc was 12 new partners out here in la that dropped to 5 for my first year here but then i would not blame that number dropping in half on the women out here it more like just the raw logistics of living in this city in nyc everyone goes out all the time gets wasted they meet new people everyone internet and or mobile dating everyone lives right next to each other bars are on every block and so basically you bump into someone have two drinks and about 45 minutes later it like so wanna go back to my place i live a block away and there your hook up here in la meeting people is difficult getting them out is even harder and when you do get them out or meet them out getting people back to your place is almost impossible you have multiple cars driving long distances the question of who gonna park where are they even sober enough to drive etc etc uber has solved some of this and i live in a neighborhood that like a mini manhattan very walkable but yeah nyc for men is definitely the game on easy mode la is the game on hard mode for sure and as for relationships forget it back in nyc there were quite a few girls i might have considered seriously dating for a little bit here i have met just one girl so far that i would consider girlfriend material and i am not even that into her which is the terribly irony all the la couples i know were couples before they got here my advice for everybody then la great to come and work on your art it the ultimate monk mode city but when it comes to girls do not even worry about it if they happen to come to you great enjoy them while you have them but do not waste your time playing the game out here stay focused and put your hours into your craft you will be far ahead of your ever partying peer group soon enough ,3,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,i am actually in this exact same situation right now been seeing a girl for a little over a year non exclusive non committed non monogamous relationship technically a plate then although i do not have any other regulars spinning at the moment just the occasional encounter here and there girl tall beautiful smart funny conservative traditional background all my friends love her etc etc and yet for some reason i just never felt that necessary connection between us do not know if it pheromones or what but despite her looks she really is quite beautiful works as a pro model i could just never and still cannot physically get that into her the result is that throughout our entire relationship over the past year i have been cool distant aloof not on purpose mind you i am not gaming her per se it just automatically how i am around her all the time because say it with me now i am just not that into her and to be honest if i could flip a switch and be into her i would because she awesome but i cannot sooo i still remember the first time i brought her out to have dinner with a friend of mine right after we started dating when my date went to the bathroom my female friend said wow she sooo beautiful and she really likes you seriously she seems so into you i would not play games with this one you will mess it all up i just laughed and said you are confusing cause and effect do not you get it it not that she likes me but i am playing games with her and i should stop or i will mess it up it that i am playing games because i am not that into her and that why she likes me my female friend was aghast i was sitting there on a date with a 10 so surely i should be properly worshipful no but i just did not have it in me still do not do not know why but yeah one thing for sure being not that into them and i do not mean pretending i mean actually feeling it is unfortunately the biggest aphrodisiac of them all ,1,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,can confirm lived in nyc for 12 years downtown manhattan in tribeca moved to la 2 years ago hollywood la is definitely the superior city when it comes to the arts nyc was where it was at a little while ago but sometime right around 2005 2006 suddenly all the creatives left and now it just hedge fund managers and the people who work for them la is all artists and it a great town to be in if you are just starting out because you are surrounded by that energy all the time i think everyone should live in nyc at least once in their life even if just for a summer etc but honestly and i never thought i would say this la really is the better city now ,2,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,any girl who using internet or mobile dating okc tinder etc usually has 3 regular guys she hooking up with and then 1 to 3 backups as well so 4 to 6 really although they always report 3 as anything more than 3 regulars at any one time would be totally slutty behavior am i right guys every 2 weeks to 2 months one of the guys is changed out so fresh alpha meat is being brought in pretty much all the time with the losers ghosted as soon as there a slightly better prospect on the horizon does not matter how much of a badass you are you can be the perfect 10 but the new guy who may be a 9 gets a temporary 2 smv hike for being the unknown quantity and thus now he an 11 he wins you lose and are dropped from the rotation accordingly the end gotta say roosh definitely called this one a little while ago the advent of the smartphone along with mobile apps like tinder making instant cock delivery possible has made monogamy obsolete ,16,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,re a lot of the comments here to quote one of my favorite movies a few good men it the difference between paper law and trial law when you are studying it all takes place in an idealized perfect legal world where logic trumps everything out in the real world however most cases are won on bluff and bluster with precious few ever even going to trial in keeping with op rp law theme here though i will offer this bit friend of mine is a well known trial lawyer in nyc he said something great once which apparently one of his hardass law professors drilled into him if you are not right on the edge of contempt the entire time you are in that courtroom then you are not serving your client 100 rp implications should be obvious ,1,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,if a woman says i cannot stand him he disgusts me or he drives me crazy you can be sure she about 10 minutes away from having sex with him the neurons that fire together wire together works the same for love and for hate use to your advantage ,1,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,just finished a major sci fi project which required quite a bit of research and yeah gotta agree the future is not going to be give us half a million up front and now you are the proud new owner of a brand new sexbot more like here your free ad supported sexbot and you can bring her back in and exchange her for a newer better model after a 2 year minimum has passed much like google coming auto driving cars are likely to be free and ad supported sexbots will almost surely follow the same trend this will after all be the ultimate panacea to the how do we motivate the betas problem we are going to be looking at in the latter half of this century i say do not worry about the betas once these guys get their hands on their first free sexbot and the sexbot says oh i would love to have sex with you but only after you buy x merchandise from y retailer which you can do though me just by speaking to me right now all those men that had previously checked out of the economy figuring if there no reason to impress women then there no reason to work hard are suddenly going to be stampeding back onto the field when they start having to impress their sexbots by buying things on a regular nightly basis sexbots will in effect be women designed by men and like a great video game the more you put into the bot re money energy time investment the more you will get back out the two will be directly proportional to each other this in contrast to say women designed by mother nature wherein generally speaking the harder you try the more resources you commit the worse you ultimately do of course the nightmare scenario starts when you are 5 minutes into having sex with the bot and then suddenly she stops and says you know i am just feeling it right now but maybe if you bought me x from y i might get more in the mood maybe freemium gaming anyone you are in combat and wanna reload that gun that will be 10 bucks my boy gonna be pretty funny if at the end of the day all the sexbots end up basically being modeled after russian goldiggers looks personality and all who knows maybe that really is the final evolution of woman their fitness peak if you will ,6,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,you know we have 120 000 members subscribed here officially but lately i have been wondering if our actual readership is not in fact much much higher rollo recently let it slip on a podcast or a blog post cannot remember which that his readership is somewhere around half a million visitors a month find it hard to believe that most of those are not red pillers as well even if they are only just lurking here i know i was coming here for almost a year and just reading nothing else before i actually hit the subscribe button it was nearing 100k and i wanted to help tip it over perhaps we should put out the call then if you are reading this and you are not currently subscribed to the sub consider creating a new red pill only account and doing so right now it great to read and take in all the information here but really you can only spend so much time on the sidelines eventually you have to step onto the playing field ,2,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,agreed i have always thought most red pillers way underestimate the number of men most women have likely been through i read of partner counts here like 5 and 10 and i just want to laugh and laugh average partner count for an attractive young woman and i know a few by my observation is usually around 2 to 4 new partners each and every month with or without a boyfriend does not matter facebook tinder instagram it just so easy for women these days they see a pic of a new guy on their phone a friend of a friend on facebook or a profile on tinder they think the guy s hot they tap on his pic and send him a one word text wyd for what you doin and 10 minutes later the guy on his way over for no strings attached sex see it everyday ,1,asktrp
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,dr robert glover s author of no more mr nice guy advice re exclusivity early on in a relationship from his early stages of dating podcast if she asks if you re seeing other women you say until you and i have a conversation about dating each other exclusively you should assume that i am dating other women if she persists you say seeing multiple people is a good way to slow things down and we can actually get to know each other better that way it s actually a healthy thing to do to not dive in exclusively before we ve given ourselves a chance to know each other this applies even if the two of you are involved sexually and even if you are involved sexually with other women if she stops seeing you because you won t commit to her within the first few weeks let her go ,2,asktrp
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,i used to have a joke with friends whatever number a woman gives you re her partner count multiply by 3 and add 10 whatever number a guy gives you divide by 2 and subtract 5 how funny years later now that i ve discovered the red pill to see this random observation actually backed up by evidence time and time again my experience is that a woman s actual partner count tends to be tied to that woman s age generation gen x women born between 1960 and 1975 most often report an exact number of 8 partners this for a while was considered the perfect number anything less was prudish anything more was slutty but the real number was usually about 35 easily extrapolated when you ve been close friends with any number of women throughout much of their sexual history say and have kept rough track of their actual partner count accordingly gen y women born between 1975 and 1990 usually report a number of less than 20 while the real number is closer to 60 or 70 and as for millennials those born after 1990 it s a little too early to say but i d guess their average partner count is going to get well up into the 200s and 300s easy as many have pointed out here before it s not necessarily that women are becoming more promiscuous nowadays women have always been this way it s just that ready access to sex with a gorgeous ripped alpha male to boot is just so easy for them now gen x women first had to find men through friends friends of friends coworkers etc go on dates do that whole dance gen yers just had to get online and visit a few dating sites and now millennial women just have to whip out their smartphones and send a single one word text to the hottest nearby guy in their social media circle as soon as the mood strikes take it from someone who lives and works in hollywood and is surrounded by attractive young early 20 something women all the time for them getting sex is identical in every way to ordering an uber i see it happen every night i go out and as such these girls are racking up on average by my count 2 to 4 new partners each and every month this is not a bad thing if like me you ve accepted that this is the future of relationships marriage is gone monogamy is on the way out and the future is just a bunch of friends that are all randomly hooking up with each other whenever they feel like it no strings attached with no more commitments obligations emotional investment etc depressing as well for those of us raised on the disney princess myth and who d hoped to maybe one day have a real relationship but hey that s the red pill for you it ain t easy but it is the truth ,3,TheRedPill

IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,so i actually had a front row seat to the whole dotcom revolution 1 0 back in the late 90s and yeah it was quite the running joke you always knew who had the money in the room based on whoever was the most sloppily dressed if you are in a conference room with a dozen people and there are 11 guys in suits and one guy in shorts in flip flops it the guy in the flip flops who has all the money saw this time and time again of course my staff and i wrestled with this ourselves when we were out meeting with potential investors doing the whole vc dance etc like do we wear suits go ultra casual what suits we thought were a bit too try hard like they reeked of we re desperate for your money please please please give it to us but the shorts and flip flops on the other hand although intended to signal we re so wrapped up in our own work that we just don t care how we dress really just i thought came off as asshole ish like dude you re basically on a first date with these people the vcs you re meeting with or whomever let s show a little respect yes i agree that if you re a coder or whatever and you re bent over a computer all day long then a suit becomes superfluous you can go ahead and dress purely for comfort but if you re interacting with clients trying to raise money dealing with people etc then you have to present a certain kind of polished image and the flip flops just don t cut it bit of a tightrope really between the formal and the casual but we found that when it came to actually impressing people and successfully raising money the trick was to be fairly casual but then to toss in one or two items that were extremely high value just to let people know what was up example you wear the company t shirt a pair of ratty old ripped up jeans comfy sneakers and then you throw a 3 000 dollar tailored jacket on top of it all i still remember the first time i tried out that combo i was having drinks one evening with the ceo of another company we were thinking of merging with and at one point totally out of character the guy was like man that is a nice jacket i shrugged and said something like yeah i kinda like this one just got it impulse buy take away message we at my company have money and we re not afraid to spend it on nice things we like and thus no you ll not be screwing us on any deals we might be talking about in the not too distant future so yeah for the artists and entrepreneurs out there when you re making the rounds showing off your work raising money etc try for the casual plus one expensive peacock item look a nice jacket an expensive watch etc you will get the best of both worlds with this combo for sure bonus works great on dates as well ,2,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,sounds like the difference between outer game and inner game no pua outer game you are dressing up as the part peacocking acting the part pretending to be the part trp inner game you are the part you are becoming the part also wasn t the big takeaway from the game the neil strauss book that outer game pua while fine for a while to use as a set of training wheels ultimately didn t cut it when it came to getting to that next level in life best chapter in there was when he was chillin at some club chicks coming up to him left and right he thinks oh man i m on fire tonight must be my cool outfit my amazing energy etc etc and then he finds out right when he s leaving the hostess had mistaken him for moby been telling girls all night hey moby s over there and so of course he was just sitting there getting hit on by every girl coming into the place thinking it was all him all along when in fact it was the hostess who had set the frame determined the narrative at the outset and he was just unknowingly playing in it all night so the lightbulb goes off and he thinks well shit what am i doing here with my life i should just work on myself become rich and famous like moby and then i won t have to go out and do pickup at all the girls will just flock to me like they did that night transition from outer game to inner game he hits the other guys in the house with this breakthrough and they all pretty much agree pickup only gets you so far eventually you have to take the training wheels off stop pretending to be the badass and actually become the badass sarging is for losers i think was the phrase they actually used been a while since i read the book though ,15,TheRedPill
IGoYouStayTwoAutumns,if you are dating a woman you are in an open relationship reminds me of a conversation i had with one of my best friends back in nyc guy a well known extremely successful trial lawyer lives in a beautiful 7k month loft downtown has his own practice specializing in divorce of course man s highly educated worldly been around the block a few times etc etc so we are catching up we get on the topic of women somehow and at one point he says something like you know i m beginning to think this is how it works when you are together you treat her like a queen like she the only person in the universe and that that but when you are not together you do what you want she does what she wants really i think that the only possible way it can actually work i remember at the time several years back pre red pill how shocked i was when this guy just laid it all out for me like that it just seemed so cold and bare so not romantic so very un fairy tale esque now that i have been around the block a few times myself and happened upon you fine people here in the red pill about a year and a half ago honestly looking back at that one talk i think this guy might have unwittingly stumbled upon the very future of relationships right there enjoy em when you re with em assume they re seeing other people when you re not only way to go bonus side effect you ll never be cheated on again you can t lose fidelity if it was never a part of the equation in the first place ,2,TheRedPill
