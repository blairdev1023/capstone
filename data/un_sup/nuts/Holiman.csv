Holiman,i am confused about the strawman argument please explain i work in manufacturing so good questions technologies are a huge problem which is based upon advancement moving so far beyond the peoples ability to keep up robotics and equipment is changing much faster then the ability for companies abilities to train their workforce older and simpler technology is more than cost of the technology itself and companies buy equipment the same way people buy cars based upon their needs and budget i am unsure about the rest of your rant the world is a huge marketplace of ideas and things i doubt i am even vaguely qualified to answer whatever it is your implying i would start with removing the idea that people regardless of profession are largely influenced to help humanity most people are just trying to make a living ,1,conspiracy
Holiman,yes i am talking human advancement can you show me examples of anything else i would love to say you are correct i am a huge fan of cohesion and working together i do not think these are the only paths forward and think you should show case studies showing advancement without these ideas are not possible ,1,conspiracy

Holiman,again not a theory a wild ass supposition scary thought our genetics might have come from other planets meaning it might be rather common as well even if aliens did want to try our dna it would not take long to get all the samples needed nor require government secrecy to do so a species capable of interstellar travel could destroy us rather easily lastly broadcasting to outer space is impossible to stop hence why seti works to listen for those very broadcasts ,1,conspiracy
Holiman,it might help to stop using the word theory theories have facts and are testable what you are presenting are sufficient guesses which hold no value if they cannot be proven or disproven lastly any race capable of space travel would most likely be capable of material transformation our higgs boson experiments have proven the possibility of matter manipulation already ,0,conspiracy

Holiman,first take a deep breath and realize calling you a flat earther was not an ad hominem actually i read your post and noticed your writing was very indicative of someone who believes the earth is flat i simply pointed out something obvious and then dismissed your points because i doubt you are open to honest discourse flat earthers are simply willfully ignorant of reality i have had no luck talking reasonably with people like that ,4,conspiracy

Holiman,a scientific anomaly worth investigating to date nothing supporting alien structures or civilizations has been found there are also potentially a multitude of other causes so why chose the one about aliens ,1,conspiracy
Holiman,it is find and acceptable to state we would not understand the actions of some advanced alien intervention however your also adding we would not notice it either the tigers know humans exist even if they do not understand our actions other tigers might not know the how and why of the circumstances but would be well aware of the actions taking place the same with chimps understanding and being aware are two separate things ,2,conspiracy
Holiman,i find that statement rather unhelpful ,1,conspiracy
Holiman,this is actually horrible reasoning there are companies now looking into mining asteroids because taking an asteroid placing it into low earth orbit for mining by machines is relatively easy cheap and the rewards are beyond our present requirements no significantly advanced civilization would chose a less effective method than we are presently working on that is just bad thinking ,2,conspiracy

Holiman,such as how we are indifferent to ants yes aliens might consider us as just another animal however that does not answer the question ,1,conspiracy
Holiman,if we wanted to follow this line of thought which i personally think is silly we have to admit non interference is not the same as hiding or pretending not to exist this is also expecting aliens to think and act as we might pretend we should we do not act towards others based on their best interests why should we pretend we will or that others would i consider this wishful thinking at best ,2,conspiracy
Holiman,to all believers i ask the following why would a group capable of interstellar space travel care about local governments or secrecy the technology difference would be well beyond europeans landing on the shores of south america so what reason would they have to be secretive and why would they allow governments to control the narrative ,94,conspiracy
Holiman,what i think is disingenuous is your comment to pretend i was talking about the russia investigation takes willful ignorance of what i wrote trump is dangerous i absolutely agree with you and we have a huge problem we have had 6 years of stagnant bs and a broken political system in 2018 the dnc could take back the house and maybe more in a way i think trump might be a good thing until his followers realize why trump and his ilk are wrong though things will simply get worse ,1,politics
Holiman,i live in the south and am surrounded by christians and trump supporters i am neither however i like the people here and hope that i can get some of them to think critically to me the worst part of our present political system is exactly what your suggesting swinging the pendulum harder to the right or the left will not stop the damage done ,2,politics

Holiman,i can see you failed to take my suggestion to educate yourself about the media history shows this is neither new or different you continue to state that the media and the wash post have no facts time has shown repeatedly that in fact the stories are true and the list of problems for the trump presidency is growing the funniest saddest counter to your statements is that the potus himself is often the corroborator of many of these stories take some time to ask yourself why his people often work out stories and covers for his controversies only to be undermined by a late night early morning tweet from the potus himself ,1,politics
Holiman,exactly what is your argument there are a lot of stories about the trump campaign and until an investigation is completed we will not know if any crimes have been committed as to the news being a weapon you might want to take a deep breath and study the history of media the media has always been a tool to hold men in power accountable its often the only power that has that ability hence why in free societies the press is protected just because you do not like the story does not mean its not true ,2,politics
Holiman,i would suggest you lose the fake news since the wash post has been proven time and again to actually be correct also most people upset about the potus might not actually want hrc in office at all lastly the fact that the vp is a hate filled moron should in no way blind anyone to crimes committed by those in office ,9,politics
Holiman,i would suggest you narrow your focus on exactly what you want to learn machining is a rather large subject ,2,machining
Holiman,i personally think the problem is rather simple people by and large do no understand science it is a methodology a way of understanding it is extremely unlikely to achieve anything with a mindset of disproving concepts or uncovering the truth science is a methodology of observing reality attempting to explain how things happen testing our ideas rigorously allowing others to have all of our information and ask them to justify our results people have achieved so much since adopting this methodology those that do not are bound to continue arguing over long settled issues such as the shape of the planet ,0,conspiracy

Holiman,you might find people seem religiously adhered to evolution because without evolution nothing in biology makes sense it really is that pivotal to the science without going into great detail you can read about it on your own but ask yourself why do we need new insecticides every year why are diseases becoming resistant to antibiotics why do people get diseases why is there different types of animals at all without study in evolution how can any of these questions be answered intelligently ,1,actualconspiracies
Holiman,funny as this might sound i would avoid comparing evolution to gravity gravitational theory is probably wrong science has been having a really hard time with mathematical application of gravitational pulls and in some cases quantum particles gravity seems to play no discernible role at all evolution however has explained every prediction and has verified multiple other scientific disciplines such as paleontology germ disease theory and molecular biology i could go on but i think you can understand my point ,4,actualconspiracies
Holiman,there are great documentaries on youtube about the history of evolution if you are interested in the subject my favorite one shows some of the early mistakes and con perpetrated on scientists some years ago however no actual arguments or reasonable discourse exists to explain speciation other than evolution if you are truly interested i would suggest you look up talkorigins org ,11,actualconspiracies

Holiman,first i would ask how much you have read and studied about immigration problems in the us to say that this is a sudden stand of any sort is to ignore the last 20 to 30 years of history second is if the argument was truly about tax dollars i would heartily suggest you look into facts and figures that openly discuss the different options presented deportation is by far and away the single most costly and will be devastating to our economic interests i would ignore the un question because that is going down a very bad road with no positive responses just to say foreign involvement in south and central america is not the way to solve problems lastly military power to solves immigration has myriad potential problems and could lead towards anarchy and huge civil unrest ,1,politics

Holiman,it is a presupposition according to the original statement to date hrc has never been charged and convicted with a crime she may be guilty as sin but this has yet to be proven and even if it was true about some crimes it would not be evidence for other crimes she is accused about doing critical thinking 101 ,1,conspiracy
Holiman,so your premise is that once you stop being objective to each story and conspiracy and instead start with a presupposition of hrc being a criminal it all just makes sense you might want to rethink your critical thinking skills lastly i hate the clinton as well and have never voted for one i just care about the truth ,-1,conspiracy

Holiman,you have to look at how the christian religion actually evolved it was organic and took centuries before the time most people believe jesus lived it was eastern culture that had man as god concepts examples in both egypt and persia both huge empires at different times the western cultures found this concept as hugely taboo this changed after the first rise of western empires with alexander who after conquering the east declared himself a god later through hellenistic culture the influence of man as god became more socially acceptable still though a man had to die or could only be god at certain times etc now during the hugely successful reign of augustus the concept of the will of a god was brought forth and some concepts such as worshiping the will of augustus was introduced which was important since so many of augustus changes were cultural and about changing rome to be more family oriented so the pieces of the puzzle were already well laid out and over the next few hundred years these concepts were tied together through theological interpretations to give all of these powers abilities and what not to the huge growing religion of the west ,2,DebateReligion

Holiman,so since the catholic church was called on its abuses there are politicians who are speaking out about this fact i am sure the president has called the pope to task for the church stance on contraceptives worsening the aids epidemic in south america and africa there must be a major politician who is calling christianity to task for their abuses right now religious islamic sets have been targeted for their actions but the religion itself has been ignored this is true enough you want to change this please explain why for what reason and why islam and not any other religion see its easy enough for me to say their both bs ideologies based on warped bad concepts but i have not been elected to represent those people get the idea yet ,1,DebateReligion

Holiman,lets discuss the first question why would a man be crucified in a roman province there are a few reasons for crucifixion the most common being rebellion of some sort most historians agree the term used to describe the other two people crucified next to jesus were brigands not simple thieves if the holy men of that time were to want a man dead for blasphemy stoning was the method lets not pretend people were not stoned at this time jesus supposedly stops a stoning if the people supported the death of jesus as the gospels indicate then he would have been stoned pilate was not influenced by crowds or the people he was recalled to rome for purportedly cruel and inflammatory actions on the people of judea one action he is noted to have done was line the temple with tributes to the emperor tiberius pissing off the people another time he crucified 20 men for climbing the tower and cutting down an eagle he had placed over the temple this is not a man who would need to wash his hands of an innocents blood nor would he have attained the level he was given without cruelty and necessity being his bread and butter the sign king of the jews makes no sense unless jesus was actually a rebel and meant as a warning to his followers even the concept as messiah is meant to be a military leader of the jews not a son of god every part of the killing of jesus makes no sense in christian theology ,1,DebateReligion

Holiman,your so is very confused on a basic part of the god covenant concept the jews israel broke several covenants with god and according to their legends god makes new ones also according to their scriptures god greatness is shown in that he kept his covenant i would ask what faith your so is because the argument is actually against god not the jews unless your position is the jews first broke the covenant and the holocaust was gods punishment ugly as this concept might be what exactly is the argument about god or jews ,4,DebateReligion
Holiman,i would love an honest expose done about radical islam and how much believers know of their religion ,3,DebateReligion
Holiman,christianity stood strong for so long because so few could read the books that formed the foundation for the religion once we reached a level of reproducing works and general literacy the religion fractured into several thousand arguments that have persisted since the easiest way to become an unbeliever is to read the holy books your religion is based upon ,5,DebateReligion
Holiman,you may have read a single book but i am unsure how much you know of hitler at that time the outsiders stood up in those so called democracies i immediately issued warnings about this because it is obvious the german people did not feel any kind of hate against the french or the british the french people the british people the german people wanted only to live in friendship and peace with them germany has claims which do not hurt these other peoples at all which do not take anything away from them speech 1940 what we want lies clear before us not war and not strife just as we have established peace within our own people so we want nothing else than peace with the world for we all know that our great work can succeed only in a time of peace but just as the leadership of the nation in the domestic sphere has never sacrificed its honor in its relations with the german people so it can never surrender the honor of the german people in its dealings with the world danzig 1939 and today people are saying yet again that we were agitators i would like here to appeal to a greater than i count lerchenfeld he said in the last session of the landtag that his feeling as a man and a christian prevented him from being an anti semite i say my feeling as a christian points me to my lord and saviour as a fighter it points me to the man who once in loneliness surrounded only by a few followers recognized these jews for what they were and summoned men to the fight against them and who god truth was greatest not as sufferer but as fighter in boundless love as a christian and as a man i read through the passage which tells us how the lord at last rose in his might and seized the scourge to drive out of the temple the brood of vipers and of adders how terrific was his fight for the world against the jewish poison today after two thousand years with deepest emotion i recognize more profoundly than ever before the fact that it was for this that he had to shed his blood upon the cross as a christian i have no duty to allow myself to be cheated but i have the duty to be a fighter for truth and justice and as a man i have the duty to see to it that human society does not suffer the same catastrophic collapse as did the civilization of the ancient world some two thousand years ago a civilization which was driven to its ruin through this same jewish people munich 1922 ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,and what about the many bible verses that disagree with that position matthew 5 22 1 john 5 12 john 5 29 mark 9 48 mark 9 43 2 thessalonians 1 9 revelation 20 15 i could easily go on ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,serious question is english your first language ,0,DebateReligion
Holiman,well my first confusion is where morality and doing something for yourself or others is connected where is the morale distinction from masturbating myself or others you make no sense in your argument i am asking for clarification god being perfect assumes moral perfection is not something everyone agree with might makes right is the normal response to those statements many many gods have been less than morally perfect and most people argue the god of the bible shows less than morally superior values ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,my understanding of argument from ignorance is that something that has not or can not be proven false since your argument was inherently inscrutable and as such etc i figured it is almost a perfect match personally ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,you should explain your definition of morality i am very confused by what your saying if i choose to take a bathroom trip this is not a moral decision ya know ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,per his book he did and they got tired of his shit too ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,per wikipedia that is an argument from ignorance ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,where was morality found in this question are you claiming god had a moral imperative how could a god have morals or be effected by them ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman, it not about who is right and who is wrong but about how much right everyone is lets re write your sentence and disassemble it its not about who is a or b but how much a everyone is where a or b are nouns and contradictory in nature a a but a b so your sentence basically keeps right as a noun in both parts and your adjective is how much so your contention is that a changes nature when there more of it also you fail to account for b purpose entirely so its not about a or b unless you have a shit ton of a is a contradictory bullshit statement does this help unravel the mystery ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,then if you read your sentence i quoted you should realize how contradictory you statement is and how i could equate it with bs ,3,DebateReligion
Holiman,if the point is figuring it out then you admit we have no teacher if we are all self taught without guidance by that teacher again we have no teacher if the teacher does not even show up to class then again we have no teacher its student lead learning which if tested later would only show the failings of not having a teacher ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman, it not about who is right and who is wrong but about how much right everyone is you have earned a phd with this bs ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,i will agree with splinter group not branch nor defined by its rejection of a later separatist movement it would be wrong to call all christian religions branchs of catholicism and its alot closer than your inference ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman, modern judaism is defined in part as a rejection of christianity i doubt we could get many non christians to agree with this one yes jesus was a jew and his cult began in jewish areas but christianity became a large dominant religion through non jews and can and has been described at strongly influenced by other greek and roman religions ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,well if were just going to interpret ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,that on its own is fine but look at the larger context of those words and its little more than a poster card greeting first he says love the lord in great detail then love your neighbor as yourself i think this leaves lots of room for problems which in truth is not a teaching of jesus himself rather repeating of ot teachings ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,christianity is not a branch of judaism i am soo sorry if you feel that was a rational statement yes i agree faith healers are fake all of em and yes mess with people in power can lead to your death so in the end jesus had little to no effect on judaism was a fraud and was killed for mouthing off against people in power this is my opinion ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,he didnt teach anyone medicine he did magic we know magic doesnt exist so he probably did nothing he damn sure didnt tell them about disease and whatnot his words were horrible about the poor he never gave speeches about how to become self sufficient he spread poverty by his teachings ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,i tell people what they dont want to hear and they call me an asshole i normally agree however i am talking in the context of his works and life and teachings none of which i think were good ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,probably all true confucianism i understood was great in a legalistic way for china and lead to alot of stability i always liked budda for its vision of self improvement however you are probably correct on all three perhaps there is no good in religious figures ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,his influence on judaism was marginal at best there is alot of history about the changes of judaism healing the sick can be watched every weekend with benny hinn speaking out against hypocrisy gets you killed this is something i can actually agree he might have done however i do not think this makes you good just opinionated ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,after reading those stories i come to a different opinion ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,examples ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,what exactly about jesus or his teachings were good ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,i havent seen him make the talk show circuit yet ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,i am not saying the rule of rome was a good thing but its fall was measurably bad in the fallout you are correct on the rest i agree roman philosophy strongly effected christianity ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,isnt everything ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,i think this takes away from the point at hand i am not ignoring your point or saying your correct but i dont wish to alter the discussion at hand ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,you are probably correct but i would say his actions helped free his country from england which was my reason for mentioning him ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,i picked the names out of my head without much thought tbh as far as the bad history you would have to explain this further i think a solid argument could be made for the christian theology was a large factor in the fall of western civilization ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,good points my basic measurement of good was how his life and more importantly his teachings effected others i am unsure what you mean by dct actually yes in my opinion if your message is so poorly received then you were probably unclear a good person once said the point of good communication is not to be better understood but rather for you to be impossible to be misunderstood if you give bad instructions and people follow your instructions are you not at fault ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,conversion is never my purpose i do not have a truth claim about religion i do try to encourage others to use critical thinking i often try to challenge others both to better understand my own beliefs and to see if they know theirs i live in an area where i cannot often speak my mind about religion without fear of retaliation so for me this is an outlet people are always trying to convert me yes online is a different area for me since few christians are so outward on their beliefs there is a restraint that i do not often see in public often religious discussions turn violent fast ,5,DebateReligion
Holiman,i always find it amazing followers can find the evil in every religion but their own you keep pointing out the failing of people but expect nothing of your deity these people often did what they did out of misunderstood or i think well understood teachings from their religious books americans didnt stop slavery from the love in their holy books society reached a level where we could grasp these concepts it is obvious you pick and choose your teachings which shows to me you are a normal healthy individual once you realize you can ditch the book and pick and choose your morality off of healthy reasonable choices i think you will be happier the one point i often try to get followers to understand is that i accept every persons statements of faith as true and honest it is ultimately the failings on the part of a deity to interact with the individuals that is the problem and issues you are ultimately correct people are flawed and individuals are fallible even with a connection to a deity no improvement comes sadly we attribute our success to that deity and our failings to ourselves as i have already stated ad nauseam ,0,DebateReligion
Holiman, loving christ first cannot possibly lead to abuse most people do not tep into it this badly of course i could go on about the crusades burning witches or torturing jews for conversion but no thats not what i am talking about here lets take islam for example i am sure there are equal amounts of love allah first messages in the koran you find emotionally unstable youth and feed them full of dogma and mistaken values and in no time you find zealots capable of horrendous acts to prove love this is no different from how many christian religions have acted in history or how they act in lesser ways today families that refuse medical treatment for a dying child or parents disowning children because of their sexual identities they find their reasoning in their interpretation of loving god just ask em i always loved the god hates the sin not the sinner line funny i never heard tell of a sin burning in hell just sinners actually the bible is full of hate i could go on and on about the hate in the bible just read mathew chapter 10 oh yes i have read your book thats why i reject your religion you cherry pick your interpretation but remember jesus never said do not stone adulterers he merely asked the first stone be by a person without sin any decent person would have asked why stone the woman only or even why stone a person for love in the first place no he went right to the none is worthy line the teachings of jesus corrected no wrongs then or now if he had any notion of his teachings being followed after his death you would think he could have come up with some good messages ,0,DebateReligion
Holiman,you are heavily interpreting those commandments to say the least you claim i misrepresented them and then argued things i never implied first thing i implied was loving god first as indicated is unhealthy this concept leads to zealotry and is the most basic requirement for all abusive relationships placing the second commandment as it is written shows that loving both others and yourself comes next this is plain and has nothing whatsoever to do with your arguments self loathing is absolutely essential to the christian dogma debasing yourself is an absolute start remember jesus said whoever was servant of all would be first in the kingdom in the letters paul talks about being the worst sinner of all and about having to fight his old man his old self the biblical story starts with you were born bad from the start you cannot be good enough for god you deserve punishment it is only through his grace that you should live and thrive this is not a polite religion its an abusive relationship that leads to horrible results ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,hell is a very interesting concept in the ot you have sheol translated as hell pit or the grave depending on usage the common usage offered different meanings because sheol meant a place a punishment cut off from god it isnt until greek roman influence hades we see the lake of fire references revelations zoroastrians have the narrow walkway leading to judgement and punishment of hell much like the abrahamic religions these all have one thing in common and that is punishment for evil deeds a cosmic settling of debts that i think most people wish on others so no i do not think hell came from looking at volcanoes but rather from a lack of justice in the world we all would wish to see righted in an afterlife ,3,DebateReligion
Holiman,while i think the op made a poorly worded argument i think he is made a solid point i think your argument has huge flaws though lets take these two commandments since you single them out love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind this is bad advice first any half decent psychologist will tell you that you cannot love in healthy manner if you do not come from a position of loving yourself this is not pop psychology look into the facts and you will see how important self love is and how placing another even a god figure can lead to disastrous events many of the facts and patterns of zealotry come from loving a deity from a base of self loathing which is something the op refers too love your neighbor as yourself this is not bad by itself but its rather vague what if you do not love yourself how easy is it if a person starts with self loathing born a worthless sinner and places a god figure at a point of absolute adoration and fanaticism to then treat others poorly since they themselves deserve such bad treatment the death of their god figure the basis of christianity is indeed you are born bad your god is good and so good he took your punishment for you you cannot pay this deed back or even earn redemption other people have also been given this great sacrifice but they do not respect or acknowledge this which can incite you towards violence no i am sorry your response is a bad one ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman, when he says destroy families he does not mean you must immediately leave your wife and kids i guess departure or abandon equals destruction in your book you made up this argument i was showing you that yes he did mean to immediately abandon your family also to give away all your money would destroy most families leaving your family while fishing in a first century world if you were a healthy young man could indeed destroy them yes giving away all your money at the end of the world your conflating issues i am not a christian more of an agnostic truth to be told however i have read the bible extensively ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,to feel good and to feel good about myself same reason i do that now ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,actually yes jesus does indeed support destroying families look at how he called his disciples mark 1 16 mathew 4 18 etc there is an expectation of absolute obedience and immediate departure from your families what does jesus say to the rich man in mark 10 21 i promise you if you give all your money away your family will not understand but what was his point if you wish to continue this argument about context just fyi i am not an atheist and that has no bearing on what i think ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,its hard to say about each exact item you might bring up self improvement might mean i could still exercise and try to be polite and friendly i would undoubtedly do some drugs though ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,sure why not ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,no fear is no way to live life if the world ends i would like to spend my time the exact same just without working ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,i absolutely hate this argument about context these books were often compiled by verse without entire passages let alone books so they were compiled to create context not the other way around next this chapter is about jesus sending out his disciples to create his cult following he starts out with take no money and expect to be provided by those you preach to next he tells them they will be beaten chased and possibly harmed for doing this work finally he tells them that the purpose of his ministry is to divide those who follow and those who reject him this context is exactly correct jesus states his ministry is to destroy families divide neighbors and overturn the populace all to create his new faith ,3,DebateReligion
Holiman,i spent alot of time wondering about morality i too question the absolute nature of morality however i came to realize that indeed there are things i find so utterly repugnant that to allow them to happen is not something i can withstand while people may do the wrong things for personal gain this is not the end of all morality could you allow wrong things to happen without intervention i use this example because i find it very relevant a marine was issued orders to ignore afghanistan soldiers raping young boys because their culture allowed it their screams at night were too much one evening and the marine responded by intervention much violence ensued was he morally right was his actions in his own best interest what is your breaking point ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,i really like your points and basic premise i think you have actually delved into a portion of jewish theology that i have often heard as man attempt to understand god i would suggest one thing though why would a neutral or perhaps ambivalent deity interact with man at all if god has no sense of right or wrong what exactly is our relationship to this deity ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,one huge thing i think you absolutely misunderstand about your concepts of beauty and art is that these things have evolved with society they are still evolving so is society i would suggest you study some paleontology and re work your basic premise ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman, and some humans have none my god i actually laughed out loud for real good arguments solid reasoning ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,my point is and was that if you change tactics there is a reason for this change either people or god has changed for there to be a reason for this change in tactics your point is exactly correct and proves my position you changed the rules for your children as they are capable of being more responsible this is your children changing growing up etc i am in no rush to critique and my bias has alot of reason behind it for your argument to even be reasonable you must change it to claim you raised your grandchildren and treated them differently for no discern able reason it makes you come off as close minded and incredibely arrogant i am arrogant i am also patting myself on my back at this very moment you cannot stop that why call me close minded i am on a forum trying desperately to communicate politely with believers not really the position of a close minded individual is it if you were actually interested in truth you would seek to better understand what i am saying rather than instantly mischaracterize it and reject it i have not mischaracterized anything you have said also this is foolishness if what you were saying held truth i would not have to seek to better understand it a neat thing about truth you can argue fight and wallow in falsehoods the truth never changes get over yourself no now what ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,i think we have a misunderstanding i never meant to imply terrorism has no effects i meant effective as in works towards their goals if i throw a stone in a lake it will indeed have an effect but it does not create a boat dock hisotry is full of terrorist style tactics and differentiating levels of reactions my claim is that they are not effective methods to achieve any worthwhile goals ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,terrorism effects nothing in the way the terrorist could want can a terrorist use their actions for recruitment sure is that effective doubtful does their actions result in significant blowback hell yes no terrorist act changes the behavior of a nation that works in the terrorists benefit terrorist actions result in govt action action which i think is horrible for the people of that nation in the longer term but those actions never meet the desires or wishes of the terrorists a few black college students conducted a peaceful sit in at a lunch counter in greensboro and actually changed a nation palestine has conducted terrorist acts against israel for years has this bettered either nation or met any goals ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,really bad response i will not respond to this ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,no no your right bringing up antisemitism in the white house and the israel palestine conflict adds no complexity at all yeah thats sarcasm btw i could go into alot about israel i am not a huge fan of things that they do or that the president did condemn the attacks and didnt excuse them as you imply but its not relevant to this discussion the question is how do we respond to islamic terrorism and i personally do not wish to follow israel example and how little good it has done them so far ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman, you ignore the distinction i made between god character and god tactics and just assert what you asserted before this is because it is impossible to ascertain gods character except by his actions and words that not a hard concept in fact its how we determine everyone character i have answered each of your arguments you just do not like what i have to say that not rhetoric its response well though out and i like to think insightful responses i do not blame you for wanting to end the argument on your high horse you have failed to prove your points and mine are logical and sound perhaps the seed of reason will find root in you one day ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,terrorism isnt effective because it never works guerrilla tactics may be effective in a territorial conflict against invaders in a broader conflict it is inherently harmful these attacks will never produce the outcome the perpetrators envision ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,you are absolutely correct israel is a huge piece to the middle east debacle however even the mention of it adds another layer of complexity ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,i think this is awesome if this is made to biblical records i want to see them put it out to sea ,16,DebateReligion
Holiman,i would avoid these types of arguments myself some people have argued that age was counted differently in certain bronze age cultures that lacked a julian calendar one hypothesis i have heard was age was counted in moons seasons or harvests ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,creationism is an argument from ignorance wherever we find a point where we do not know the answer we leave room for the god answer this neither proves nor disproves god leaving only ignorance ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman, an all powerful singular force created the universe and all life in it this sentence shares nothing with science ,6,DebateReligion
Holiman,interesting fact there is no law or practical reasoning against multiple partnerships sexual or otherwise there is a law against bigamy what is the difference here simple marriage in the us comes with benefits these benefits are great for a couple and should have no bearing on the sexual identity of the couple however multiple partners and beneficiaries make it too easy to abuse the system should be illegal there is no reason if you love more than one person you cant co habitat or even marry in your religious churches or whatever your thing happens to be however asking the government to licenses and provide benefits for your multiple relationships is just wrong so my question why are these people asking to defraud the us government and tax payers ,4,DebateReligion
Holiman,nice turn around but lets look at your point i discussed each point i never stopped the conversation rather pointed out the bigotry of certain concepts that were examples of bigotry my conclusion was a nation attacking a religious group by order and force of arms is wrong especially for wrongs they did not commit or perhaps even support i am not muslim or even religious but i do know what wrong is to quote forrest gump ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,i deleted my first response on accident so forgive my late response its alot of typing to do twice this strikes me as kind of an unfair thing to say it seems strange to me that you automatically assume i do not critically engage with this issue just because i come to a different conclusion than you you do not have to reject something to be a critical thinker i would argue rejection can be just as dogmatic and uncritical as acceptance i am sorry if my response offended you i was saying your response illuminated nothing i learned nothing and you were simply arguing from a position of excuses instead of dealing with the issue i think this is a false dichotomy an important distinction has to be made between god character and god mechanism for relating to the world i would argue the latter changed and not the former god character can easily remain consistent while changing the mechanism by which we relate to that character i think that what we are seeing between the ot and nt i could give example after example of god changing his mind such as gen 6 6 and jonah 3 10 but as above you would equivocate and excuse fact if you change the covenant deal pact or way you handle interactions you are in fact changing you cannot honestly pretend neither god nor man changed from ot to nt even your later arguments argue that but more importantly there is a third option here just because god changed tactics does not mean he is learning something that an assumption on your part it could also be god changed from one tactic to another because he wanted us to learn something it my view that god set up a theocratic government so that we as humans can learn that it is not with laws and rules that a heart is compelled to act justly humans have a tendency to rely on rules and regulation to promote and enforce justice if god changed tactics he did so for a reason he or we changed you even admit we change by learning i have a daughter and sometimes i have to let her touch the stove so she learns it hot this is called learning through experience and if we were all immortal beings who were here from the beginning it might be relevant peasant farmers in england damn sure did not learn about theocracy through israel trials not to mention hello there theocracies still exist so um we still learning here i believe god had to create a society in which humans failed at that very thing in order to show us it a futile endeavor quite possibly the ugliest concept ever how diabolic is the god you worship never mind i read his book i do not think either man or god changed this is another assumption on your part god used the israel project to teach man what he is really like dude for the sake of sanity you just contradicted yourself if you learn you change what in the world do you think change means it was not so much that humans changed or became something different what like a lizard the book of galatians and much of the nt is about how rule following never produces actual spiritual growth only a person who passionately loves god can do that we see examples of this in the ot and explicit teaching of this in the nt it a nonsequiter to argue that a tactics change necessitates that humans or god inherently changed as well what is spiritual growth can i measure it is the priest that molests children growing spiritually yes you change tactics for many reasons the most common would be it did not work if you are perfect as god is supposedly perfect then his approach was perfect yada yada yada why change tactics you say we learned to teach us new things etc i have demonstrated this is outrageously ignorant of factual reality i think the overarching point of the ot is that the main issue is that human hearts are hard and evil one of the lessons we glean from the ot is that god direct behavior in the world no matter how much we might demand or request it does not move the human heart towards justice so who learned this us or god since i was not alive i am guessing it was not me instead the most capable way of solving the problem of a sinful heart is to transform it entirely through the spirit and the work of christ according to the bible the purpose for human beings is to be like god in character no amount of extraneous rule following can produce that except all evidence to the contrary the spirit does not stop atrocities god spirit can not be found working in that pedophile priest can he this spirit of god does not work well enough to stop his religion from splintering into thousands of factual violent divisions it depends i think the questions you asked were fueled by inappropriate assumptions and some faulty reasoning however every answer in life will produce more questions even scientific answers produce more questions such is the nature of acquiring knowledge why are my questions inappropriate i think cause they make you think how is my reasoning faulty you have failed to demonstrate this you are simply equivocating and stating your opinions as if they carry the weight of facts ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,the video is very hard to watch because ben affleck reacts like a child these types of conversations are to the absolute root of religion not a particular religion i would find truth in ben affleck position that you cannot judge turkey by the same measure as isil historically muslims were the enlightened educated free thinkers while christian europe was spreading the plaque with flagellants however i actually find all 3 of the abrahamic faiths to be morally bankrupt and the seed of horrible actions so in the end i would not agree with ben position because he did not listen to the facts bill maher has a history of attacking every religion so i think was on very firm ground here ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,i have to break down what you said because you said a lot of things i would simply ask for those muslims that wish to leave their homelands assimilate into their new culture atleast in its laws these two points are not the same laws are not culture and yes actually every single nation not only expects actually demands that immigrants follow the laws culture however is your own and no nation should be allowed to change that if they insist that sharia law is supreme to their hosts constitution then they should leave i personally believe any religion that insists on a nation following their religious code is wrong i live in the usa and i believe in the concept of division of church and state seditious speech is protected unless there is imminent threat if your country is activeley being targeted by 1 of a religion while their religious brothers are in the street calling for the overthrow of your constitution through other political avenues then the 2 are complicit they share the same goal just using different tactics this leads to internment camps and other horrible reactions i see no evidence of what you claim ig going on in my streets so i see no reason to resort to such mcarthian tactics every nation however should respond as they feel best i can only speak of my own is it too much to ask for comdemnation of jihad nope fuck them jihadists sons of bitches whoever does not condemn them is probably an asshole why come to another country claiming to want a better life then advocate the same theocracy you have just abandoned loaded question there are other reasons to move than wanting a different form of government rather than making a false dichotomy instead ask people questions the answers might surprise you 1 of 1 6 billion people is 16 million 8 jihadis just killed almost 200 people this is called fear mongering 1 person walked into a theater and shot 27 people do bad things it sucks i know how many have already been killed in the war on terror hundreds of thousands millions its an ugly concept to start counting dead if muslims dont like how they are will be treated by people they should take a hard look inside themselves and ask if islam is the kind of religion they want to be associated with if muhaamad is the kind of person they aspire to be we as americans have accepted and expect to be targets by jihadis for our governments actions in muslim nations muslims should brace for reaction ugly bigoted bullshit you can change the word muslim for any group black christian japanese or irish whatever you want this is still a horrible horrible concept the ambush tactics used by jihadis are the embodiment of cowardice and it is a natural response to want to do harm to those who call them brothers especially when there is no one else to lash out at just ewwww i know my wife did not clean the house very well last night so i beat her sister unconscious but hell what else should i do my wife was at work also you can call firing missiles from a drone in a trailer in utah cowardice as well just fyi by their very nature the terrorists inflicts the damage and then leaves his fellow muslim brothers to deal with the fallout how they immediately begin to play the pity islamophobia card is disgusting if they dont want the fall out they should make sure they are very public about their denunciation of these tactics in the bible jesus is quoted as saying you will be known as how you treat the least of my people a japanese american taken to internment camp was quoted as saying what price is democracy the us has made terrible assinine mistakes in its history we will soon see if idealogues such as yours will make its comeback i honestly hope not ,1,DebateReligion

Holiman,so your answer is to declare war on over 2 billion people for the actions of less than 1 can we do the same with christians for the actions of westboro ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,i like your response its honest however it is not critical thinking did you consider the questions your response raises the first question is why did god change is it that humans failed him yet again or if you fail at something multiple times is god the one failing i know that you probably have an issue with the concept of can god fail but if he can change tactics then does not that indicate that god learned something if god can learn than he is imperfect if you accept that the relationship between man and god has evolved over time the question becomes who changed to think man has changed is a quick response but is that correct lets ask what about man has changed are we different has our responses changed has our hearts been easier for god to reach is man more or less religious than we were is gods will better understood today than in history how is god spirit more capable of solving any of these issues than direct involvement if your answer raises more questions or issues than the original question then there is a problem ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,well if you look at the christian bible you do not have a hidden faith required deity to prove god over baal elijah brings down fire the israelites flee from egypt and are given several different miracles of course they immediately make a image to god who destroys it the early bible is full of actual interaction with a god figure why is it so hard to ask where is he now ,3,DebateReligion
Holiman, cannot we also say that people leave religious life out of fear of ignorance you will have to give me an example i have no clue what you mean by this sentence do you believe that religion is spread 100 by fear i try to never say 100 on anything i would also say fear is but a main ingredient there are many parts to religions ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,i would not wish to legitimize their worldview by allowing them to align their beliefs to billions of others who in all honesty do not share their dogma why should we discuss their religion when other muslims are running from them by the millions ,2,atheism
Holiman,i had to follow your link to understand your post and you make great points i do not agree with your conclusion however and this is not because your wrong on the basis of stopping violence it is that we as a species are unable to do so humans are amazing at violence and hunting it is precisely this that has pushed us to the top of the food chain regardless of a lack of natural killing abilities our teeth are not threatening our hands have no claws yet we have hunted so many species to extinction to expect us to change our nature might be more than we are capable of at this time to ask us to understand how morality is aligned with our tendency towards violence however is not great concept but perhaps a less ambitious goal is what is required ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,i cannot speak for others but when i rejected christianity i also rejected the notion of sin so while i have been accused of choosing to sin or other examples of fear tactics of religions i cannot help but chuckle religion is spread by fear fear of god fear of death of hell of punishment and isolation i have found that my rejection of these fears was a relief not a burden should i consider it a sin not to follow outrageous commands from a absent father figure i can neither prove exists or rationally comprehend the only sin i can find today is doing evil things to other people my nature is such that i try not to do that i do admit i am an imperfect human and prone to choose my own good above others and this is natural a large part of my rejection of christianity started with liking exactly who and what i am if this is a sin than i do indeed like it ,1,DebateReligion

Holiman,you have changed your point and are now asking me to prove something i did not claim neither evolution nor any of its parts state that your choices have a direct link to your children dna although there are some certain instances where external influences may alter your dna makeup by altering certain dominant and recessive genes that was not your statement and your statement is wrong the ot describes elijah as not having died which one normally argues the wages of sin are death per the nt so often it is believed that elijah was without sin etc there is job who was blameless etc these do indeed argue with the nt verse you claim but biblical inaccuracies and conflicts are fairly common which is why i normally try to avoid these types of arguments nt states no one ascended into heaven which is direct conflict of the elijah story as well this also conflicts with later stories about jesus ascending with both elijah and moses shrug ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,i hate tons of laws that i obey i pay taxes and that is not fun you might do well to read some physiology books since your argument is actually not supportable so your god is no better than your than the common abusive partner no thank i will pass if that sin i embrace it ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,i do not its called irrational fear and is actually a result of a screwed up culture ,3,DebateReligion
Holiman, original sin does not refer to the origin of sin but to the guilt of adam sin imputed to his offspring and the corruption of man s nature that occurred when sin entered how could adam have sinned if he was ignorant of sin adam only knew about good and evil after he ate of the apple in any rational sense adam was incapable of understanding and rationalizing his actions evolution and natural selection tell us it is possible for two humans to take an action that directly affects their descendants you so do not understand those concepts if you think this is a true statement also if you believe humans affect global warming then you believe the actions of humans can directly affect the laws of nature again you do not understand science effecting a balance of natural elements is not effecting the laws of nature this is just a suggestion but try reading some science journals about global warming and end the question yourself that s just it no one can be decent it s not genetically possible that not what the bible says there are quite a few good men according to the bible ,4,DebateReligion
Holiman,it not a stupid moral law its not moral at all followers fail as human beings all the time even with the radical god effect so whats the point ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,i think the basis of your arguments are about the gospels themselves and not about the story there is a problem about the origins of the gospels which is linguistics and often goes with the q theory http www pbs org wgbh pages frontline shows religion story qthomas html i also like another theory about the origins of the gospel here http www bidstrup com bible htm however i read an article once and really enjoyed the concept and cannot remember where i saw it now the concept was that in the early decades of christianity each cult had many sayings and important lessons written that were compiled by each group when christianity grew as these things do many cults probably gathered together these writings and compiled them together and many many groups had large amounts of different pieces of a theological doctrine that were very different i personally think this better coincides with how later in the 4th century clergy attempted to compile these writings together and formed the first 4 bibles which were very different the christian bible and religion continued to evolve over the next thousand years with few literate non believers around to document things martin luther takes another axe to the bible and viola we have the basis for today bible we do not know the authors we do know their stories have been altered and changed we do know nothing today proves any part of their religion to be true from that the real question should be what does the origins really matter ,7,DebateReligion
Holiman,actually sort of yes i am asking god why someone who was beating his wife has suddenly accepted your grace been made new yada yada etc but that twat has not stopped beating his wife i would think someone who does not understand why that a valid question might be a twat as well ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,i answered the first response because i thought your question was relevant to my point you have now escalated into a full on ad hominem not to mention you do not seem to understand the difference between morality and personality ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,i claim no link to an all mighty divine force that supposedly can have an effect upon me however i do claim secular morality is far superior to religious ones ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,why are your followers such twats should not they be better people ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,the first one is too ambiguous science has great theories about the big bang and the universe being caused by a singularity but its obvious your looking for more which is unknown quick answer would be we do not know another trick question first life might not have originated on earth there are exciting new findings about life being here much much earlier than scientists ever thought possible however life could have been seeded from elsewhere another we do not know i am unsure exactly what you mean by planetary orbs spinning and how they should be spinning gravity is a rather fluid theory but i would love for you to present something showing this claim i would find it interesting to read why ask atheists about evolution we have things called biologists they actually study these things same answer however i doubt dna could be called digital information you might wish to talk to an actual biologist if you have questions read a book common descent is well documented in the latest genealogy studies and mapping of the dna codes ask a physicist i mean honestly does every atheists have to be a biologist a scientist and a physicist ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,i suggest you re read the thread i see you naming three historical references which is sort of an appeal to authority however since they are potentially authorities that fine in this same point though if you suggest someones an authority on a subject that does open their credentials for scrutiny i remember a fox interview where the fox reporter keep asking why a muslim would write about the historicity of jesus his response is classic because its his job and his education and what he does for a living educated in the subject someone challenges the credentials either you can respond with facts or admit the point changing the subject to avoid the issue is not something i can agree with every argument has two sides it should be the facts presented that make the case no if you have a solid case list your facts and lets discuss them the only possible way to overcome prejudice is honest interpretation of facts ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,this is a horrible response to someone giving you solid reasons for their argument instead of handling criticism you are changing the subject could you imagine a historian of any reliability following your example being taken seriously ,4,DebateReligion
Holiman,yahweh aint special here i also think the other 6000 suck as well quoting a verse does little to make an argument also if i had a hard heart i wouldnt talk to believers listen to their arguments and care about truth ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,ignoring the circular reasoning ignoring the huge inconsistencies of a methodology you cannot prove nor understand lets focus on one part of your argument that god would truly suck i am not demeaning your god or at least not attempting to i mean any god that could create no better methodology than guessing sucks even the most basic of jobs train their employee to understand what is required many have manuals repositories of information etc the best most successful companies create entire methods of learning that create a job requirement so idiot simple failing is actually hard and yet people still do that you will work perhaps 1 3rd of your life but the most important part of existence by a creator god is left to guesswork and chance sorry sounds inept to me ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman, i am not trying to prove god nor his ability to create ex nihilo but you easily dismissed my ability to create being a father and machinist by bringing this up since we do not even know what nothing is or could be its irrelevant and you cannot even prove gods ability to do it either so what was your point no i do not have control i have choice i can make choices but the effects are often very different than what i envision choice is absolutely effected by people things etc and yes control being illusion is very important you will find out if you have not already how quickly life can take control away from you ,1,DebateReligion

Holiman,i actually had a believer tell me that romans couldnt figure out how to make the calendar work until a rabbi explained the world stood still for a day hence leap year ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,arent you just a peach let me first start by stating there is a difference between being offended and calling something offensive i am not offended by your repeated insults i am simply explaining that i find your comment an offensive way to debate rather than playing word games with you i will only say your sentence was inclusive meaning the word you used along with and people like me that is an offensive way to debate especially since you seem to feel you have set the bar in this discussion well on that count you are correct now saying you shared a stage with muslim extremists is not equal to calling you one you are so projecting here you placed me into a box by your religious views not unlike the way muslim extremists call everyone infidels my sentence is called rhetoric and it normally allows a person to express views in a way others might understand it seem to have failed here i know not to mention your entire post has been rude so i will say this once clean it up or i wont respond further if this is what you feel shows your religion in a positive light well i would rather leave the room ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman, you did not create ex nihilo those things that the type of creation i mean with respect to god not the everyday sense of the word show me ex nihilo and then we can talk i am unsure such a concept is actually real nor do i know of any physicists suggesting such a thing is possible our decisions are dependent on god and physics and independent from other objects people etc sorry brother no one lives in a vacuum no decisions are independent of other object people time age circumstances etc lastly control is an illusion so decisions you have control over is hopeful thinking at bet ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,yes and no you stated your opinion as if fact unless you can demonstrate truth to your claim in some way its no different than any other claims really your answer is rather vague i could fill in your god answer with thousands of other words and have the same results ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman, you are asking a bunch of questions all different from each other does my religion have an effect on the world does god have an effect on the world does god do miracles why why not is that a problem i have no clue why you started this way well judaism has had more impact on the world than any other religion since it basically birthed the rest kind of a big effects no yes and no yes in that i agree abrahamic religions are by far and away the largest group of believers and they have effected the world greatly no in that i cannot lay every achievement at the feet of its predecessor i would contend even judaism owed its origins to earlier religions and that christianity at least took many other religious concepts to create their religion i would answer the rest of your questions yes and yes though because of the klipot and someone like you who calls themselves a once duped christian you are so far removed from kedusaha you will never find it at this time calling me a kilpot is a rather offensive way to have a conversation you are defining me by your religion in a negative light it is the concept that your religion allows you to define the world that is offensive in that sentence you have shared the stage with muslim extremists congratulations why did not you ask if people religiously have an effect on the world theurgy because people of course effect the world that argument means nothing to me horrible people have effected the world this does not mean anything and should not matter to us about what they believed ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,fair enough answers i might take some time to re read some of your comments and answer later i have a tendency to respond quicker than i think ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,you have come to the crux of the problem your philosophy or religion or whatever you wish to call it depends on the concept of rebirth or reincarnation to explain the huge glaring hole that is your basic concept of kamma now prove reincarnation or rebirth is true or real if you cannot which i do think you admit you cant then there is but one answer your entire religion is just wishful thinking ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,children the world over are born into malnutrition hunger misery drug addiction and abuse they deserve this why ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,i started to read your first link and got so disgusted i stopped popes are not miracles youve had a women pope who obviously lied to get her position you have had popes who started wars and popes who were imprisoned by nations the catholic church stepped into a role of leading the world after the super nation of rome fell that is not a miracle lastly you actually presented the catholic church record on respecting woman really fucking disgusting honestly ever heard of the malleus maleficarum https en wikipedia org wiki malleus maleficarum i tell you what stop letting your priests rape children that would be enough of a miracle for me to listen to you further this conversation has made me sick i am sorry i try honestly i do try to speak politely with believers but at times i fail after all i have no god supporting me in this endeavor ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,i was once a christian i am thankful and sorta sad to realize i was duped i was fooled into believing false ideas and stories i did look at both links for a moment or three just to make sure there was not anything funny hidden in the messages you made a claim about god could control my fingers i challenge you and your god to control them now make me write something other than i do not accept the jesus mythology ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,my first problem with kamma is that it does not work sure bad actions bring back negative results sometimes there are millions of examples of bad people who never get their comeuppance there are millions of examples of good people never receive any rewards rather than argue this even your faith just gives a loophole about the next life cycle sorry i see nothing divine in your faith here the faithful give more to charities i agree this might say more about religions effect on charitable giving but it says nothing about gods impact on the world ,3,DebateReligion
Holiman,fine have your god control my fingers into making my next post say i am wrong and your god is real i would actually really really like your god to prove me wrong all i ever asked was for a god to interact ,3,DebateReligion
Holiman,not a big fan of warhammer although i once enjoyed painting the figurines ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,and we know this because you did not answer my question you simply stated your opinion as if it were fact ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman, creation implicitly includes dependence i reject this notion i raised my children to be independent so should every parent i am a machinist i create many items people use i have no obligation beyond making my part right we do not have free will in the sense that we can make decisions independent of god this sentence but we have free will in the sense that we do make our own decisions and we do not feel any coercion from god to do that and this sentence make no sense either we make decisions independently or we do not because we are not coerced we are liable to account for our deeds if we are liable we are coerced the biblical stories in the ot show god does indeed coerce people the devil or demons coerce people i am unsure of the koran ,3,DebateReligion
Holiman, again you are thinking of it all wrong whether or not god will give you a bicycle is unrelated to the question of if he exists or not ill give you a parable some dude had an absent father he never knew his father and received nothing from him only was told about him by his mother his mother did everything for him but his existence proved their must have been a father fast forward into the future and mom finally admits he was an experiment with science of creating life from one parent alone and his dna was both parts from his maternal side he has no father he might be freaked out to be so different from everyone else but what actual effect did not having a father have the absent father added nothing to his life so his removal only effects a preconceived notion of normality others have bestowed upon this person among other arguments the problem of nothingness is quite lethal for atheism in the sense of holding that no creator exists or could exist although not an atheist i see no problem with nothing first i do not know what nothing is or could be we have no examples of nothing and no knowledge of a creator of nothing is your argument about the unknown being a factor presumably he would be a little wiser than you about if doing certain actions are a good idea or not sadly believers are not i absolutely agree if people did have a connection to the divine they should be different problem is they simply are not hell at this point i would just be happy if believers would stop raping children ,0,DebateReligion
Holiman, is religion the same as the things it about the whole is the sum of its parts yes maybe you did one by accident then no i explained myself and my point haha what which word did not you understand did you mean to add to the mind of a cliche newatheist who has never tried a different perspective or do you just have a very loose understanding of refutation either way ok i guess no i mean physicists such as steven hawkings among other educated people on this subject norms of rationality no clue what you mean here do you think maybe the line if we want to be able to call ourselves rational individuals suggests something like that i do not care what you wish to call yourselves if your god has no effect on this world and you cannot prove the world or universe was created than your belief is not a rational response ,0,DebateReligion
Holiman,so this god wanted a world where death and misery runs rampant ok so this god made everything why for what purpose if we are wholly dependent on this god and he did not want it to evolve on its own we can lay every evil deed on its feet ,5,DebateReligion
Holiman,i am not attacking you or your religious belief if that what you call your infatuation with a music band but if your butt hurt can you can report me i guess to the point the music talent if you can call it that is really really bad first rule is i try never to judge a singer highly if they do not release acappella versions of their music however the heavy usage of auto tune and almost non existent vocals allows me a comfort zone here of saying they suck ,-1,DebateReligion
Holiman,i took the time to listen to grimes and holy shit does she suck sorry brother if that your god you need help with a lot more than religion ,3,DebateReligion
Holiman,the differences are about topic verses discussion your deity faith and miracles are all part and parcel to your religion hence my follow up points are part of the overall discussion i was not attempting a bait and switch if your deity is hands off then what good is he i would be interested in reason dictating a creator since all of those arguments so far have been refuted ad nauseam also if one did actually prove the universe created how would it then follow we were obligated to do anything how do you actually know god isnt a celestial vending machine ,0,DebateReligion
Holiman, 1 god created us to know of him why would god not give man knowledge of good vs evil in the beginning if he wanted us to know him why would a god find it so hard to let man get to know him i searched for years and still do not have a clue what a god could be or if its real 2 god wants us to love him not because he egotistical or something like that but because he is the way how many abusive husbands father etc do not abuse their victims because they want to be abusive its just their way not to mention i doubt you have a good grasp of your bible since god is indeed egotistical the verses i could quote you but why bother who makes creatures just to worship you if your not egotistical 3 we have choice we can follow him or not though people who have not heard of jesus do have a good chance of salvation it just depends if you want to spend eternity with him or not an egotistical angry abusive all powerful maniac who enjoys torturing his creations simply to prove their loyalty i think not ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,this is a nice story however it actually makes no sense if god was a kind more passive deity as you suggest why would he even make an attempt at reaching us at all just let everyone into heaven if they want it and if they choose not then let them wander whatever eternity they choose why have sin why have any religion why not just let humans be ourselves and enjoy the show your argument makes a passive weak deity who willingly tortured and killed his son just get to know us better ,5,DebateReligion
Holiman,what are we saved from from what god will do to us if we do not let him in i think i have heard better offers in the movie godfather ,3,DebateReligion
Holiman,it a huge mistake to use holy books to prove or disprove religions one example is in the book of revelations there is a verse rev 22 19 and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy god shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book now this has taken on lots of meanings to lots of different people the book itself predates most other books in the nt however its been placed at the end simply to make the books of the nt seem complete and finished not to mention translating this text would be a sin ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,probably because we put people in jail for refusing medical treatment for their children just a guess though ,-1,DebateReligion
Holiman,again so what is your response you do not have an actual argument against abortion do you the reason it is important to show the reality is to remove the emotional garbage of how precious life is and that it should be cherished people die not just some of us all people die to bring life into misery for some arbitrary concept of divine morality is not even close to correct you do not care why you do not care about facts you do not care about what works best you simply wish to demand people follow your sense of divine morality what makes your morality better than shariah law ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,i read that title and actually heard archer say phrasing ,4,DebateReligion
Holiman,i refuse to believe a lie even if it gives me comfort i would refuse to worship someone or something just because its more powerful than i am since we are talking about the god of christianity i would absolutely prefer having nothing to do with such a creature ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,i am not an atheist although i did sleep at a holiday inn last night i was indoctrinated into christianity during high school and even studied under a master theologian thinking of entering the ministry it took years to realize i was duped probably without intent but i came to realize christianity wasnt true i studied mormonism and even went through a pagan wiccan druidic interest i know very little about islam and little more about judiasm and love the norse mythology what i do know is bullshit claims and lack of evidence any claims of god i have decided are that gods responsibility to prove if he she it wanted to do so i am very open minded i worry very little about what came before the universe hell its not like science knows that much about our own galaxy yet what i do know is i have yet to experience an actual supernatural phenomenon and await that pleasure even if something did happen i would require testing replication and further study before claiming a god ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,i was not intending to argue what life is and where it starts i am trying to explain how utterly wasteful reproductions among people is in reality life is not precious in any grand sense its precious to the people that are effected by death humanity is overpopulated and is still growing death can be horrible i do not care if its natural doctor aided or drinking a poison fact legalizing abortion reduces abortion teaching safe sex reduces abortion access to contraceptives reduce abortion believers by and large are against all of these things not to protect children as they say but instead to control women this is why they find it so easy to ignore all facts and arguments i have noticed you have no actual argument just your bible based morality that i have shown is rather ugly ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,good now that argument with the one link makes an argument worth talking about the big blue link fest shows lazy work you want to argue make a statement support it and expect a rebuttal ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman, in no way did you paraphrase my argument and the argument you are making is just stupid to put it frankly ok let say all believers do not care about the situations that children are born into so what it does not mean that abortion is moral or ok your sentence is a fantastic example of the inferiority of religious morality yes absolutely the circumstances matter so much in fact even most anti abortion activists understand the rape incest exceptions there are studies aplenty that explain in detail about the effects of unwanted children and poverty etc your so what show how little hope we can have for reasonable debate with believers i mean by your logic i should be allowed to kill you if i do not think that you are in a good situation in life i mean right if you are allowed to kill an unborn child because the situation they would be born into is not good why cannot i kill you because i think you are in a bad situation knock you out first so you do not feel anything but then put you to death that would be perfectly ok abortion is not murder how many times does a person have to explain that abortion is actually natural life is not perfect woman lose 90 of their eggs unfertilized men release billions of sperm every ejaculation i do not even want to figure out that waste even if a sperm does fertilize the eggs there is a chance a woman body will reject the pregnancy no that is not ok and most believers probably do really care about the situations that children are born into that why there are countless religious charities that provide basic needs to children all over the world why would you even think that people do not care i agree religious charities do exist and do some good dont break an arm patting yourself on the back though the us alone spends 11 billion a year on unwanted pregnancies hint none of that money goes for abortion cause i know you doubt this http www guttmacher org media nr 2011 05 19 index html btw as an aside what have you done to help children in deadly situations my guess next to nothing yet you want to rage against all of these believers that do not in your mind really this would be called an ad hominem so you know i could claim things i have done but that would be pointless and self aggrandizing this is a debate not an attack on a person how about this how about caring for human life from conception to death how about that that btw is the view of the torah which i believe in following and it should be the position you and everyone else should hold it the only moral position holy crap really i suggest you check out this link https www youtube com watch v cq2c7fyvta4 you can look at your loving believers morality i could do without below psalm 137 9 happy is the one who seizes your infants and dashes them against the rocks hosea 9 11 14 ephraim glory shall fly away like a bird no birth no pregnancy no conception 12 even if they bring up children i will bereave them till none is left woe to them when i depart from them 13 ephraim as i have seen was like a young palm a planted in a meadow but ephraim must lead his children out to slaughter b 14 give them o lord what will you give give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts exodus 12 29 30 at midnight the lord struck down all the firstborn in the land of egypt from the firstborn of pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon and all the firstborn of the livestock 30 and pharaoh rose up in the night he and all his servants and all the egyptians and there was a great cry in egypt for there was not a house where someone was not dead numbers 31 15 have you allowed all the women to live he asked them 16 they were the ones who followed balaam s advice and enticed the israelites to be unfaithful to the lord in the peor incident so that a plague struck the lord s people 17 now kill all the boys and kill every woman who has slept with a man 18 but save for yourselves every girl who has never slept with a man ,1,DebateReligion

Holiman,funny how amoral believers are about abortion sure they raise a hell of a stink about killing the unborn but couldnt give a shit less if those children are born into horrible deadly situations fuck them that are born just keep breeding more eh abortion may be a bad choice but unless you know the alternative your asserting moral superiority from ignorance ,1,DebateReligion

Holiman,i would happily be separated from such a god ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,my argument is always against the theist claims i actually like the concept of god and would welcome a reasonable debate about what a god could actually be theist claims are always about a knowable god and these i find unacceptable not because i have preconceived notions or personal bias rather that nothing i have ever seen shows evidence a god worthy of being worshiped if god is a child with a magnifying glass enjoying torturing people as i define most abrahamic religions then why should i worship it ,0,DebateReligion
Holiman,history would be fairly empty if we used such high levels of proof to establish historical figures no homer no alexander the great who really was pythagoras anyways ,4,DebateReligion
Holiman,normally i am against the religious and i absolutely understand your position here people in hospitals often times have no one or are in the gripes of terrible times where any act of kindness even a religious one is a help i absolutely agree this chaplain was way out of line but that the problem with an absent god people screw up and there is no divine helper to move them along so we are forced to deal with our foibles this one person may have caused you and your mother harm but chaplains in hospitals have done much more good ya know ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman, this is for christians who care about being taken seriously create methods for proving claims true without regard for your preconceived conclusions you again started with a preconceived notion what if he was not christ and people made up the stories like the other thousands of religions throughout time ,7,DebateReligion

Holiman, in conclusion this argument boils down to seven different adjectives about peoples claims what makes this particular avenue worse is that the concept was born from the known writings in the gospels to create a methodology for validating a claim that is my conclusion after taking each and every point and explaining why they were bad bases for evidence are you attempting to claim i failed to make my case your reply makes no sense to me ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,for a claim of supernatural intervention the burden is on the claimant i am willing to listen but i have never seen proof of the supernatural to date ,3,DebateReligion
Holiman,your making a false equivalency there is no they were liars or not choice here they could have just been wrong they could have created followers themselves and died for them there is also and untold number of alternatives we do not know what actually occurred but we do know there is no evidence of their claims today ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,i can actually concede the link is not a good example i will attempt to fix that everyone i mention believed it was true non of them were con men either neither was hitler or stalin they also died believing they were all wrong i never claimed the apostles were con men as to the historicity of the gospels that is another huge topic to start with i would ask who wrote them why did they write them and what purpose do they serve ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,the point was never that you remember nothing but that memory is effected by time long term memory is still effected by time but some points stick out such as in the article the reference to smell effecting long term memories do you in fact dispute either that time effects memory or that documentation about the life of jesus is well past what we could establish as early testimony requires corroboration but i never claimed that all testimony is without merit i merely implied you cannot establish truth by testimony alone giving seven different adjectives testimonies changes nothing they died because they believed something is true nazi believed in hitler and the reich bolsheviks believed in the power of the people the followers of jesus including apostles died believing in jesus and heaven there is no differences in what your arguing they all made claims and died for their beliefs in your point about the con man that would make jesus the con man and to my knowledge we have no writings of his ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,science is not a tangible thing you cannot find it lying on the street and point it out declaring there that science declaring god made science is actually offensive in that you ignore those people who actually had a hand in creating what we call science today science can be defined as the intellectual and practical activity encompassing the systematic study of the structure and behavior of the physical and natural world through observation and experiment great you have a non natural non physical god stop bringing up science then their not compatible ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,quick answer no i do not find these arguments satisfactory 1 did paul have free will when god blinded him did jonah the stories in the bible were full of people disobeying god and god responding even through a jackass so your free will argument isnt supported by your holy books 2 once again god supposedly intervenes throughout history creating a planet is intervention enough to make your entire argument unsupportable not to mention your entire concept here is meaningless if god wants worshipers instead of a sims world 3 this divine vision has supposedly been seen by many who were in fact willing to martyr themselves although normally followers seem more than willing to kill instead 4 so god is hiding for my own good then why have a hell for failing this test 5 over half the population believes in some form of a god religions love to ask us to blame ourselves for our failings but any decent god would have left a clear path that path does not exist the thousands upon thousands of different gods and faiths alone attest to this fact 6 wow this one seem like gibberish sorry i see no point unless its an appeal to ignorance closing rebuttal most religions christianity included suggest a god that does intervene and is physical tearing down towers and flooding the world are not the acts of subtle benign god you dressed up your faith in a pretty outfit and made it all pleasant and light however this hides the ugly truth of what followers actually believe ,9,DebateReligion

Holiman,i agree the quran for example seem very close to what is thought to be original i do understand the original authorship is uncertain however lastly the point absolutely still holds that it does not work well in modern society the muslim world was once the leading the world on science and society however the religious ideology does what it always does and hinders the people who follow it ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,while religions talk about how to live life they are ultimately based upon a fear of death you know the answer well enough in every conversation with a believer the first and last comment they make is about fear of death every faith based statement is about an unknown element of the afterlife or the meaning of life itself the atheist stance is one of rejecting those claims as either unknowable or demonstrably false those claims of atheists being nihilistic or depressing is their way of projecting their own fears on you as in all things the best answer is to life life well ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,i am skeptical of this claim for the reasons i am skeptical of most miraculous claims why did this one person receive a miracle and no one else since was his need more than others or was he more righteous or godly there are literally millions of miraculous events that avoid easy explanation when you give an answer such as god did this thing that requires more than a simple statement should not we all ask why him and not others if there is a god who heals one amputee every 10 billion people than is this even a god we should worship ,1,DebateReligion

Holiman,you read it all then why ask what is well answered on page 4 the draft sequence of the neanderthal genome provides more evidence that interbreeding between neanderthals and modern humans may have occurred it showed more similarities between non african modern humans and neanderthals than between african modern humans and neanderthals this difference between regions is consistent with interbreeding between neanderthals and the ancestors of eurasian modern humans before they branched off into regional groups approximately 1 to 4 of non african modern human dna is shared with neanderthals ,2,DebateReligion

Holiman,i do not care what atheists say about this subject nor should you honestly scientists and biologists have spent 100 years and exhaustive work fleshing out this subject it is complex and simple enough everyone can understand the basics cellular biology itself has explained more than fossil evidence ever could to date i have never seen a argument against evolution offer a scientific argument that withstands the same credibility as required by peer review ,4,DebateReligion
Holiman,you have every right to feel however you want about evolution and the human soul i myself do care about this subject since it very important to science a subject i am very interested in personally smithsonian link click to see human fossil evidence http humanorigins si edu evidence human family tree the first issue is that in evolutionary theory every fossil is transitional since evolution has no end point per se the fossil record itself is exhaustive allow me to quote here considering the low probability of fossilization the number of transitional forms that have been found is remarkable to say that these fossils fail to establish evolution because there should be more would be akin to seeing the angel gabriel descend from the sky and saying well that does not prove anything i mean where uriel see more at http vuletic com hume cefec 5 7 html sthash ifqmictp dpuf just a few transitional fossils http transitionalfossils com ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,a couple of suggestions first i would not use the word linear and evolution together since evolution is not linear second you should actually go take a class and learn about the basics of the theory of evolution this would clear up alot of your misunderstandings ,6,DebateReligion
Holiman,honest questions not an attack have you looked into the fossil record or read any journals articles etc about this concept ,3,DebateReligion
Holiman,fine lets consider that two writings exist that claim they saw a man who had died was alive and that they were witness to this event first we must analyze both writings quick citation https thechurchoftruth wordpress com synoptic gospels not writen by matt mark luke or john so the authors are actually unknown and experts have placed doubt on their being first hand accounts hence hearsay might be correct regardless however i will not reject this on hearsay alone i reject this first and foremost because of a lack of amazing evidentiary support there was a very intense rift between pharisees and sadducee in that time about resurrection christian article about this http www angelfire com journal althehare pse html yet the stories give multiple accounts of jesus performing resurrection and neither of these factions freaked the hell out really i mean honestly if taken at their word these people ignored reality entirely to cling to an old faith with a tenacious strength no one could possibly hold today are first person accounts reliable at all science says no http www scientificamerican com article do the eyes have it ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,your argument is very hard to follow i would honestly suggest you clean up and re work it personally first problem first state of the universe cannot have a naturalistic explanation this is not supported by several prominent physicists so requires more than a simple statement for acceptance from me natural world does not equate space time and its contents choose your words better please outside of space time is a huge unknown so how can you define and explain what can or cannot exist there as far as i know no such thing actually exists why would this agent be personal you simply state this and give no reasoning how you reached this conclusion how do you know that that abstract objects cannot have casual relationships that are natural towards creation of a universe you make such giant leaps of logic we have the ability to create a universe potentially with our lhc experiments we would be outside of that space and time if we did such a thing does that make us gods by your definitions ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,if i read you correctly i agree the cosmological argument is indeed a circle jerk ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,i guess that is why i prefer drinking and fighting and screwing in a long hall for my afterlife ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,well if you read my responses again you will notice i was directly responding to a point about paul and his vision now read my original point where i make a case about millions viewing the same thing and if we should consider that evidence to your point yes the stories in the bible refer to hundreds of people all seeing jesus i can show you a video showing thousands of people seeing a zombie dead man walking in jamaica there has to date been nothing i have seen that supports these allegations but i am waiting there were 20 well known writers in that area and time and none of them mention dead men walking strange no ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,what if we lead a revolt ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,no the point is some dude had a vision and you accept that as evidence i am pointing out that i do not and for good reason ,1,DebateReligion

Holiman,you have good solid points to your argument in the end both the facts you presented and others that are well known in the resurrection story raise reasonable doubt lets ignore this point for a moment does it matter if people think a man rose from the dead or not 2000 years ago to a few people there are no reliable miracles today no amputee regrow limbs and the supernatural is unreliable at best if you seek rational result oriented faith you will be disappointed ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,millions have seen aliens can we consider that as evidence as well ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,according to my understanding of a christian god adam can atone and be forgiven john goes to hell the basic foundation of a christian theology is that belief is required there can be no salvation or forgiveness for sin supposedly we all sin no exceptions so they hold an equal share of evil and only the first asked for salvation my question is why should anyone worship a god if this is an acceptable scenario for salvation ,7,DebateReligion
Holiman,if you were not an angry muffin you could have asked what reasonable evidence i could possibly have shown such as scientific studies that show prayer does not improve people in hospitals and have in some instances shown negative effects if the person knew they were being prayed for or we could have talked about an article in a catholic paper that showed western countries with less belief in god were better off socially instead you got butt hurt and insulting i have not i guess i found my third example eh ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,wow nasty negative end of discussion ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,it is an example that belief precedes worldview hence we have belief given by knowledge this shapes our worldview not the other way around the crux of religious arguments is that you are not arguing a belief rather you are questioning a persons worldview ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,i do not accept that concept since there is reasonable evidence that shows no reciprocation to that relationship ie i find this argument about as reasonable as i have a gf in canada ,3,DebateReligion
Holiman,i think belief comes before worldview and actually shapes your worldview for example children have little or no worldview beyond their parents i absolutely agree that they cannot conflict without serious physiological problems which i think may be the crux of religious arguments ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,ok since you want to drag out the bible in the story about jesus and doubting thomas we see that jesus actually points out a difference in faith himself there is a difference in faith and blind faith i submit the difference is that faith can be based upon belief through knowledge yet blind faith is actually something that goes against knowledge ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,i want to avoid the bible since i want this discussion multi theistic also i do not agree that belief and faith are the same as i stated in my definitions ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,which ideas about religion are asserted with any real supporting evidence ,4,DebateReligion
Holiman,it was once ten times more natural than it is today science has reduced these numbers drastically you can color the actions as horribly as you want the bodies process is no walk in the park either the facts are the body naturally aborts much more fetuses than people do by choice poverty leads directly to abortions crime and actual murders yet you have no problem suggesting the churches have that problem covered i disagree i will admit the church does try probably more than most but we are all failing and its getting worse not better ,0,DebateReligion
Holiman,its not murder as i pointed out our bodies do similar things naturally much more frequently ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,not even comparable there is no reason to allow special privileges to the unborn ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,i would accept any supernatural claim that was as supported as any scientific theory that simple enough for you ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,my thoughts are about the relationship part of your comment i remember vividly the comment if your not as close to god as you once were its you cause god has not moved this is absolutely true your relationship will always be one sided cause god gives nothing to it i know people do not like hearing this but its true there were 19 people on 9 11 that had very intimate relationships with their god closer than most christians i have ever known yet in the end does anyone truly think any god would have supported their actions ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman, abortion purposely ends a human life it is in essence murder it is horrifying to those of us who oppose it abortion is natural a woman s body naturally rejects at least 18 of fertilized eggs this means that if you have unprotected sex that leads to the fertilization of an egg 30 chance of successful fertilization the resulting zygote has an 18 chance of being rejected by the uterus the human body naturally performs abortions almost 20 of the time see more at http www patheos com blogs lovejoyfeminism 2012 10 how i lost faith in the pro life movement html sthash y9u1djmu dpuf same sex marriage was not an issue until recently when a relatively small group of began to call for it thus changing the definition of marriage when christians expressed some moral objections to it that same small group immediately labeled them as bigots what you see as railing we see as responding if it is a brand new issue why are so many happy same sex couples who have waited decades getting married it is new only in that people have only recently gotten their rights your responding in the same way people responded to civil rights in years past i love how easily you sweep aside issues about poverty and the poor as so unimportant so your god only cares about the usa and jesus never spent much time talking about the poor and downtrodden just wow if your not alarmed about environmental problems than your in denial pure and simple ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,i like to think of an argument like a building if your basement is faulty i will not enter that home if however your door is askew i might simply mention that in passing so in answer no not all fallacies are conversation enders however if your argument starts with a straw man i will cut it short ,3,DebateReligion
Holiman,if someone attempted to use their belief in those things to effect my life i would take them very seriously one needs only watch the news to see how religious beliefs are effecting us daily ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,i would agree that these are important topics and worthy of discussion i would absolutely argue religion is either a help or solution to those same problems ,3,DebateReligion
Holiman,i have neither attacked nor surprised anyone here and have actually learned some things and enjoyed some decent debate ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,if what you say is even close to true explain why they had the council of trent https en wikipedia org wiki council of trent if not in an attempt to codify cannon and yes they have removed books since then again repudiating your position entirely another point if they were codified whey was there the septuagint which offended people like aquila symmachus theodotion who translated different versions of hebrew books none if which contained the new testament read about the codex sinaiticus one of four ancient books that show you are simply wrong even the simple basic concept of the nicene creed took hundreds of years to be accepted i am not a scholar of bible or greek history so i can only say every one i have read tells me your wrong ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman, quick answer there cannot be a newer testament because the incarnation of christ is the fulfillment of the scriptures there is nothing new which need be added because everything necessary for salvation is already contained within the bible actually this statement does not conform to most known christian orthodoxy the only way jesus can fulfill the prophecies even the ones in the ot is by coming back also the notion of salvation being contained in the bible does not conform with common sense there was no bible for hundreds of years after the supposed death of jesus and the bible looked quite different until the protestant movement ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,i am unclear what distinction your making here i have no problem with jews not accepting jesus as christ there were dozens every year running around at that time leading up to the roman crackdown on jerusalem ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,if a theist just claims there is a god what separates them from a deist ever notice there are schools of theology several forms of theism mono poly etc we will obviously run into the gnostic agnostic position in regards to this question however i would simply state your own example of theism contains people who claim knowledge about god ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman, all positive arguments have a burden of proof and should be free from logical flaws or unsound methodology posted by limitedletshangout would you agree with this for a starting point ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,i am sorry i will not respond further to your accusations i have explained i am not an atheist you have failed to address this post and i can see no further good can come from our discussion ,3,DebateReligion
Holiman,i agree theists have a multitude of different views on their god however i do not agree that theist only means someone is convinced of a god to me that is a deist theists normally take it further by claiming knowledge about that god which is a very important distinction your christian example does mean every christian at least believes in a christ figure if god is knowable and has an effect we have something to talk about while a deist can claim gods that are not knowable and have no effect man would understand ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,i would think a sound argument actually meets the burden of proof in a discussion at least it would absolutely work with me ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,i do not argue that what you say is true however you made points why another new testement is not possible i think you merely made my case stronger ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman, no jesus himself did not even radically change our understanding of god and morality from the old testament after all his first followers were devout jews themselves two points mormons were once devout christians second the pharisees and sadducees were both devout jews and felt quite differently not to mention the jews alive today ,3,DebateReligion
Holiman, all positive arguments have a burden of proof and should be free from logical flaws or unsound methodology posted by limitedletshangout now to the argument a person poses x and uses xyz to make their claim if person used logical flaws or unsound methodology should that not be addressed before continuing ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,would you prefer i suggest that your argument would do better on its own rather than distract from what argument i am trying to address with this post or i suggest you make a post and make your case but in truth i find little if any interest in these types of arguments the rabbit hole goes to deep for me to follow ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman, you never asked why i refuse to make a case for my belief is that not my original question if you are convinced of your position why is it so hard to shoulder your burden and make your argument again you seem to absolutely misunderstand the question or refuse to actually read it there is no indictment no assertion of any kind only the question of why not make your case again the accusation of me inverting truth i asked a question and you refuse to deal with that apparently yet the very next sentence you declare victory with an argument not even presented this makes me lazy and dishonest shame on you sir stop changing the argument ,3,DebateReligion
Holiman,so can i not respond with hitchens razor what can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence ,3,DebateReligion
Holiman, all positive arguments have a burden of proof and should be free from logical flaws or unsound methodology this is a great sentence ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,i am dealing with it and honestly i asked why you refuse to make a case for your belief your response was a straw man and now your avoiding the question to again ask me to argue something i openly admit i have no evidence for or against ,3,DebateReligion
Holiman,see this is a threat and shows you probably have alot to learn about people and your own bible ask yourself if your interaction with me showed a positive representation of christ or if instead you were off putting and reinforced my negative view of the bible ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,do theists not share beliefs holy books attend meetings and in some cases lectures and learning lessons from people considered experts in the field while there is a rather new atheism movement starting it cannot be called organized as the range of comments here alone prove ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,this is kinda complicated i need to think on this for a while ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman, the fact is the materialist naturalist modern scientistic worldview that almost all atheists subscribe to is not built on any kind of solid epistemic foundation i agree with the rest of your post except the above however this probably isnt the best time for this debate ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,i read your book i once believed in your god my study has showed me that your book holds nothing of truth that i should hold holy so where does this leave us in this discussion ,3,DebateReligion
Holiman,this i think is exactly what i am saying not only should the person making the x claim state their reasons they have that responsibility what other than burden of proof explains this concept ,3,DebateReligion
Holiman,it depends on what your saying here should i give a reasoned response to a claim to explain my position or give evidence contrary to a claim then i agree however if i should attempt to disprove any and all claims because i am unconvinced of supernatural claims then no ,6,DebateReligion
Holiman,i worded my reply badly i guess those paleontologists would not argue about the ones they agreed upon in the same way the christian and atheist need not argue about the gods they both reject ,4,DebateReligion
Holiman,now this is worth discussing if someone claims your worldview is wrong you are absolutely correct in asking for that reasoning however the question of does god exist should not be about your worldview if your god is only relevant in your worldview than its a personal deity and not something another person can interact with the conflict only arises when you project or infer that your deity interacts with more than your worldview ,3,DebateReligion
Holiman,i do not entirely disagree except perhaps that asking for evidence does not in my mind equate to scathing criticism i am asking how that should instead be worded ,5,DebateReligion
Holiman,to me the burden of proof is a way of explaining an argument that goes roughly i belief in x with the response of yeah prove it ,4,DebateReligion
Holiman,i absolutely support critical thinking being taught in school which i think would be a good start ,7,DebateReligion
Holiman,if we abandon the concept of burden of proof how would we even form the question then i am not against a new form of requesting evidence to support an argument though ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,name any other subject where two people agree on a concept such as 5999 gods do not exist instead of merely focusing on the one in which they actually have different positions ,4,DebateReligion
Holiman,so how would you change my original question then how should the argument even begin ,3,DebateReligion
Holiman,would you then accept that reality is self created and would you also accept that another persons perception is as valid as yours even if it differs fundamentally ,3,DebateReligion
Holiman,please explain this further ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,if we discount the scientific method does that not lead towards self delusion i am not calling your position or belief wrong i am curios how else we can establish truth ,9,DebateReligion
Holiman,this is a wonderful example of a straw man i neither stated nor implied what you have argued here you then bring up something rather irrelevant please respond to the question ,8,DebateReligion
Holiman,in my experience the phrase people around here or those people alienates the people your talking to or debating your strong statements from the i position were good points though i also think anyone worth talking to would listen to your evidence and respond to that alone ,3,DebateReligion
Holiman,if an atheist claims no god exist i agree further it would be reasonable to ask one to prove that statement ,7,DebateReligion
Holiman,this is a tough question what is belief i believe my car will start from experience however i can and have been wrong before now faith can be a form of belief by experience or blind faith without justification the latter is what i do not accept personally ,3,DebateReligion

Holiman,i think that i understand what your getting at here once something is understood it becomes natural so the supernatural is a never reachable goal if we understood the nature of a god would that then become a natural event ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,how exactly does your ad hominem add to this debate ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,wow project much so since i find someone threatening me even if its with things i do not accept repulsive its my fault for feeling that way not that perhaps i was once indoctrinated into belief when i was younger and that as a normal person find am still bothered by certain concepts yep i am angry and vulnerable thank you for your insight ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,they would both suck i dont really understand your question ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,i once read someone said the goal of good communication was not to be better understood but rather to be impossible to be misunderstood that in a nutshell is what i would expect ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,your so right my bad a girl wears a short skirt and you perhaps tell her someone might rape her for wearing such things thats not a threat right your just saying it could happen years of indoctrinated threats have kept the church wealthy ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,open discussion about the afterlife is fine threatening me with burning in hell however is another subject entirely ,3,DebateReligion
Holiman,the south deep in the mtns many people i know have similar accounts in the south there are tons of evangelical christians mormons and jw nearby no muslims though although i would guess we are also talking about online ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,actually no there are an entire groups of every religion who do not use reason and logic and do not care if their claims are rational ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,and there are multi thousand religious claims i should memorize them all only to be confronted with theists who move goal posts at every turn i think not ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,using the bible to argue the bible is falling into a hold and using a shovel to dig deeper in hopes of finding the way out the answer is actually simple did the founders know of the bible did they feel our laws should be dependent on that bible it worked for over 200 years stop trying to fuck that up people ,2,atheism
Holiman,first while i do not consider myself an atheist its not your place to tell anyone what they call themselves second how can i argue a position until someone makes a claim unless your claiming every position of god is apologetic ,0,DebateReligion
Holiman,since so many self claimed atheists are unsure of the possibility of god and merely reject the arguments and concepts of god that they encounter what exactly would you have them prove would you expect them to argue every element of every belief at every encounter ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,well i reject christianity not just the nt but i would not care if the nt was actually historical fact the abrahamic god story itself is what i find repugnant god makes the world things go wrong and 1 3rd of his workforce rebel so god punishes them then or before god makes man and makes a perfect life and man his creation screws up so god punishes man so god makes new and harder rules and again man fails so god kills all but one family and starts over we have this same concept repeated an awful lot until god makes himself man and allows himself to be tortured and killed to overcome rules he made up that man couldnt follow just to create a loophole that allows child murderers to have eternal bliss upon conversion while good people who think this is a shitty system can have eternal punishment for finite crimes sorry shitty concepts of a shitty god ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,well answered,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,your argument is nature vs nurture in a nutshell i attempted to find a common ground with you before since i do not discredit the argument on its face however your conclusion here actually argues against your own position and show a level of dishonesty that you should really work to fix ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,i find it pretty easy to buy the multiple author concept it does seem the story changes in some noticeable ways if you find some subtle meaning and can read positive messages into this story i guess thats a good thing i read the story how it presents and find the character of god as represented to be repugnant however i was once a christian and felt differently then so perhaps perspective is the missing element ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,i never claimed to speak hebrew although i have heard several different variations as i said in my statement do you have a source you would care to present also i am not sure i agree with henotheistic but you are absolutely correct i used pantheistic when i should have said polytheistic which i think is actually more accurate ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,there are some strange religions out there https en wikipedia org wiki yazidis however i do not think the epicurus argument about the problem of evil is an argument against god so much as against worshiping one ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,you are so obviously reading into the text since no where does morality come up in the conversation let us recap god says have you tried job satan says no you have protections upon him then god removes the protections and allows satan to remove the blessings god has given unto job all of this is simply to show job will continue to worship god no where does it show job continuing to be morale all he does for the next 30 chapters is whine and defend himself from his friends accusations job attacks the view that he is a bad person sinner the only thing your left with at the end is god is more powerful and you just do not understand ,0,DebateReligion
Holiman,no to me none of that book is about morality lets pretend for a moment we agree that job does plead his case for him being a moral and upright man that does not matter god and satan both agree job is a good guy in the beginning so much so god brags to satan about that fact so being a good man grants you protections and blessings from god that he can and does remove at a whim in this case a bet the only reason given is that he is god and better than your and me that is the only shallow thing i see ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,well i am sorry but your wrong on every account a hero journey should have an entirely different structure no mentor no journey no obstacles overcome job is a flat character who actually learns nothing new and changes nothing he is a good man who does nothing wrong everyone attacks his character he defends himself repeatedly until god intervenes god questions job and by his response god rewards job job masters nothing and never changes and in the end learns nothing of value ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,if you do not mind me jumping in here you made a claim a fairly decent one actually so when someone engages you and challenges this claim the best response is to take your evidence in this case research and make your case instead you have resorted to an attack on your opponents views that adds nothing to the discussion if your goal is to debate someone and express a positive view of your position you really need to alter your approach ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,where are morals even discussed in that book how would torture prove morality if i am reading this in a shallow way please explain the interchange between god and satan as a matter of fact take the names god and satan out of the passages and read it without special pleading boss where you been lieutenant lieutenant checking out the job sight boss have you looked in on joe lieutenant nah he is your favorite of course he is doing right if you didnt protect him though boss go screw with him see how good he really is to me ,6,DebateReligion
Holiman,you make a valid point specifically i can think of no justifiable reason a god would do such a thing to prove loyalty ,4,DebateReligion
Holiman,we have characters in the story as you labeled job the protagonist in the beginning now label god satan lots friends and his wife this is some pretty basic stuff ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,how would you label the rest we have both stated our claims and come to very different answers so we should start at the beginning not keep repeating in our ideological differences ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,you have ignored my question entirely ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,lets start at the beginning it is a simple book to tear open actually you have a few major actors job god satan job friends and his wife now job i agree is the protagonist however how would you label the rest i would say satan only acts on god wishes his friends and wife also act to help job even if they are ultimately wrong or unhelpful ,0,DebateReligion
Holiman,thank you now that a discussion a couple points in this story isnt god the antagonist not the adversary another point is how did god bestowed greater blessings lets be honest other than materials what could god have given back surely not health family or the years of torture do you find the actions of god loving take out the spiritual and re think the story on a more realistic scale someone of great power decides to verify the loyalty of a minion by the most despicable of acts imaginable repeated over years when this minion is outraged but still loyal unto death angrily ask why they are reminded they are a minion to an all powerful overseer and have no right to question ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,if the story is about why do bad things happen to good people what could be more important than the ultimate question of why which it turns out is god wants to win a bet what exactly is the difference in those two points other than you prefer the later in the story god provides job no answers and is pissed off job even asks in this example a mob boss is the only comparison i can understand ,6,DebateReligion
Holiman,yes quite i am asking how you came to this insight seeing as how nothing i read in job conforms to your interpretation ,0,DebateReligion
Holiman,i would take another viewpoint if a persons worldview depends on a claim then attempting to alter that claim is tantamount to shattering a worldview there is large amounts of physiological explanations to explain why people hold unsupportable claims and beliefs and until the person is actually interested in the truth no amount of facts can change their minds consider conspiracy theorists in this same context ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,after reading job chapters 1 then 38 41 what other reason does it give ,0,DebateReligion
Holiman,you are skipping what to me are the biggest points the reason given is that god makes a bet creating a foundation for this story that is laughable if not so pathetic the end is that god is the ultimate might makes right argument people should worship god simply because he is god and can destroy your life by whim i agree with the rest of what you said though ,7,DebateReligion
Holiman,so might makes right god has power over you so worship him or pay the price great god you describe there i think i will just pass ,3,DebateReligion
Holiman,wow um by god is with us you mean god will torture us to win a bet ,-1,DebateReligion
Holiman,if i am wrong i apologize however i have read many of your posts and you have given me this impression ,3,DebateReligion
Holiman,well if your referring to the revelation stories since nations wage war against the antichrist i would say this is probably not true ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,do yourself a favor stop looking for proof that your assumptions are correct follow the evidence where it leads read the link and see what i am saying ,6,DebateReligion
Holiman,i found this response says alot to me http www academia edu 1480861 predicting atheism a test of the defective father hypothesis,3,DebateReligion
Holiman,i think showing the powers attributed to god in the bible would be a start if every knee bowed to him and every nation gave up sovereignty i would be very open to believing ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,empathy pure and simple if you wouldnt want to be treated poorly than do not treat others that way slavery is always about treating people poorly in case that is the ready response ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,if your interested take a look at the god el if you read the genesis chapter 1 in hebrew god is called elohim which is a pural form with many different interpretations some consider it a form of the god el which does makes sense considering the when and where of the writings let me add early judaism was pantheistic ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,i myself have never heard of your interpretation of dispensationalsim nor have i heard of covenantalism to the best of my understanding the second would simply be a form of the first although i will attempt to respond christian theology is a mixture of several concepts starting with the jewish tanakh with some differences the canonical gospels letters attributed to paul and the various letters that have survived over a millennium of re writings to be blunt its a mish mash of several different religions that do not actually flow well because of this people have offered literally thousands of interpretations to explain these discrepancies if you actually care about the why i would suggest researching the early church history starting 400 ad and how it the bible was formed and changed over the next 1000 years ending with martin luther ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,use the internet to recruit followers ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,if i was to say here there is no water in this pot would you respond with a negative to indicate water was indeed in the pot furthermore would a rational person who claimed there was indeed water in this pot not finish the comment with and there it is your definition is creating a negative in response to a negative hence again your stuck creating a positive claim that should require a burden of proof is this shit really that hard to understand ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,i would go further and say that jehovah witnesss who claim to be the only christians since the rest are wrong is also a scottsman fallacy i do agree that atheists cannot believe in a god and claim atheism though ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,yes absolutely there are 3 major religions all based on one abrahamic god there are thousands of factions and divisions among all 3 and even further schisms among those particular factions how on earth can you know if another person believes what they say except you take them at face value also you might wish to actually learn some things about jewish law since strict adherence is not always a requirement ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,some criticism of your post i hope you take seriously if your going to make an argument it helps to know if your argument is well known and documented as has been pointed out this is a version of kalam and you make no new points you actually go further only in opening yourself to a god of the gaps fallacy and an argument from ignorance i hope you do more research if you plan to present more in the future not to mention your atheist christian arguments seem to me like a straw man instead of an argument ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,first you should actually read the god of the gaps fallacy i make no supernatural claim i simply refuse to openly reject unknown claims without first exploring them this seems quite reasonable to me you continue to state i cannot have a position that is well established and reasonable yet you have not given an example how its wrong protagoras died long before the internet yet is claimed to have said as to the gods i have no means of knowing either that they exist or do not exist for many are the obstacles that impede knowledge both the obscurity of the question and the shortness of human life lastly your creating a false position i have not claimed uncertainty about everything i refuse to claim certainty about certain concepts spiritual for example but am willing to debate them and even reject others claims if they are proven untrue i will give my reasons for rejecting them the same as i expect people to give reasons for believing them ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,i could link some articles about how squid eyes developed but is that fun for either of us simple internet searches put this to rest my question would be why believe guidance for anything is required since guidance could not be proven ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,semantics aside lets use an example a short time ago physicists postulated the higgs boson particle which for years was considered unlikely this particle was even considered the god particle since its detractors considered it a god of the gaps answer so if i took a position i refer to as default that i do not accept this as an answer since they failed to prove it by your definition that position was not valid which is strange since this is exactly how science works and in fact the ones making the claim actually submitted lengthy papers for their postulates until experiments proved them true i am sure you can provide examples where a default position is invalid though yes a simple lack of belief in deities is reasonable if researched and found false or unacceptable since it does not preclude an unknown deity that might prove true once presented ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,can you give examples i for one would find that interesting to the best of my knowledge in scientific circles every attempt has failed ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,you entirely ignored my point i avoided the god question because i am not an atheist yet i share some points such as i accept the default position of disbelief in incredible claims that is not i believe that god does not exist the main part to me of the default position is the willingness to be convinced with evidence presented ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,this argument seems to be about etymology but it should have been about the burden of proof i myself have looked up hundreds of claims about psychics and found no evidence or proof to accept any of their claims i do not dis believe in psychic ability hence my interest in the subject but i do not accept any psychic claims when confronted with a psychic or claim the burden of proof is on the one making the claim right i am not expected to prove its impossible how is this any different ,4,DebateReligion
Holiman,i would honestly like to know if the op would use this same argument with non religious questions aliens bigfoot homeopathic drugs conspiracy theories if i take the position of any claim that seem unlikely requires proof or evidence must i prove them false first or cannot i take the position of disbelief until proof is given and then carefully consider that evidence ,5,DebateReligion
Holiman,i am not sure i understand your position are you implying no intermediary steps of evolution have benefit ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,not that i personally believe such nonsense but i have heard some new tactics on this ic argument they now insist that ic means that the item body part cannot function as it presently does if one thing was changed i have heard this about the flagellum and eye ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,yeah your right i do not understand at all and you failed utterly in giving an example of salvation in the ot both slavery in babylon and egypt occurred supposedly from israel falling away from god and his eventual release which the jewish people actually had to do for themselves both times so loving and faithful yeah whatever now how about actually answering my questions ,0,DebateReligion
Holiman,please provide examples of god as a salvation deity in the old testament as you imply as a matter of fact explain god with us since the ot biblical stories imply nothing of the sort the god of the ot was judgement fire and ultimate authority whose concept of forgiveness was remorse after drowning humanity by delivering them a rainbow ,0,DebateReligion
Holiman,monotheism was a rare concept around the time of jesus even judaism was rather pantheistic in nature before the messianic age in western rome the concept of a human god was anathema even after the times jesus was supposed to have lived greek legends had the children of gods as human until after death however some few hundred years before this alexander had conquered lands that included the persian empire where living human gods were common alexander later proclaimed himself a god which angered his men this lead to hellenstic mythology now caesar augustus was not worshiped as a god in the west however his spirit or will was divine and statues attest this fact so there you have the basis from these concepts now add the martyred god of which there are a great many examples in history also remember the deification of jesus is not so clear until well after the establishment of christianity in the fifth or sixth century ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,1 you have shifted the burden of proof from the claim there is a god and created a straw man the burden of proof belongs to the one making the claim the position of the atheist is rejection of the claim not what your implying here most atheists have listened carefully examined any evidence and simply rejected the theists position 2 god of the gaps and proves nothing 3 pascals wager is a known fallacy so um whats your point 4 5 see 2 i guess 6 your argument seems rambling this is to me the best argument feel free to respond to an old greek philosopher is god willing to prevent evil but not able then he is not omnipotent is he able but not willing then he is malevolent is he both able and willing then whence cometh evil is he neither able nor willing then why call him god epicurus,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,what do you lose your pride your confidence and your self respect i know too well living in the south surrounded by the religious how easy it is to hide behind the appearance of neutrality ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,i do not define god since i have no belief in one i make no claims about god other than i have no reason to believe one exists i do have problems with the concept of omni god which i define as omniscient omnipotent and omnipresent these concepts to me are silly ,3,DebateReligion
Holiman,i find this rather like special pleading if anything effects reality it can be studied by the scientific method if not then this becomes philosophical at best ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,the facts point towards anyone who believes in biblical literalism and inerrancy are either ignorant of history or simply irrational on this subject the religion predates the creation of the bible by centuries in even the most liberal of historical interpretations the religion was separate cults until founded by constantine and the bible was nothing like we know today until martin luther some one thousand years later i wont even get into the factual errors in the bible or inconsistencies that can be researched easily enough ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,i could never have explained my point about dna better than this last post very well said the other point i think that could have been added though is that dna alone does not determine how a living tree grows you have failed to take into account the myriad of other factors weather soil light etc your complexity argument does nothing to prove or enlighten anyone it is a simple god of the gaps fallacy ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,dna is not a code in the way your implying nor does it indicate how a tree grow complexity is proof of nothing ,3,DebateReligion
Holiman,i thought we liked science facts show overpopulation is indeed a huge issue look up any world organization and check into how overpopulation is destroying our environment you cannot prevent miscarriages really once again facts show modern medicine has reduced miscarriages greatly who knows what we will learn tomorrow abortion is not contraceptive i agree entirely it is however a persons legal choice to do with their body what they will ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,overpopulation effects of poverty on children not to mention science shows 15 to 20 of all pregnancies occur in miscarriage miscarriages are called spontaneous abortions until after the 20th week of pregnancy just to name a couple ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,you have avoided the question ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,so if a seven year old child needs a kidney you would force the parent to give up their body parts ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,i find your position interesting if i am wrong to derail the discussion i understand but wish to ask you another question since you mention both science and secular in your responses do you not accept their arguments against your position ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,what is your secular reason against abortion ,2,DebateReligion
Holiman,your response ignores your entire post i am glad we agree on the biological imperative now explain how belief in an afterlife changes this concept when humans are the only known species to have this belief system cockroaches and spiders are probably the best known survivors does this make their will to survive stronger than yours and mine belief in an afterlife has been tied to suicide and murder so i still do not accept that your argument holds true ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,i have problems with your concept the first being that evolution is somehow effected by any creatures ability to stay alive longer the biologic imperative is to live long enough to breed anything beyond that may or may not mean anything in an evolutionary sense i do not understand the difference in a weak or strong will to live i would need more information to understand exactly what your implying here i also have problems with the concept that a belief in an afterlife extends or improves life expectancy the concept of martyrdom alone seem to refute that concept ,1,DebateReligion
Holiman,theism is a lie it jumps beyond the question of if god exists to i know things about this god and allows for an entire range of false assumptions and dictates theism allows even a good person to do unspeakable horrible things in the name of this god and leads to less morality not more the questions of everyone agreeing with atheism to me is a non issue since atheism is simply a rejection of theistic claims nothing more a better concept is if everyone used critical thinking instead of fairy tales for the big decisions in life ,2,DebateReligion
