Bigly-Wrong,i recently did a study on the effects of the breakdown of nafta on the us economy in general the us economy is largely self sufficient the trade deficit was only about 5 of gdp the lack of trade barriers between the us and mexico did cause jobs in the manufacturing sector 851 000 to shift south due to the favorable wage rate no jobs were lost to canada 51 000 gain since 1994 during the time of nafta 1994 to present a total of 5 million jobs were lost in the manufacturing sector part of this is due to mexico but most to china and through automation in general it seems to me that establishing trade barriers will improve the us job situation and economy any trade deals should be bilateral and focussed on creating value for both sides currently many multiparty trade deals include developing economies and are essentially a sort of social program to benefit these countries at the expense of the us middle class the multinational corporations still benefit as well as thier shareholders although it may seem self centred the us would gain the most in jobs and gdp growth if they were more protectionist once these trade barriers are established it will force companies to maintain manufacturing jobs in the us and invest more locally in r d innovation one big thing president trump announced previously is his intent to have another corporate tax holiday for foreign held funds this will allow companies like apple to repatriate some of their 200 billion in cash at a reasonable tax rate they could use this to build automated factories in the us rather than china much like tesla and their new gigafactory president trumps initiatives are wise and will be effective ,3,The_Donald

Bigly-Wrong,1 sun tzu said raising a host of a hundred thousand men and marching them great distances entails heavy loss on the people and a drain on the resources of the state the daily expenditure will amount to a thousand ounces of silver there will be commotion at home and abroad and men will drop down exhausted on the highways as many as seven hundred thousand families will be impeded in their labor 2 hostile armies may face each other for years striving for the victory which is decided in a single day this being so to remain in ignorance of the enemy condition simply because one grudges the outlay of a hundred ounces of silver in honors and emoluments is the height of inhumanity 3 one who acts thus is no leader of men no present help to his sovereign no master of victory 4 thus what enables the wise sovereign and the good general to strike and conquer and achieve things beyond the reach of ordinary men is foreknowledge 5 now this foreknowledge cannot be elicited from spirits it cannot be obtained inductively from experience nor by any deductive calculation 6 knowledge of the enemy dispositions can only be obtained from other men 7 hence the use of spies of whom there are five classes 1 local spies 2 inward spies 3 converted spies 4 doomed spies 5 surviving spies 8 when these five kinds of spy are all at work none can discover the secret system this is called divine manipulation of the threads it is the sovereign most precious faculty 9 having local spies means employing the services of the inhabitants of a district 10 having inward spies making use of officials of the enemy 11 having converted spies getting hold of the enemy spies and using them for our own purposes 12 having doomed spies doing certain things openly for purposes of deception and allowing our spies to know of them and report them to the enemy 13 surviving spies finally are those who bring back news from the enemy camp 14 hence it is that which none in the whole army are more intimate relations to be maintained than with spies none should be more liberally rewarded in no other business should greater secrecy be preserved 15 spies cannot be usefully employed without a certain intuitive sagacity 16 they cannot be properly managed without benevolence and straightforwardness 17 without subtle ingenuity of mind one cannot make certain of the truth of their reports 18 be subtle be subtle and use your spies for every kind of business 19 if a secret piece of news is divulged by a spy before the time is ripe he must be put to death together with the man to whom the secret was told 20 whether the object be to crush an army to storm a city or to assassinate an individual it is always necessary to begin by finding out the names of the attendants the aides de camp and door keepers and sentries of the general in command our spies must be commissioned to ascertain these 21 the enemy spies who have come to spy on us must be sought out tempted with bribes led away and comfortably housed thus they will become converted spies and available for our service 22 it is through the information brought by the converted spy that we are able to acquire and employ local and inward spies 23 it is owing to his information again that we can cause the doomed spy to carry false tidings to the enemy 24 lastly it is by his information that the surviving spy can be used on appointed occasions 25 the end and aim of spying in all its five varieties is knowledge of the enemy and this knowledge can only be derived in the first instance from the converted spy hence it is essential that the converted spy be treated with the utmost liberality 26 of old the rise of the yin dynasty was due to i chih who had served under the hsia likewise the rise of the chou dynasty was due to lu ya who had served under the yin 27 hence it is only the enlightened ruler and the wise general who will use the highest intelligence of the army for purposes of spying and thereby they achieve great results spies are a most important element in water because on them depends an army ability to move,1,The_Donald
