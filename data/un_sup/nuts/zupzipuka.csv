zupzipuka, republicans have been anti climate change for decades but trump and the alt right are the only ones starting this rhetoric that does not make any sense you are saying that the party that denied climate change for decades would voluntarily remain in an agreement to take action on a thing they do not believe in he will get a version through that no other politician would have had the gall to propose has he indicated he has another version to get through talk leads to other countries believing you and the world economy reacting to it the world economy has not crashed yet are you from rt or breitbart look how clever you are no i was actually wondering because i cannot remember where i saw it you also have not responded to my earlier question about which country you think trump is going to go to war with that the other republicans would not ,1,politics
zupzipuka, when you view peace as the state where everyone is pointing their guns at each other and but no one is firing you have learned peace at an elementary level there is not any other kind of peace that is possible in this world you will never get rid of all the guns it not possible the other people in the stand off wo not disarm and even if you magically took away all the guns there is no way to be sure people are not hiding guns in their jacket which in this case is an entire country thinking you can have some no one has any guns peace is a fantasy mad is another word peace through war no it is peace through strength kim jong un hates america you know why he does not attack us because it would be suicide because we are stronger it is only a matter of time before someone as unstable as him gets nuclear weapons and for the safety of millions of innocent people we have to make sure that tinpot dictator will never use them it is impossible to monitor an entire country for weapons the only way to make sure they do not use them is for that dictator to know using the weapons would be suicide so he wo not press the button ,1,politics

zupzipuka, the government has the responsibility not to censor political speech they are not censoring you by blocking you on twitter they are not stopping you from speaking they are not stopping you from writing they are not stopping you from e mailing a million people what you want to say not to mention that it not even the government it one person on his private social media account that is textbook government censorship textbook government censorship is shutting down the internet and jailing political dissidents not blocking someone on twitter i realize these were both settled out of court so no precedent so no precedent ,1,politics
zupzipuka, you think pence would have gotten us out of paris yes he come out and said he does not care about climate change http thehill com policy energy environment 336070 pence for some reason climate change is a key issue for the left of course he would have and the republicans have all gone on tv defending that decision you think rubio would have signed an executive order banning muslims no but trump order has been blocked so it an irrelevant distinction you think bush wanted to start a trade war with china and the rest of the world trump has not started a trade war with china or with the rest of the world it all been talk so far and every time he had meetings with foreign leaders he toned down the rhetoric and jeb bush would probably have been in favor of free trade so it actually an issue i agree more with trump on this is not normal is that from colbert or john oliver ,1,politics
zupzipuka,sargon of akkad has a good video https www youtube com watch v xmc8ybq8usg on mutually assured destruction he explains the concept better than i can but let use your mexican stand off analogy every country in the world has some weapon of some kind ready to be pointed around we will say that nukes are an m16 while smaller countries without nukes have bb guns so the america and russia each have their m16s pointed at each other the reason no one shoots first is because they know if they do so they will be shot back it a nuclear deterrent judging by the way you describe nuclear weapons as a mexican stand off i am going to assume that you favor disarmament here the thing if the america lowers its weapon and russia does not there is nothing to stop russia from firing at the america because there will be no dire consequences or better yet both the america and russia lower their guns and trade them in for bb guns meanwhile north korea next door has been busy working and has built themselves an m16 what is to stop them from using it on us nothing we have to keep our m16 because it the only way to be sure other countries do not attack us as soon as they get their own m16 and it is a matter of when not if because technology is not regressing russia is not likely to nuke anyone and neither are we but other countries are going to continue making bigger and better weapons and the leaders of other countries wo not always be sane the only way to keep ourselves safe is to be equally or better armed if other countries know that attacking us is suicide for them they wo not attack us by having these weapons we are keeping the peace ,1,politics
zupzipuka,i am no blm fan but that a wilfull misunderstanding of what the phrase means when people go around holding up save the whales signs they are not saying fuck every other kind of animal they are just pointing out that there a specific problem regarding whales they want addressed you do not have to agree with them but there plenty of ways to criticize blm without wilfully misinterpreting their slogan ,7,TheRedPill
zupzipuka,you are correct unfortunately lower and middle classes subsidizing the poor while republicans cut taxes for their rich donors is pretty much the ideal scenario for them if we could just get the democrats to take their heads out of their own asses and start talking about that instead of russia we might actually make progress towards fixing it ,1,politics

zupzipuka,the irony here is that by keeping a low minimum wage and making workers rely on welfare republicans are essentially making the nanny state they claim to hate so much a necessity so people do not starve if we could get our economy to the point where businesses paid workers enough to live on we could actually get rid of a lot of our welfare expenses it like limiting access to contraceptives and then complaining that the abortion rate is rising gee who would a thunk it ,308,politics
zupzipuka,no there fucking is not the first amendment gives you the right to say whatever stupid shit you want it does not mean anyone else has to listen to you if you stand outside my house with a megaphone and i shut the window am i preventing you from speaking no not to mention that twitter is a private platform so the first amendment does not even apply to it the first amendment means the government cannot stop you from saying stuff but a private company can kick you out for whatever reason they want you can say he being a dick if you like but as another guy nicely put it being a dick is not illegal ,-6,politics
zupzipuka, the same way he does not give a fuck about what his team says about twitter or calling it a muslim ban or referring to mexicans as rapists yes but notice how all of these examples you have cited are not policy they are rhetoric trump does not give a shit about what he says but as far as policy goes he acted no differently than i would expect someone like marco rubio or jeb bush to in his position he appointed the same old insiders and signed what the republican congress has sent to him the only real policy initiative he taken that goes against the republican party is his travel ban and even that he could not do right i think trump would start wars that no other republican would can you name me a country or countries you think trump would go to war with that other republicans would not that makes sure they do not overstep again starting a lame duck war would not fly we invaded iraq in 2003 and still have troops there the america military is also involved in yemen somalia pakistan and afghanistan https foreignpolicy com 2013 05 03 how many wars is the america fighting right now and lately the trump administration has done airstrikes in syria if the republican base was capable of or had any desire to end foreign intervention they could have done so for any of these conflicts there no reason to believe they would act any differently in the future ,1,politics
zupzipuka, politicians are not talking about the things americans actually want they do not do the things they said they would do this has been the case since long before trump and will probably be the case long after our current government is not unique in this regard so there no reason to believe trump will have any extra effect 4 years of being ignored will kill the youth movement and grow the trump movement the party in power usually loses the presidency after four or eight years this is a long established trend in american politics 4 years of being ignored and having their conditions worsen is not going to lower turnout among people who dislike trump it will raise it if anything trump supporters are less likely to turn out because they will feel let down by the exaggerated promises he wo not be able to keep ,1,politics
zupzipuka,1 if you define rationality as simply acting in accord with your beliefs trump would also fit that definition he believes that the mainstream media is out to get him so he responds accordingly 2 pence does not have a vendetta against obama but the republican party of which he is a member does they have stated repeatedly for the past nine years that they want to undo everything obama has done there is no reason to believe that pence would not take the same steps trump is right now the republican party does not acknowledge climate change and have all come out against the paris accord mike pence would have pulled out of it as well you are correct that pence probably would not have done the immigration ban but since it been blocked in the courts it an irrelevant distinction anyways i do not know what you are referring to about policing so i cannot respond to that point 3 i do not know where the 30 40 number is from but let say that it right what group used to believe in the msm but does not anymore directly because of trump were republicans tuning in to msnbc every evening before the 2016 election the term fake news has come into popularity but americans trust in the msm was not all that great to begin with gallup polling http www gallup com poll 195542 americans trust mass media sinks new low aspx shows that from 2015 now it dropped about 8 it steeper than previous years but it was already on a downward trend and not all of that 8 is from trump either bernie sanders supporters complained furiously about the msm lack of coverage of his campaign and that almost certainly had an effect as well trump disregard for the truth is concerning but it not new to republican administrations see iraq 4 i do not disagree with this point i would just say that trump will add on to that unpopularity if he were to be nominated in 2020 it would be an unpopular man with an unpopular platform which i think could work greatly to the democrats advantage trump is bad we agree on that but i think you are letting your personal dislike of trump exaggerate the negative impact he having compared to your standard republican i do not want him in office to make a point but because it has the potential to end the republicans creeping takeover of government ,1,politics
zupzipuka, trump has said repeatedly that the nuclear option is on the table why would not it be the whole point of having nukes is that they are a deterrent to other countries because there is the threat of using them mutually assured destruction helps keep the peace he not calling for a first strike merely stating that they are on the table as they should be the narrative that trump is controlled by his staff is silly they have to take away his phone because he is on twitter too much he not going to coordinate a nuclear war in syria single handedly ,1,politics
zupzipuka,that is true ,1,politics
zupzipuka, america will be so turned off of politics that trump will likely win again why would american be turned off of politics if a deeply unpopular president is running for a second term more people will likely turn out to vote him out of office doubly so if the democratic candidate is popular ,1,politics
zupzipuka, pence would be a lame duck president and would not advance any of donald deeply unpopular agenda do you really think donald is the one behind all of the current goings on in the administration the man knows next to nothing about his job he signs what the republicans send him everything he railed against the republicans on he has not been able to do the immigration ban was blocked there is currently no progress on the wall the swamp has not been drained and he is making cuts to medicaid he also said he would get the america out of foreign wars but that not happening either i cannot think of a single policy trump has implemented that president mike pence would not implement too pence would also not start a war to earn votes trump is not going to single handedly start a war that the rest of the republicans are against any war that trump starts you can bet that pence would have started too it better for the republicans this way because trump can be the scapegoat if things go wrong wanting 3 5 more years of the twitter president is insane 3 5 more years of trump is essentially identical to 3 5 more years of mike pence it just that at the end of those years one of them is more likely to lose to a lefty it not insane it perfectly rational ,1,politics

zupzipuka,petty spite is not enough motivation for the man to launch a nuke i do not like him any more than you do but pretending he going to cause the end of the world just makes the left look stupid ,1,politics
zupzipuka, pence is not a vindictive small minded egotistical irrational child of a man i will remind you we are talking about mike refuse service to gays pence i will agree that he does not say nearly as much stupid shit as trump does but let not pretend like he some sort of rational thinker thus pence would not make it his mission to undo anything obama did that essentially been the republican platform for the last nine years pence would undo just as much if not more because he probably more informed on how to undo everything obama did he would not attack our institutions our freedom of the press our judicial system and our intelligence community in an effort to discredit destabilize and diminish our faith in all of the systems that hold our democracy up trump will attack anything and everything if the mood strikes him but this has little to no effect on actual america policy i agree mike pence would not behave so poorly but it not that big of a deal the republican agenda is plenty unpopular on its own even if pence were to put a pretty face on it the republican party agenda is quite unpopular and it the pretty face they put on it as well as the democrats incompetence that put them in control of all three branches of government i would argue that trump ridiculous antics make him easy to dislike and the unpopularity of his policies harder to conceal ,1,politics
zupzipuka,i am sure he would feel a tremendous sense of i told you so and would go on about it for days if not weeks or months but saying he would be ecstatic makes it sound like he pro terrorism and he just not there plenty of legitimate reasons to criticize trump but overextending just makes other people less likely to listen to those legitimate concerns ,1,politics
zupzipuka,undoubtedly my concern is that when liberals start saying stuff like trump is pro terrorism they make the entire left look bad ,2,politics
zupzipuka, north korea iran hell yeah what possible motivation could trump have for nuking either of those countries he has the world largest military at his dispoal and he is largely controlled by the other people in power around him he is not going to take a lone initiative and launch nukes at those countries because he has no reason to there certainly people cheerleading war with iran but no one with any influence in the white house is calling for nukes on iran the threat of trump launching nukes is essentially zero however much media outlets want to generate clicks with catchy headlines ,0,politics
zupzipuka,trump and mike pence will effectively implement the same policies as president trump stepping down will result in no change of policy except that now the president is not as dislikable if trump runs for office again in 2020 as disliked as he is that will make a democratic victory more likely what part of that is insane ,1,politics
zupzipuka,trump massive unpopularity is exactly why the left should want him to stay in office having trump run in 2020 will essentially guarantee any democratic candidate who is not complete shit winning the presidency ,-1,politics
zupzipuka,having trump in office is a gift to the left in america mike pence will just put a nice face on all of the awful shit trump administration is already doing and what do you think trump is going to do nuke europe he does not press the button himself there thousands of people around him that would never let that happen ,-1,politics
