Haurboss,i went to wshh because its the 1 black owned website on earth its a pretty good place to see what young black americans think about certain subjects considering i have used that website off and on for nearly a decade i have seen how the users react to various racist things the double standard they showed was scary by most of them agreeing this was not a big deal when i have seen hundreds of more minor incidents where they flipped shit and yeah the black population needs to understand that they would have more power in the country if they did not support democrats nearly 100 if democratic leaders seen a decent portion of black voters voting third party or republican then democrats would actually have to help the black community for once by fixing up black majority cities instead of just preaching the same republicans are racist so you must vote for us bs ,3,The_Donald

Haurboss,kelly anne conway saying talking with russia is a good thing is not the same thing as saying kushner sought secret back channel with russia and as the article points out back channels between super powers is not out of the ordinary russia wanted a back channel to discuss one thing syria until you can provide evidence otherwise then you are spreading fake news,-61,politics

Haurboss, the msm never covered it hence why i said underground news only 3rd tier news agencies and popular right wing twitter people covered it ,1,The_Donald

Haurboss,1 brandon jacobs 2 brandon jacobs 3 brandon jacobs,1,CFB
Haurboss,he was one of the worst verified twitter shills in trumps replies he would show up to basically any right wing twitter user who was in the spotlight always getting the top spot in the comments for example he was pushing the hashtag firehannity a few days ago he would also run polls in his twitter feed about trump him and his brainwashed followers would vote in them and bash trump acting as if his liberal echo chamber poll results showed 80 of people hated trump that it must be true kind of pathetic one time trump supporters brigaded his polls in a show of support and he quickly buried them just a faggot all around,26,The_Donald
Haurboss,fuck yeah he was easily one of the top two worst verified twitter shills i heard trump blocked a few of the people who are always at the top of his twitter feed so i wonder if that the reason he deleted this account guess we will see if he makes a new one to troll with,32,The_Donald
Haurboss,mental illness oozes from that post leftists are becoming so extreme that they dont even tolerate moderate left views 1 we do not buy excessive amounts of reddit gold its actually quite the opposite 2 we are not alt right or at least the majority of the sub is not 3 most importantly reddit hates our fucking guts these fucking idiots actually think reddit is on our side wtf 4 suggesting reddit admins and their families need to be beaten because right wing views are allowed here is insane ,12,The_Donald
Haurboss,ugh i am getting pissed reading about all these people being murdered by democratic leaders this murder was clearly meant to send a sign to anyone thinking about trying to bring these democratic criminals to justice that they will kill you and get away with it smh sickening ,4,The_Donald
Haurboss,i hate how the republican party has been stacking candidates in recent elections too many candidates just divides the party ,3,The_Donald
Haurboss,maybe put quotes around steal meaning the fbi left these guns in their car unlocked so the assassins could come and get them and use them to kill seth with if a person used an officers gun in a shooting you would not have to worry about said murder weapon being found and tied back to belonging to the assassins it would just be one less way the murderers could be tracked down thats just my guess i have not looked into the stolen firearms op is talking about this would not be a stretch considering its already extremely odd that the fbi swooped in and obtained seths laptop information so quick ,6,The_Donald
Haurboss,no more suspicious bulges in the pants of our first lady ,35,The_Donald
Haurboss,he was the podesta group received 170 000 from a russian bank to lobby to end sanctions this was underground news months ago isnt it funny how its proven that hillarys future secretary of state john podestas brother was accepting money from russian banks to lift sanctions yet hillary and john podesta accuse trump of colluding with russia to lift sanctions and theres all these stories about russian banks and kushner trump its kind of freaky how much projecting they do,54,The_Donald
Haurboss, san diego 7 4 11 1 11 1 stanford 4 8 5 7 8 5 12 1 orange bowl win san francisco 13 3 11 4 1 nfc champions 12 4 michigan 10 3 citrus bowl win 10 3 most players drafted into the nfl yeah he totally does not know what he doing lets just ignore that his entire career hes taken over struggling programs and eventually led all of them to high levels of success i mean he turned stanford stanford into a powerhouse college football team san francisco had not been in the playoffs since 2003 until harbaugh took over they had not been in an nfc championship since the early 90s all of a sudden harbaugh shows up and they become one of the best teams in the nfl and go to the super bowl and since harbaugh left san fran well they were 2 14 last year this is not even taking into account he was a college and nfl quarterback which just adds to his experience brandon jacobs is a fucking moron,490,CFB
Haurboss,i wish wikileaks would just tell us if seth was the leaker or not were over here looking for evidence that could potentially bring down the dnc media and intelligence agencies so its kind of gone beyond i need to protect muh dead sources shit,3,The_Donald
Haurboss,not this cringey shit i see this i wanna be part of history shit all the time in those breaking evidence trump colluded with russia posts in politics,2,The_Donald
Haurboss, if the msm hops all over this document then just know its a set up to try to discredit us it will be a good sign someone fed this fake document to biggs knowing we would get hyped and then they could come crashing in with proof its not real in an attempt to discredit everything this happened a lot with pizzagate we cant stop the hype so hopefully its real,10,The_Donald
Haurboss,but if it was fake why would they leave us a means to prove its fake if you were trying to pass a fake document you would not leave a code on the bottom for everyone to quickly be able to figure out if its a fake unless you were purposefully trying to get us hyped up only to then later on be able to find out its not real ,26,The_Donald
Haurboss,if verified then this story blows the fuck up we need this to be verified some fucking how ,10,The_Donald
Haurboss,just to be technical it would only end the debate in terms of whether a robbery occurred or not it would not end the seth rich debate as a whole though the dnc could have hired two goons that shot him and then ran his pockets to make sure he did not have any important information on his person and then ran off hypothetically it still could be an assassination even if they stole something from him and seth said he was robbed laying there dying seth very well could have said he was robbed ,7,The_Donald
Haurboss,which is pretty sad because obviously reporters rely almost entirely on their sources contacts but the current media has destroyed any and all trust they had with a large amount of americans we now have to assume the media is lying unless they show us evidence to back their claims after the 1 000th time over 5 months you tell me your anonymous sources confirm trump colluded with russia yet you still have not provided any evidence i am going to have to say you are making shit up or you need to find new sources,3,The_Donald
Haurboss,i am sure press secs will need to be rotated out often it cant be healthy having to deal with the press the way spicer has had to deal with it for past press secretaries like under obama it was a walk in the park almost like the reporters were your friends asking simple questions with trump its a full on assault every single day too much stress for one man,21,The_Donald
Haurboss,i am not going to wish that job on hannity who would want to deal with a room full of people attacking you everyday trying to get you to slip up and say the wrong thing so they can end your career ,6,The_Donald
Haurboss,well to be honest msu is not a very very good program its like saying baylor is a very good program because they had a few good years the only reason they were good for a few years was because of their defensive coordinator pat narduzzi who they let walk to pittsburgh right once he left msu was doomed they had a few good years of success they are not like michigan alabama oklahoma texas ohio state good in terms of programs history mid tier program at best it was only a matter of time before they came back down ,10,CFB

Haurboss,right you should have known better than to think everyone here are idiots who think islam is a religion of peace and not a death cult maybe if you just cover your eyes and act like the middle east and muslim african countries do not exist then islam wont seem that bad ,1,AskReddit
Haurboss,sorry if the truth offends you ,3,AskReddit
Haurboss,exactly i cant believe my eyes i am actually seeing someone state isis is true islam i have been saying that for so long killing non believers is what the quran directs muslims to do islam is basically about trying to take over the world in the name of allah and spread his message that what muhammad was doing before he died that what the holy war isis is fighting is about i am so sick of this false liberal narrative that islam is about peace when its the exact opposite the only peaceful verses in the quran are directed at other muslims for non believers its everything but peace,2,AskReddit
Haurboss,islam at its base is pretty barbaric its the reason the middle east is still stuck in the age of stonings beheadings treating women the same as animals religious killings nonstop and throwing gays off rooftops ironically i am guessing you are the one with ridiculous false presumptions about islam if you think its a normal religion ,1,AskReddit
Haurboss,definitely this is like the faggots using pictures labeled shareblue image 264 the comment is labeled you which means whoever took the screenshot is the person who typed the comment i highly doubt a dnc operative took the screenshot and spread it around,12,The_Donald
Haurboss,but why are the comments labeled you only the person calling seth a heroin user would have been able to capture this screen shot since the you is ther indicating its their comment looks like its a troll acting like a shill which happens pretty often on 4chan,6,The_Donald

Haurboss,i would prefer if we did not underestimate hillary or anyone who runs against trump in 2020 that exactly what democrats did with trump they got complacent they felt like they had it in the bag everyone told them hillary was going to mop the floor with trump and then they got their ass kicked because of it trump will certainly have to lift a finger no matter who he up against the media attacks come 2020 are going to be insane if you think its bad now just wait we need to keep the underdog mentality and quite frankly we still are the underdogs its pretty much us against the world,40,The_Donald
Haurboss,you just know she wants to come back in 2020 and shes trying to test the waters to see how the democratic voter base reacts to her why cant she just go away its like shes a fucking evil robot politician that does not know any other way to live life besides trying to scam people out of money and try to win the presidency just retire and enjoy all that money you scammed out of people you evil cunt,6,The_Donald
Haurboss,for sure this is important i am enjoying it too much seeing democrats become demoralized with each election loss they would become way too cocky if a democrat won newt gingrichs district osoff is a major soros stooge too,3,The_Donald
Haurboss,i highly doubt hannity is basing his entire stance on kimdotcom i mean we believed seth was murdered by the dnc long before kim came along why could not hannity have believed it too without kims claim to have evidence also hannity could have easily been fooled by kimdotcom thinking since he is connected to snowden and assange that he must be credible hannity could have made a mistake everyone makes mistakes i refuse to trust kimdotcom after he said he had hillarys 30k emails and then when it came time to drop he told us to ask the nsa for them he does not deserve our trust he needs to earn it now after that bs hannity sees the russian dnc hacking story stinks he sees seth richs murder stinks so he looking into it simple as that ill gladly eat my words if kim provides evidence seth was the leaker but he wont ,3,The_Donald
Haurboss,you should sign it its not kims petition but yeah it is kind of odd that kimdotcom is pushing a petition for seths murder to be investigated when kim claims to have damning evidence that could blow the case open if he really wants this investigated why would not he release his evidence he claims to have he does not have shit ,5,The_Donald
Haurboss,what the fuck are you talking about we have tens of thousands of signatures why stop now it does not hurt anybody to take 1 minute to sign it if it brings more awareness to the murder then great if not then oh well nothing is lost i am going to doubt george soros runs the white house petition site attached to whitehouse gov please provide proof ,10,The_Donald

Haurboss,this is fucking it is this fucking it i think this is it in this labeled opinion piece the author was told by someone who says that mike rogers allegedly said that russian officials talked to members of trumps campaign how much more solid evidence do we need than that wives have been stoned to death in the middle east for less evidence than that open and shut case good work guys gals its dolphinkins etc ,1,politics
Haurboss,the only mentally ill group in america are american liberal sjws they are completely detached from reality they love censorship the way they want to control how everyone thinks and speaks and the way they are fine with the cia being able to hack into our tvs is eerily similar to orwells 1984 i have no doubt they would back the idea of thought police in the us they see nothing wrong with allowing in as many people as possible from shit countries because they think they will come here and magically become normal they do not see how dangerous islam is they trust the government the media and intelligence agencies 100 its legitimately troubling how much control the media has over the minds of liberals they want to disarm americans which would give the government a scary amount of control over us ,15,The_Donald

Haurboss,leftists now label every candidate they do not like as far right its because the left wing media started doing it and being the brainwashed idiots they are they follow suit ,-14,politics
Haurboss,nice example of one of the many reasons why trump won labeling trump as just a reality tv star when he an international businessman with 40 years of experience who was so successful he became a billionaire is about as big of an underestimation as one could make keep underestimating him i mean after all he just a mere reality tv show host took on the worlds media the deep state and all of the most experienced politicians in the us and won in a landslide ,-36,politics

Haurboss,do democrats ever get tired of losing i mean the house is republican the senate is republican the presidency is republican the supreme court is conservative leaning democrats have the least power in the us government than they have had in over 80 years democratic party needs to be checked into hospice you guys spam articles about some russian conspiracy all day long hoping it somehow leads to trumps impeachment but really its just making you guys look bad its making your media look bad for pushing it non stop y all are too detached from reality you guys need to realize this whole sjw super progressive everyone who does not agree with me is russian hitler shit is not a winning formula ,-16,politics

Haurboss,trump played boss of nato today as he should the us provides 22 of natos funding which is far more than any singular country only 5 nato members out of 28 pay at least the minimum agreed upon that unacceptable and only an idiot would defend those 23 countries for not paying their agreed upon amounts american taxpayers are basically subsidizing europes defense because they would rather spend their money on refugees and socialism the us does not need nato nato dies without the us they need to pay up or we need to let nato die https www youtube com watch v 2cm8su bbmw,-33,politics
Haurboss,no leftists defending nato members not paying their minimum amount that was agreed upon is embarrassing we pay 22 of nato funding yet get barely anything in return while these countries get the backing of the most powerful military in the world for practically nothing finally we have a president who is not a fucking pussy and willing to tell all those smug leftists asshole leaders to contribute to their own fucking defense a little instead of spending everything on refugees and socialist practices,-56,politics
Haurboss, they are supposed to be a team if you wanna talk about being team players then how about you tell everyone else in nato to start fucking paying their fair shares the us funds like 22 of nato while countries like germany and canada do not even meet their minimum requirement of 2 gdp this is not a team which is why trump is threatening to pull out of nato if these countries do not start paying the amounts they agreed upon,-3,cringepics

Haurboss,jared looks like the fucking slender man on the topic of religion trumps obviously a christian man and pretty much all of his family bloodline is christian i find it funny how the shills on pol try to push the idea that he somehow jewish or secretly a pawn of jewish elite in an attempt to get pol to stop supporting him ,4,The_Donald
Haurboss,not sure what to make of this 1 you can buy the exact dc badge for like 30 40 bucks on ebay 30 bucks to have unlimited larping trolling power over pol would definitely be worth it for some 2 he tries to hide his identity by not showing his full badge which is understandable but at the same time he could also be hiding the bottom portion of his badge because it may say retired on it right below in the area he cut off this could mean he is retired and would not have knowledge of this case or that the badge was bought off ebay for cheap as there are numerous retired dc police badges for sale there 3 if he trying to hide his identity he is going about it sloppily he says he will check the seth rich file tomorrow but then he says ill need to sign for it if dc police sees this post on 4chan then all theyd have to do to catch him is see who signs out seths files not totally buying it or at least i am not buying this cops act that hes a good guy sincerely asking questions about how he can help this could very well be damage control trying to give off the impression like the dc police honestly thought it was a botched robbery but they will look more into it just for you guys if the dnc and police chief have gone this far to cover up the murder by hacking seths old accounts and having the entire media attacking anyone who tries to investigate the murder then theres no doubt they could try to put on some charades in pol after all pol is definitely leading the online investigation so if they were to try to stifle it then pol would be a great start ,37,The_Donald
Haurboss,i like when insiders do not actually give any additional new information they just tell us that were close its awfully convenient to tell us to look into donna brazille right after it comes out she threatened people to stop investigating i do not believe this i mean if you really were an insider would you stick your neck out just to tell some people hey youre close just keep digging or would you actually try to help them by giving out previously unknown information yea you would give them actual information not a pat on the back,4,The_Donald
Haurboss,yup exactly bush john mccain obama clintons etc are all on the same side once you realize that a lot more things start to make sense its the illusion of choice trump was the first outsider that broke their little game which is why republican leaders democrats and the media all flipped shit when he won its why the msm is still pushing for his impeachment with literally no evidence its why the deep state cia fbi is going after him he not supposed to be there this is why the dnc rigged the primaries against bernie because hillary was the chosen one from their elite little group the people wanted bernie but they forced hillary in there ,4,AskReddit

Haurboss,see that where you are wrong establishment republicans and democrats are on the same side they would have loved hillary john mccain paul ryan lindsay graham are all just corrupt politicians in the same boat as hilldawg plus all this impeachment nonsense is being caused by the media the media would have treated hillary better than obama and acted like her entire presidency was the best thing to ever happen to the world as opposed to how they treat trump and push a fake russian conspiracy hoping it somehow magically leads to him being impeached we would not even be hearing the term impeachment right now,0,AskReddit

Haurboss,sick of fox news trying to act like they are a dependable right leaning news source anytime a story is pushed that could be detrimental to the democratic party fox backs off basically even the right leaning news sources are controlled by leftists because all leftists have to do to control the narrative is threaten to pull out funding anytime fox starts to cover a story they do not like ,53,The_Donald

Haurboss,is it legate that dudes such a faggot he used to be at the top of trumps tweets i am not sure theres anyone i find more pathetic than the professional twitter losers who feel like their opinion matters more than others,55,The_Donald
Haurboss,but wait if trump has been colluding with russia to win the election like the media and leftists have been crying about for months then why would top russian officials discuss how to influence trump aides why would they need to influence aides if trump himself is on their team which one is it trump colluded with russia and needs to be impeached or russia tried to influence trumps aides the lying fake news media cant even keep their lies straight and brainwashed democrats just believe whatever bs they publish,-6,politics
Haurboss,americas current journalistic landscape is cancer but its certainly not because of hannity its because of the 24 7 trump hate fest that the left wing media is engaged in its fucking cancer if they are not using unverifiable sources to claim the president is committing treason and never providing evidence to support their claims they are making mountains out of mole hills with whatever trump does donald trump slams voting rights for felons wants gop to court black voters trump gets 2 scoops of ice cream while everyone else gets 1 trump eats chicken with a fork why is not melania holding trumps hand donald trumps wrong mexicans are not going to rape you hillary surrogate says trump s schlong remark was really about calling obama a black rapist ben carson is fine with donald trump calling him a child molester but not because trump offered him a job donald trump just literally made the republican race about his penis oh yeah its defintely hannity that is making american journalism cancerous and not liberals ,0,politics
Haurboss,he does not care he knows the dnc russian hacking story is complete bs he going after the truth and he not going to be intimidated away from digging into seth richs incredibly suspicious murder that democrats and the dnc just want to sweep under the rug theres absolutely nothing normal about how the dnc handled server email leak incident and theres certainly nothing normal about seth riches murder ,1,politics
Haurboss,actually trump is estimated to have a 160ish iq which puts him in the top 1 of the world labeling someone stupid because you disagree with them is pretty childish you do not become a billionaire by being dumb as rocks you do not overcome practically the entire worlds media and beat out 10 of the most expierenced politicians in the us by being dumb as rocks please keep underestimating donald trump that exactly why he is the potus right now,-4,politics
Haurboss,not surprising considering twitter and shareblue work together and twitter will verify anyone shareblue asks them to not surprising considering twitter most likely gave control of seths panda account to some damage control dnc operative twitter was also banning people for pizzagate posts twitter higher ups are fucking scum ,6,The_Donald
Haurboss,this is great because that racist ass anti white mohammed guy started all of this by trying to rag on her for only having 20 followers,39,The_Donald
Haurboss,theory seths panda twitter account was hijacked with the help of twitter themselves his panda account laid dormant since the time of his death no activity at all then yesterday someone went into r sanders4president and wrote out a long post explaining it was their account not seths since then there has been some activity on the account for the first time in nearly a year if you can remember there was leaked communications between david brock shareblue and another person in which david brock told this guy he could get any twitter account verified that he needed verified this means david brock and shareblue have connections with twitter higher ups would not be surprised if david brock was granted access to seths account by twitter,23,The_Donald

Haurboss,yeah i am going to say this behavior should be against the rules but for some reason i have a feeling reddit is encouraging this if not completely behind it they also have lists of the donald users that we seen used when the donald was shut down temporarily many people were automatically banned from r twoxchromosomes for no reason when td went down i was banned and i have never even commented in there they must of had some sort of list they used to mass ban people because they thought we would trickle into that shithole for some reason ,6,The_Donald

Haurboss,because he that much of a baller that even with his low weight he still highly rated by the likes of 247 and scout he was a 3 star like a month ago then he showed out at some camps and got a bump to a 4 star 247 has him as the 86 player overall so obviously hes very talented he will have an even better rating once espn and rivals evaluate him theres nothing wrong with his weight he a junior in highschool weighing 260lbs he can get up to 270 275 by the end of his senior season and then bulk up with college s c,2,CFB
Haurboss,kimdotcom is full of shit he is full of shit because he saying the only way he will deliver the evidence is if the us allows him safe passage in and out of the us that will never happen kim is wanted in the us for money laundering and racketeering the us is currently trying to extradite him to the us they are not going to allow his ass to step foot in the us without arresting him he might as well be saying ill only show you evidence seth was the leaker if you fly me to the moon because theres the same chance that happens as there is of the us letting him onto us soil if kimdotcom really had evidence and he doesnt want to post it online and he isnt allowed to hand deliver it himself why would not he give it to someone else to deliver or maybe set up a video conference with the proper authorities there so many more logical ways to hand over evidence than this spectacle that kim is putting on ,11,The_Donald
Haurboss,for the record jalen says he 260 right now on mgblog they did a piece on lineman greg frey recruited that relate to mayfield size wise mayfield is exactly the type frey likes and develops into beasts frey recruited taylor lewan 6 7 275 entering college and patrick omameh 6 6 265 and helped turn them into nfl players then did the same with jason spriggs 6 7 270 at indiana jalen can put on 10 15 pounds by the end of his senior year they also said his dad is a big guy so he will fill out ,7,CFB
Haurboss,because rivals is not even trying anymore guess itll be fun to see how far he jumps in the ratings once they actually evaluate him instead of probably just judging him by his low weight ,5,CFB
Haurboss,this is an interesting recruit 247 has him pegged as a top100 recruit and the 1 player in the state of michigan but espn and rivals have not really evaluated him yet so they have him as a 3 star espn and rivals laziness of not evaluating him properly is dragging down his rating big time once they actually grade him and they surely will now since he committed to michigan his rating is sure to skyrocket probably have a 92 95 rating once they do which would be insane because he was like an 81 only a month or so ago,4,CFB
Haurboss,hmmmm lets see maybe because kimdotcom did not show he even had any evidence at all today the day he was supposed to drop a bombshell on all of us if kim had given hannity evidence then i am puuuurrrrrtttyy sure he would have showed us some of it so he could avoid the massive shitstorm he is experiencing right now i am not sure why anyone is defending kim kim does not deserve our trust after him lying about having hillarys emails he has to earn back our trust what kim pulled today hurts the credibility of our investigation when you have a ton of skeptical people and then you have a big name like kim saying he going to drop huge evidence and then he does not drop any evidence it makes it seem to the general public that there is not any right now it sure is seeming like kimdotcom royally fucked hannity it caused fox to retract the story and now hannity is under the most fire he ever been,4,The_Donald
Haurboss,all im saying is if hannity is fired him and o are illy should create their own network they would kill fox hannity has a net worth of 80 million so he fine no matter what happens,35,The_Donald
Haurboss,i do not think the dnc henchmen could murder hannitys kids at the moment that would draw way too much attention to the case only newscaster who talks about seth rich possibly being murdered by the dnc had his kids killed today after numerous threats this would force a real investigation to happen ,2,The_Donald
Haurboss,i do not understand why the rich family is so opposed to hannity discussing seths murder the only conclusion i can think of is that his parents are your typical brainwashed democrats who believe the left wing media when they claim its crazy to think seth was killed for political reasons they also probably do not understand what wikileaks is all most people know about wikileaks is what they may have heard on the news recently which is that wikileaks is an arm of the russian government so his parents think its bad if their son was leaking to them it just does not make sense why they are so upset that hannity is talking about this so strange everything about this case is fucked,1,The_Donald
Haurboss,just think what will happen when muslims have a strong population and the police officers are not white itll be a bloodbath,13,The_Donald
Haurboss,seth rich had a reddit account it was u megrimlock4 in one of his comments he was posting about his parents dog that had run away in omaha nebraska he was in dc so he asked anybody with information to email him and he listed his gmail account which was something like sethrich gmail com it had his name in the email so it confirmed it was his account somebody went in and deleted that comment but not before everyone had seen it this is where people got his email address from so ya know like when you lose your password they send you a text to the number you attached to the account yeah well people on 4chan were trying to brute force his account and it showed the original number attached everytime they got the password wrong but then when they were trying at a later time the number that was showing up had changed so somebody had to have logged on and changed it somebody has been logging into his accounts and changing things and now with this post we see someone trying to claim one of his old accounts its clearly damage control and trying to stifle the online investigation its creepy as hell and very telling that something is not right here ,8,SandersForPresident
Haurboss,so was seths confirmed reddit account and his email account something extremely fishy is going on here,10,SandersForPresident
Haurboss,of course op wont be replying whoever this damage control person is taking control of seths accounts just took all this time to think and plan out this long winded post probably checked over it 10 times to make sure its as rock solid as can be they are doing what a lawyer would advise a client to do do not say anymore than you have to say so you do not fuck up and say the wrong thing if op were to start replying to comments and he says something that contradicts his past comments then he fucked so he just staying silent if this was my panda account i would be joking around in the comments with people or at least replying because it would be pretty funny interesting to have your old inactive account become involved in a murder investigation,35,SandersForPresident
Haurboss,they are now editing and manning a dead guys accounts they are in full on damage control mode they got fox news to retract the story but fucking patriot sean hannity wont budge its great to have people like him with a voice on our side for once ,1,The_Donald
Haurboss,its definitely damage control they are trying their hardest to silence this investigation all of his accounts being edited all of a sudden is creepy as hell,24,SandersForPresident
Haurboss,oh lmfao you actually think the us is going to give kim safe passage into and out of the us so he can deliver evidence even though the us is currently trying to extradite him on charges of money laundering and racketeering hahahahahaha see that why kims statement is bs he knows the us will never allow him to step foot in the country without arresting him which means he will never have to hold good on the promise of delivering evidence why did not he offer to give the evidence to someone else he trusts to deliver it hm because he does not fucking have it,2,The_Donald
Haurboss,i know hannitys tweeting about it he knows somethings not right with the russian hacking story and seths death if he using kim as a sole source for information then he making a mistake i am sure he not though i am sure hannity has reviewed all of the real evidence of this cover up to base his reporting on kim needed to give us something anything to prove he has evidence he could not do that he did not give us anything do you understand kims statement hurt our investigation do you understand that people are already skeptical if seths murder is really being covered up to have a big name like kim say hes dropping a bomb on tuesday and then not releasing anything hurts the stories crediblity i am sick of bullshit people like david seaman and kimdotcom hijacking movements for their own benefit and fucking larping,3,The_Donald
Haurboss,because kim does this shit all the fucking time i read fat fucks article and guess what it was nothing please point me to any shred of evidence he contributed to the discussion he just fucked over hannity now fox is posting articles saying they retract the story and shit remember him saying he had hillarys emails and then when the time came to drop them he said ask the nsa they have her emails he is a conman it does not help to have a fraud as the face of our movement this is reminsent of crazy ass david seaman being the face of pizzagate continously saying arrests are happening and then nothing happening,2,The_Donald
Haurboss,so you are saying all these new subscribers arent trump supporters you do not believe that this sub could add a bunch of supporters after a huge burst of publicity with the blackout i would prefer to believe they are trump supporters that found out about the sub instead of just an army of 10 000 shill accounts ,1,The_Donald
Haurboss,i am not a concern troll and i know kimdotcom is full of shit he did not provide a single piece of evidence he built up this huge bombshell date that he was going to reveal evidence that seth was the leaker and then he failed to release any evidence he no better than the liberals constantly claiming trump colluded with russia yet never providing evidence to back their claim you see kim would be given a chance to prove himself had he not already pulled this same exact stunt saying he had hillarys emails and then just telling us to ask the nsa for them hannitys great for covering the story but he needs to distance himself for kim ,5,The_Donald
Haurboss,smh i do not buy kimdotcom for a fucking second he conveniently uses the nickname panda long after its been discovered seth used that nickname he provided literally no proof and the terms in which he said he would provide proof will never be met as the us is not going to grant safe passage to someone that they are already trying to extradite on charges of money laundering and racketeering ,11,The_Donald
Haurboss,dissappointed so many people are buying kims bullshit believing kim when he is providing no actual evidence is no better than leftists believing cnn saying they have proof of russian collusion for the 1000th time yet never showing the proof ,4,The_Donald
Haurboss,jesus you are so gullible the us is never going to agree to this the us already wants to extradite him for current charges due to the fact the us is never going to agree to allow kim on us soil without being arrested it means kim is never going to have to show any evidence its that simple he lied before about having hillarys emails and hes lying again ,2,The_Donald
Haurboss,lol you actually believe that load of bullshit even after he fucking lied about having hillarys emails and then told us to ask the nsa for them he might as well have said hey if you fly me to the moon ill show you proof of seth rich being the leaker because theres no fucking way they are going to grant him safe passage to and from the us the us is currently trying to extradite kim on charges of racketeering and money laundering he knows for a fact they are not going to fucking allow him to waltz onto us soil and then fly away back to nz which means he is never going to actually have to hold good on this promise of having evidence ,12,The_Donald
Haurboss,concern trolling bruh everyone here should be pissed and skeptical about this especially considering kims past history of being full of shit not only did he not release a single shred of proof but hes making hannity look bad ,2,The_Donald
Haurboss,what will that even accomplish he clearly does not actually have anything if anything that will hurt our case having this fat fuck going on hannity with no evidence the us is actively trying to extradite kim to the us to bring him up on charges of racketeering and money laundering they are not going to agree to let him on us soil without being arrested therefore he is never going to have to hold good on his promise of having evidence of seth being the leaker he a fucking conman,56,The_Donald
Haurboss,no actually its nothing but a load of bullshit this is no better than leftists saying they have proof of russian collusion but never showing you the actual proof,15,The_Donald
Haurboss,annnnnd it fucking nothing kimdotcom is a conman he now has zero credibility i thought that since wikileaks tweeted about kims upcoming revelations that maybe they were true but i guess wikileaks was tricked too he knows there is no way he is going to be granted safe passage to and from the us which means he is never going to have hold good on his promise of delivering evidence its like saying hey if you take me to the moon ill show you proof seth rich was the leaker but only if you fly me to the moon ,12,The_Donald
Haurboss,surprise surprise its fucking nothing,8,The_Donald
Haurboss,yup he never going to be given guaranteed safe passage into the us by mueller which means he knows he never going to actually have to hold good on the promise of having evidence that seth was the leaker if he had fucking evidence he would post fat fucking piece of shit,3,The_Donald
Haurboss,fucking kimdotcom never should he be trusted again ,3,The_Donald

Haurboss,it was not the terror attack in russia that caused this sub to slow their roll on susan rice we would not have allowed a terror attack in russia that barely got any media coverage to distract us like that i cant remember exactly what happened that caused us to stop but yeah we definitely did not push susan rice story as long and as hard as we should have cant make that same mistake with seth hopefully kimdotcom is not lying and drops a bombshell tommorrow,7,The_Donald

Haurboss,in the open senate hearing with the nsa and the fbi comey was asked if he reviewed the dnc servers he said no but he said something like he seen enough evidence to know that it was russia who hacked them ,1,The_Donald
Haurboss,its because in that open committee hearing with rogers and comey comey said they did not need to examine the dnc servers directly because they have other ways to review the evidence sounds like to me he saying that they trust the word of crowdstrike just some bs excuse but that what democrats will use as their rebuttal ,2,The_Donald
Haurboss,well i am not sure you would fit into the category of being a typical introvert judging by your comment so you might not understand where people are coming from doing keg stands and initiating conversations with girls at parties is kind of the opposite of what introverts do,-3,AskReddit

Haurboss,glad to see the rest of the student body was booing these jackasses as they walked out american liberals are like a cancer in this country,-16,politics
Haurboss,very symbolic of how democrats in todays country function you do not agree with me ok ill act childish and ignore what you have to say theres no room to compromise with modern day american liberals they cant stand the thought that people have differing opinions than theirs ,-15,politics
Haurboss, sigh that pisses me off it makes me so mad when democrats try to say welfare fraud is not a problem and they pull out their stats because its one of those things that impossible to accurately calculate how do you know someones committing welfare fraud unless they are caught you do not and using welfare funds in ways they are not intended is an extremely hard crime to catch someone doing how can you catch the guy who sells his monthly bridge card funds to a drug dealer for drugs when stores are not even required to ask for id to see if the food stamp card even belongs to the person using it i could give a crackhead 100 00 for his 200 in food stamps right now they give me the card and the pin i go to the store buy my groceries leave and return the card back to him theres no way i can get caught unless i announce it to the world and that exact scenario is happening every single day thousands of times across the us i live in an inner city and welfare fraud is off the fucking charts it has to be way over 7 million a year i have known roughly lets say 50 people in my lifetime on food stamps or bridge cards as they call them in michigan and i have known one one single person who used their welfare funding correctly it was an elderly lady everyone else sold it for drugs money or used it for shit like paying rent to a corrupt landlord one of my close friends has been claiming his son as a dependent for like 6 years yet he has not even seen him let alone taken care of him in 6 years that professor is one of those liberals who speaks about things she has no fucking clue about she probably never even lived in a city like detroit flint or chicago etc,6,The_Donald
Haurboss,liberal professors had to get in one more piece of brainwashing before letting the students go ,15,The_Donald
Haurboss,notice that his mom says try to find the two that killed him its at the 24 mark ,1,The_Donald
Haurboss,sounds like they are just thanking everyone in general who is talking about his murder as for the connection with being a leaker if wapos story is true that they do not like the claim he was leaking to wikileaks it could just be that they are not redpilled yet most people their age have not a clue what wikileaks is or they hear the media say wikileaks is russian propaganda his parents probably do not know that if seth was the leaker then he could not have been more patriotic by revealing the deep seeded corruption in the dnc ,1,The_Donald
Haurboss, this video is from at least april 25th 2017 here the earliest upload i could find of it from youtube https www youtube com watch v azvozokgv c and the shills in here downvoting this need to fuck off what soulless devils would downvote a video of a mother in tears thanking people for trying to help find her childs murderer ,3,The_Donald
Haurboss,its called a timeline if you do not want to spend 5 minutes skimming through it then obviously you do not care that much its a complicated string of events a tldr seth rich was killed for leaking to wikileaks is what everyone already knows 1000x over we need more detailed posts now that what this is not every post in this sub needs to be a meme or some short one sentence title post,12,The_Donald
Haurboss,how is it disproven just because he was invited to clintons campaign team does not mean he was not a bernie supporter op saying he was invited to reduce the motive that the dnc clintons team would have any reason to murder seth why would they murder someone they wanted on their team ,14,The_Donald
Haurboss,imagine believing this shit propaganda you would think the world was ending i flipped through the news earlier and landed on cnn the story breaking sheriff david clarke plagiarized his thesis they just do not stop ,2,The_Donald
Haurboss,mods in r funny are openly mocking seth rich stickying posts saying his name was seth rogan liberals are truly the scum of the country,91,The_Donald
Haurboss,how can it be debunked if his murder is still unsolved does not even make sense ,293,The_Donald
Haurboss,this post is ironic because the seth rich private investigator story dropped mere hours before washington post dropped the trump gave classified information to russians story if anything the trump russian story was dropped to divert attention from seth richs families pi finding out he did contact wikileaks lol the media beatdown nobody gives a fuck about the media beatdown except for the anti trumpers who jackoff to cnn all day oh shit cnn is reporting trump is colluding with russia per anonymous sources for the 1 345 245th time this year trumps getting his ass kicked russia russia russia people have been calling for seths murder to be solved since it happened it did not start this week,-35,Jokes
Haurboss,lol ah yes the people who want seth richs murder solved are much more sickening than the democrats and the media who try to ignore it as much as possible and even go so far as to mock him ,-35,Jokes
Haurboss,i guess this mod thinks its funny to mock a guy who worked for the dnc that was murdered last year his name was seth rich his murder is still unsolved police labeled it a robbery even though his wallet and cell phone were found on him he was a bernie supporter and extremely patriotic people want his highly suspicious murder solved yet the media and democrats are trying to sweep it under a rug hence why people post his name was seth rich so he not forgotten its theorized he leaked the dnc emails to wikileaks because as we seen in the dnc emails it shows a high level of corruption and rigging of the election in favor of hillary over bernie the reason democrats hate this theory and go so far as to even mock seth is because if seth leaked the dnc emails which he had access to then that means russia did not hack them which destroys the russian hacking narrative wikileaks has put up a 10 000 dollar reward for information leading to seths murderers julian assange has always denied that his source was russia and has always hinted seth was the leaker but wikileaks obviously cant admit it was seth because wikileaks never reveals their sources,-177,Jokes
Haurboss,wow mocking a patriot who was murdered in cold blood classy,-3,Jokes
Haurboss,so true whenever i see the multitudes of people bitch about the donald i think what the fuck you do not even have to ever see our posts if you do not want to they go out of their way to come here to get mad at our sub the mere thought of someone having a differing opinion than theirs makes them upset edit this thread is 78 upvoted and falling how ironic that they are here right now going out of there way to downvote this thread ,94,The_Donald
Haurboss,td needs to be more careful than ever when screening mods i am sure shareblue smells an opening,8,The_Donald
Haurboss,oh oh oh so flynn was being influenced during the campaign trump began colluding with russia after the election trump was just like welp i won now i guess its time to go commit treason for no reason at all then ill go bomb russian ally syria deny exxon from drilling in russia and not lift sanctions against russia totally colluding helping russia out a ton shit wait how was trump colluding with russia again how is russia benefitting at all from a trump presidency ,-12,politics
Haurboss,again why would they need to influence trump through flynn if trump was already colluding with russia ,-9,politics
Haurboss,but 3rdcoast this article says russia thought they could use flynn to influence trump that implies russia had no control over trump hoped to use flynn to influence trump and that trump wasnt colluding with russia i mean if trump was colluding with russia then why would russia brag about being able to use flynn to influence him why do all these fuckers deserve to be drawn and quartered live on tv because russia thought they could use flynn to influence trump you are so stupid you cant even see that this cnn piece contradicts the entire trump russian collusion narrative this piece proves cnn is just making shit up and their sources are fake,1,politics
Haurboss,or it could be that the leftist media is pushing their anti trump agenda and they do not give a fuck about credibility because they know you idiots will watch and believe no matter what how many of the cnn wapo nyt about trump russian collusion ever ended up being proven true like none of them or else he would be impeached yet you guys still believe them wait wait what happened to cnn saying all this time that trump colluded with russia they ran the trump russian collusion narrative for months now they are saying russia needed to use flynn to influence trump this story implies trump wasnt colluding with russia cnn just contradicted everything they have been saying for months with one single headline i want you to explain that to me how could it go from our sources say trump colluded with russia to our sources say russia planned to use flynn to influence trump that two completely different scenarios that their sources say happened yet you say their sources are credible one implies the president was committing treason the other implies russia thought they could use flynn which one is it i am so sorry that you are still programmed to believe our msm is 100 credible and holds itself to the highest standards of honest non biased reporting hopefully after the trump russian investigations are cleared and you see the media has lied this entire time then youll start to see the media are liars you wont because you are a sucker ,1,politics
Haurboss,ok so lets say this is true guess what this implies trump himself has no ties to the russian government like you lame brains have been saying for months if the russians already had control of trump like you guys have been saying for months then why would they brag about using flynn to influence trump they would not need flynn if they had trump himself trump russian collusion narrative destroyed by cnn lol you guys are fools cant even keep your own story straight ,-22,politics
Haurboss,sources are obviously a big part of journalism but the thing is sources eventually lead to some form of evidence what we see today is anon sources anon sources anon sources but never any evidence at the end of the tunnel claim after claim of shit like trump is about to send 10 000 national guardsmen door to door to round up illegals or trump sealed indictment incoming yet nothing ever happens its fake news left wing propaganda duh you idiots eat it up every single time its called confirmation bias you hear something you like and you believe it even if there is nothing backing it the truth is that this story is buried because anthony weiner is a democratic politician married to huma abedin hillarys right hand lady also this is pedophilia from a high ranking us politician which democrats are very defensive about due to pizzagate that why this real news is buried in this shithole sub,1,politics
Haurboss,he will be in prison so no shooting sources are reporting anthony weiner was found dead in his cell this morning with 46 stab wounds to his chest and back it has been ruled a suicide ,8,The_Donald
Haurboss,anonymous sources told us anthony wiener had been suicidal for months cnn msnbc wapo etc after weiner kills himself in prison,7,The_Donald
Haurboss,i pointed this out a long while back when the trump russian story was just starting because this conspiracy blew up due to new york times articles they claim russia a foreign nation is influencing our politics too much meanwhile they turn to new york times as one of their main sources even though its owned mainly by a mexican isnt it wrong one of our largest media outlets has its narrative controlled by a mexican billionaire or is it only a big deal if russia tries to influence us ,3,The_Donald
Haurboss,yeah most subs should be allowed to run however they want but certain main subs like news world news or politics should be ran differently they are the face of reddit they should not have biased moderating and reddit certainly should not allow politics to be controlled by democratic internet marketing agencies r politics basically has all right wing news outlet articles on auto delete besides fox all you can really post is left wing news articles which forces the conversations to always be anti trump just to show another form of bias they can post conspiracy theorist louise mensch blog posts about trump receiving a sealed indictment that makes the front page but you know damn well we could never post conspiracy theorist alex jones articles in there ,1,The_Donald
Haurboss,my bet is that seths parents are your typical brainwashed democratic baby boomers early gen xers who believe every single thing the media says without question they see cnn saying seths murder was of nothing suspicious they see cnn and fbi saying wikileaks is part of the russian government so they are scared to believe their son was leaking documents to wikileaks they have fully embraced the dnc even allowing a member of the dnc to be their spokeperson they cant fathom that their son was murdered by the party they support i highly doubt they are being threatened they just are not aware of how corrupt the political landscape is we will have to find the truth without them ,8,The_Donald
Haurboss,god you guys are obsessed with russian conspiracies now smh everything that happens that you guys do not like or that implies dnc corruption you guys blame on russia the president is not working for putin russia is not hacking elections fox news is not protecting putin ironically fox news has now become the least biased news source on tv they run negative pieces on trump with shepherd smith but they also have hosts like tucker and hannity that side with trump while cnn msnbc abc cbs all run anti trump pieces all day long thats how far leftists and their media has fallen that how divisive you guys now are fox is now the most non partisan news show on tv think about that for a second its the truth do not deny it you guys are beyond pathetic,-2,politics
Haurboss,lol trump supporters have been talking about seth rich for months russia has nothing to do with it you guys are clearly obsessed with russia and now blame everything you do not like on russia seth was murdered for leaking the dnc emails to wikileaks that why wikileaks offered a reward for information on his death that why julian has hinted it was seth for the longest time his murder was ruled a robbery even though his wallet phone etc was all on his body that why the leftist media is trying so hard to bury the story and discredit it democrats hate seth rich because he completely destroys muh russia narrative yall have been bitching about for months the dnc refused to let the fbi have access to their server and instead only let crowdstrike review their server crowdstrike is a corrupt cyber security company with ties to clinton donors also the owner is a russian expat with a past history of falsifying evidence russian government has nothing to do with it you looney tunes ,-1,politics
Haurboss,nope the weiner story is hidden away in controversial easily the biggest politics story of the day and they are not even talking about it the front page is just the usual trump russian conspiracies oh and they are also bashing david clarke racists smh ,1,The_Donald

Haurboss,there was a new york times post on r all from r politics that was titled comey is said to be unsettled from interactions with trump i love how leftists now base all of their information on trump from unconfirmed sources anonymous sources hear say unnamed senior officials etc its confirmation bias to the max they claim to pride themselves on being the intelligent voter base in the country yet they are so fucking brainwashed whatever the media says they believe without question,4,The_Donald

Haurboss,why would we marchagainsttrump bots posts to the top of r all every single day when this sub was created in february it would have less than 100 users on and still get tens of thousands of upvotes obvious botting its nothing new,12,MarchAgainstTrump
Haurboss,literally the only way the donald shows up in r all is if you subscribed to them reddit admins blocked t d from r all because they got there all day everyday without bots like this sub so what are you doing subbing to t d if you do not want to see them oh right you are being a little bitch subbing so you can go in there and downvote faggot,1,MarchAgainstTrump

Haurboss,im reading he was an intoxicated hispanic man with a history of dwi he tried to run from the scene probably best to wait for all the details before we go screaming that it was a muslim,29,The_Donald
Haurboss,but unnamed anonymous american senior officials said trump colluded with russia why wont anybody believe me i am being all super cereal and you guys are acting like its a big joke ,6,The_Donald
Haurboss,its a good thing because he russia story will be put to rest no matter libcucks crying about needing a special prosecutor or independent investigation if cnn and wapo push trump russia stories even after trumps cleared then they will begin to look retarded even to many leftists,1,The_Donald
Haurboss,yea i am pretty sure op just made that shit up i mean the statement from trump which this thread is all about talks about finally proving his campaign did not collude with russia if the investigation was solely about russian hacking then trumps statement would not have included anything about his campaign,4,The_Donald
Haurboss,then why did trump release the statement above basically saying his team did not collude with russia and he hopes this investigation concludes quickly and shows that pretty sure trump knows more about the investigation than us the investigations main reason for existing is definitely to put to rest the trump russian collusion bs if it was just about russian hacking then trump would not have even brought up his campaign ,1,The_Donald
Haurboss,yeah i do not get how one can agree that it was a good idea to not prosecute her she needs to be taken down for something so all these retarded democrats can see the monster that they tried to elect i am disappointed in gowdy for not taking the fbi job i guess he wants to sit in a courtroom forever yelling at people as they do not answer his questions basically achieving nothing ,18,The_Donald
Haurboss,oh if democrats hypothetically gained the majorities no doubt they would push to impeach trump for some bs reason if they were unsuccessful they would use his near impeachment against him in 2020 that is totally the msm mission push anti trump news nonstop push impeachment hope dems gain power in 2018 impeach trump,13,The_Donald
Haurboss,comeys own words annihilate the entire memo narrative ,3,The_Donald
Haurboss,my comment is stupid because i am saying that there is no evidence that can be used to impeach trump ok then surely you can provide me with tons of direct evidence linked to trump himself that shows he committed an impeachable offense you cant all this time saying trump colluded with russia and still nothing therefore you and all you bitchy little democrats are the dumbasses in this equation muh anonymous sources say trump colluded with russia ,0,politics
Haurboss,50 downvoted no place on reddit has the right to complain about being brigaded more than the donald do not even want to hear it from the liberal faggots in r politics or any of the anti trump shill subs and the downvote bots this is pretty pathetic that this is what shareblue spends their donors money on literally nothing comes from downvoting a picture of trump in t d,1,The_Donald
Haurboss,over what you cant just impeach the elected president because he has views that oppose yours you certainly cant use unproven claims in news articles that say trump did something wrong but then offers no proof to support the claim other than anonymous sources said so to impeach a president democrats have lost their damn minds no wonder their party is failing democrats have the least power in us government than they have had in 80 years and they will continue losing power until they pull their heads out of their asses the whole lot of em are so detached from reality edit yeah downvote this comment to children as quick as possible censoring opposing views is what democrats do best ,-14,politics
Haurboss,lol oh shit this conspiracy is bigger than we previously thought trump is working with the russians to not only steal the us election but also overthrow putin so he can be replaced by none other than puppet master steve bannon ,8,The_Donald

Haurboss,i am fatigued and i am not even getting hyped by the trump impeachment news like democrats the media is breaking story after story every day telling us trump is colluding with russia in some new way eventually democrats are going to get fatigued of constantly hyping themselves up for trumps impeachment that the media tells them is imminent that never comes and many will start to question if the media is lying about everything they claim trump is doing ,3,The_Donald
Haurboss,just think if all of america was as stupid as democrats and actually believed everything the media says like they do scary to think how much control the deep state and media would have over the country if not for trump supporters realizing the media is flat out lying non stop to push the deep state agenda,3,The_Donald
Haurboss,the media will carry this on until then unless of course trumps administration is able to prove how corrupt the dnc is with the seth rich murder obama spying or finally getting hillary in actual trouble then the attention would be diverted kind of hard to keep harping about muh anonymous sources on russian collusion when hillary is on trial with real evidence the dnc members are on trial with real evidence or the obama admin spying story gains major traction,2,The_Donald

Haurboss,they are so scared of seth rich because his case could bring down the entire dnc and annihilate the russia story they have been talking about for months cnn employees would probably kill themselves before reporting on a bunch of dnc members being busted in connection with seths murder cnn parades around trump russia stories literally every single day with nothing more than anonymous sources as their proof seths case has ample evidence to suggest his death was much more than just a botched robbery and they call it fake i just cant deal with their bs much longer ,22,The_Donald
Haurboss,lol do not attack these stellar reporters of cnn bitch all we want is the sources so we know they are not completely fabricated everyone with a functioning brain is beyond sick of all this headline trump russia news that is based completely on anonymous sources if this situation is as serious as liberals and the msm make it seem then we need actual proof americans cant just believe trump is working with russia because some unverifiable anonymous sources say so we need proof you dumb cunt,22,The_Donald

Haurboss,yes sir they are its an unstoppable circle jerk potentially the largest i have ever seen and that saying a lot when talking about r politics i just spent way too much time trying to point out to individuals that wapos article offers no actual proof and relies completely on an unnamed source but they simply do not give a fuck they think that the unnamed source is 100 trustworthy and mcmasters powell and tillerson are lying about saying trump did not divulge classified information they are falling victim to confirmation bias harder than i have ever seen my head literally hurts from being in there,1,The_Donald
Haurboss,lol because this is fake news my god you numbskulls believe whatever wapo says and disregard their lack of evidence to support their claims wapo bases everything on unnamed sources unnamed sources are not proof of anything meanwhile mcmasters dina powell and tillerson all of whom were in the meeting have said wapos story is false and that trump did not do what wapo is accusing him of sorry i know you anti trumpers like to think you are the smart ones but your guys confirmation bias is way too strong you guys are complete fools for continuously disregarding the fact wapo constantly relies on unverifiable unnamed sources as proof you wonder why trump is not impeached after everything washington post says hes done because none of it has happened ,-5,politics
Haurboss,hr mcmasters who was in the meeting with trump and the russians did an interview on msnbc http www msnbc com hardball watch mcmaster it didn t happen 944530499610 tldw it didnt happen he cant stress enough that the wapo article is completely false stop believing fake news seriously how many anonymous sources say articles from wapo can you be let down by until you realize wapo is lying ,-24,politics

Haurboss,no this is not normal the us has never seen the mainstream media lie and spread so much fake propaganda about an administration before take this article for example you can spot fake news by the constant use of anonymous sources or unnamed senior official theres no proof washington post just expects you to believe it because our sources who names we cannot tell you said it happened so far 3 people who were in the meeting with trump have come forward and said this article is false tillerson dina powell and hr mcmasters have all said this is not true so who do you trust more 3 named americans or an unnamed senior official the media lies kid never trust the media on politics for either side ,1,politics
Haurboss, drumpf is finally finished finito its over we won washington post 1 234 345th unnamed senior official anonymous source says trump did a no no and cnn rehosted the article so it must mean its true i am just going to disregard the fact that so far 3 americans from the meeting have come forward and said this story is false and instead put all of my faith in the washington post wapo fuck yea popular vote bernie is going to make it to 2020 match me ,-17,politics
Haurboss,heres the sides side a tillerson powell and mcmasters who were at the meeting have come out and said the story is false and that trump did not give russia classified information side b wapos article uses an unnamed person as their source you decide which is more credible i for one am not falling for the anonymous sources say bs from washington post for the 1 millionth time just because other news sites rehost the content does not mean its verified like other idiots try to say unnamed sources cant be verified by 10 different news agencies obviously ,-5,politics
Haurboss,mcmaster tillerson and powell were all at the meeting and have already came out and said this wapo story is false the story itself provides no evidence and forces the reader to put all of their faith in unnamed sources which leaves no room for verification 3 people at the meeting vs an unnamed source yeah i think ill take the 3 people at the meeting this is the epitome of fake news but liberal anti trump suckers will eat it up because it fills their need for confirmation bias,-24,politics
Haurboss,where the proof anonymous unverifiable sources are the furthest thing from proof so far all the big names at the meeting have come out and said wapos story is completely false tillerson mcmaster powell all of em said this is false and that trump divulged no such information there is no proof in this story ,-1,politics
Haurboss,mcmaster tillerson and dina powell have all came out now and said wapo story is completely false and that trump did not divulge any such classified information at their meeting the only named source in wapos article has also come out and said wapo is lying you guys are addicted to confirmation bias stories that provide literally no proof of their claims and use anonymous sources as their cover,-15,politics
Haurboss,mcmaster tillerson and dina powell have all came out now and said wapo story is completely false and that trump did not divulge any such classified information at their meeting yet here your dumbass is believing some anonymous source lol you are such a fool how many false wapo msm trump russian headlines will it take for you to finally see they are lying for views ,1,politics
Haurboss,no wonder you are such a dumbass you are one of those people that trusts every word the msm propaganda machines puts out as if they do not have their own biased agendas to fulfill the washington posts track record is atrocious lol you just made me crack up they are one of the main outlets constantly posting about trump russia collusion using anonymous sources yet none of it is ever proven all of this trump russia bs is because of anonymous source senior officials who cant be verified and their information cant be proven true or false and that exactly what we have here again from wapo again you think trumps just sitting in a meeting with russia surrounded by his highest level people and they are just going to sit there and let trump go into detail about highly classified information to the russians you can think trumps incompetent enough to do it but people like mcmasters would not sit there and allow trump or anyone to do that nobody is verifying this report other outlets will rehost the content just like they have been doing about every trump russia story haha you anti trumpers are full blown conspiracy theorists now,-2,politics
Haurboss,lol no actually i just quoted hr mcmasters himself you jackass i think its probably best to listen to the guy who was in the actual meeting you just keep getting your news from unverifiable sources i hear that fake news and anonymous sources are like a drug once you get hooked you cant get off hopefully you seek treatment ,-2,politics
Haurboss,and did you read mcmasters reply ya know one of the guys who was at the meeting there was no highly classified information disclosed they discussed isis as russia and the us should considering they are fighting isis they discusses aviation threats they did not discuss any military strategies that are not known to the public keep on being an idiot believing these anonymous senior official sources clearly you still have not learned that anonymous sources are rarely ever true if they were then trump would have been locked up and tried for treason for russian collusion about 1 million times now maybe one day they will be right ,-2,politics
Haurboss,why would t d acknowledge fake news only idiots continuously believe these anonymous sources that have been proven to be completely full of shit countless times here mcmasters response on the situation ya know an actual verifiable source who is on the inside the president and the foreign minister reviewed common threats from terrorist organizations to include threats to aviation said h r mcmaster the national security adviser who participated in the meeting at no time were any intelligence sources or methods discussed and no military operations were disclosed that were not already known publicly russia and the us should be discussing isis strategies considering russia and the us are the two main forces fighting isis derp derp derp now ill let you go back to jacking off to fake news,-6,politics
Haurboss,and here is mcmasters response but of course you guys have already made up your minds the president and the foreign minister reviewed common threats from terrorist organizations to include threats to aviation said h r mcmaster the national security adviser who participated in the meeting at no time were any intelligence sources or methods discussed and no military operations were disclosed that were not already known publicly keep on believing unverifiable anonymous sources ,1,politics

Haurboss, the fbi position is supposed to be nonpartisan so garland would assumably be required to abide by this rule oh yes because we all know there no way garland would cover for corrupt democratic politicians like hillary or obama have you guys lost your damn minds are you seriously suggesting we replace comey with an obama lackey wtf there no way in hell trump could appoint garland fill his vacancy and then fire garland that would be considered extremely dirty and ethics wise trump very well could get in trouble that just a horrible horrible plan ,5,The_Donald
Haurboss,sidelined as head of the fbi you think being the head of the fbi is being sidelined just as an example of how important the fbi role is if we had someone who is not corrupt like comey as fbi director then hillary would be in jail right now the fbi gets access to all the good evidence and the director can hide all the crimes the people like obama clinton or weiner commit if they want to this is a position that most certainly cannot go to any person who is affiliated with obama or hillary,7,The_Donald

Haurboss,my most important stance is protecting the cultures and people of the us and europe my support for trump is also support for european politicians like le pen and wilders who hold strong nationalist views this new anti white agenda that brainwashed white guilt ridden progressive sjws are pushing needs to go death to multiculturalism down with dieversity why is it that africa is for black people asian countries like japan china india for asians south america for latinos the middle east for arabs yet the white countries are forced to be diverse and forced to allow in everyone or be labeled a racist for reasons unknown politicians in the us and europe feel like we must allow in mass amounts of immigrants refugees from south america africa and the middle east we do not need to allowing in mass amounts of people from places that hold the complete opposite views as ours and come from completely different walks of life will destroy our countries i cant say exactly what i want to here or else i would be banned but i am sure you can figure out why i do not think it benefits us to allow in people from the middle east south america or africa just look at the filthy countries they come from why would i want that to be brought here since trump is the strongest on controlling our borders and upholding our immigration laws i support him since democrats are now basically for open borders theres no way in hell ill ever support them again ,0,AskReddit
Haurboss,yea this is the only thing i disagree with trump administration on so far i think their stances on weed drugs come from a severe lack of knowledge and experience with drugs make it legal create safer forms of the drugs because a lot of these heroin overdoses are caused by other drugs like fentanyl being mixed in with the heroin tax it create laws that prohibit driving while on it etc its a funny thing how something being illegal causes more problems than if it were legal ,11,The_Donald
Haurboss,wars on drugs do not work 90 of the worlds opium comes from afghanistan if drugs are not coming from the south they will come from somewhere else or people will create new drugs similar to how crack meth was invented legalize tax create safer forms of drugs create harsh laws to discourage crime while on drugs or trying to illegally obtain money for drugs treat it like alcohol theres literally no difference between the drunk drinking himself to death or the heroin junkie overdosing,8,The_Donald
Haurboss,not strange really it was huge in the 70s and 80s when all the vietnam vets came back from smoking opium in asia it died down once crack became big in the 80s and 90s and then heroin came back strong again in the 2000s its just made a comeback everything is cyclical ,14,The_Donald

Haurboss,the subs like ets and marchagainsttrump that reddit admins knowingly allow to bot their threads to the front page i mean some of these anti trump subs will have like less than 1000 active users online at a time yet somehow get tens of thousands of upvotes while the rest of the posts in their sub will have like a couple hundred that obvious signs of vote manipulation ,29,AskReddit

Haurboss,everyday i wish that people would understand loot games are purposefully unbalanced you start out with a few op weapons everyone grinds for them then devs nerf them and make something else op everyone grinds for new op gear then devs nerf that and make something else op then people grind for new op gear its about adding longevity to the game loot games like destiny and division have little content players are addicted to loot and having the best loot so devs purposefully nerf and buff weapons and armor so players have to endlessly grind to retain the best gear loadouts what you do not think massive could not just buff some of the weaker weapons and balance them with the rest of course they know which weapons need a buff and how simple it would be to do but they do not want to because then people would not need to grind as much for the best gear long story short the division will never be balanced because devs do not want it to be,5,thedivision

Haurboss,haha it seems you really do not like that i pointed out russia is not the only one doing this kind of kills the russian narrative that you leftists are so invested in its important for people to know russia is not the only one doing this its important for people to know the us is the main ones doing it its important that i provide facts showing the us does it more than anybody for leftists and their media to be constantly dogging russia for hacking elections with literally no evidence acting as if we in the us are above that is dangerous this is war causing stuff people need to know the truth even if you leftists do not like that,0,news
Haurboss,if you could read you would see the title of the entire thread is us increasingly convinced russia hacked french elections so the us is obviously in the conversation the person above said this fuckery is what they are good at as if russia is the best or only ones doing it its safe to assume he american as most posters are so i think he should know that his own country meddles in foreign affairs more than anybody i am so sorry i slaughtered your russian narrative and its making you upset ,0,news

Haurboss,look at my first sentence i understand it will never be that referring to a cover based pvp shooter then i ended with saying they could find ways to encourage the use of cover whether that be increasing damage to targets out of cover or increasing damage resilience while in cover strictly speaking of last stand all i want is for hipfire to be ineffective which is what it should be the only way to avoid the chicken dance hipfire gameplay would be to make ttk against out of cover targets instant false make it so hipfire does not register crits make it so hipfire spread is insanely wide so its almost impossible to do it sounds like you just do not want there to be a fix to the hipfiring chicken dances that has turned the pvp into more of a joke than its ever been,1,thedivision

Haurboss,for starters dj wilson no he a tall small forward mo wagner is a stretch 4 mo only averaged 4 rebounds per game and dj wilson averaged 5 rebounds per game your team oregon has legit big men you have a guy averaging 6 rebounds and a guy averaging 8 you also have two guys averaging 2 blocks per game ,5,CollegeBasketball
Haurboss,dude derrick walton was basically our leading rebounder he our point guard our point guard should not be 2nd in the team in rebounds our leading rebounder on the season averaged 5 rebounds a game we had one guy average 1 blocks per game and after him our next leading blocker averaged 0 4 blocks per game we need a big man not a tall guy who shoots 3 pointers we need a big guy similar to what we had in mcgary i love how smug you are yet clearly you are very very delusional,4,CollegeBasketball

Haurboss,election fraud and voter fraud are synonymous both lead to an illegitimate election the fact of the matter is republicans wanted this investigated while democrats made a huge scene and cried for weeks that it was not necessary now who seems like they would be more likely to be committing election voter fraud whether it be tampering with machines or illegally voting obviously it would be the party who does not want it investigated derp better question what party would be more likely to commit election voter fraud a the party who controls congress and the white house or b the desperate party who holds the least power in the usg than they have had in over 80 years ,-5,politics

Haurboss,hillary is being investigated by the oversight committee they are still trying to get all of the documents that hillarys state dept would not give them during obamas presidency the investigation is expected to run on into 2018 according to the oc you tried to make it a point that trump being investigated implied he guilty so the easiest comeback from me is to point out your favorite candidate is also under investigation and as expected you had no rebuttal to that and as expected you are uninformed ,-15,politics
