Scuba_jim,to elaborate left wing is about a few things while workers may control the means of production in a communist system left wing in the western world typically entails greater social liberties but also a government that provides a framework for all of its citizens to thrive or survive this is why healthcare the dole and so on is a big part of left wing politics although outside of the us it almost universally accepted nazi government was vastly different firstly social liberties were abolished to create a monolithic social system this has quite a lot to do with an authoritarian government which is why you see somewhat similar design in stalin russia thesedays the western left is not associated with that kind of behaviour economically nazi germany is similarly monolithic everything flows through the government who in turn provides everyone with a job sounds left wing well it might be if you ignore the mass extermination of undesirables and the distinct lack of citizen support beyond a job their policies were also about war and aggression i do not think it fair usually to lump right wingers as nazis as nazis were more control and subjugation as they are with current right wing beliefs that being said current t d users are rapidly changing my mind ,2,Fuckthealtright

Scuba_jim,here some food for thought the brain is not simply a computer in some respects the way in which memories and emotions and skills etc develop is due in part to where in the brain that particular memory or whatever it is is located have you ever wondered why perfume and aftershave are so popular it because emotional centres of the brain use to be used for the sense of smell before it evolved to favour emotion as a relic of that time our sense of smell has a strong influence on emotion similarly people with a foot fetish are likely to have unusual neuron patterns as neurons involved with sexual activity are next to those that control the foot people with foot fetishes appear to have some wires crossed for people with autism they use different parts of the brain to accomplish the same goals however this manifests as the behaviours of autism something highly complicated such as social activity and facial interpretation is subsequently relegated to a part of the brain that is not cut out for that sort of work some children even recover once the brain figures out where to put what function where ,3,explainlikeimfive

Scuba_jim,the original question is if there are any particular boundaries for islam to participate and enrich western civilization even if there are chapters arguing for the marginalisation of women that has little influence over what they actually follow if they choose not to much like i do not think you kill witches i agree this is probably a bigger problem for islam than christianity right now but hardly a deal breaker western civilization is fully capable and has been since the beginning of amicable relationships with islam like i said and you fairly agree with holy books are a clusterfuck and there no reason to establish any sort of rationale for or against based solely on them still i appreciate the information and certainly the politeness in our discussion ,1,AskThe_Donald

Scuba_jim,arguing koran and biblical verses is patently insane both books have glaring contradictions both books promote violence absurdity and occasionally messages that would be considered good case in point you have cherry picked a number of verses showing the christian god in a good light it is equally easy for me to find ones showing him in a bad one same for the koran the point is is that all believers cherry pick they have to it impossible to follow all commandments for either holy book it particularly telling however that the overwhelming majority of both religions are peaceful respectful and do not tend to cause violence this is a product of themselves ,1,AskThe_Donald
Scuba_jim,muslims are encouraged to go to mosques and read the koran they know well enough what is in there unlike the bible it a fairly short read i am confused by the term and issue of atheistic regressive left what makes them regressive what makes them bullies i would argue anyone telling someone else what to do with their own bodies and families would be bullying what liberal violence are you experiencing are you talking about a handful of blm protestors you do realise there millions of liberals right ,1,AskThe_Donald

Scuba_jim,http www infoplease com spot northireland1 html this is a small example now i will cross the floor with you for one point there does appear although i admit i have not researched it particularly thoroughly that as of right now there is more muslim based violence than christian based there are plenty of reasons for that i would say you would argue a religious basis i would probably argue a sociology economic basis the middle east and africa is not known for its effective wealth distribution however the discussion we are having is not which side is worse we are discussing whether there are inherent and impassable hindrances that muslims cannot overcome to become a part of and contribute to western civilization for that argument it is clear and obvious that muslims can do so and have been doing so since the inception of islam we do not have 1 1 billion radicalised lunatics we have an extremely diverse group of people who are in principle no different to christians and their diversity ,1,AskThe_Donald

Scuba_jim,i am sorry could you please phrase the question are you asking if we should prevent some ideas and beliefs in extreme instances yes we should they hijack our base instincts and are deliberately harmful in the case of holocaust denial i personally do not think it should be suppressed but every publisher and bookseller has a right to refuse to sell or publish a book and a lack of historical merit is a good reason for something like this ,1,books
Scuba_jim,there no censorship here censorship would be oppressing holocaust deniers they have chosen not to publish their books,1,books
Scuba_jim,my wife is a cancer researcher who occasionally works with patients a sizeable portion of patients refuse effective treatments because of pseudo science like that milkshake book books like that kill people and for what a quick buck this is not about agreeing or disagreeing science is about rigour and reality take a hypothetical hamster i will agree it is male you will agree it is female neither of our decisions influence the hamster gender science is about establishing the gender of hamster science is a dynamic body of work that is complicated and confusing pseudoscience offers superficially plausible alternatives that often scared people have to deal with because it sounds nice and easy they are likely to follow it nonsense like this exists because of psychological quirks and the busyness of life means trying to understand the real answers is too time consuming i do not think intellectually dishonest media deserves any sort of special ness to help promote if it wants better publishing rights from companies who have no obligation either way then it can follow scientific rigour like the real stuff does ,1,books
Scuba_jim,yeah i did when your book goes in stark defiance of 95 of scientific and or historical understanding you can safely call it fringe science or historical revisionism or horse shit and there should not be an obligation to publish it for anyone a simple disclaimer at the front of the book saying it not accepted would suffice ,1,books
Scuba_jim,there is a clear and evident path of scientific and historical acceptance holocaust denial is not some sort of teeter totter of debate it is utterly overwhelmingly wrong and dangerous too ,3,books
Scuba_jim,that would be great were it not for the world we live in things like holocaust denial exist because a people love echo chambers and b it too hard to get to the bottom of a topic the holocaust is complicated terrifying and difficult to appreciate to understand the evidence for it would be a pretty big ask holocaust deniers get an easy ticket precisely because of the holocaust complexity it easier to call it a hoax than to figure out what it is and use superficial counter evidence to show it other examples in this vein include anti refugee policies evolution space aids denial and so on we do not need to support these fabricators whose existence is harmful stupid and who exist because of a quirk about life being too busy and people being too lazy to get to the bottom of it ,1,books
Scuba_jim,yes and no they knew of monkeys but had no expectancy to think they were related they had no idea regarding evolution they had no idea about stuff we take for granted like how important and useful our hands are that sounds weird but this is from a group of philosophers who were succeeded by people thinking the brain is a device for cooling blood basically what i am trying to say is that they were at square one in figuring anything out ,1,meirl

Scuba_jim,there are plenty of biblical verses that disgusting and awful that we readily ignore the vast majority of muslims do so for their own religious texts ,1,AskThe_Donald
Scuba_jim,the enlightenment took centuries to occur under the heel of the christian church incidentally thank the arabs for holding onto documents that made it possible while early christians discarded or destroyed things disagreeing with them newtown is a classic example of how christianity stifled science he established laws of gravity very well but then did not move ahead with his ideas and so the theory had to be furthered by laplace while the enlightenment happened in christian dominated countries it was not a christian creation it marked the emergence of science and rationalism that for one went out of its way to reduce the influence of the church i had trouble understanding what you said about rational science and religions we are very very lucky that the enlightenment occurred as similar golden ages happened elsewhere but failed it was probably the close proximity of cultures wealth from non religious sources and the reformation that made it possible ,3,AskThe_Donald
Scuba_jim,are you out of your mind protestants and catholics are committing acts of terrorism against each other to this very day depending on the flavour of the week they would be burnt at the stake for their beliefs similarly there are locations where sunnis and shia are at odds and locations where they are not ,1,AskThe_Donald

Scuba_jim,ok let organise a few things i believe you are referring to the reformation which was the time at which christianity began to take things less literally the enlightenment had its roots in scientific and philosophical understanding it was hardly a christian creation secondly no where christianity is strong enough homosexuality is not tolerated half the states of the us have no law against discrimination of employment if you are a homosexual and there are plenty of lynchings torture and therapy for homosexuals to this very day did you know the majority of terrorist actions in the us are caused by christians killing abortion doctors among other crimes but i digress i do not hold the actions and beliefs of these radical christians to equate to the entire christian world islam is much the same ,-1,AskThe_Donald
Scuba_jim,what exactly is wrong with islam what false equivalency have i brought up i am no apologetic for islam but to state that it because it prophet was a bad guy by today standards is special pleading,2,AskThe_Donald
Scuba_jim,jeez i thought this was askthe donald not ask trumpsupportersgettingdefensive,2,AskThe_Donald
Scuba_jim,ah ok so this for some reason does not apply to other religions just islam because for some reason you think the teachings of muhammad are more salient than moses or jesus can you at least appreciate that this is special pleading there nothing inherently nasty about islam in its teachings compared to the other so called great monotheisms and you are scarily misinformed about muhammad and any claim ever held that he is the perfect being unlike jesus at the very least he did not claim to be an actual deity ,1,AskThe_Donald
Scuba_jim,so what are you saying then because what i am interpreting is that you are stating that one religions starting position speaks volumes about its incompatibility with western civilisation but you neglect other probably worse stories because it does not fit your narrative is this incorrect ,0,AskThe_Donald
Scuba_jim,i see so what you are saying is is that the religious beliefs and stories of their founders have nothing to do with whether they are compatible with western civilisation ,1,AskThe_Donald
Scuba_jim,i see so getting back to the original question considering these other stories would you throw out jews norwegians and other christians ,1,AskThe_Donald
Scuba_jim,well is it a myth and legend or something that actually happened ,1,AskThe_Donald
Scuba_jim,so you believe muhammad is the true prophet ,0,AskThe_Donald
Scuba_jim,hang on you are talking about myths and legends and somehow associating that with real world politics the jews killed jesus should we state their incompatibility they also believed in having slaves butchering tribes that were on their land and burning witches should we ban hindus for their weapon producing abilities as seen in the mahabharata they have arrows that kill by sound and bombs that poison the air and are happy to use them against their enemies should we throw out anyone who follows old nordic faiths for worshipping horse rapists should we get rid of christians for following augustine of hippo or peter or constantine for their terrible purges this is not rhetorical i would appreciate an answer ,2,AskThe_Donald

Scuba_jim,i have made this point before but i will state it again the problem with good ideas is that they almost always get hijacked by loudest minority because it easier to digest which in turn muddies the water take feminism i do not think any reasonable person would think that a female should get treated or paid any differently to a male for the same job that perhaps one of the core values of 2nd and 1st wave feminism yet the discourse is hijacked by obnoxious sjws and we get offended by them because of how stupid they are as a result some people state that they do not like feminism conversely there nothing inherently racist about fixing an illegal immigrant problem it unfair to those individuals coming in legally produces a whole heap of social problems and is hurting taxpayers however the discourse is hijacked by racist hillbillies and kkk members and we get offended by them because of how stupid they are as a result some people state they do not like immigration control the problem is is that because there all these real life straw men it very hard to see the forest from the trees at times if my news feed is deluged with sjws and kkk members i wo not notice actual issues with clearly definable good and bad outcomes for example if there is a healthcare system that helps the poor increases productivity and produces an overall net profit for a country that is in my mind a clear advantage that should be pursued however if i dislike the liberals and their sjws i can see how such a system could be considered a bad thing to do ,1,Conservative

Scuba_jim,as an outsider looking in this is what i felt with hillary and the wikileaks stuff and why the message for me of course was not effective wikileaks and parts of reddit clearly had a big agenda wikileaks in particular tried to generate buzz by disclosing emails piecemeal promising the next one will put her in jail and so on this was not helped by r the donald and r hillaryforprison whose message was agenda filled and often obnoxious r hillaryforprison has been running for quite awhile and yet they are mostly concerned with a fairly recent rig in the primaries again this is an agenda issue but it also makes the message difficult to understand if you look at that subreddits top posts of all time nothing in that area appears to be an offence hillary has been deeply scrutinised by the fbi and other agencies numerous occasions and found completely fine again this makes the whole shebang feel like an agenda it still really unclear what she has done debbie was guilty sure but is there concrete proof of hillarys involvement now i am sure that i could get a bunch of messages showing me something but to date i have not seen it it hard to be concerned with any of this when trump is overwhelmingly the poorer candidate in terms of sheer policy what he was saying going into the election will clearly not work i do not care if hillary is culpable for these things if it means that overall the country is in more capable hands i do not mean to start a flame war this is just how i perceived the matter ,-3,DNCleaks

Scuba_jim,i am a doing my degree in civ eng and based on my experience i agree with this sentiment with odds greater than the number of grains of sand in the sahara to one against i am not sure if all utilities have a similar design to what i have been dealing with but it a curious mix of retaining the status quo reducing individual liability and fear of repercussions that makes any project involving public interaction an absolute nightmare i would guess it because the australian public is so energised when it comes to perceived impacts on their lifestyle who else but east coast australians are going to be more upset about three hundred trees more than the epa ,1,sydney

Scuba_jim,i think for a best cause worst fans ratio it has to be atheists sjws and marijuana enthusiasts atheism is a great ideal it not unreasonable to say that religion is now a large source of strife in the world and that we should accept rationality a lot more if we are going to move forward as a species plenty of well meaning and intelligent commentators have made excellent arguments to adopt atheism but then it gets co opted by neckbeards to the point that you probably read that paragraph above and thought i am a jerk and i am the sort of guy who calls catholics rapists and muslims extremists and so on it hard to think of a less attractive figure marijuana is a superb medicinal and recreational drug it benefits have been known for thousands of years and even now we are finding so many benefits and so few side effects that it becoming increasingly popular the most vocal fans of marijuana for a very long time were either stereotypical potheads or gangbangers it amazing to see something so beneficial take so long to be accepted by the mainstream community precisely because of the actions of these loud stupid groups gender race and sexual preferences are multi faceted delicate and confusing it important for everyone to realise how certain actions can be considered discriminatory and that behaviours need to be scrutinised to as not be exclusory or hurtful to certain groups what fan base do these issues get the noisiest are easily sjws whose flat out idiocy cruelty and faked hyper sensitivity is turning universities into laughing grounds which in turn is being associated with liberalism thereby weakening it ,2,AskReddit

Scuba_jim,it may postdoc in my experience refers to anyone who is a researcher but not yet climbed further up the academic ladder it a bit of nomenclature difference here the point i am trying to get across is that there a fairly noticeable divide between 35 year old post docs and the fifty year old professors tenure does not really exist here the way i believe it exists elsewhere but once you are professor you do get a certain ability to do your own thing as it were thanks to lack of funds however professors usually have to do a full teaching load on top of their research most of their money comes from teaching i apologise for my loose terms here i thought it would be the best way to get the point across ,3,engineering
Scuba_jim,work at a university team it really diverse actually there a whole swag of roughly fifty year olds professors then practically all the post docs are 35 or so then down to the postgrads now that i think about that pretty much the three age groups we have it use to be that you would have a few post docs skirting around older ages and a few professors who were a bit older but in australia the funding is so scarce they have kicked out anyone who had tenure but was not running ten or so students and the older post docs have understandably gone to happier hunting grounds ,5,engineering

Scuba_jim,i agree there is not one right answer but i do believe there are two you either believe the fetus is a human child or it is not like a collection of car parts is not a car so you believe the fetus is a human this means that regardless of any circumstance the child must not be aborted be it product of rape horrifically disabled danger to the mother and so on this after all is a child and even one with an iq of 10 and a projected life span of two months is still a human alternatively you state the child is not a human this means you can abort it and do so as you please less palatable with this option is opting to abort continuously until you get the right child or and this happened aborting one fetus of a set of twins i am personally on the not human side but i believe that if you do feel the fetus is a child you have to follow that belief ,2,AskReddit
