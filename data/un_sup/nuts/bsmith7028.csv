bsmith7028,i stumbled on the body of someone i knew actually an extended family member while in high school he was slumped over in the driver seat of his truck in fact the circumstances regarding his death and many of those around him would definitely fit this sub in fact his official cause of death made him the only member of his immediate family who did not die by by being shot his sister was murdered by her boyfriend allegedly he was convicted plead guilty despite it being commonly believed someone else actually pulled the trigger his father was tortured and castrated before being shot and thrown into a river his mother was killed by his stepfather in a murder suicide and his uncle ws shot and killed under sketchy circumstances although his killer was not charged due to supposedly being self defense there are also multiple extended members of the family who havee been murdered or have murdered others i am not a believer in this sort of thing but i will be damned if it does not seem that that particular family is cursed to meet their end by violent means the only surviving member of the immediate family was married to my brother after their divorce my brother was involved in a murder and went to prison but has since been released its worth noting that this is not a gang involved family all this takes place in a tiny rural town in alabama it more justified than the wire officially it was natural causes overdose but without getting too deep into it let just say there was some really questionable circumstances around it involving shady local law enforcement that i would rather not get into i touched on some of this in my post about the mars hill murders https www reddit com r unresolvedmysteries comments 386xew the mars hill murders the worst unsolved massacre utm content title utm medium user utm source reddit utm name frontpage ,8,UnresolvedMysteries

bsmith7028,her lie was reprehensible and the cost to this young man life is irredeemable but cases like this bring out the ugly side of reddit calls for vigilante justice misogynistic language fat cunt etc before it gets brought up i am not saying that any of that is comparable to to the ramifications of her actions but that not the point i do find it somewhat interesting that among a large group of redditors it seems that women who make false accusations regarding rape generally discussed as generic boogeymen this story serving as one of the few real life examples i have ever seen refefenced inspire more vitriol and seem to draw more ire than stories of actual rape occurring but i digress since i ai not down with damning the girl to hell or proclaiming her literally hitler i know i am courting down votes here but fuck it i agree with you regarding the connection between her age and obviously poor decision making skills seventeen year olds fuck up and if you read the facts around her making the original accusation you can see that her train of thought was obviously based on more on her immaturity than anything malicious that does not absolve her from responsibility and she should not be praised for coming clean but she did at least own up and do the only thing in her power to attempt to rectify the situation of course it unfortunate that he was convicted in the first place but unfortunately in the imperfect world we all live in rape and sexual assault are fairly unique crimes in the fact that there little or no direct physical evidence or eyewitnesses in a large portion majority of cases and it very often boils down to a judgment call on the part of a judge or jury based on one testimony against another combined with circumstantial evidence it a flawed system for sure but a i believe its necessary to achieve any reasonable amount of justice unfortunately with any imperfect system there will be cases of innocents convicted and guilty parties acquitted until we have some technology that can see into the hearts of and minds of the accused and the accusers it the best system we got maybe a reexamination of what and how restitution should be paid to those who suffer miscarriages of justice is called for and maybe a conversation about the consequences for those who file false charges is needed but i believe the latter is a subject that should be tread on very carefully because sometimes there a very fine and blurry line between someone intentionally and maliciously filing a false report versus someone making an accusation that may be true but due to extenuating circumstances may not provable just as there a stigma against the accused there also pressures on victims not to report and i do not believe we should do anything to discourage them i think the point is similar to the laws and ordnances protecting drug users from prosecution for calling 911 when someone od sometimes there are no easy answers ,2,rage

bsmith7028,i assume karen was certain because of the scream her neighbor informed her of and because she knew that was not the boyfriend that holly was outside with her brother was initially unconcerned because he had just woken up holly appeared in no danger and he probably did not want to get involved in a lover spat which iirc is what he had assumed was going on of course it easy to speculate what we would have done knowing what we do now but there was no way for him to know she was in immediate danger i can totally see myself as a parent seemingly overreacting if i thought my daughter was in peril and i can also see myself dismissing my mother seeming overreaction and not wanting to concern myself with my teenage sister love life nothing in either of their behaviors seems unreasonable to me as far as the bucket goes i too am curious what was in it but i do not see how that detail could resolve anything ,3,UnresolvedMysteries

bsmith7028,i do not have a source for the stalking right off hand although unless i am misremembering it it been probably a year or more since i immersed myself in this case it should not be hard to find i must have been unclear i do not believe there strong evidence of foul play but there also not sufficient evidence to say she was having a psychotic episode i do not believe a manic episode would come close to explaining how she ended up inside the water tank of course there no way to say for sure but it would be seriously atypical bipolar disorder and mania should not be used as cop outs to explain any behavior as they so often are in this sub the toxicology and autopsy reports were performed after 3 or 4 weeks submersion iirc so i will let you decide how much weight you place in those results i am mostly play devil advocate here i do not know what happened and the psychotic break theory is compelling but presenting it as a proven fact and down voting alternate scenarios goes against the health of this sub imo ,-5,UnresolvedMysteries

bsmith7028,you certainly are cherry picking what evidence you are listening to you have a girl who claimed she was being stalked ending up in a water tank with a video where she is acting strangely and could be hiding from someone there just as much evidence of foul play as there is that she has a psychotic episode its completely subjective depending on how you interpret the video the fact that she was bipolar does not explain her psychosis unless she was misdiagnosed and actually suffered from schizophrenia look up the differences between bipolar and schizophrenic psychosis i think that definitely possible but once again it nothing close to being a fact why and how she ended up in the tank is not resolved no matter how strongly you believe in your chosen theory ,-11,UnresolvedMysteries

bsmith7028,that a compromise indictment to get a grand jury indictment you only need nine jurors to agree that there probable cause a much lower standard than proving beyond reasonable doubt in a jury trial at the time there was not enough evidence to indict either for murder as they could not prove which one actually committed the crime but they gambled that they could find probable cause to say that they a placed the child in an unsafe environment obviously she was murdered or hindered the investigation attempted a cover up i assume the accessory obstruction charge refers to one spouse covering for the other even if burke is guilty i do not believe it would have been handled in that manner at that time with the immense pressure to close the case i think if they truly believed they had evidence that burke was responsible they would have closed the case then he would have made the perfect scapegoat under colorado law he could not even be indicted it would have saved bpd face without the ramifications and risks of a trial ,13,UnresolvedMysteries
bsmith7028,i am sorry you felt attacked i just did not personally think terms like leap or stretch were all that aggressive i will make sure to wear my kiddy gloves from now on someone stood off to the side and yelled bullshit and then did not add anything that what you have done no i pointed out exactly why your assumptions were bullshit see ask and ye shall receive i am not going back over them again because it obviously would not do any good or stimulate a productive discussion ,-1,UnresolvedMysteries
bsmith7028, i am fairly familiar with the case and have been for years i have read multiple books saw the shows etc but one thing i have never understood is when the burke did it scenario went from a possibility to a widely held belief i am honestly trying to wrap my head around why people are so adamant about it especially enough to try and pass it off as an accepted fact other than the fact that he was in the house and some weak pineapple evidence that could mean a million different things what evidence points towards him that not just absolute speculation which is obviously not evidence i know about the boot print but that also a non starter because there was no way to know how long it had been there to begin with so again why is that theory so popular also why do the rdi hardliners attribute the lack of evidence pointing towards the ramseys to a bungled police investigation but immediately dismiss any intruder theories due to the lack of evidence as well does it not work both ways ,118,UnresolvedMysteries

bsmith7028,gotcha although i am still hesitant to say that his demeanor is cause to judge whether he would be capable of covering up his own daughter murder i think that on a whole nother level than putting up a wall while on camera or in public ,3,UnresolvedMysteries
bsmith7028,ugh i hate when someone judged by their demeanor or mannerisms he probably an introverted guy who lived out of the public eye for the most part in spite of being labelled as his own sister murderer and or rapist since he was nine friggin years old i would not expect him to go on dr phil in front of a studio audience and knowing the entire country will be watching the broadcast and act as naturally as a movie star ,28,UnresolvedMysteries
bsmith7028,he not the most openly emotional guy but that does not indicate that he capable of anything on the a e doc he seemed genuine and i have cannot remember anyone calling him cold maybe stoic or even detached but the guy has lost two daughters and a wife and one of his sons has been all but crucified in the public eye as a murderer and or molester which he has also had to deal with for the past twenty years if he is innocent i do not know if he is or not i used to think he was involved in some form or fashion but i just cannot say one way or another now then i cannot blame him for being a little detached i just hate when anyone whether it damien echols darlene routier burke etc is analyzed in this fashion for their demeanor people act differently it does not necessarily mean anything ,7,UnresolvedMysteries
bsmith7028,what gets me about the rdi subscribers who wo not even consider an outsider is that they love to throw up the bungled investigation as to why there was not sufficient evidence to charge the ramseys but when an intruder theory is brought up they immediately bring up the lack of evidence unaware of the irony i have also noticed how quickly some in the bdi camp will have a conniption when the touch dna is brought up saying it useless which i agree but then accept equally worthless evidence pineapple poop boot print the almost certainly nonexistent sexual abuse as a smoking gun i am not necessarily in either camp i used to be firmly in the rdi camp although never in the bdi but i have since come around to being agnostic about who responsible it drives me mad when either side presents their opinion as fact when any theory is almost purely speculation in this case ,17,UnresolvedMysteries
bsmith7028,based on what ,2,UnresolvedMysteries
bsmith7028,that a hell of a story but it quite a leap to actually try and present that as fact as far as i know the only evidence of his fecal problems was when he was acting out during patsy first bout with cancer when burke was six which does not seem as abnormal under the circumstances to assume he was still playing with shit as a nine year old is a stretch if there evidence which i do not know of please correct me there also no evidence of sexual abuse the postmortem analysis is disputed but her pediatrician and others deny that there was ever any indication of abuse either mentally or physically i have seen bedwetting be brought up as evidence which is crazy on its own plenty of young kids went the bed whether they are abused or not the ransom note is harder to explain but i could see it used as a red herring or misdirection from an intruder as much as i could from jon benet own family i am not saying the ramseys were not involved in some form or fashion but the above scenario is 100 speculation with no evidence to back it up and it seems highly unlikely if not improbable it would be a fine if highly disturbing piece of fiction though asnu tishmiamor said there is plenty of precedent for a killer rapist assaulting a victim in their home regardless of whether there were other residents at home or not as far as your last sentence remember that the ramsey residence is huge and she was found in the basement probably as far away from the other inhabitants as possible ,14,UnresolvedMysteries
bsmith7028,i am fairly familiar with the case and have been for years i have read multiple books saw the shows etc but one thing i have never understood is when the burke did it scenario went from a possibility to a widely held belief i am honestly trying to wrap my head around why people are so adamant about it especially enough to try and pass it off as an accepted fact other than the fact that he was in the house and some weak pineapple evidence that could mean a million different things what evidence points towards him that not just absolute speculation which is obviously not evidence i know about the boot print but that also a non starter because there was no way to know how long it had been there to begin with so again why is that theory so popular ,17,UnresolvedMysteries
bsmith7028,where would that particular factory be located also are they hiring ,6,UnresolvedMysteries
bsmith7028,also because of the bungled investigation i do not believe we can whittle down the chance that it was an intruder down to 1 in fact i do not think we can even ascribe percentages to it especially when you have different detectives who worked the case at the same time who come to such different conclusions ,8,UnresolvedMysteries

bsmith7028,so lots of kids have behavioral problems between the threads about burke ramsey and damien echols on here you would be led to believe that mental or emotional health is tied directly to someone guilt or innocence while that can be used as corroborating evidence on it own it means absolutely nothing thankfully ,22,UnresolvedMysteries

bsmith7028, edit lest this comes off the wrong way the a e doc also involves people who believe the ramseys are guilty although it does cast considerable doubt and mostly focuses on the intruder theory it does feature people who were upset the ramseys were not indicted it does pretty much dispel the burke theory though i think the a e doc was very well done and went fairly deep into every aspect of the case i get that it did not appeal to the popular burke did it crowd which is a very popular pet theory around here and that turns some people off but if you go into it with an open mind and not pretending that you know for sure what happened i think you will find it a fascinating documentary for those who do not like the fact that john ramsey was involved i do not know what to say other than why would not you want to hear from the only living person who was an adult in the house that night i have never been convinced of his guilt or innocence and i am still not but i thought he came off as sincere and candid i also noticed a few people stating that john ramsey funded this documentary is there an actual credible source for that info or is it just bullshit conjecture to tarnish the film i know all about beckner ama and that he also subscribes to the bdi theory and even that covered in the show the other detectives for the most part all cast doubt on burke being the culprit most convincingly for me was the one who interviewed burke that day before he had even known that his sister had been murdered and only thought she was missing i think his word has a little more credibility than any armchair sleuth no matter how many books the sleuth has read on the subject the a e documentary also does a lot to dispel the rumors of jon benet being sexually abused regardless whether you think it was john patsy burke or an intruder you do not know none of us do i see a lot of people in this thread stating different theories as fact and that gets under my skin i have not seen the american murder doc yet but if it focuses more on gut feeling than fact i do not care to see it anyway ,9,UnresolvedMysteries

bsmith7028,first of all you are seriously straw manning as no one said anything about taxing the rich raising the minimum wage or the dmv the usps has made remarkable strides in the past four years and is now comparable in reliability to fedex and ups while remaining cheaper so that argument is a non starter anyway as far as being able to sue oil and auto companies for health or environmental damage well that a little late do not you think i would rather have protections there to prevent damages from incurring instead of reimbursements after the fact no one ever said the answer was taxing the rich however taxes that disproportionately affect the poor is certainly not the answer either all it does is widen the gap between classes and exasperate the resentment whether or not we should raise the minimum wage is irrelevant to the argument of doing away with it i am not even going to get into whether paying employees as little as you want is a good idea or not because it just ridiculous safety net programs may need to be reformed but that not the same as abolishing them our initiatives to make sure our poorest are not starving in the street is a major factor that separates us from third world country we are supposed to take care of our own getting rid of our regulatory and protection agencies many of which were formed directly because of the abuses incurred during a time in history where the main tenets of libertarianism were in place is also a terrible idea time and time again it been demonstrated that trusting industries to not harm the environment or treat their employees with basic human decency never works that not mentioning from trusting the pharmaceutical and food industries who try to skirt health and safety provisions even with regulatory agencies in place yet somehow we are supposed to trust them to police themselves i suppose we could always put together a class action lawsuit against the offending companies and perhaps get paid for our suffering three to five years after the fact ,1,news

bsmith7028,who poses a bigger threat to them and brown people over here hillary or trump because those are your two choices i wish they were not but at some point you have got to come down to earth and accept that it down to one of the two i get idealistically sticking to your principles i honestly do but after a certain point such as after its mathematically impossible or at the very least improbable for your favorite candidate to win it time to start thinking realistically about the choices in front of you and figure out which direction you want the country to go so look at the choices we are presented we got trump who even if you discard his statements about muslims and the hateful policies he proposed about immigration has threatened to seize iraqi oil break our deal with iran send 30 000 troops to the me to fight isis and kill all the family members of isis fighters on the other hand hillary main criticism regarding me affairs is her 2002 vote on the iraq war which the majority of democrats moderate or liberal alike also supported why because there was supposedly hard evidence that wmd existed that what everyone seems to forget she lamented that vote and no one would suggest that she would have went that way had she known the wmd intelligence was bunk she also spoke out at the time that her decision was no taken lightly and the actual proposal she voted for required that sanctions and diplomacy be tried before a military invasion although the bush administration did not live up to that provision she repeatedly regretted and admitted that the vote was a mistake before i am done i am going to pretend that sanders is a viable choice and look at his history his record does not reflect the peacenik appearance he tries to portrait either he may not have voted for the iraq invasion is 2002 but he did vote twice in 1998 for the america to initiate a regime change in iraq and forcefully remove saddam from power he supported operation desert fox which scores of civilians were killed anywhere from dozens to 600 2000 depending on the source it should be noted that in both of those votes there was far more opposition than there was during the 2002 vote in 2001 he voted for bush aumf which for all practical purposes have bush the unilateral power to wage war on anyone he wanted he supported obama clustering in libya and suggested that we should have had an expanded presence in the syrian civil war he also supported continuing obama drone program which has killed how many innocent civilians in the middle east the only difference between hillary vote and bernie is that she admitted making a mistake and regrets it while bernie has not do not give me any bullshit about brown people in the middle east ,2,SandersForPresident

bsmith7028,what you are failing to grasp is the definition of the definition of sexism which is what this whole side tangent is about there is no prejudice or discrimination in standing up when a female enters the room so labelling it sexist is an erroneous use of the term whether or not treating sexes differently is inherently wrong is debatable but using sexist to describe benign instances like the one above trivializes the term especially when compared to serious cases of sexism it no different than decrying bet or black history month as racist ,0,AskReddit
bsmith7028,sexism by it original definition https en m wikipedia org wiki sexism implies that prejudicial or discriminatory behavior is taking place there are all sorts of fields of study and theories about what denotes sexism and i am not going to pretend to know them so i wo not say your definition is wrong i do think that applying the term sexism to any situation where a male and female are treated differently no matter how trivial does more harm than good obfuscates truly hurtful sexism ,0,AskReddit

bsmith7028, haha what i apologize for overwhelming you let me try and simplify it in the discussions i have had and witnessed with trump supporters about the second amendment the main argument against expanded gun control is that like it or not the right to bear arms is absolute and should not be imposed upon the argument for gun control is usually that it an issue with public safety that one right to go into a public space without worrying about a nutjob with a gun should trump one right to carry a firearm or some variation of that scenario the pro second amendment crowd is usually quick to point out that knee jerk policies instated in the name of public safety do more harm than good otoh when it comes to banning muslim immigrants or the closing down or increasing surveillance at mosques the argument reverses and the same ones who were so adamantly against restricting the second amendment in the name of public safety are now all for restricting the first amendment in you guessed it the name of public safety the right or lack thereof for non citizens to emigrate is not cut and dry either it been debated since the founding of the country but i digress if that part of my post bothers you just focus on trump statements about closing down mosques the argument that only mosques that conduct radicalist views is inherently flawed how would that be determined the nature of islamic radicalism makes it almost impossible to distinguish from regular islam as they use the same texts teachings etc i highly doubt radicals plan terroristic attacks out in the open during jum ah ,1,AskTrumpSupporters

bsmith7028,my brother got a twenty year split sentence for a murder in which the victim was never identified his girlfriend at the time picked up a hispanic drug dealer believed to have been an immigrant from mexico or guatemala at a bar and subsequently took him to an abandoned house and shot him she then called my brother and under false pretenses got him to come to the scene at the time he was in the midst of an extreme meth and opiate addiction and not exactly in good standing with law enforcement and he agreed to help dispose of the body they dumped him in a well around nine months later they were picked up after she confessed to her ex husband who was locked up for separate crimes and he turned around and gave them up my brother got out last year after serving ten the female will likely do her full life sentence ,10,UnresolvedMysteries

bsmith7028,i worked in a distribution center for a major online retailer it was in the middle of peak season a week or so before christmas and management brings over a lot of people from another department to help out because it gets extremely hectic around that time of year my supervisor tells me to quickly explain the job to the ones they just brought over ninety percent of the stuff we shipped in our department was idiot proof you just slap a shipping label on the box and send it down the line there are a few items though that come packed in bulk and you have to manually open the case and separate the items unfortunately for me i was in a huge rush that night and forgot to explain the second part i did not realize it until i was on my way home so instead of a ton of customers receiving the item they ordered they received a whole case the most expensive item that was packaged that way was beats headphones which i think came four or six to a box i did not get in any official trouble because technically training was not my responsibility and i should not have been put in that situation in the first place however despite being one of the best workers they had and having the highest average production rate on our shift they started cutting my hours and forcing me out and i was laid off pretty quickly after that ,1,AskReddit

bsmith7028,what i do not understand is the bernie supporters who now say they will vote for trump despite the fact that hillary platform is extremely close to sanders and trump platform is the antithesis of sanders it just goes to show that a lot of people no longer care about the actual issues which are the most important part of an election it easy for middle to upper class straight white people to say vote for trump and burn it all down when they are not the ones whose lives will be directly impacted if his proposals bear fruit it all abstract to them there are numerous stories of brexit supporters who voted leave almost on a lark because they wanted change by any means without actually considering what it entailed and now regret that decision ,1,AskReddit

bsmith7028,her views on gay marriage are no different than the majority of people her age time is not static the views of people and society evolve as far as the world is going to shit so let speed it up and vote for trump that a fucking stupid and harmful worldview you may treat politics as a game and vote in elections on a lark but people whose lives with be direct impacted and harmed by a trump administration if he able to push through even a fraction of his proposals do not treat it so carelessly ,0,AskReddit
bsmith7028,a rather large portion of sanders supporters have bought into the bullshit propaganda that originated with the gop there one major misconception that repeated in your title op no corruption has been proven i get that she hassome unlikable qualities and that she a career politician and has all the baggage that inherent with members of the political elite and if that your issue with her then that understandable but it seems that most of the hillary denouncers believe any negative thing spouted about her no matter how dubious the source the loudest and most fervent ones remind me of the obama birthers from 2008 ,1,AskReddit
bsmith7028,on it own no the pressure of being accused or even suspected could cause someone with an already fragile disposition to end it all of course there are also cases where a perpetrator commits suicide out of guilt or fear of repercussion i think the bottom line is that you cannot draw any conclusions from someone committing suicide ,1,UnresolvedMysteries

bsmith7028,it common here in the southern united states as well i mean i can see where it can lead to an awkward situation when you are unsure if you should hold it open or not because the next person is kinda far away or if you are the person they are holding the door for and you feel like you should sprint so they are not holding the door for a long time but ultimately it feels like such a trivial non issue that it really stunned me that people bitched so much about it ,1,AskReddit
bsmith7028,thank you and yeah i have considered the risk and ultimately decided to post it anyway as i have inadvertently ended up discussing this on much more public forums like facebook so far i have not caught any flak for it there another case which is just over a year old that i had planned on writing up but it would be difficult to do it justice without putting myself out there so i think i am gonna pass on it i did go back and change a few things that could be seen as inflammatory and also took out a few parts where i overcharged ,4,UnresolvedMysteries

bsmith7028,yes but the united states has been commonly referred to as the singular america since the 18th century if anyone is referring to a country called america they are referring to the united states when people refer to americans 9 times out of 10 they are referring to citizens of the united states not any country in central or south america or canada even central south americans refer to citizens of the america as americanos despite the fact that they too technically live in the the american continents we are both right in this situation america can refer to a set of continents but without a qualifier it more commonly refers to the america when irving berlin wrote god bless america and when trump says he will make america great again they are not referring to south or central american countries the problem with the original discussion i linked to is the other guy could not accept the fact that neither one of us was wrong ,1,AskReddit
bsmith7028,the self righteousness of some redditors i saw a guy tell a story that may have included smoking a joint and driving although it was not pertinent to the point of the story and it was actually referred to as a mistake but he was quickly downvoted and another redditor called him a horrible human being for driving high the part i found most appalling was the same guy who insulted him had many posts supporting eugenics and had suggested that in the zoo incident in cleveland that the little kid should have been shot instead of the gorilla i was speechless ,1,AskReddit
bsmith7028,this is one that i do not believe is part of reddit culture as much as culture in general ,1,AskReddit

bsmith7028,me too if we end up with a trump administration it will be just as much the fault of the tin foil hat liberals who have bought into the anti hillary propaganda that originated from the gop there are possible legal issues with clinton although nothing proven so far but for the most part the shit that repeated about her is about as legitimate as the obama birther bs ,1,AskReddit

bsmith7028,thanks for the info i assume that the investigator probably just misspoke or just called it ballistics for short there was a pistol in the statement and he may have lumped them together and the shotgun was identified by other means perhaps blood residue or something ,7,UnresolvedMysteries
bsmith7028, strangely enough roy brother daughter widow and the man his widow married after roy death all have since died at the wrong end of a gun his son also died under mysterious circumstances and his autopsy report has never been released ,15,UnresolvedMysteries
bsmith7028,thats always driven me crazy wondering what they meant by that here a direct quote from the first newspaper article field said ballistics tests showed that the shotgun and pistol were two of the three weapons used in the original thread u aftercourse and u pmar chimed in aftercourse speculated that maybe since it was a sawed off the spread would be unique and traceable here pmar comment i have not gone through all the links yet but nothing is said so far about what type of shells were used some types of slugs can sometimes be possible to match but i think the better explanation might be that the shotgun was linked by other means blood for example and that the term ballistics tests was used since anytime forensic tests of any sort is done on a firearm it often gets lumped into the ballistics fold by the time a newspaper sometimes even prosecutors gets a hold of the info ,7,UnresolvedMysteries
bsmith7028,i never understood how someone could bully or harass the family of a tragedy like that nothing makes me madder than reading how nikki catsouras family was targeted after her death the porsche girl incident or how anonymous people would call tabitha tuders parents after she went missing and either act like her or talk horribly about her things like that make me wish i believe that hell is real so those fuckers could burn ,17,UnresolvedMysteries

bsmith7028, it not for everybody but the 12 steps sincerely help a lot of people do not be disparaging towards others for what helps them especially if you have no first hand experience with the hold addiction can put on someone i am an atheist but i have seen other addicts who i would never think would ever have any long term sobriety completely turn their life around because of their faith in my experience in recovery christians or whatever religion tend to be some of the least judgmental religious people of course there are exceptions but i would never speak begrudgingly about whatever path someone uses to get clean ,4,Music
bsmith7028,the na meetings i attended framed it more as things are beyond your control you could interpret that as there being some god or fate or literally any way you want it is a very helpful realization for most addicts that there are circumstances that they have absolutely no affect on and have to deal with things as they come it may seem obvious to most people and even some addicts but a major factor in addiction is control specifically of emotions david berman has a line that goes you cannot change the feeling but you can change the feeling about the feeling which to me is saying the same thing that the na aa doctrine is trying to convey ,1,Music

bsmith7028,your statement would have been ok if you left out one word solely first of all no company or group of companies were solely responsible for the market crash they certainly contributed but their actions were made possible by nearly three decades of deregulation started under reagan and going on all the way through george w of all the presidents in that period clinton policies had the least to do with the market crash i believe he has some responsibility because he did nothing to put a rein in on the lack of oversight on wall street but i cannot say that any of his policies had a hand in what happened in 2008 the repeal of glass steagall in 1999 was nothing more than symbolic it had already been completely gutted by the time clinton took office he still complicit in my view for his inaction especially considering some warning signs were already starting to appear but compared to reagan hw bush and w bush his role in the crisis is miniscule ,1,AskReddit

bsmith7028,my brother was involved in a murder and just finished his sentence last year he acquired an addiction to meth around the time he turned 30 by that time he had owned a home multiple vehicles had a very successful life but you know the story and he lost everything there were no red flags beforehand but it was a spur of the moment thing so i guess there might not be but from the time of the murder until he was arrested he was a different man you could tell something inside him snapped the tenuous grip he had on reality withered away to nothing and he was as far out there as i have ever seen anyone it should be worth noting that none of us knew anything about the murder until after he was arrested which was a little over a year after the murder took place i am glad he was arrested and sentenced to do serious time because it saved his life at the pace he was on i doubt he would have lasted another six months ,75,AskReddit

bsmith7028,if you stuff anything in an exhaust pipe if it completely blocked pressure will build until the object is ejected mythbusters did an episode about this by trying to stall a car ala beverly hills cop for backed up exhaust to enter the cab there would have to be a leak in the exhaust system which does offer one theory for why the rag was there maybe someone was checking to see if there was a leak if the car ran fine and did not shoot the rag out of the pipe that would mean there had to be some other outlet for the fumes to escape ,1,mauramurray
bsmith7028,unless there was a crack somewhere in the body and system the exhaust would not enter the cab of the car if it was completely blocked pressure would build until the rag was ejected also if you were to ball up a rag and stuff it in the pipe the side of the rag facing out would be fairly clean so it would not be hard to tell the color i am guessing it was either placed there after the fact or there was enough airflow that it did not affect the car performance one way or another ,2,mauramurray

bsmith7028,i read a quote somewhere in reference to using occam razor when discussing human behavior about how it not appropriate because human nature on an individual basis is a extremely more random than most people realize i think that argument works in this case too you could glean from those statistics that nine year olds did not commit a substantial number of unsolved murders but using statistics to attempt to clear any subject is pointless and flawed fwiw despite following the case almost since it happened i do not have a pet theory about it but i also do not buy into the bdi theory i just think it wrongheaded to exclude anyone based on x people do not do that if it physically possible and to my knowledge it is he fair game a five or six year old would be different edit while i still think crunching numbers to include or exclude a suspect is iffy the murder vs accident aspect threw me off if you concede a nine year old can accidentally kill someone via rough housing playing i really dont understand your point if this was burke whose to say it was not accidental or a heat of the moment type deal does anyone really suggest otherwise ,5,UnresolvedMysteries

bsmith7028,i am going to hold off on judging the teacher for the tone of his rebuttal as i do not know how i would feel after twenty years of being demonized for a crime i was never charged with and having my entire personal life scrutinized by some armchair detectives without access to the proper case files as a true crime buff i am guilty of making some assumptions based on what little i can glean from articles episodes books assorted media about cases but i try to keep in mind that i am not getting the complete story and that in america you are still innocent until proven guilty i try to err on the side of caution when discussing suspects or poi who have not been convicted or even charged especially on the web where a simple google of someone name can have real life consequences a lot of the sleuths on websleuths and other sites do not always practice as much restraint that one reason i prefer this sub to other true crime forums i concede i have sometimes gotten wrapped up in a case and not abided by this myself i am not trying to single anybody out after reading the post by the teacher i just tried to step back and try to see it from his point of view i also have an immediate family member who spent a decade in prison for murder and i have read what some have written about him her and how different the reality of the situation was from what even the newspapers published much less what bystanders had to say about the case a stand alone conversation about the ethics that go along with discussing true crime and active and past investigations would be interesting i believe ,9,UnresolvedMysteries
