HB3234,without background as to what kind of things you are replying to in this way i am so curious about your conversations is i know your personal filler for mhm type affirmations is he saying things which you really do already know and do not need to be told is he being condescending is he a boring conversationalist does he retell the same stories do you have an encyclopedic knowledge of the world so many questions ,1,RedPillWomen
HB3234,i think for you drawing boundaries in your interactions would be more beneficial than trying to bring rpw to her if she gets upset when you do not share your relationship details that a problem she is demanding your emotional intimacy without being the kind of person who invites it naturally and that is not how it works no wonder you are irritated with her and feel the urge to tell her she is not all that i would too but it really is not the right response i would suggest you let her know you are not interested in sharing and cite how judgemental she was last time depending on your relationship you can do this frankly or humorously but do scale back how often you see her if you can help it if she an unavoidable fixture at social events hone the art of deflecting questions turning her conversational attention back onto her and quickly extracting yourself from the interaction with her ,1,RedPillWomen
HB3234,you seem weirdly and unhealthily invested in taking this acquaintancs down a few notches she is not a close friend so this is not your place to bring up frankly unless she point blank is asking for advice i would advise you not to say anything at all can i ask why it concerns you so much is she condtantly pestering you and your social group with stories you would rather hear less of is she hounding for advice she does not really heed ,1,RedPillWomen

HB3234,woah it a huge red flag that he dismisses and minimizes your concerns as shallow are you familiar with communicating feelings and needs using i statements it sounds like you may be served by employing them in this situation but if he keeps dismissing your needs it a dire situation because it shows he does not really want to fix problems he just wants you to shut up about them ,3,RedPillWomen
HB3234,is it possible he mentioned he likes long hair in an attempt to validate you if you have short hair and are growing it out was he possibly at any level trying clumsily to reassure you that he likes the long hair you are shifting to no doubt his execution made you feel bad in any case but a good intent could take the edge off the sting work on being secure in yourself when you feel insecure about small things ask yourself can i work on this thing i am insecure about and will it inprove both my health and happiness if i pursue improvements if yes to both make a game plan and when you feel bad remind yourself it is a work in progress and you need to be a kind loving compassionate and patient friend to yourself if no to either remind yourself why this thing is not realistic for you to alter ie no one looks like a photoshopped covergirl not even the model herself instead try to ground yourself by reminding yourself of your other fantastic attributes you may not be the tallest woman but you have an enormous heart and a sky high capacity to get things done under pressure and that makes you pretty fantastic itll feel weird at first but in time you will find pathways of communication with yourself that feel authentic genuine and which you believe that where you really become your own ally amd advocate and are able to manage issues like this jealousy ,2,RedPillWomen
HB3234,even though your wife is trying it coming after fifteen years you instinctively know it will be a long slog toward a sex life that may never be satisfying and yet here is a woman with whom it is satisfying off the bat of course you want to leave and i think it reasonable to do so it may be a case of too little too late though i repeat the caution about leaping right into the arms of the other woman in terms of any long term commitments make sure you are not falling for the 80 20 effect where you idealize someone who provides the 20 your so does not as if they are 100 ,11,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,do you know why you do not get turned on or enjoy sex is it him his technique have you ever had satisfying sex with him or anyone else do your masturbate can you bring yourself to orgasm without amswers to those questions my initial assumption is you are sexually inexperienced and have not had good sex yet and you need to explore your sexuality on your own and with your partner ,1,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,in my experience re femininity some very small things will make you seem very feminine 1 learn validation and active listening techniques apply liberally these techniques are often socially conditioned into us to varying degrees and are what make a woman seem warm nurturing soft utilize them skillfully and you will be seen as more feminine almost instantly and a great conversationalist though most people will struggle to put their finger on quite why you are magic 2 show an active concern for those around you and take care of them in little ways 3 watch how you bond with people look up male bonding v s female bonding there actually a great ted talk that i will try to find it is a blue pill perapective that highlights how men and women form platonic bonds differently and how this affects women in the work force but basically she states that men bond with each other by challenging each other and talking shit while women bond by cooperating on tasks and sharing advice compliments so if you want to read as more feminine an easy way is to stop bonding via talking shit and start collaborating ,19,RedPillWomen

HB3234,a rejection will sting anyone ego but for most adults it a momentary thing and they will be just fine to be honest this is true with a flat out no or a subtle deflection so you have to accept that and be comfortable with that just as anyone approaching you needs to be comfortable with the idea of rejection these are easier in scenarios so say you are at a conference and boozing it up because conference someone hits on you at the bar and you can say that very sweet kind generous of you that was a good one but i have to admit i really am just at this conference to learn about x and nothing more exciting how are you enjoying the lectures on y this gives him a chance to answer your question and then leave of his own accord saving face or to keep talking if you have something interesting to discuss if he a decent guy he wo not push it hard though if he is really interested he may test the waters to see if you were just being coy of course this only works if you are open to either possibility if you want him to leave at once you will have to be more firm ,3,RedPillWomen
HB3234,what i am going to write will soundvery harsh but i only bothered because you sound self aware and introspective enough to put it to good use if you are coming across as defensive with a woman that is a screaming red flag if someone does not appear confident and secure they do not register as attractive sure that is one part but also for us a defensive guy reads as a threat because insecurity is at the root of many abusive behaviors from physical violence to emotional abuse so at an animal level we are anxious around defensive people so say you talk to a girl at a party well you are short or not conventionally attractive strike one but she talks to you because hey you may still be a great guy but then you are boring strike two if you lack outward beauty you need to becharming in spades to make up for it inner beauty or whatever but say she sticks with it for a bit because hey maybe you will be less shy maybe you will warm up and then you start to read as defensive so now you are setting off subconscious alarm bells strike three you are out she will leave in the span of three sentences because you are not appealing at all you cannot help your height but it also the least consequential of the three you can absolutely be a short but witty hilarious charismastic interesting passionate man ie hot imo an app like tinder can help you really gauge your relative attractiveness based on who you match with this is only a useful exercise if your photos are honest never ask people outright no one wants to have to tell another they are unattractive in some way never ask someone and expect the truth when it comes to attraction only actions matter ,7,RedPillWomen

HB3234, my stomach is not very flat and sometimes rolls during some sex positions look i am a woman with washboard abs and my stomach rolls in some sexual positions because when you scrunch your midsection the skin has to roll this is how bodies work when they obey the laws of physics and no quantity of weight loss ever will change this you have married a man who is either gay or immensely sexually immature and i am so so so sorry i cannot imagine how terribly hurtful this must be but please do not internalize these things as your fault you can not change yourself or your behavior to be more attractive to him the good and bad news is that there is nothing on earth you can do to make this man attracted to you we say on here so often that you cannot negotiate desire ,2,DeadBedrooms

HB3234,yeah i have been making these arrangements for about 4 months now ,2,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,ugh how awful i have absolutely noticed that people who zone out shamelessly still manage to take offense when treated this way and do not seem to accept the inconsistency when pointed out i wish i understood why but i guess their dysfunction is not my business i just have to leave them single and at it ,1,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,i cannot tell if you are being facetious ,1,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,a male friend who will never want you sexually is interestingly worth his weight in gold while a boyfriend who will never want you sexually is not worth his weight in dryer lint you have exponentially increased the value of this relationship and opened your life to a more fulfilling future relationship it hurts now but you did the wise and kind thing ,22,DeadBedrooms

HB3234,he has offered more sex in the last few weeks but i do not know if it is related to that or just hysterical bonding 2 weeks ago he asked where we were moving once i graduated and i let him know that i was not open to taking a db relationship into the next phase of my life i did not mean to spill the beans but oop it just blurted out of me he interpreted my words to mean he had one last chance and has been offering all kinds of hysterical bonding but i have been turning it down no need to sample the buffet of what could have been ,20,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,in the early db when i loved him and wanted him still the intimacy would have made me feel very loved it would have let me coast no expectations mid db i would only have been open if it was part of a step to reestablishing intimacy now nope you do not get any affection or validation out of me sorry not sorry i give you food water shelter and that all i owe you ,4,DeadBedrooms

HB3234,i like this perspective a lot i think i am going to try to incorporate it more ,3,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,this op is already leaning toward leaving in that context i do not think we can expect this person to want to go above and beyond reasonable norms the post is literally asking internet strangers for reasons to stay in other situations i might reccomend keeping lines of communication more open talking more being reassuring etc but this level of investment is what is informing my advice ,1,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,it is unclear to me whose perspective you are speaking from and what this refers to do you mind elaborating or clarifying for me ,1,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,i would really really advise against considering this great partner behavior it is not healthy for comfort to have to flow in the direction of worst affected to less affected and can make someone already trying to manage recovery from surgery and now sudden loss of a sex life feel like they are not already a good great partner if they do not bend over backwards to accomodate someone who ought to reasonably be accomodating them ,5,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,he is more traumatized by your trauma than you are managing his reaction and making him feel better about what you suffered is not your problem tell him once you suggest he contact the hospital for counseling usually just one or two sessions after something like this can be very helpful to unpack fears be clear to him that you are not ok with a sexless relationship and that it would be an absolte deal breaker for you ,5,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,you cite reasons you just do not pin them on her aka say you feel there is am incompatibility you recognize now it is rooted in you you want to split because you do not think it is a fixable issue just a basic sexual mismatch i doubt she will actnsurprised or question it in depth she probably knows as well as you do ,2,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,i can almost guarantee you that the 12 years of refusing your partner sex have already wrecked her said loud and clear you are not attracted to her you do not need to speak on that because you have already communicated it instead just explain that you want a split and for both of you to find more sexually compatible life partners ,14,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,ime if you have to threaten breakup to get something addressed that person is not worth your time you are so young you have plenty of time and opportunity to find an hl partner who will cherish you amd wo not ignore you your needs until you are at a breaking point i promise no man that is selfish in bed is the one who got away the correct category is dodged bullet ,8,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,you said in your post that i would do everything to avoid sex with your gf it sounds like she really wanted you when you were not all there and available now you are available and she does not want sex with you but also thinks missing you via a break may help her the grass is sexier on the side of the fence you cannot touch sounds like she has a pursuer attachment style and you were the avoidant attachment partner now you are pursuing and she is responding in perhaps the only script she knows might be worth looking at adult attachment styles sidebar has some stuff iirc and talking to her about those patterns if you see that it does fit your lived experiences but i also have to add that in my heart of hearts i feel you are wasting your time with this woman based on the brief history in your post one of you has almost always been turning the other down basic sexual incompatibility from almost the start ,1,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,wow that is literal emotioanl abuse you do not do that to people you care about he is holding you hostage to the relationship via guilt trips and crazy ones too managing his stress levels is not your fucking job and anyway that not really how cancer works i am sorry you are going through this ,3,DeadBedrooms

HB3234,you are working to save your marriage and give your child a happier home that the big picture no matter what your faith all religious leaders are in the job specifically because they felt called to guide and inspire and help people through their struggles and to do it with a happy heart your case is no different there is no shame whatever in seeking that help and acknowledging things are not perfect if you do not want to divulge exactly the nature of the problem you can atleast just ask for the counseling reccomendations good luck ,4,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,would it be possible for you to go to your religious leader and seek guidance on finding faith based counseling for you individually to heal these hurts and also as a couple if marriage is sacred and divorce is a sin within your faith community walking out of a sexual partnership is likely an egregious offense as well he needs to do his work ,5,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,i mean depending on your partners openness about her toys it could also be here is a bag in a closet my partner is unlikely to dig theough stuff i am embrassed to have in the open goes here but your gut reaction is informed by so much more than mine you know her have history and background etc ,2,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,yea this is exactly how i feel too good advice for the next she had literally years to show you she cared did not only when what she wanted was threatened did she decide to try to change that is not genuine and that is not how you demonstrate care you made the right decision do not look back ,44,DeadBedrooms

HB3234,woman here but i think it would be tied to the length of the db if it a 4 month db and i saw 4 months of fix yeah absolutely after years of a db i might be more leery also how they turn you down do they offer alternatives ie offer to help with hands are they dismissive in how they turn you down v s sympathetic gentle etc ,6,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,it came in waves for me in the beginning the waves of wanting to cheat leave etc were much shorter than the periods of quiet content stillness then the waves came more frequently then the waves which came were bigger and longer and more frequent finally i was living in the state of the wave i am on my way out the door 10 weeks ,2,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,in light of that do you really think it is petty to want a real sex life in your relationship ,2,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,ok reasonably what do you bring to the partnership he works 60 hrs and is financial support and emotional support surely you are his emotional support too do you keep the household running in terms of cooking and meal planning cleaning finances maintenance of vehicles etc ,3,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,like i said not the attitude of the sub but definitely the attitude of my community in our culture wives are still seem as subservient to husbands his word is law etc i think it is appalling but here we are i am doing what i want and need but i am getting some serious side eye for it ,1,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,think of leaving a db like a surgery to remove something making you ill when you wake up from surgery you are full of anesthesia dizzy in pain a little confused what just happened you are in a situation very very different from your normal you got sliced open that just what the breakup itself is like a few days to weeks out you are a little sore you are recovering from being sliced open the surgical wound is all you can feel some days you went through something big after all that what the early post breakup days are like a few months out you are healed up from the surgery you might have a scar from being sliced open but now that you are well you can appreciate that you were cut open to remove something bad without that festering sickness you now feel light free and healthy you are glad you went through those few months of recovering from surgery rather than feeling sick indefinitely that a few months post breakup when you have pieced your life back together yes it does not feel fantastic now yes it might not even feel fantastic two weeks from now yes that is ok and normal no that is not a sign you should go back to your ex hang in there heal up quick you are on the hard path to the road to happiness fulfillment right now please keep moving forward we are cheering for you ,13,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,you are just getting maintenance sex a lot of us in dbs complain it is not just about the act of sex it the being desired by your partner it does not sound like you have sex with your wife but just kind of in or on her she is present but not quite a participant ,10,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,the problem a lot of dbs have and that you are experiencing as well is that your needs are not being considered in this arena for most hls the story we hear from our lls all the time is that our libido needs do not matter and there is no compromise i want it 4 times a week and he wants it once a month we are gonna do it once a month for you you want it less but she wants it more and you are going to relent to her number she does not seem to consider your perspective here at all in both cases having your needs ignored in this very important arena can be exhausting and frustrating you are not in too different a boat from us despite living with an uhl so uh welcome and sorry you are here ,4,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,make sure that you are not just staying because you are falling for the ink cost fallacy 6 years feels long especially when you are young but the flip side is you are too young to be settling for a db if the woman could keep her hands off you for 6 years she has shown you who she is for a nearly half a decade believe her ,3,DeadBedrooms
HB3234, i do it daily so im at like 60 4 so 15 1 ratio hahaha ,1,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,some great examples another thing you can try is cite some things you do for him that you could not care less about because he cares and it makes him happy i know it kind of jarred my so when i let him know i always keep the counters and sink spotless for him messy kitchens bug him even though i am a sloppy person and it hurts me that he cares less for my happiness and libido than i care about the damn sink lol depending on how much you want to escalate the discussion you can also ask if since he has 0 libido and it does not matter to him if it would matter to him if you sought that help elsewhere it may help you explain that of he thinks that is unfair and wrong the flip side is true if he does not want to let you seek sex outside the partnership lack of libido is no excuse to walk out of the sexual relarionship completely either he cannot refuse you and demand celibacy of you long term ,6,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,i climb more now than before to cope i have always been active and and in good shape so i do not think i look any different but people compliment me more so something must be different ,3,DeadBedrooms

HB3234,he is saying i have issues he may also he silently saying i know i am like this please stop trying to frame it like this is something new to me i know as much as you do that we are not sexually functioning and if he knows he has issues and is not working to fix them his actions are saying something very important for you to hear i cannot be bothered with fixing this it is not worth the work ,7,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,thank you for the support itotally agree i do not mean to perpetuate these ideas just saying that how my community sees it nonwhite inmigrant community and its stifling ,2,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,you are 20 and dating a woman you are not sexually compatible with in terms of predicting long term happiness and success this is actually as bad as dating someone who is amazing in bed but who does not have anything else in common with you you can talk to her about it but at 20 you are way too young to be making it work in terms of sex i know you hate to hear that it hurts because it is true ,5,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,you hit the breaking point usually you see people here leave shortly after or stay and suffer deeply psychologically feelings of worthlessness powerlessness and or unattractiveness untik you are able to reassert to yourself you are worthy of love and are attractive and leave it is a painful process but once you shut down there almost no recovering that sense of love and goodwill to your partner the sooner you can extricate yourself from this suffering the better so sorry you have to go through it ,5,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,i feel this to my bones on one hand i am a terrible person if i leave a man because he wo not give me sex i am terrible if i cheat but he does not owe my anything or owe me to open the relationship i just owe him celibacy not the attitude of this sub but definitely the attitude of my community which does not value womens sexuality at all decided i would rather be a bad but happy person so i chose to leave ,5,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,that when you tell them they are treating you like schitst tell her if she does not shape up shale be looking for a new partner soon communicate ,21,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,so what she is saying to you is this is me take it or leave it i am not willing to work on this with you ,3,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,the advice here is sound and i wo not repeat it but is this a pattern in your relationship do you find that you do things for her that are actually for you my so does this and it exhausts me but also do you feel you need to give presents that take care of you because she does not step up to that plate i may be totally off base and projecting since it is a dynamic in my own relationship but just a thought ,5,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,ok where to start there is a lot going on here akd you have my empathy 1 it is ok normal reasonable healthy to have expectations expectation is not a dirty word try another synonym and see how it feels standards would you tell someone not to have standards 2 re cooking as a bonus forget the sex i would even argue that cooking is expected in a healthy adult relationship both partners should be able to out together healthy and tasty meals it is part of being a functional human being it is part of maintaining your physical health i feel like maybe your relationship with a deeply dysfunctional person has really skewed and pushed your idea of what it is and is not ok to expect out of a life partner 3 marriage is an inherently sexual relationship that is why monogamy is assumed inherent to it in our culture monogamy is the expectation you will be exclusively sexual with someone so yes you expect the sexual aspect as equally as you expect exclusivity 4 however what is not reasonable is to expect someone to change drastically after marriage especially if you were not already working on it if you had a db before marriage and did not address it when you asked her to share your life you signalled you approved of and wanted this relationship forever not saying you cannot ask your partner to change behaviors but if she fundamentally showed you how she is and who she is toward sexuality it is fundamentally incompatible you cannot expect a marriage contract to change that dynamic in any significant way 5 it is not too soon to annul your union 6 ptsd is not a life sentence there are treatments that can literally put the reactivity in the past what treatment plan is she on ,6,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,thank you i hope you two are able to find a resolution you are happy with whatever it may be ,1,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,he wants to feel wanted wothout having to invest effort or energy or make himself vulnerable stop rewarding his behavior with the affirmation that makes him feel wanted ,2,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,he is addicted to an illegal substance you did not see how bad it it because it happened so slowly that is how it always does you are not bad or stupid for not seeing this what it boils down to he is an addict and taking you along on the ride of his highs and lows though it a bit of an unconventional substance this is the same pattern all actively using drug addicts drag their sos through i suggest you look into resources or support for spouses of addicts because that can help you formulate next steps ,7,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,yeah it was an absolutely awful holiday season for me the next one will be better alone i can celebrate my friends and family freely free of that crushing sense of being not good enough unloved ,6,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,i go through this exact thought process but lately ive been telling myself that the answer is none of my business wether he is willfully obtuse or just very stupid neither is a trait i want in a life partner toss him in the bin ,4,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,i wish i understood too i cannot conceive of a healthy explanation ,5,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,it was not a sex journal i journal daily and he knows my journal has drawings 5 things i am grateful for or was happy about notes about plants animals i saw on my daily hike reminders etc when we have sex it always goes in the gratitude column ,2,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,one of the reasons i decided to leave and not say anything was that he confessed to me a db caused by him ended his last relationship even though when we were courting he saod he was so glad to meet an hl woman and portrayed himself as always being shot down by his prude exgfs he is the common factor here and he knows it ,23,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,i think you can cultivate love and desire maybe if you have a rich history of it and many threat centives motivating you not to split but for me it does not seem worth the struggle we are too young to have a decades long relationship and foundation ,4,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,it feels like an elaborate form of gaslighting to say we had sex when we did not an attempt to invalidate and erase my pain rather than take responsibility that he checked out of the relationship ,29,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,good luck cheering for you ,5,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,insane that it is so common how can that be like i get they do not care about sex but like i do not care for going to the movies but i do not labor under the delusion i see films weekly i know the last time i saw one was in the summer ,15,DeadBedrooms

HB3234,i have ptsd not combat though please feel free to ask me any qs and i will answer them the best i can ,1,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,probably atleast 1 if not more of those meds however if he is on so many and has been on this cocktail for a while it probably not a great idea for him to mess with what works it sounds like he has a lot going on mentally that needs managing right now at 3 months it sounds like a take it or leave it situation you are still getting to know each other and deciding if you are compatible if the mismatch libido is already messing with you it may be your red flag ,3,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,long term solutions are totally possible where the partners do not see sex as a problematic element in their relationship anymore does not mean perfection but to say db can never be solved long term means you are willing to stay in a relationship where sex will indefinitely be a problem if you can be zen monk and accept that i guess your relationship is ok but then i would question why you are in a support sub ,4,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,i feel like a lot of lls say this when hl partners leave though even if they explicitly state they will leave if the db is not fixed i feel like they cannot wrap their head around what they are hearing because they value sex so little and cannot quite empathize with someone who sees it differently ,4,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,what a lot of posters are touching on is that you can have sex within a db not all dbs are 100 chastity your db is over when you both find a long term solution that satisfies both parties so it sounds weird to say after 1 night that you have achieved your longterm solution however i hope you are right ,2,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,i cannot second this enough you gave her ample notice and effort she chose not to take you seriously you did let her know you are not the one being unfair here she is by acting like your distress did not matter until it was bad enough to push you literally out of the door ,23,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,this seems like a useless and unhelpful thought experimebt who cares what the kids think they are not equipped at this stage in life to understand as adults it would make perfect sense to them ,13,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,if you think of yourself as not a good husband your words not mine why do you expect her to be a decent wife what makes you say you are not a good husband ,10,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,yes this it is frustrating that he treats the leaving wife as worthy of these acts of love but where were those demonstrations for the loyal and patient and loving version of you he had before ugh my partner is doing this now and it fills me with rage,10,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,he is not speaking english offer to take him to a neurologist because the language center of his brain is clearly deteriorating either he is a manipulative ass or in the first stages of dementia and you should let him know thats what this looks like ,12,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,you do not try to make that thought go away because it is valid and worse it is true your partner has heard you expressing your needs and feelings and unless you two are actively working on it or trying to find a balanced compromise it means they have heard you out and decided your needs are not worth addressing this is extremely useful information for you productive ways to deal 1 talk to him about this this is important to me and you keep brushing me off why when you choose not to work with me on this important issue i feel like you are telling me that my needs are not very important to you 2 plan an exit strategy if this is who he is and how he values you not negotiably your options are leave or make peace with it ,12,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,it sounds like you are in a deep predicament torn between two things you want so badly i do not know what will give you the wherewithal to make that final blow it sounds like your behavior and inner life are totally at odds that has to be really uncomfortable because right now your care for him is outweighing your care for yourself ,2,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,maybe your so does not like foreplay hence why they do not provide it and also why what you provide feels complaint worthy ask them point blank do you dislike foreplay do you dislike x y or z if they insist they like it ask why they refuse to reciprocate on something they like and do not let go til you have an answer ,2,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,i am curious about your issues w selfishness or being controlling and how these may have played into it i am hl f and into a lot of different types of kink but only with partners i feel utmost safety with and respect for its an even higher standard than for regular sex a partner i hold in the highest esteem yea cum on my face in my mouth where the hell ever and i will enjoy a bit of degradation play a partner who my respect for has diminished forget it no fucking way if you have legitimately done something tonmake me feel degraded then it may never be sexy again i wonder if this is part of why your dynamic changed and things were taken off the table more and more ,5,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,maybe say something like we have beek working on our sex life for x time here but this engagement will end if we cannot find a way to have a good sex life i am not willing to consider a sexless marriage if you continue to choose not to work with me i will take that as your good faith agreement that we are not compatible and that you want to cancel the engagement put it on him too he is the one neglecting a huge element of yiur partnership ,1,DeadBedrooms

HB3234,what she is saying about you usong her body amd abandoning her is patently unfair it assumes you had malicious intent and saw sex as a thing to take from her rther than an act of building together it makes it seem like sex was always a 1 way street her giving and you taking if this is true ofcourse you should split because how awful and evil a dynamic to trap someone in and if it is mot true but is her reality this is someone with such unhealthy attitudes about sex unless she makes the move to fix it independent of you nothing well get better all signs point to go do not collect 200 just gtfo ,21,DeadBedrooms

HB3234,have you tried scheduling sex perhaps you can kill two birds with one stone and suggest a date night followed by sex once a week and tell her you will also lay off pressure for sex or oral on the other days maybe that can help her feel less smothered and resentful get you more sex and help rekindle passion for both of you also are you asking for oral point blank or as a consolation prize for when she denies sex or some otber context do you offer to reciprocate honestly because i am the hl in my relationship but i can absolutely see resenting and not wanting to be intimate with a partner who kept asking for one way sex acts ,3,DeadBedrooms
HB3234,it is pretty normal in our society to compare in that lots of women do it but i would argue vehemently it is not a healthy behavior i worked hard to get over bosy dysmorphia from an eating disorder so mileage may vary due to the differing causes but what helped me was even if you cannot replace negative self talk w positive talk yet just cut the negative talk hey voice fuck outta here i have no time for your negativity exercise with hard goals for my situation lifting and getting into climbing endorphins are nice but the rush of validation from meeting a goal was the big one related to the exercise it helped me reframe thinking about my body in terms of aesthetics to performance rather than bemoan its aesthetic shortcomings abundant i began to see my accomplishments in climbing when i looked at my body not as abundant but viscerally satisfying no less this takes a lot of constant reminding to maintain though ,2,DeadBedrooms
