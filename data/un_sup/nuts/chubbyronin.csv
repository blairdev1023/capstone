chubbyronin,well if you are just commending him on his restraint because he saved himself from going to jail then i apologize but that statement could be read as you also holding the belief that men should not hit women even in self defense ,3,PussyPass
chubbyronin,you say you do not think it ok for women to hit men but you also say you do not think men should hit women back yes you admit he would have been justified but the very idea that he should not hit her back is the inequality u tom9152 was referring to nobody should hit anybody first but hitting second or last aka self defense should be completely socially acceptable no matter the gender ,3,PussyPass
chubbyronin,one of the commenters asks and how in gods name did he get her to do it what like women are somehow incapable of being willing or even wanting to do something like that ,5,PussyPass
chubbyronin,women play best of 3 matches men play best of 5 sure it possible that the woman may go the full 3 sets in every match while the man shuts out every opponent but not very likely all i am saying is if they want to make it more equal when they raised the purse they should have at least raised the number of matches for women and that not even getting in to who brings in the most viewer money ,9,PussyPass

chubbyronin,a backlog of unprocessed evidence keeping a man out of prison is not the same thing as all evidence available a smoking gun in the woman hands and her still facing limited to no consequences i am not denying male rapists can get away with it but the system is not specifically designed and implemented in a way that allows them to do so if you have got the guy dead to rights he not getting out of it and these days even if you have got nothing on him except the woman word he going down accusation guilt these days ,1,MensRights

chubbyronin, i had no idea this article would cause such a ruckus and i was not posting this based on woman hating despite what some of the liberal sjw posters here seem to think i posted this based on the fact that she got the same sentence a man would when the sentencing gap usually provides a baseline pussypass for all women the fact that she turned herself in could prove that it not a ppd or it could prove that she was attempting to utilize pp by manipulating the system getting ahead of the charges and trying to appear repentant in order to lessen her sentence she also tried to use a self defense umm defense in court according to another article but was found guilty of straight up murder http www greenfieldreporter com 2017 01 14 area native found guilty in slaying however if the mods wish to remove this post i have no argument ,5,pussypassdenied
chubbyronin, but could women s prisons actually be eliminated in the us where women s incarceration rate has risen by 646 in the past 30 years i love how they try to pull off some bullshit by using percentages to make it seem like the number is far worse than it actually if there were only 100 women in jail 30 years ago that would mean only 746 women in jail now conversely if there were 1 million men in jail 30 years ago and 1 100 000 in jail now that just a 10 increase and the article would have said something like men incarceration has only gone up 10 in the last 30 years ,8,PussyPass

chubbyronin,see that the problem because of the stereotype i mentioned above even if a man actually genuinely does want to keep a child when the woman wants to abort she can accuse him of stealthing and likely will if he makes too big an issue out of it even if the child was a legitimate accident and she will use the fact that he wants to keep the child as proof because men have no parental rights in the decision whether or not to abort a child any man who argues to keep it when she does not want it runs the risk of being accused of putting it in her against her will ,4,PussyPass
chubbyronin,seems like she might even have done it for publicity this is the column piece she wrote about it for an activist website https web archive org web 20140410134858 http acvoice com 2012 10 25 culture of silence she contributed many pieces to that site notice how she even has the nerve to ask herself was it rape if he was too drunk to stop himself ,7,PussyPass
chubbyronin,the blackout part means she sexually assaulted him ,5,PussyPass
chubbyronin,ok in a myriad of stupid things feminists say this has to be the stupidest thing yet and i mean that literally not figuratively what cotton candy skied world does this imbecile live in that she thinks men are a significant threat of stealthing she going against the whole feminist stereotype of men that says we run like speedy gonzalez at the first hint of baby making does she not realize she in more danger of putting women in prison with a law like this ,8,PussyPass

chubbyronin,i empathize with genuine victims but cases like this are becoming far too common and prove that title ix does not work at all this is precisely the kind of situation paul elam was referring to when he said he would always vote not guilty if he were a juror for an accused male rapist because it literally impossible for the accused to get a fair trial under these kinds of rules ,1,PussyPassNeutral
chubbyronin,pig cunt is right you are comparing california to texas that like comparing apples to hand grenades i am genuinely surprised she got as much time as she did plus i do not care is the opposite of invoking the tears subsection of a pussypass which fits nicely into the showing remorse requirement for sentencing even if they are crocodile tears ,2,PussyPassNeutral

chubbyronin,he did not have to release it at all her accusations never made it past the first look at the video by officials so it never became newsworthy and i doubt he personally released it that video would be the property of the police department he works for they might have released it though i do not know why they would since giving her a pussypass on the accusation would not look good on tv so it probably came down to some reporter sniffing something out and using foia to get the video and really videos showing evidence that not in the cop favor do not get released do you even youtube ,1,PussyPass
