snoopoopoop,i have a few questions that i hope she can answer she seems to have information that is used in her suit but everyone investigating online cannot really do much without knowing the basis for some of the most crucial allegations this covers about a quarter of the claims that are not quite substantial how and on what occasions did robert shepherd interfere with investigations into the deaths as arkansas state democratic chairman how did lib carlisle have the authority to order the state police to stop their investigation in what way did don birdsong corrupt the investigation what evidence is there that birdsong liaison appointment was influenced by actions he took to corrupt the investigation what specific tests were ordered not to be conducted by state crime lab directors have you sought professional legal representation or private investigation ,1,conspiracy
snoopoopoop,i am sure i am either a troll or a shill or something but you know that you originally said one thing and then completely backtracked in order to avoid having to explain yourself again i really do not know why you started throwing out insults like pretentious prick and accusing me of having a personal problem because you could not explain your own post i interpreted your sudden hostility as my having exhausted your ability to explain away your claim that putin refuted the claims that he silences journalists you said that you used the wrong word and the the very next sentence is actually a complete shift in topic so it does not pertain but you know how silly that sounds if you could explain yourself calmly and logically you would you are resorting to hostility because you cannot it really not a big deal though i do not want you to be upset i just wanted an explanation of an outrageous claim that you now clearly regret but cannot admit to regretting being upset is a decision that you made and again i am sorry that i put you in a position where you felt the need to be hostile ,1,conspiracy
snoopoopoop,oh shit i just got totally decimated by a guy with an overtly racist name i am such a cuck ,0,conspiracy
snoopoopoop,he claims that he meant to say dispute but that does not explain how he says putin decimated her on this topic anyway he gotten really worked up and offended and i would rather leave him alone ,1,conspiracy

snoopoopoop,so by disputing the claim he decimated her that does not fit a disagreement does not mean you destroyed your interviewer if you meant to say disputed instead of refuted what did you mean to say instead of decimated ,3,conspiracy
snoopoopoop,here his original post i watched the original yesterday so i am sure i did not notice everything whatsoever but this one was glaring to me when i watched it yesterday the edit made it seem like putin was saying yeah journalists disappear and there corruption but that our way of doing things so do not come at me like that seeing that full answer was honestly pretty astounding this time around his answer not only refuted those statements but gave examples of russia domestic progressions they had to try to save some face after he decimated kelly like that here what you say his main claim is nbc badly distorted putin response to make him look worse i can see how his comment hinted at that but he did not directly address it until his next comment his main point originally was that putin is all cleared up now and kelly lost at what i do not know he should clarify how exactly putin disproved the accusations that he silences dangerous dissenters ,2,conspiracy
snoopoopoop,because nbc is tied to a secret cabal of child rapist pizza loving drag queens obviously ,10,conspiracy
snoopoopoop,i thought your main claim was that he refuted the accusations how exactly did he disprove the theory that he has repeatedly silenced journalists who report on the realities of his regime how can a satisfactory rebuttal of those claims even take place in the context of a televised interview with a tabloid tier journalist ,0,conspiracy
snoopoopoop,why did you bring up trump and obama and hilary and the presumption that you would defend russia a lot of what you just posted came out of no where and it seems like you are preempting an accusation ,-7,conspiracy
snoopoopoop,proceed means to begin or continue precede means to come before procede was meant to be precede but that does not make sense in the sentence they meant to say followed which is its literal opposite my firefox dictionary does catch procede and proceded as errors procede is spanish for proceed that may have something to do with it being in an auto correct dictionary ,4,funny
snoopoopoop,so why exactly did they released the full interview online without the edits made for television ,33,conspiracy
snoopoopoop,yeah how exactly did putin prove in this interview that the disappearing russian journalist trend is just a crazy coincidence how did he refute that exactly ,4,conspiracy

snoopoopoop,i can see how your interpretation of their analogy is likely but i do not think it fits with what they actually said according to their analogy seeing a person observe a sexual depiction in an artistic context is like watching them as they sit on the toilet i do not want to see you watch the shower scene in starship troopers for the same reasons that i do not want to watch you poop that implies that acknowledging sex is an unclean act this does not even get into what they think of actually having sex or watching something for sexual gratification this is just sitting on a couch and acknowledging that sex is a part of the human experience maybe the analogy was sloppy and that not what they meant but that is what they said also i never knew who watched the movies they play on tv with censored lines and the whole thing chopped up for ad time i guess that explains it i really do not think being able to watch a sex scene with a parent or uncle like a regular person makes me some new wave hippy who talks to his parents about blowjobs or something sex in a movie or tv show is just not a big deal i have seen boobs in shampoo commercials the idea of cutting out the naughty bits on dvd is just absurd to me ,0,movies

snoopoopoop,i am sorry i made you feel so vulnerable that you see the need to try to shift the blame off of yourself there is no blame there nothing for you to feel sorry about you cannot control how you feel you described my opinion as bile and expressed disgust with my mediocrity compared to you now you saw that you were only ever talking about a bird i understand that this probably is not your proudest moment and that vulnerability is scary that guy that i disagreed with about the bird is fine he agreed with me yesterday and we have moved on no one was insulted the only conflict here is the one that you have created for yourself i am sorry for being too analytical i should have predicted your hostile reaction to reason and understanding emotion only listens to emotion if that means you wo not listen to me that fine i wo not give in to throwing out insults or trying to fabricate controversy i guess that just something us mediocre people have to leave to the exceptional ones such as yourself wearing your emotions of your sleeve the way you do is dangerous they are easy to show off but also easily damaged if you are hurt it because you made a poor emotional investment getting angry and literally saying that you are better than me is a huge emotional investment most adults do not take such dramatic emotional actions ,1,StoppedWorking
snoopoopoop, i am defending that kestrel against your overzealous misidentification and subsequent bile i have met people like you so sure of themselves despite their mediocrity so you often feel superior to others and you see yourself as a defender of an entity that cannot defend itself you sound a lot like holden caulfield you are surrounded by phonies who just do not understand how special you are and you are the only one who can defend others against the banality that is being imposed on them holden is the most well known antisocial figure in the modern canon and he is characteristically hostile towards anyone who tries to understand sympathize with or analyze him being spoken to as though his problems are normal is insulting to him because his entire identity is wrapped up in his self perception as a unique and tragically misunderstood hero your hostility leads me to believe that this exchange is making you think for what it worth i know that i am mediocre i know that you are mediocre as well there nothing wrong with that you do not have to be special to be good ,1,StoppedWorking
snoopoopoop,correcting grammar is important i appreciate it when people do it to me because it helps me learn and communicate more effectively i know that they are not attacking me personally or trying to insult me that why i really do not understand your hostility are you reading these messages in an agitated tone are you making a conscious decision to turn this into a fight in your head that bizarre and i think if some people you know in real life were able to read this they would be ashamed to know someone who behaves this way online this is like when you accidentally bump into someone at a bar and they start yelling and telling you to walk away it needy and sad it puts a damper on the whole room the guy always thinks he being intimidating but really he being pitied throwing a temper tantrum is not impressive it alarming i do not know why you feel the need to create discomfort or discord in an otherwise civil situation but it does not come off the way you think it does get some help ps those comma splices sure are handy ,1,Sneakers
