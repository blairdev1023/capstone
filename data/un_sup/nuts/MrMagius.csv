MrMagius,even better those are things i never would have thought of why super deep clean the bathroom once a week when you can just tidy it during the 2 4 minutes it takes for the shower to heat my shower is far away from the water heater so it usually takes a good 3 minutes that is plenty of time to wipe up around the sink and toilet then just a quick spray n mop later on ,5,getdisciplined
MrMagius,great idea i am going to try this also i have a book i bound that has just been sitting empty for the last couple years time to ink up my pen and put my pack back together nice ,6,getdisciplined

MrMagius,it changes today i did not eat my full portion of dinner even though i wanted to saved it for lunch tomorrow i am almost positive i am a binge eater i sneak fast food on a credit card my wife does not look at i eat way too much and feel sick then i eat dinner again because i cannot show that i already ate then i eat a pint of ben and jerry well not so much the ice cream as much any more this is pretty much me exactly the formal diagnostic criteria are recurrent episodes of binge eating an episode of binge eating is characterized by both of the following eating in a discrete period of time eg within any 2 hour period an amount of food that is definitely larger than what most people would eat in a similar period of time under similar circumstances a sense of lack of control over eating during the episode eg a feeling that one cannot stop eating or control what or how much one is eating the binge eating episodes are associated with three or more of the following eating much more rapidly than normal eating until feeling uncomfortably full eating large amounts of food when not feeling physically hungry eating alone because of feeling embarrassed by how much one is eating feeling disgusted with oneself depressed or very guilty afterward marked distress regarding binge eating is present the binge eating occurs on average at least once a week for 3 months the binge eating is not associated with the recurrent use of inappropriate compensatory behaviors eg purging as in bulimia nervosa and does not occur exclusively during the course of bulimia nervosa or anorexia nervosa yep ,1,BTFC

MrMagius,from their faq https www dyerandjenkins com blogs journal 12877033 raw and selvedge denim dont be misinformed q what makes jeans raw a i highly recommend the above article so if you have not read that yet i suggest it the gist though is that raw denim is denim fabric that has not been washed after it been dyed this leaves the jeans stiff with an even dark usually indigo wash but more importantly it leaves the denim open to personalization taking place in the form of creases and fades where the jeans see the most wear from your body minimal washes keeps them from well washing out ,3,LifeProTips

MrMagius,yep i understand the deal i mess up i pay for it the problem is though people with a non violent property crime like myself are treated as equal to someone who killed someone purposefully i understand that for the rest of my life my family and myself have to pay for the 2000 00 i stole i feel like our system should not completely erase the charges but perhaps bar them from background checks after a certain length of time for certain crimes and only if the time since has been void of more criminal charges for non security sensitive positions ofc ,13,UpliftingNews
MrMagius,i would imagine so i make crispy fried cheese in a frying pan out of cheddar jack etc so i would bet it works just fine might have to adjust some times ,1,ketorecipes
MrMagius,you are for sure using parchment paper and not wax paper right there is no way it will come off wax paper i use the cheapest walmart brand parchment and it works great did not pay attention once or twice and used wax paper real bad idea ,3,ketorecipes
MrMagius,really i almost exclusively use parchment and microwave the oven only occasionally i do an average thickness slice of provolone on a square of parchment for about 25 seconds pull it out let it cool for just a few seconds then pull and drape over spatula handle i dont even pay attention any more but i think it is a few seconds after the cheese starts really bubbling that i pull it out it is not browned at all still mostly white but firms up great with a bubbly texture almost like a muncho potato chip if you have had those ,1,ketorecipes

MrMagius,i served 5 years from 2000 to 2005 1829 days to be exact because my parole date was a friday and they only release on tues thurs i was on parole for 7 years only because i had 2000 worth of restitution to pay i have had zero trouble with the law since i was arrested for that crime i now have 7 8 years of random schooling trades comm college etc but i am still treated as if i am dirt by most companies i got so very lucky to get my current position which i finally now make 15 50 an hour i had to get a job at a factory that hired anyone ex offenders who really do not want to go back have to work so much harder than your normal folk in order to be seen as almost equal luckily for me it did not go unnoticed i had to do a lot of making sure the higher ups noticed me and make sure they knew i had skills other than generic manual labor stuff now i am a payroll clerk if anyone wants to know more about any of my experiences living when i was released they are not really that story worthy but i can answer some questions for you ,109,UpliftingNews

MrMagius,i spent 5 years with the mdoc when i was in from 2000 to 2005 the food was made by prisoners who were supervised by cooks who worked for the doc the food was not really that bad until huge budget cuts started coming around mid 2003 portions started becoming smaller and smaller most days you would be hungry before lights out unless you had money to buy off the store prisoners in kitchens made 17 5 cents per hour starting out 12 16 hour days for months straight with no days off were very common but we mostly volunteered to work those long hours because it gave us something to do and gave us that extra bit of money at the end of the month when we got paid i want to say we had probably 2 3 cooks total that rotated out depending on shift and just the cos that supervised seems pretty cost effective to me do not know why they would change it bonus stories when i was in ionia at the now closed riverside correctional facility we used to fill our white tumblers with water at lockdown and see how high the rust cloud was in the morning at florence crane correctional facility in coldwater all of our living spaces had signs at every entry door that read warning asbestos glad those days are long behind me ,15,Michigan

MrMagius, insert mat speech about boots i have nothing against nobles mat said straightening his coat i just don t fancy being one myself why is that then mat sat for a moment why was it finally he looked down at his foot then replaced his boot it s boots boots setalle looked confused boots mat said with a nod tying his laces it s all about the boots but you see mat said pulling the laces tight a lot of men don t have to worry much about what boots to wear they re the poorest of folks if you ask one of them what boots are you going to wear today mop their answer is easy well mat i only have one pair so i guess i m gonna wear that pair mat hesitated or i guess they wouldn t say that to you setalle since you re not me and all they wouldn t call you mat you understand i understand she said sounding amused anyway for people that have a little coin the question of which boots to wear is harder you see average men men like me he eyed her and i m an average man mind you of course you are bloody right i am mat said finishing with his laces and sitting up an average man might have three pairs of boots your third best pair of boots those are the boots you wear when you re working at something unpleasant they might rub after a few paces and they might have a few holes but they re good enough to keep your footing you don t mind mucking them up in the fields or the barn all right setalle said then you have your second best pair of boots mat said those are your day to day boots you wear those if you are going over to dinner at the neighbors or in my case you wear those if you re going to battle they re nice boots give you good footing and you don t mind being seen in them or anything and your best pair of boots setalle asked you wear those to social events like a ball or dining with a local dignitary balls dignitaries bloody ashes woman i thought you were an inn keeper setalle blushed faintly we re not going to any balls mat said but if we had to i suspect we d wear our second best pair of boots if they re good enough for visiting old lady hembrew next door then they re bloody well good enough for stepping on the toes of any woman fool enough to dance with us then what are the best boots for walking mat said any farmer knows the value of good boots when you go walking a distance setalle looked thoughtful all right but what does this have to do with being a nobleman everything mat said don t you see if you re an average fellow you know exactly when to use your boots a man can keep track of three pairs of boots life is simple when you have three pairs of boots but noblemen talmanes claims he has forty different pairs of boots at home forty pairs can you imagine that she smiled in amusement forty pairs mat repeated shaking his head forty bloody pairs and they aren t all the same kind of boots either there is a pair for each outfit and a dozen pairs in different styles that will match any number of half your outfits you have boots for kings boots for high lords and boots for normal people you have boots for winter and boots for summer boots for rainy days and boots for dry days you have bloody shoes that you wear only when you re walking to the bathing chamber lopin used to complain that i didn t have a pair to wear to the privy at night i see so you re using boots as a metaphor for the onus of responsibility and decision placed upon the aristocracy as they assume leadership of complex political and social positions metaphor for mat scowled bloody ashes woman this isn t a metaphor for anything it s just boots setalle shook her head you re an unconventionally wise man matrim cauthon copied from the web cannot take credit for typing it from the book ,27,WoT

MrMagius,ahhh ok then i will even upvote that ,2,Minecraft
MrMagius,you seem to have taken my comment way too seriously i was saying nothing about mountain dew as was implied by your previous comment i was saying that i also saw 7 up products which yes here in the us dr pepper and 7 up are part of the same company which is cadbury beverages north america regardless dr pepper and diet dr pepper are neither pepsi nor coke which was my point ,1,Minecraft
MrMagius,certainly are diet pepsi i see coke pepsi and 7 up dr pepper brand products ,4,Minecraft

MrMagius,i do not deny your experiences i am just talking from my own i have pretty much been a grease monkey since i was a kid and have been a formerly certified master automotive technician for the state of michigan i have always tipped the oil container up into the fill hole and left it hands free until it was done emptying never have i come across one that melted the only way i could even see this happening is if it was left for way too long after the oil has been emptied i do admit through some odd happenstance it could occur though ,1,LifeProTips
MrMagius,use a hairdryer i personally use a heatgun to remove packing labels from cardboard boxes to reuse them for shipping just be careful not to get the paint too hot or it will peel off heat it up just good enough to get the glue from the tape hot and you should peel it off slowly then follow up with some goo gone to remove the residue ,3,LifeProTips
MrMagius,there is a clamp on one end of the zipper for holding both halves together you may have to do a bit of sewing but usually you can take a pair of pliers and a small flathead screw driver or an awl pick to remove that clamp readjust your zipper and reclamp it hope this helps you i try to be very resourceful and fix things instead of buying new so i have done this a few times in the past ,1,LifeProTips
MrMagius,i still feel it is faster just to highlight by double or triple clicking them right click search google for for me but this is a nice thing to know thanks for the tip ,6,LifeProTips
MrMagius,gotta remember though people do something one way because of a way they saw someone else do it then never look for instructions after that because hey i already know how to do it i usually always buy straight up generic dollar store type oil only thing on them is a sticker on the front that says something like national oil 10w30 ,5,LifeProTips
MrMagius,some of them yes it is not on the majority of the cheaper brands though ,1,LifeProTips
MrMagius,car engines do not get anywhere near hot enough on the valve covers to melt plastic if they are getting that hot there is something terribly wrong even engine blocks do not really get that hot unless you are very near the exhaust manifolds ,3,LifeProTips
MrMagius,my experience is that the place has to be a state certified collection center in order to accept used oil trans fluid ,2,LifeProTips

MrMagius,sorry for the mind blow hope it does not hurt much ,6,LifeProTips
MrMagius,my apologies i thought it was obvious from the photos i added they are made the way they are so you do not pour oil everywhere if you pour with the opening higher and the angled part towards the oil cap you are way less likely to spill ,13,LifeProTips
MrMagius,fantastic ,2,loseit
MrMagius,since no one seems to know that oil quarts are shaped the way they are for a reason i will teach you via these pics no http i imgur com wbxuohb jpg yes http i imgur com yfc1kxz jpg edit seems like people posted this as i was uploading and commenting edit2 i guess this needed more clarification so here goes the bottle is designed the way it is for a couple reasons i have no source other than being a previously state certified master automotive technician and doing countless oil changes the main reason being that it allows air to fill the space the oil just vacated in the bottle without doing the omg gonna spill everywhere death bubbles and it usually makes it easier to get the opening of the bottle near the oil fill opening if it does not make it easier to get near it still makes it take a ton longer to pour so you will be able to line the bottle up correctly so you do not have to do the ninja quart flip thumb maneuver ,261,LifeProTips
