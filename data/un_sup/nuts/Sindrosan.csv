Sindrosan,i personally have a cash value life insurance policy and am quite pleased with it the issue is what policy he is advising like the other commentators are saying if it whole life you may be better off avoiding it what myself and my wife have is an indexed universal life and it excellent only a few years in and it protected me from losses with my saved money and i have a good chunk of money i can access easily tax free if i so choose however whatever product he is offering you if it is the one and only thing he offers that would be another reason to steer clear when i got my iul it was from a broker that worked with multiple insurance companies and multiple products meaning they could offer mutual funds term life whole life iras and more than i can remember and they were opposed to whole life and very open about their compensation and a proper financial adviser will really be holding your interests first i have seen a good one not push a sale because a client needs to improve their debt and emergency fund just requiring the savings account at the bank they already have for instance ,1,personalfinance

Sindrosan,fortunately i did have the advantage of growing up of not bottling up my emotions very much i remember one event as a child that i think really set the course i was a youngling maybe 7ish and angry at my younger brother because whatever my mom told me it was my choice to be angry or not regardless of what he did or did not do at first i did not believe her until on another day with an unrelated incident my brother did something and i chose not to get angry then i remember returning to my mom all excited that i chose not to get angry that planted the seed that i control my emotions as an adult i use multiple things visualization when an event is occuring i imagine the event in different terms depending on how intense it is if it relatively minor or mundane i imagine it as water rolling off a duck back i imagine myself as the duck and the stressor as the run breathe in breathe out and imagine it rolling off my back as harmlessly as water off a duck back as a matter of fact water of a duck back is one of the sayings i constantly repeat in my head to keep my strong cliche but it works when the event is much more intense i will imagine myself as a halo spartan punching the ground and activating his energy shield or a medieval soldier holding up his shield to word off arrows and swords a spaceship powerful shields blocking giant energy beams in particular the scene from stargate atlantis where the deadalus blocks a solar flare from a star to protect a planet or even myself as wolverine absorbing bullets as i charge forward unphased basically i mentally blast myself with the idea that i can take the hit of whatever coming my way i do not bottle it up i deflect it block it heal from it and move forward still strong i will say again typing it out sounds so freaking cliche and hokey but i have built a habit of doing it for so many years it instinctual remembering past victories i think back to other situations where the cards were stacked against and i faced what seemed like insurmountable odds then i remember how i still came out okay as time went on i collected more and more victories that i could review at first it took a lot of effort to convince myself i could handle the situation now there are so many examples that i may refer to i can trust myself to handle the situation it gotten to the point that when i have to speak to a crowd i prefer to be notified as last minute as possible i know i will do great i just want to minimize the time i have to potentially get worried gym i really cannot emphasise enough how much weight lifting has helped there are times where i think it does not do much because i never stay upset for long then i remember that i lift regularly so the little bits of stress that i do hold onto are regularly released through physical exertion and natural hormones also if i ever have a particular frustrating day i can go to the gym and lift some heavy weights and then feel amazing by that point i am thankful for whatever caused me to get angry because now i feel full of positive energy and burning out all of my stress hormones also being healthy and in shape helps keep a healthy hormone profile and keeps the brain running effeciently with sufficient energy all of which contribute to emotional health a k a helping reduce anger and anxiety reason it sounds kind of lame but i reason through the moment and repeat the logical conclusion in my head now normally in these moments there is lots of emotion which means logic is the one thing i do not follow but overtime i learn to accept the reason instead of the emotion in these moments this also harkens back to remembering past victories and visualization i replay past stressful moments that i overcame and reason with myself that if i did it once i can do it again another way helpful for anxiety is to run through the worst case situatuation and then the most probable reasonable situation i will give an example of that last one when i was living with multiple roommates in college days we got an eviction notice for failure to pay rent cue freakout temptation at that point i walked through the worst case situatuation i was not on the lease so it would not effect my record i did not have a lot of possessions so i could easily pack them all in my car my family was still trying to get me to move back with them before this so i had a place to stay and i had numerous other friends i knew who would be willing to take me in once i processed that i realized that if i did get evicted i would be just fine and it turns out the other guys got their act together and paid up their rent in time and no one was evicted go figure a liiiiiitle bit longer of a post then i wanted and possibly somewhat disjointed but hey it what i got edit automoderator removed the comment because i included a link to an 11 second video of water rolling off a duck back ,1,selfimprovement

Sindrosan,oookay i am getting it better now so let me better clarify due to my age health insurance would be cheap for me regardless and i am in good health with nothing of concern in my health history however i am also young enough to be on my family group plan even though i am married and moved out it obviously did not occur to me you meant health insurance i was thinking life however for my wife we still went with a more expensive and not through any group employer plan so she can see her doctors and avoid the deductible for some costs were we each 10 15 years older plans would not be quite so affordable for us and to fully answer your question i still probably would not take any extra risks since i make most of the money whether or not i had insurance and even if it had no deductible and awesome coverage cutting off the majority of our income due to an unnecessary risk is still something i would not want to do ,2,AskReddit

Sindrosan,to someone fresh out of highschool i would not push business as the sole thing to do however what we call small business which is often just an individual practice was the standard before the industrial revolution by that definition is what i am referring to when i say business or trade since they often start the same and you are correct by the time you get to a master plumber you have the knowledge and experience to run a plumbing business if that is what someone chooses to do then it could be said they were building a business the entire time they were working their practice trade ,1,getdisciplined

Sindrosan,i love this question it a challenge i experience as well short answer it takes practice you have to continue doing things that you want to do and treat everyone else opinions as water off a ducks back at first it hard and even nerve wracking but as time goes on it does get easier a quote i once heard said something along the lines of no matter how famous you get how popular you get how successful you get no matter how well of a speech you write or how well you plan your actions people will misinterpret remember incorrectly jump to conclusions and misquote you everyone already has a bias that everything about you passes through so if people are going to hear what they want to hear you may as well say what you want to say that saying had helped me out a lot it reminded me that people are usually more concerned with themselves which also includes their definition image of you it worth changing for the better but if you are around people that do not want to improve themselves for the better and do not understand why you want to improve you they will misinterpret accept that going in and keep moving forward ,4,selfimprovement

Sindrosan,it sounds like you are going down the right track i have always seen done this by focusing on much of what you have done debts including mortgage final expenses income lump sum put in a vehicle to spit out cash and replace your income education for kids some stuff like mortgage and debts are pretty straight forward as they already have a dollar amount income is usually the trickiest how much do you want to provide and for how long if you just want to provide the money for a set a mount of years such as 10 just make sure that much is available if you want the income indefinitely you need a large enough lump sum to be able to live off the interest the advisors i know anticipate putting this lump sum in an annuity that for math purposes they assume can give 5 interest for income after reviewing your post i only saw mention of term insurance for something temporary like mortgage and children having a term long enough to cover them is a great idea once the mortgage debt is paid off and the children are grown it appropriate for that insurance to fall off because it not needed in order to make sure your wife would still have the income and final expenses provided this is where permanent insurance comes into play this is what i will be doing myself i have permanent on myself now for things like income and final expense and when we have kids and or get a mortgage i will get term for 20 30 years to cover that additional amount but as i said you seem to be considering the right things hope that helps ,1,personalfinance

Sindrosan,there are a few catches all of which i was well informed of before hand and are not that big first off to count as life insurance and gain the tax benefits there are things such as cost of insurance plus limits on policy size based on face amount you also have to qualify based on health however if you ever need to save more you can just get another policy and considering you can take out money tax deferred or if you follow the rules tax free what you save in taxes makes up for fees several times over the fees are also not very big at least not for the companies i have seen there are also surrender charges involved both to prevent money laundering but also to allow the company to provide high rates of return incidentally a reason banks have such low ror they have no guarantees how long the money is available to work with this is why it good for long term by the time you need it the surrender periods are long gone and the funds can be pulled out while you are alive some of the companies are really trying to revolutionize things and add long term care on board meaning if you had to receive long term care benefits you could pull that from the death benefit of your policy while you are still alive ,1,personalfinance

Sindrosan,i was incredibly tempted to stick in a sarcastic off course not because they are all white response but you did request serious responses so i will oblige in short my answer is yes and who cares if we are to apply the same standards to this as other types of movies and media but not keeping the depiction pure we absolutely could call it cultural appropriation now however comes the second part who cares this is in part because of the double standard that pervades so much of the media and culture and that is that discrimination against whites does not exist because white privilege simple double standards there the rest of the story is because we make too much of an issue out of first world problems there may be times were having the right type of actor is something to make a big deal about but actively hunting for issues just takes away from the real issues for instance i believe there are numerous times where white washing movies is a legitimate issue inversely there are times where not having someone cast according to the source material or 100 historically accurate is not that big of a deal otherwise everyone in movies taking place in the past would have terrible teeth for example ,1,AskReddit

Sindrosan,because it not motivation motivation is fleeting multiple things do come into play such as being obsessed with what you are building creating the proper environment and building good old fashioned discipline when you rely solely on motivation you will fail you need something stronger inspiration ,13,GetMotivated
Sindrosan,i have a controversial view on college and jobs i believe that for most people college and the later job is an incredibly inefficient way to get to their dreams and goals unless someone has a goal to get into a field require a formal degree it a waste of time unless they do not wish to achieve much i normally encourage people to either 1 go into business or 2 go into a trade business has an advantage of eventually making income automatic not needing a degree and having higher income potential solid trade work has an advantage of being able to earn a lot more money while spending a lot less on education and then being able to dump more into savings which leads to earlier and better retirement or for the way things are trending today actually having a retirement the caveat is most people wo not advise others to go down those routes you will generally get advise to go down a safe route it your choice where you want to fall a near guarantee you will end up where most do or a partial chance to end up with more i prefer the latter but cannot make that decision for anyone else and may only encourage them ,3,DecidingToBeBetter

Sindrosan,baby steps time discipline practice a key step for myself was evaluating if someone was qualified to influence me or give advice is their advice or what they want me to do something that is actually consistent with what i want for instance if i am looking for dating advice from people that have certain success with certain types of girls and a guy comes around who has not achieved the success i am looking for and is not interested in the women i am i automatically shut my mind off to his advice he unqualified and listening would not benefit me i do not tell him and may politely respond but i reject it because he has not proven his methods work and his methods are not even going after what i want another key step was explaining myself less and apologizing less not to be a jerk but letting my opinion and myself be without justifying it an example would be in conversation where i have a possibly different opinion instead of saying well in my opinion waffles taste better on thursday i would just say waffles taste better or thursday or not comment at all little things that train me to not worry about the outcome and feel removed from other influence hope that helps i can come up with more if this provides any benefit ,1,LifeProTips

Sindrosan,aaanndd now i am subscribed to four new subreddits,3,numenera
Sindrosan,i do not have feedback specific to baz and such just about numenera in general it is meant to be very open and to allow you to create something of your own within i recently did this with the titanic ridge i had forgotten the place existed and my players were trying to look for a good place to setup a base and saw it on the map since they had talked to some adventurous npcs i found it reasonable they may remember a blurb on the location so i read the paragraph in the book to them they loved it and decided to go there queue me spending several weeks creating a historical background several mysteries and strange creatures along with accompanying challenges to get there for a place i never considered them going to now we have completed two sessions on the titanic ridge with a possible 1 2 more to go i have multiple events that transpired and because the players feel everything is complete it leaves so much mystery for them they did not want to end the session all from 1 2 paragraphs in the core book go for it ,5,numenera
Sindrosan,that actually some of what i have in mind on it high power level i want it to cut through weapons and armor i am thinking anything below level 7 8 this would add to the effect of the initial reveal where melee characters think i got this fool as they then watch their favored blade get effortlessly and unceremoniously chopped in half and if heavy emphasis on if the players ever gain access to one i absolutely want to make it access to power very limited requiring high level powercells that are hard to make are rare to find because of how high energy they are in such a small container i also like the idea to penalties to recovery rolls naturally if they are losing limbs it an excellent opportunity for permanent injury something my players have not experienced yet i was also toying around with what weapon class to treat it as i had been considering light due to how well light it would be being composed of just a handle ,1,numenera
Sindrosan,this is yet another confirmation i need to get the compendium not only could these be good stand alone weapons that i would be fine with the party finding making but it also serves as a good low power level version of a lightsaber ,1,numenera
Sindrosan, if the players ever manage to acquire one i want them to feel like they have something of extreme power i am hoping they make the right decisions said every gm ever to lead up to a good reveal where a high level 8 9 enemy is surrounded by a large and powerful pc party allies in what looks like a very one sided battle in favor of the pcs then i want to watch their dreams get crushed as this outnumbered and outgunned enemy pulls out a lightsaber and destroys their force powerful enough to destroy a small army though as i said it a big if on if they would ever acquire it first they have to know about the technology existence then they have to either kill a nearly invincible enemy that normally would not reveal itself or 1 gain access to the technical specs in a highly secured facility 2 gain the materials to craft the device 3 gain access to the tools and know how necessary to craft it 4 create find proper power sources and crystals to activate then finally 5 receive proper training so they do not accidentally kill themselves in combat ,1,numenera
Sindrosan,i just reviewed it nothing specific about how to handle lightsabers based on the few times its mentioned it looks like they would be treated just as a regular weapon almost since the sw inspiration in my campaign is small and the swords rare i want them very significant,1,numenera

Sindrosan,i have definitely enjoyed the feeling of having several more small tasks done today that i would normally overlook ,1,productivity
Sindrosan,that sounds like a lot of fun to play in a case like this sculpt flesh could still be usable i imagine the nano leaping up to a distant ledge and spending several seconds one round allowing claws to grow as he prepares for battle then leaps down towards a vulnerable foe not that you would have to play that way obviously but that how i see the abilities synergize as for pool distribution i would say it depends on what you are going for are you wanting to have a character that mainly focuses on being quick and fighting a lot you might want to put most into speed and a balance between intellect and might and enough edge as you level to counterbalance your ability costs then speed or if you want a character that does not fight much and just does not want to deal with weapons when combat does come focusing on intellect first with might in the distant past i really commend your creativity here ,1,numenera
Sindrosan,when it comes to weapon types i have always run my games where any type can use any weapons they just may not be very good in that case the jack with a heavy weapon is just fine at first he would have a 1 step to difficulty but he would get increased damage and able to train away that inability later or you could make him give up a normal jack and or foci ability for instance he could lose flex skill for permanent training in all weapons like a glaive both options require little to no modification of the game rules and for the nano with the staff does he want to use the staff as a weapon or as an artifact if as a weapon then since nanos do not have training for medium weapons you could handle it similar to the jack above however if he only wants an advanced staff it could be treated as a medium weapon physical attacks including the 1 step to attack difficulty but has it cool artifact ability that is not hindered by weapon type for the nano with the bow i have a feeling the jack option wo not work well personally i really like pork snorkel idea with the carries a quiver idea other ideas include giving him the one time option during character creation of losing a default esotery in exchange for the training not receiving the intellect edge or even having an xp deficit 3 5 depending on what feels right in order to gain training in bows specifically unless you find getting trained in all medium weapons appropriate all of these try to have minimal effect on the rules and keep game balance i too like to be a rules lawyer but i have learned that does not always fit the design of numenera p s i also sometimes skip the limits on how much you can reduce the difficulty of something i found it allows my players to feel empowered they do not complain ,1,numenera
Sindrosan,i just recently stumbled upon something that actually helped curb my phone habit i recently started playing the mobile game growcastle and in order to gain experience and other stuff i have to leave the app open on my phone as i let it do its thing this means if i play anything else on my phone the app is not up and is not earning and i do not want to play the game always by grinding so i let it auto play this leaves me having to find something to do other than be on my phone just thought i would throw you the idea of my accidental discovery ,1,getdisciplined

Sindrosan,i have actually suffered from some similar situations myself in fact i am recovering for a major lapse in discipline in my life where for several months i did not go to the gym and wake up early like clockwork just to name a few a few things i have done in the past and am doubling down on now to resolve this are associate with quality inspiring people this does not just mean hang out with cool friends or successful people though that is a vital part of it it also means read listen and watch them for instance i have read boldanddetermined com and dangerandplay com for years and have even flown across the country to network with other guys that read those sites to and who lives have been changed this does a lot for mentally programming myself to do stuff and removes some of the barriers to starting restarting change my environment this was most notable when i moved out of my family house 18 19 because i was to complacent but it also mattered when i decided where i lived and who with later in life i am very susceptible to complacency so i cannot live with people that allow too much of that energy in my abode also if the place is unnecessarily messy and trashy or just low quality it effects my mood i try to arrange my life so it easier to fall into inspiration as opposed laziness emotionally speaking also back to raising associations and the final thing that comes to mind right now is make small and positive commitments that can easily become more for instance in going back to the gym i am committing to listening to music stretching and walking on a treadmill once i show up and start doing the easy movement suddenly doing more is not so hard and for waking up early as long as i get up and move around after my alarm clock goes off i am allowed to go back to bed and sleep the key part is i got up after it went off training myself to wake up earlier baby steps basically i hope one of those helps i feel i am kinda in the same boat as you brother p s i am also kinda in finance interesting connection ,5,getdisciplined

Sindrosan,this is difficult that the truth we should not compare ourselves to others just like looks should not matter because it what is inside that counts that may be true but that not how people act comparing yourself is a very difficult habit to kick i have not done so but i have gotten better at avoiding and or redirecting it a few things i have done maybe it will help first i qualify if someone is even worth comparing myself to are my goals my beginning my environment and the resources i have access to different than this person then why on earth am i comparing myself to them second if the person is doing something i want to do and the comparison is relevant i ask myself where was this person when they were at my point in life what was different between us then what have they done different third i realized a lot of people put on an image i often think back to people i have put on a pedestal at one point and later got to know better and quickly realized they are not all they are cracked up to be often times i am far ahead in certain areas of my life only a few things that came to mind it a process begin by eliminating how often you compare yourself and by who you compare yourself to eventually all comparisons will lessen or they might start comparing themselves to you secretly as you move forward ,1,howtonotgiveafuck

Sindrosan,there are multiple ways to handle dungeons in spirit of numenera theater of the mind is encouraged this could mean having a list of rooms and describing how the players encounter them or have an actual map that only you see as you describe everything to them alternatively you could have an actual map they can see for this i like to use generators such as this https donjon bin sh d20 dungeon until i get something i like then i make a list of what is in each room and figure out a way to simulate fog of war print out the map and cover undiscovered parts or project on a screen only the portions they can actively see i have used all of the above methods depending on what that session called for and what my players prefer in your case i would either 1 create a list of rooms and describe what it like as they run through the facility or 2 if you believe it requires them seeing a map get a simple pregen facility and designate what is in each room and describe it to them so they may still get the feel if your players do not like the dungeon crawly feel some of my players do not option 1 is preferred if your players like the crawl and or you consider it essential for the feel you want in the session then definitely do 2 ,2,numenera

Sindrosan,with some modification at the heart of numenera cypher system they could be a very science techy character what comes to mind is carter daniel and rodney from stargate sg1 and atlantis any other scifi show inspiration would work i just grew up on that a very smart character in their particular field s who can get things done that without them would be utterly impossible i am giving it all she got captain ,1,numenera
Sindrosan,if i were gm dependent on context i may allow at most having a resistance 1 step in your favor for all future interactions with the poison most of my time i have been a gm and when my players suggest something that does not work i usually try to tell them why that specific suggestion does not work such as a free attack on a 19 or damaging an opponent when rolling a 20 on defense and ask them to come up with something else or offer a few suggestions if we cannot find anything that seems appropriate we just make the effect you succeeded really cool like in doing this sometimes they get a great cinematic finish at least one time was worthy of bonus xp they like my counter suggestion or i relax my master plan and let them do something really cool and probably slightly over the top a key part is having a candid conversation at times for why an effect is or is not acceptable i would say talk to your gm about it is he saying no because lasting immunity is not appropriate ask him for suggestions for future reference on major and minor effects ask in what situations certain things are and are not workable have him express his creative gmness in this out of play moment so you both have a new understanding moving forwards i have had my players do that with me multiple times and it lead to better play in future sessions ,1,numenera
Sindrosan,i am not concerned if the word not that great i consider it essential to be able to add my own stuff to an engine at first just adding to the world and as i get more accomplished as a gm and with world building i just start having my own settings i really like homebrewing basically ,1,numenera
Sindrosan,watching office hours right now from that recommendation i prefer making npcs distinct in the way you mentioned i only want to train voices since my players like it seems like i need to learn to build in motives to more npcs reading some articles and realizing putting more emphasis on that even in creatures they fight could make it more fun in one session i ran the players did that quite well on their own they noticed that these four monstrous brutes coming to them were kinda dumb so they bluffed their way into having the creatures believe they were higherups and tricked them into locking themselves into a cage ,1,rpg
Sindrosan,it sounds like making my non player characters actual characters might just be what i am looking for as for voice acting the reason it brought up is my players mainly family in this case enjoys the voice acting since one of my friends who gm would for years is great at it it was a unanimous vote by that party for me to work on it during an intermediate session we had to discuss what changes we would make to the campaign ,1,rpg
Sindrosan,i will definitely have sessions that use this,1,rpg
Sindrosan,i like it being new to gming with players who were almost all rpg virgins before playing i like mechanic light engines to use especially since some of them are younger siblings who would not work well with a stat wall i have seen shadows brought up several times i will be keeping it in mind good to know it can cover some areas numenera does not ,1,numenera
Sindrosan,off hand focus works miracles comes to mind immediately it can be immensely powerful for healing for descriptors i usually steer new players away from trying to make the descriptor mechanically sound for their character instead i encourage them to choose the descriptor based mainly on roleplaying reasons why is your character a healer heck a battle medic could even be cool a glaive who knows how to put up a fight but part of his heart is tugging at him to ease the burden of pain on others that for so many years he inflicted an occultist or similar is definitely not your only option ,5,numenera
Sindrosan,i also forgot another reason i did that was because the other players were convinced that a jack was basically useless and it all about nanos and glaives so i guess i tried to break it on purpose to prove them wrong and sending physically offensive enemies is so much easier though fortunately he already had some mental attacks in store for that session i may have to check out that other game numenera is my first to gm but i want to explores others as well especially if they are a bit crunchier ,1,numenera

Sindrosan,i gave most of my reply in the edit above the patron actually did reveal why he left he had someone he trusted show them a numenera device that had a holographic recording of the armies and flying vessels of three factions 2 specific to my campaign plus the kingdom of navarene they allied with duking it out in the streets of bodrov against himself and his automaton army this was the point when he told the party i do not need you to recruit new people i need a new location and they basically have no idea where he is now they have a device he can track them with but that about it oh on his own he also is more of the quiet introverted type interesting you mentioned that i like the idea of most of the beings not being interested that would give some excellent non combat interactions which some players love i will have to try and draw some heavy inspiration from stargate which we are all very familiar with and they would catch on with quite quickly ,2,numenera
Sindrosan,they may not be a powergamer i once created a foolish jack who needs no weapon i do not remember everything in detail but i had a 3 or 4 on speed defense punched for 4 damage and got to roll every action twice and keep the greater number it was not to break the game and it was actually run by one of my regular players who wanted to try gming i just wanted to have fun seeing what i could do as captain america lesser known cousin who never graduated the ninth word equivalent of highschool i was basically untouchable in combat in that game but my character was not the brightest and actually got another player killed and was incredibly vulnerable to anything mental sure was fun though ,1,numenera

Sindrosan,without rehashing what others said on minimize shin usage for the setting if i were to offer shin it would be about enough for some relevant cypher artifact armor weapon i think may be useful at their tier as an alternate for my campaigns i prefer to have story motivations for completing a quest where the completion is the reward plus my players know that bonus xp is a thing other times discovery or justice are rewards something i will use moving forward is advanced tech and possible augmentations from some of the factions if they serve them in ways consistent with the factions goals think power armor laser rifles genetic enhancement type stuff ,2,numenera
Sindrosan,a bit late to the party but i keep it open based on context to use extra training in a relevant skill as an asset on a task in your example if someone were specialized in one handed attack and trained in the ability thrust i may count that training as an asset reducing total difficulty by 3 2 by skill 1 by asset in cases like this whether someone was trained or specialized in the relevant skill i would only apply 1 asset sometimes i may only apply the asset if they are specialized in the relevant skill ,1,numenera
Sindrosan,cypher core book is high priority for me to get i knew it had updated armor rules did not know it had updated combat i am also leaning towards either the cypher armor method or just effecting speed defense i realized i could not achieve the feel i wanted with armor and still keep it simple in numenera cypher system spirit ,1,numenera
Sindrosan,this may end up being more like what i go with i only wanted to include the light armor asset if there was the failed roll penalty otherwise straight speed defense penalty is suitable without burning through points faster my increase for armor wo not be as large with this system where i was considering light armor having as much as 6 with heavier types gaining more but still leaves room to boost high level armor and having a balanced penalty thanks for the input ,1,numenera
Sindrosan,far simpler which i like myself and my players were not fond of burning through points faster hence the new rules this would be my fallback though ,1,numenera
