Kron1900,the special counsel is the only way trump or comey could go after clinton with the special counsel both of their hands are clean i have been saying for a while that i think that what is been going on also the memo leak and the russian intel comey acted on when not recommending prosecution for hillary were are road flares directing muller to hillary and co i have not read this yet and do not know if my theory still holds ,2,The_Donald

Kron1900,we have know about the letter since the nyt reported on in about a month ago also i think gowdy has seen this letter and is what drove him to act the way he did in an interview with martha mccalum no idea if that how you spell her name i believe it the reason comey could not recommend prosecution with lynch as the ag it was corrupt from the top down an no reasonable prosecutor would bring a case that implicates the ag when the ag would be the one over seeing the case i think there a chance that comey may surprise everyone on thursday go to 5 30 mark and i believe gowdy is talking about the emails and make sure to listen to the very end https youtu be eedom1pgc6u,1,The_Donald
Kron1900,remember that leak several weeks ago that was only around for a couple days that said comey knowingly acted on fake russian intell when he recommended no prosocution for hillary have you read the scope of the doj letter drafted outlining what muller can look at i think there is a chance she is already being looked at by someone who has no skin in the game and is not tainted by accusation of a politically motivated investigation ,1,The_Donald
Kron1900,this goes with my theory that comey and trump worked together to get a special counsel i also think the memo leak was a way to get muller to other memos regarding clinton lynch and obama then there was the leak about comeys decision on clinton being influenced by fake russian intell which allows muller to go look at clinton with out going outside the scope of the letter the doj drafted to go outside the scope muller would have to inform the doj formally which someone would leak now that comeys decision became a russian issue clinton is fair game now we may have precedent a pede can dream right ,1,The_Donald
Kron1900, ,2,The_Donald
Kron1900,i have a theory that comey is good that the memo was a way to let muller know there were memos about lynch and clintons tarmac meeting and possibly memos on obama the other leak that came out is that comey acted on fake russian intell when deciding hillary fate the reason both of these things are significant is muller is bound by the latter drafted by the doj he has the ability to go outside the scope of the letter but not with out letting the dojknow about it it says something along the lines of everything russian and where the evidence leads him well this new evidence leads him to other memos and straight to hillary and her investigation muller can now go where he needs to go with out telling a soul which means no leaks i guess we will find out a little more on thursday ,1,The_Donald

Kron1900,i am just trying to think outside the box trump fires comey and meets with the russians the very next day then comey leaks a memo that by it self is pretty meaningless but implies obstruction it just seems to perfect and those actions definitely warrant a special counsel my guess is trump knew that and comey was in on it i think comey is pissed that his name and reputation got dragged through the mud his hand was forced and he had to stay on the sidelines and cover for the most corrupt admin ever or face the clinton machine trump and comey both win with out ever getting their hands dirty and both their names get cleared ,1,The_Donald
Kron1900,what if that was code for nunes to drop the hammer trump was saying every thing is in place and ready to go he cannot directly communicate with anyone at this point with out leaks and general backstabbing i would not be surprised if this was a go ahead man i love conspiracy shit ,6,The_Donald
Kron1900,i think it goes deeper than that i think trump and comey wanted the special council because neither had the ability to do anything i also think comey may be leading muller to hillary and here how several days ago it got leaked that comeys famous speech about no intent was influenced by fake russian intel muller has to stay in the purview of the letter drafted by the doj if he wants to go out side of what that letter allows he can but he has to inform the doj formally which someone would leak hillary and comeys decision now fall into the purview of the dojs letter and muller can look at it with out telling anyone i also think there is a good chance the memo leak was more of a tell to look at past memos involving lynch and bill than they were to crucify trump also having trump and comey appear at odds made muller a shoe in either this was set up or the people leaking shit might be the dumbest mfers on the planet any way just a theory and i wish i wrote better spez i will add that i think comeys number 2 mccabe is probably a target comey stayed in long enough to get shit in order and now mccabe has been left in to build a case against him while he tries to cover shit up just enough rope and all that any way i guess we will find out in the coming weeks ,4,The_Donald

Kron1900,ill add that they make tilt shift lenses as well as it being an effect that you can apply in photo shop i have used tilt shift lenses mostly for the opposite effect of making the entire picture in focus i mainly used the lens in product photography where i needed to shot the object from an angle where a traditional lens would leave the object only partially in focus due to depth of field and a vertical focal plane with a tilt shift lens you can change the focal plain from being vertical to a more horizontal plane making it easier to photograph relatively flat objects that have some depth to them they are also great for shooting architecture ,3,BeAmazed

Kron1900,my father is 76 years old and drives like a drunk person he is fine if he is focused on the road and only the road but if something happens in the car like a phone call or a song he likes comes on forget about it he used to have a 45 foot rv four years ago that we had to sell because he did 100k damage to it in about a year luckily all he hit were concrete pylons at gas stations and benches in rv parks shit one time he left the parking break on in the car he was towing and scraped down past the rims another time he forgot to put the anchor chains on the tow car and it came off and he did not know it had happened for 20 miles till he looked at the rear view camera thats always on the final straw was about three years ago i was in the car with him and we were going about 70 mph and exiting a highway he was messing with the radio and was heading straight for the sand barrels they have where the median starts i had to grab the wheel and yank it to get us back on course if think if i would have waited about a second longer i would not be typing this i now drive him everywhere ,2,YouShouldKnow

Kron1900,my dad is in his late 70 and has some issues some times i always let the manager know that he had an accident and that i will clean it up the best i can and seal any paper towels or soiled items in a trash bag we keep a change of clothes in the car and baby wipes at his age going out to lunch and dinner with the family is what he looks forward to the most and taking that away from him would suck there have been some pretty bad ones where i spent at least 30 to 40 min cleaning up after him but i love him and its something i am willing to do edit i should probably add that he has mobility issues and had a gastric bypass in the early 00 that makes it hard for him to hold it ,11,AskReddit

Kron1900,i was always hyper focused on one thing and kinda missed what was going on around me with that being said there is no way i made it through college with out it stuff turned me into a very efficient machine but its no way to go through life i also took ritalin for years before i was on adderall now that i think about it i have been on stimulants longer than i have been off edit i also never went through any noticeable withdraws i could start and stop when ever i wanted ,2,conspiracy
Kron1900,this was not true for me i took aderall for 13 years and it worked great i was on the 30 mg extended release once a day and never had to move up or take more now my liver and kidneys on the other hand are probably fucked i am 34 now and have not taken aderall in 8 years and probably never will again the prolonged use turned me into an emotionless robot that was great at getting work done but no longer could feel i wish i could describe that better but i guess i was just kinda on auto pilot with out ever truly feeling anything that for me was the worst part ,3,conspiracy
