Deranged40,your part uses 3 popsicle sticks and lots of glue which becomes the potential weak point if the glue breaks the middle stick may fumble around costing structural integrity but of course you are correct in assuming that vertical is much more stiff why not scrap the flat sticks and just glue and clamp while drying them to the vertical stick with a half stick offset you could use 3 layers wide or just 2 and there wo not be much excess glue ,73,EngineeringPorn

Deranged40,yeah the very last thing i want on my boat is someone like you who thinks there no chance at all that someone may board you seem like you do not even have a plan if that were to happen i get it everything should go to plan every single time you have got the higher ground the better skill the more stable platform the odds are heavily stacked in your favor but the thought that there no chance that they will board is a fallacy on your part but the fact that you cannot even entertain the idea that you might have to engage directly means you are not fit for the job sorry dude ,9,JusticeServed
Deranged40, all you need to be able to do is shoot a gun from a relatively stable platform the big ass tanker does not move much at a predictably moving target this line coupled with your avoidance of the actual question what if they board contradicts your statement about having been shooting for 30 years or at the very least your failure to answer that question definitely disqualified you that is not something that someone with even a season of experience would think actually ,4,JusticeServed

Deranged40,it more just the kind of person who signs up for the job and there a bit more to guns than just pointing and pulling the trigger while that will make the gun go boom there are many other factors than stable ground and predictably moving target they do not all move predictably this one just decided to not try to avoid being shot the exact wind conditions matter every shot will act just a little differently because of that all you need to be able to do is be okay with how many lives you ended on your trip ,71,JusticeServed

Deranged40,the reason i use an audio mixer is because i have a turntable a tv and a pc with multiple sound outputs all voip programs output from my onboard sound and everything else goes through the system default which is a sound card this lets me mix the volumes of the various devices independently and hear all of my audio through my two nice speakers or through my headphones ,1,pcmasterrace
Deranged40,sounds like you need a mixer behringer and mackie both make great products remember that most of your devices are probably stereo which is two inputs each so you need to mix 6 inputs to two outputs right and left behringer 1002 https www amazon com behringer xenyx 1002 channel audio dp b000j5wb4e is a good example of this channels 1 and 2 work as two independent mono channels so it would be more convenient for you to plug your 3 devices into inputs 3 4 5 6 and 7 8 this would give you a single volume knob per device from there just plug your headphones into the phones output you might need to get a 1 4 to 1 8 adapter they are real cheap ,1,pcmasterrace

Deranged40,he was talking about in real life ratios never work out perfectly there always tolerances to deal with if you had no oxidizer then at a certain point it would stop combustion entirely and would just spit out fuel if you had no gas then obviously the oxidizer would not combust on its own likewise if you simply did not have enough oxidizer then some of the fuel would not combust and would just get spit out with fire without oxygen gasoline will not burn in some cases spitting out excess fuel that did not burn may cause damage to the engine but spitting out excess oxidizer would not so they would prefer have just a little bit too much oxidizer rather than not quite enough the study of fuel burning is part of stoichiometry https en wikipedia org wiki stoichiometry ,2,KerbalSpaceProgram

Deranged40,1 you will get raided no matter where you are provided that you are not on peaceful mode of course i pay more attention to the type of tile ie mountain hills flatland the type of stone found there as well as the climate 2 pyromaniac and model are probably the two worst character traits in the game you can arrest them and sell them to pirates if you want but that going to take a mood hit on your colony 3 i have found that if you wait enough you will get pawns who are decent at most roles but one thing i never start a game without is a doctor with over 5 skill 4 all pawns are aliens there are pawns that crash land from outer space and there are other things that are not pawns too be patient 5 having a pawn who is hopefully decent in the handling skill prioritized to handle animals this is a task that they will complete when necessary 6 there no real need to make another settlement and in fact the game has a default setting to prevent actually settling a second colony mostly due to the performance hit it takes but to do so you will have to start a caravan move them to another tile and tell them to settle there 7 no specific game mode for this but you should be able to do it i have never tried to completely eliminate another faction 8 there is a water pump that will dry up some land types it is very slow it takes about an in game year to complete 9 this game is 2 5d at best the things above or below do matter ie ground type whether there a roof whether that roof is an overhead mountain etc there is only one z level that supports building of anything though no basements 2nd levels 10 i do not believe that this is supported right now in vanilla 11 stone walls marble granite limestone etc are the most ideal granite has the most hp per wall well except plasteel and uranium but that not practical so i would say that probably the best look around for partial walls and floors you can deconstruct them and pull the floor to provide you with some blocks early on before you get stonecutting researched wood does work to get through the first few nights but get rid of your wood walls as soon as you can 12 building into mountains and smoothing the stone floor is the best for early on wood works as well be careful for bugs if you dig too deep into mountains though ,6,RimWorld
