StrizzMatik,there is literally zero evidence that proves any russian collusion none the statistical evidence of hillary clinton rigging the primaries is indisputable students from stamford did the math themselves and came to the conclusion that clinton had a 77 million to 1 chance of winning all of the primaries vs bernie sanders especially in states where he was clearly commanding the lead and still lost you can tell by their crowd sizes alone that clinton never stood a chance without electoral fraud and fuckery to pad it out even democrats hated her and only voted for her because sanders was not a choice anymore this has been discussed extensively by robert david steele and many other current and ex intelligence insiders the only reason trump even won was because factions of the military and intelligence community intervened on his behalf to stop hillary from stealing the election via electronic voting fraud on soros owned machines he was not supposed to win and tons of the establishment cashed their chips in for clinton and found themselves tossed on their ass when trump pulled it out creating a massive power shift in our government all the way to the very bottom this is why you see the media and intelligence communities freaking out it because this upstart billionaire came in and basically fucked up the entire plan for them and threw several wrenches into their smoothly running propaganda machines and plans if there was a smoking gun with the russia story it would have been revealed months ago when this whole thing was literally fabricated by john podesta and clinton two people who ironically have tons of business ties to russia themselves how do i know they created this because it right in her fucking book this was a strategy meant to go into effect right when trump won to de legitimize him as president and control the narrative i did not vote for the guy but the rules are the rules and even tacitly supporting a deep state coup d etat against the sitting democratically elected president is completely un american and asking for trouble ,1,conspiracy
StrizzMatik,i am presuming based on the fact that you are eating up talking points from the media and not giving it a shred of very necessary skepticism you can dislike donald trump and still realize that the alternatives which are president mike pence and the deep state running unchecked are far worse than the trumped up caricature of donald trump being literally satan ,1,conspiracy

StrizzMatik,nobody disputing that the camps did not exist but they were forced labor camps not death camps yes jews were definitely killed but not 6 million of them the population numbers before and after the war do not add up or support these figures you would be very surprised if you knew just how much ww2 was propagandized and mythologized to protect the west in our history books and cover up the really fucked up things the allies did it was the russians and allies that ran death camps after world war ii that killed roughly a million german pows hitler was schooled and trained by mi5 and mein kampf was ghostwritten by jesuits the banks wall street and corporate america largely supported and admired hitler going as far as concocting the business plot in 1933 to install a fascist dictatorship in america that was exposed by smedley butler the nuremberg trials were guided specifically to only charge the axis with crimes that could not also be levied at the allies dresden anyone world war ii at its core was essentially a mass human sacrifice in the first place engineered by the vatican roman cult to kill millions of heretics using their knights of the holy see the nazis and their ss who themselves were directly modeled and based upon the hierarchy of the jesuit order and did i mention himmler and the entire upper leadership of the nazi party were devout jesuits and catholics the real reason hitler and germany went to war was because he fucked over his banker buddies by printing usury free money and the rothschilds banking establishment were not having it and because hitler wanted germany to be a dominant hemispheric power against the wishes of the ruling class sounds familiar maybe ,1,conspiracy

StrizzMatik,pedogate pizzagate is very real heavily fucked by disinformation but definitely real it was spun into bullshit by the media to be hillary running a child fucking ring out of cpp basement when in fact it was simply a group of people on 4chan and other sites that noticed weird coded language in john podesta and other dnc clinton connections emails and started to dig deeper and eventually this grew into pedogate because it all tied to a much larger international ring of child trafficking that involves high level politicians of almost every country and goes back decades the republicans are just as bad with pedophilia blackmail as the democrats and are likely even worse according to robert david steele let not forget that dennis hastert was literally repub speaker of the house and convicted as a serial child molester or that the franklin scandals in the 80s went all the way to the top of the reagan bush white house or that mccain graham priebus ryan both bushes and several other prominent rs have been implicated as a part of this by many people the angle that this is just a partisan democrat witch hunt is just deflection and dismissal of the topic because the implications can bring down our entire government an estimated 30 or more of our politicians are compromised with this when literally the entire media freaks the hell out and does back flips to get in front of a story and bury it you know something there this is a common tactic of cia mossad to honeypot politicians and celebrities to ensure their compliance and some of them are literally just sick fucks that enjoy it ,2,conspiracy

StrizzMatik,agreed i think he made it pretty clear that his intentions and the intentions of the illuminati were definitely negative but he did a good job of explaining how they are in some ways a necessary evil in the esoteric grand scheme of things to provide balance and a choice of service to yourself or others i think he said we exist to show you what you are not ie we have to be completely and utterly evil so you can realize your own inherent divinity or something to that effect ultimately he is not wrong when he says that we are literally all just parts of a greater whole and behind the scenes we are all fully aware of our roles within the great game ,2,conspiracy

StrizzMatik,to be fair he avoided putting specific dates and times on any sort of specific events the 2012 thing was technically wrong but the esoteric spiritual apocalypse and its meaning is very open to interpretation and also said that plans were subject to change depending on how certain things played out within the factions of the illuminati itself it entirely plausible that he could be a fake but it fairly unlikely considering how considered and informative his replies were nobody just makes all that shit up on the spot and people in real time on the thread were trying to trip him up constantly to prove he was a fraud and failed every time ,1,conspiracy
StrizzMatik,idk he clearly has an extremely deep understanding of these subjects much more than the average larp he was insanely consistent and if you look at how the ats thread actually evolved they tried many times to trip him up and expose himself as a fake and he never slipped i do not care how good of a larper you are that pretty tough there is something to say about the fact that he openly identifies as a luciferian and as we all know they are all about deceit and trickery so i am sure there at least a few blatantly false morsels in there to muddy the waters and provide plausible deniability i would say that a large majority of it is very much true or he at least believes it to be true ,0,conspiracy
StrizzMatik,from what i understand as he explained it they do this every once in awhile as some sort of internal decree with the elite he described it basically as a task that he was obligated to fulfill by his upline to answer our questions provided the right questions were asked as not to impugn on our free will and right not to know possibly a rite of passage within the luciferians ,1,conspiracy
StrizzMatik,lol it might be per minute i was trying to remember the exact figure i would read but i might have slipped a digit unit somewhere basically they would have had to completely burn two bodies every minute for x years straight no deviation or interruptions to get that number a human body takes a long time to completely burn up in general so the amount that they are talking simply is not feasible and there ample evidence that the numbers of dead have been fudged many times over and the 6 million jews killed meme was used well over a dozen times in different instances in history as their headline to the point where it pretty obviously fishy i am going to try to find the article i read though ,3,conspiracy
StrizzMatik,i think the trump being john titor a time traveler meme is obviously kind of ridiculous but it certainly hilarious to think about just imagine if it was true lmfao i will say that considering how often he able to completely play the media at their own game and always end up looking better in the end than he did before it certainly lends a little bit of credibility to the idea that he 10 steps ahead of his detractors almost all the time here a video of trump calling out anthony weiner and making a mention to pizzagate in 2011 i know he was likely using the casual gate term for comedic effect but still in the context of being predictive programming and or trump being a supposed time traveler kinda makes you wonder https youtu be 4tikt8yu4dw ,2,conspiracy

StrizzMatik,i voted for obama the first time around because bought into his whole charade of hope and change i was heavily liberal myself at the time especially after 8 years of george w bush but he is a perfect example of somebody saying really nice and great things and doing the exact opposite he basically allowed wall street to fuck us with no lube and presided over the largest theft of public money to the private sector in history 5 4 trillion vastly expanded the already unconstitutional policies of george w bush and continue to prosecute even more wars and drone attacks under his command as a classical liberal libertarian it was obama betrayal of his promises to undo bush administration fuckery that really made me dive into the rabbit hole of understanding the power structures that control the presidents and other heads of state you are very much correct in that clinton bush obama and possibly even trump are all cronies behind the scenes they are there to serve their interests and the interests of others like them which stand in opposition to the needs and desires of the people far more often than they do not trump to his credit is not a part of the gang so to speak he was recruited by a counter coup of ic military white hats to basically throw out the bush clinton machine that has controlled our political system since the days of jfk he was not supposed to win and only did so because of the direct involvement of the ic and military on his behalf to halt clinton attempted electronic voter fraud the same kind that hillary used to defraud bernie of 13 primary wins that he should have gotten problem is he has since surrounded himself by the same old neocon neoliberal swamp dwellers he campaigned on fighting which has caused him to roll back on many of his more moderate bipartisan ideas and turn a huge amount of his base against him and he places far too much operational control of his presidency into the hands of scumbag fucks like jared kushner and mcmaster who are actively undermining him and his policies on behalf of the deep state in an attempt to get him under control do not take this as a ringing endorsement for donald trump i think the man is an emotional child frequently puts himself into a corner with his own words he should be far more tactful in general than he actually is and his support for israel saudi arabia seriously concerns me but i prefer to look at trump being president as an opportunity for serious change at a local and public level for the positive because we will probably never get this chance again the elite are hurting and crippled but not completely beaten and they will make damn sure in 2020 to not let a political outsider get anywhere near the presidency and have history repeat itself ever again there plenty of reasons to hate him but the truth is that for the first time possibly ever america is not in direct political control of the oligarchs anymore and he definitely pisses off all the right people for all the right reasons we should use trump as the useful idiot he is to bring our country back to a republic with constitutional governance while we still have some sympathetic ears left in government ,1,conspiracy

StrizzMatik,it certainly something you have to take with a grain of salt but a lot of the concepts he talks about are very real the political landscape is radically different now than it was when seth rich was still alive as well the cabal was firmly in control of politics in the united states government in 2016 and it can be said that they certainly are not now thanks to trump win and the bush clinton factions being ousted who have essentially been running the country since jfk if op is legitimately tied to steve pieczenik white hat coup like he claims he is i think there something to this he not wrong in saying that inevitably it will have to come to violence to take the power back from them but he not advocating for violence itself he is telling us very simply that under constitutional law these people are criminals and should be arrested and under the same constitutional law it is our right to do so however i also agree that we would need the help of the intelligence community military and law enforcement to achieve this peaceful noncompliance is the order of the day in my opinion but we have also never faced evil like this as a species collectively in our history these people were billionaires by the time of christ have spent millennia perfecting and tweaking their plan and power never gives up power willingly the roman anglo khazarian cabal has shown they will stoop to any level of depravity and evil to retain it as well so like he said do people just sit on their asses and expect a savior or are you going to take the power back with your own hands ,2,conspiracy
StrizzMatik,i have no problem with honest discussion but you are basically just calling the guy a heretic and discounting the very real and verifiable information he is posting your zealotry also ignores the fact that christianity is a heavily controlled and falsified religion created by the very same elites we are talking about as a system of control if christ existed he was likely a normal man who was able to ee through the veil of our current density and manipulate it something we are all capable of this is why he frequently said what he did was nothing special and that all people are capable of it him being the literal and only son of god is a fiction created by the council of nicea in 325 ad and the story of his birth and divinity is lifted almost wholesale from paganism sun worship and the persian god of mithras the big secret of the monotheistic religions is that they are all luciferian in nature or were corrupted to be such the truth the elites do not want you to figure out is that we the human race is yahweh which is essentially a social memory complex think a sentient plasmic being whereas the majority of the elite are of the luciferian social memory complex we are all divine beings of light and ultimately even those who would be considered of a negative disposition are exactly like us yahweh is only one of many gods of creation throughout our universe and part of a larger galactic federation much like lucifer ra quetzalcoatl etc this planet is a sub logos of our sun which is a sub logos of the milky way galaxy and so on and so forth think about the russian doll analogy all parts and pieces of the same infinite creator all is one one is all christianity and the other religions are just simplifications of this concept pared down for human understanding the ultimate goal of every sentient being in the universe is to are turn to source and remember that we are all both creation and creator i suggest researching the law of one and some of the concepts of syncretism to have a better understanding of what i am talking about but i am sure you understand the picture and likely disagree but w e ,1,conspiracy

StrizzMatik,there good reason for the hatred towards zionism israel israel created isis and helped with the creation of al qaeda was the chief profiteer that gained from the 9 11 attacks politically and militarily and extensive evidence of the plot and people involved in the investigation proves that it was likely planned and carried out by israel and the mossad most jews are normal law abiding people but those in power within politics and the financial and entertainment industries are an entirely different story israel clearly has an inordinate amount of control over our foreign policy and trump is no more in control of his actions than any other puppet in the oval office israel has an estimated 70 80 of our politicians blackmailed into doing their bidding in politics nothing happens by accident if it happens you can bet it was planned that way franklin delano roosevelt,6,conspiracy

StrizzMatik,it fairly obvious that the deep state and trump are not on the same page he did not fall for their bait to get him into a bigger war with syria or north korea and compromised israel attempts at a new false flag to the russians so even israel is furious with him with comey gone and their gatekeeper protection gone with him they are not taking chances that trump wo not expose them they want him out that why you are seeing the hysterics from the media when trump technically committed no crime here as the president he can declassify and share any info he chooses whenever he wants as per law ,19,conspiracy

StrizzMatik,there far less motive for russia to kill a random dnc staffer than there is for the dnc for fairly obvious reasons especially considering that the info leaked indirectly helped russia by hurting clinton campaign so not only did russia infiltrate the dnc with a mole but they also killed their mole and have hit teams on standby in the us to whack anyone they need to do you not see the incredible reaching here ,1,conspiracy

StrizzMatik,yes the timing is definitely shady for sure but you also have to realize there a lot of things going on behind the background that are not being reported on that certainly could have had an impact on why comey was fired as we all know it was definitely for unofficial reasons what we do not know is what those reasons are israel is involved in plenty of domestic affairs there a reason aipac wields a ridiculous amount of power in congress just like there a reason why tons of mossad agents were routed out and arrested in the months following 9 11 for suspected ties to the plot itself and why mostly everybody of importance tied to 9 11 in the profiting of the attack was a zionist israeli politician or dual israeli citizen working in the united states government or with the neoconservatives of the bush administration how about the five dancing israelis two were mossad agents that were captured on the day of the attacks and then let go then appeared on israeli national tv and admitted that they were there to document the event why would benjamin netanyahu repeatedly state that 9 11 was a great day for israel what about that domestic abuse trump has far more ties to israel and political zionism than anything russia could ever hope for in the trump administration and trump is literally no different in many ways and in some ways better so far than bush or obama at least if we are comparing body counts you guys have this amnesia where bush and obama did not blatantly circumvent constitutional and international law on a daily basis and commit horrible crimes daily they just dressed up their language better and had a more compliant and dumbed down population ,1,conspiracy
StrizzMatik,if you are looking at it from another side of the lens you could also see it as comey being the only person obstructing investigation into clinton and her clinton foundation or the nationwide pedophilia rings or the fact that he was ridiculously incompetent in the first place and should have been fired months ago for not only refusing to bring charges against hillary clinton that were more than justified but for continuing to help undermine the trump administration with bulshit accusations based on shaky evidence bolstered by the source of the claims in this case the head of the fbi director comey continuing an investigation that has after 8 months of continuous rampant speculation and fear mongering produced exactly jackshit of hard evidence but the truth is probably somewhere in the middle and you are definitely still overestimating russian influence in our politics when you should be looking at israel influence a whole lot more as that has actual credible proof and evidence supporting it going back decades ,1,conspiracy

StrizzMatik,this means literally nothing it basically the catholic church saying well we had the best intentions signing it and covering their ass you know the same church that actively denied and suppressed the knowledge of the holocaust it no secret that pope pius pacelli turned a blind eye to the victims of the nazi regime and did not even apologize for their role in it for decades i noticed you seem to be ignorant on the true history of the jesuit order or you would not be so glib about dismissing them there a very good reason why the order has been consistently extirpated thrown out and hunted in virtually every european nation since their creation at their core they are a fanatical military order loyal only to the superior general of the jesuit order and are the enforcers and hidden hands behind politicians intelligence services and the puppet pope temporal power over the planet they have a long and storied history of political infiltration blackmail subversion assassinations and murder of people from any walk of life including kings and presidents the doctrine of death to any heretic by any means necessary is right in their oaths of induction why do you think it is that the united states government had cut all ties to the vatican after 1867 until 1984 it because until the jesuits subverted the department of education through their puppets the rockefellers it was common knowledge that the jesuits and vatican implicitly backed the confederate army and arranged for this assassination of abraham lincoln you can read the works of charles chiniquy to further confirm this let look at hitler various ties to catholicism and the jesuits shall we parents alois hitler born aloys schicklgruber june 7 1837 january 3 1903 was the father of adolf hitler baptized roman catholic at infancy remained roman catholic his whole life klara hitler born klara p lzl august 12 1860 december 21 1907 was the mother of adolf hitler by her husband alois she was a devout roman catholic and went to church regularly both parents were buried in a roman catholic cemetery http www spirituallysmart com images hitlergrave jpg july 1897 hitler enrolled in the monastery s choir and school adolf continues to do well achieving the austrian equivalent of straight a s he will later recall since in my free time i received singing lessons in the cloister at lambach i had excellent opportunity to intoxicate myself with the solemn splendor of the brilliant church festivals it seemed to me perfectly natural to regard the abbot as the highest and most desirable ideal just as my father regarded the village priest as his ideal http www spirituallysmart com hitlerchoir jpg may 22 1904 fifteen year old adolf hitler is confirmed roman catholic at linz cathedral sponsored by one of alois s pallbearers and former customs house colleague adolf hitler son of the catholic church died while defending christianity it is therefore understandable that words cannot be found to lament over his death when so many were found to exalt his life over his mortal remains stands his victorious moral figure with the palm of the martyr god gives hitler the laurels of victory spanish dictator francisco franco knight of the order of christ published on the 3rd of may 1945 the day of hitler death reforme 21st of july 1945 the fuhrer had come to power thanks to the votes of the catholic zentrum only five years before but most of the objectives cynically revealed in mein kampf were already realized this book an insolent challenge to the western democracies was written by the jesuit father staempfle and signed by hitler for as so many ignore the fact it was the society of jesus which perfected the famous pan german programme as laid out in this book and the fuhrer endorsed it staempfle was later sent to dachau and assassinated most likely to to his inside information on hitler personal life the secret history of the jesuits page 138 on 30 january 1933 adolf hitler was appointed chancellor on 23 march 1933 his government was given legislative powers through the enabling act and was passed by all reichstag except the social democrats and communists whose deputies had already been arrested hitler had obtained the votes of the centre party led by prelate ludwig kaas by issuing oral guarantees of the party continued existence and the autonomy of the church and her educational institutions he also promised good relations with the holy see which some interpret as a hint on a future concordat in other words a catholic priest was largely responsible for putting hitler in power ludwig kaas born in trier kaas was ordained a priest in 1906 and studied history and canon law in trier and rome 1906 he completed a doctorate in theology and in 1909 he obtained a second doctorate in philosophy in 1910 he was appointed rector of an orphanage and boarding school near koblenz until 1933 he devoted his spare time to scholarly pursuits later kaas would frequently travel to rome where he would stay with pacelli and and experience first hand the new lateran treaty which he published on in 1931 and 1932 continued as an advisor in negotiations for a reichskonkordat that however came to nothing until 1933 1933 15 march kaas was the main advocate supporting the hitler administration enabling act in return for certain constitutional and allegedly ecclesiastic guarantees hitler responded positively via papen 23 march kaas gave a speech outside reichstag voicing the centre support for the bill amid concerns put aside this vote for the enabling act was a major step in the institution of the dictatorship of adolf hitler and is remembered as the prime example of a democracy voting for its own demise just like the patriot act largely because of kaas request for guarantees and because of his later involvement in the reichskonkordat negotiations kaas and papen traveled together to rome and had discussions on the train von papen had assured kaas that a concordat with the new government was a sure thing kaas had worked on a reichkoncordat for over ten years and now hitler offered it hitler goebbels himmler and most members of the party old guard were catholics wrote m frederic hoffet it was not by accident that because of its chiefs religion the national socialist government was the most catholic germany ever had this kinship between national socialism and catholicism is most striking if we study closely the propaganda methods and the interior organisation of the party on that subject nothing is more instructive than joseph goebbel works he had been brought up in a jesuit college and was a seminarist before devoting himself to literature and politics every page every line of his writings recall the teaching of his masters so he stresses obedience the contempt for truth some lies are as useful as bread he proclaimed by virtue of a moral relativism extracted from ignatius of loyola writings frederic hoffet l lmperialisme protestant flammarion paris 1948 pp 172 ss another highly placed hitlerian walter schellenberg former chief of the german counter espionage completed this confidence from the fuhrer after the war the s s organisation had been constituted by himmler according to the principles of the jesuits order their regulations and the spiritual exercises prescribed by ignatius of loyola were the model himmler tried to copy exactly the reichsfuhrer ss himmler title as supreme chief of the ss was to be the equivalent of the jesuits general and the whole structure of the direction was a close imitation of the catholic church hierarchical order a mediaeval castle near paderborn in westphalia and called webelsbourg was restored it became what could be called a ss monastery i can see himmler

StrizzMatik,probably even more clout the bushes and to a lesser extent the clintons are one of the main players behind coordinating the drug running human trafficking and money laundering of the american empire through the cia and their terrorist cartel proxies on behalf of their cfr friends like the rockefellers and rothschilds poppy bush and cheney are still bosses behind the scenes ,1,conspiracy

StrizzMatik,so in other words an outside nation with no legitimate authority over another sovereign territory decided we are going to take your land and force you off of it and give it to the jews the people who owned and lived on the land for 1000 1500 years rightfully refused and the outside nation went ahead and did it anyways the palestinians refused because it is their land the vast majority of jews do not even have genetic ties to the region ever since then the state of israel has illegally ignored multiple un resolutions against further encroachment of palestinian territory almost uniformly vetoed by only the united states and israel against all other countries has almost completely swallowed any paltry territory the palestinians have left and have forced the rest into what is essentially an open air prison camp creating an apartheid state last i checked that an illegal military occupation ,2,conspiracy

StrizzMatik,yes this reminds me heavily of some of the gnostic hli type posts from 4chan for sure you should also read the hidden hand dialogue from above top secret http www illuminati news com 00363 html it was an ama with a member of one of the bloodline families that echos many of the teaching and precepts of the law of one ra material http www lawofone info i bet you would love it if you do not already know if it ,2,conspiracy
StrizzMatik,the white dragon society also known as the dragon family is the group that benjamin fulford is a spokesperson for they are representative of one of the asian branches of the elites possibly one of the ancient bloodlines and claim to be part of a reformatory faction of the illuminati working with other factions in trying to rid the world of the khazarian mafia satanic illuminati and bring about an era of unbridled wealth prosperity advances in technology space travel quality of life and the truth of our origins and species role within the universe there a little primer video here that goes into some of the details https youtu be u1f hk5txn8 this video here is benjamin fulford speaking with chodoin daikaku founder and ceo of the united world karate association and close friend teacher of vladimir putin and alexander romanov prince and descendant of the russian romanov family who claims to be a grandmaster of the same illuminati behind the american french russian revolutions https youtu be pin29cwzrmw about the goals and motivations of the white dragon society here another interview from 2009 between fulford and prince leo lyon zagami of santa elia author 33 of the ancient and accepted scottish rite of freemasonry grandmaster of the ordo illuminatorum universalis and supreme magus of the r c of the italian pythagoric tradition https youtu be kqpg mc1ciq part 2 https youtu be tnntdwdijek take it with a grain of salt of course as fulford and his guests say and report some pretty fantastical stuff but a lot of it is quite plausible and or believable and matches up with what a lot of people know about the jesuit illuminati khazar power structure ,3,conspiracy
StrizzMatik,you are looking a little too far into it all i said was that i do not think he as dumb as people not specifically you claim that he is ,1,conspiracy
StrizzMatik,i have watched a few press briefings with spicer and he stays on his toes pretty well most the time and has rightfully put the press corps in their place more than a few times he certainly not the bumbling idiot he described as although some of his publicized screw ups give the impression that he might be ,2,conspiracy
StrizzMatik,the media is not so discreetly spreading info that his days are numbered with trump although this could always be more theater and designed to make the administration look weak to its enemies but who knows robert david steele seems to think he confused and resisting the diversification of the political thought in the white house because bannon is mr hardline conservative and not much of a team player unless they are on the same ideological team trump is bringing in a bunch of moderates and democrats to the cabinet that now have his ear too and when you combine that with his highly publicized spats with kushner and ivanka it not looking too good for him ,1,conspiracy
StrizzMatik,they probably got some fucked up blackmail on trump there are rumors that there is a snuff film of him and a twelve year old girl in it another says israel chabad lubavitch have evidence of an incestual relationship with ivanka and are working through kushner to enforce his compliance and yet another says that kushner and ivanka are deceiving trump and misleading him on behalf of the same people he could be doing the usual political theater 5d chess to fool the deep state or he might just have been in on it the whole time no one really knows granted these are just rumors and there no real proof of any of it other than what we are seeing in the press and media so we are all trying to guess at the motivations and intentions ,2,conspiracy
StrizzMatik,scary but rings true i do not think it will be quite as much violence as people are saying though once it dawns on them that we are at a crux of history where we can change everything for the better i think cooler heads will eventually prevail to that effect i hope the rumors of the white dragon family finally getting their hands on the global collateral accounts and finally releasing exotic technology open source tech and bringing about disclosure come out true just imagine what we could accomplish ,2,conspiracy
StrizzMatik,would not surprise me but there also some heavy handed rumors that there a videotape of an underage snuff film starring trump and a 12 year old girl is out there he more than likely either being blackmailed or this is masterful political theater ,1,conspiracy
StrizzMatik,yep the more and more things come out the more i am believing that this is trump goading his usual detractors into a trap to support him and draw out the deep state almost all of his supposed flip flops turned out to be half measures failures or noncommittal gestures let look at what is happened the syrian gas attack last week was almost certainly carried out by factions within the deep state apparatus if it even happened at all and was not completely staged cia director mike pompeo and several others warn trump that this is a false flag attack after which proof then comes out proving that it was a fabrication from multiple sources and basic logic and sleuthing trump fires off 59 tomahawk missiles at an abandoned base gives forewarning to russia and syria by extension and over half of them do not reach the target and no lasting damage is done this gets the media and a lot of his detractors off of his back in the process approval ratings go up the media drops the russia narrative completely he looks tough on assad for the optics and the neocons then goes and reassures the public that we will not be invading syria drops the outdated moab on cia tunnels and proxies in afghanistan certainly not a positive outcome for them refuses to back down over north korea and north korea refuses to back down from missile testing china and most of the world joins with us to pressure them missile test ends in spectacular failure and embarrassment for the nk regime and tensions are diffused trump sends a tweet reassuring americans that our relationship with russia will be fine and not to worry about it all these strange turns of phrase that are loaded with hidden meaning what is going on here several alternative news sites and reporters such as benjamin fulford david wilcock robert david steele the x22 report and others are claiming that this is either all theater to draw out and expose the deep state and that trump is either playing them into revealing their hand or that his sell out to the khazarians deep state is in fact legit and will end in his impeachment or resignation going further david wilcock and fulford have both stated that world war 3 will not be allowed to happen regardless of the khazarian propaganda push and war provocations and that major announcements will be made soon that will affect everyone on the planet in a positive way obviously you have to take this all with a grain of salt but it does give me a little hope that this is not all going to end in nuclear fallout david wilcock benjamin fulford april 18 2017 https youtu be g 15tqcg1c x22 report episode 1255b https youtu be 8d7qgbufxjs robert david steele on phibetaiota net http phibetaiota net 2017 04 robert steele the syrian missile attack theatrics house cleaning false flag attack organized by mccain brennan mcmaster funded by saudi arabia and israel ,7,conspiracy

StrizzMatik,yes he said that after he was directly attacked by said poster are you not understanding cause and effect how would you respond if someone came along and called you a charlatan a fake and a fraud and made blanket statements to disrespect you without even knowing you or anything about your work you would probably be combative right it sounds like you are of the opinion that he should have kowtowed to the poster blatantly disrespectful tone and pandered to his weak arguments and mindset instead of rightfully saying go fuck yourself like most people would do in his situation if the guy were in person that would be grounds for a punch to the face the fact that i even have to explain this is hilarious you would be fired from any real job for responding the way mr steele did during his ama that how i know steele is a cia spook liar is there any other kind good thing it a fucking conspiracy subreddit and not an actual job or anything actually important to real life and yeah there actually normal people who just happened to get a job with the cia and some of them are fine upstanding people just like in virtually any other profession what a thought i bet you think all police officers are minority beating dog killing fascists too right your black and white thinking is ridiculous where do you think the vast majority of whistleblowers come from that right the intelligence agencies we would know infinitely less than we do now about the deep state the power structure and the world around us without those people who risk their lives and careers to get us this information ftfy which conspiracy user would trust a cia spook at their word anyone who does is as questionable as the cia spook anyone who gives the cia spook clearance without any evidence of his claims his word is shit as long as he has no physical evidence to share you mean physical evidence of his knowledge like the dozens of articles books and papers he written with insane levels of detail exposing the cia deep state the role of saudi arabia and israel in american politics the false flag of 9 11 the honeypot brownstone blackmail of our politicians his work encompassing common sense intelligence reform and voter reform strategies that could drastically improve everything we have right now introduce total intelligence transparency between citizens and government and save tons of money in the process you clearly have not read any of that if you think he not legit and you come off like an ignorant jackass just spouting conspiracy groupthink educate yourself http phibetaiota net ,1,conspiracy
StrizzMatik,lol i see so your logic dictates that when the person you agreed with clearly acted like a douchebag he just asking the right questions and the evil cia man deserved it because he cia mmmmkay no you claimed that he is looking for a position within trump administration and there is nowhere that i have seen where he implicitly states that he looking for that only seeking to have a conversation with trump and other bipartisan politicians so try your use misleading and false information to bolster your argument strategy elsewhere no excuses here the poster was being a douchebag and steele was a douchebag right back to him maybe a little immature but certainly not unwarranted it has nothing to do with trusting him or not it about using proper etiquette and respect towards another human being instead of ripping him a new asshole out of some smug sense of moral superiority steele is a cia spook any respected conspiracy theorist knows not to trust the cia ex cia spook and outspoken critic of the agency who repeatedly states that it should be dismantled burned to the ground and the earth salted where it stood but let not let logic and facts get in the way of your rhetoric a smart conspiracy theorist does not trust the cia that true but they also do not dismiss potentially useful information just because it coming from a source you do not agree with that just makes you dumb and unwilling to look past your own bias by your measuring stick i guess sibel edmunds john kiriakou and edward snowden were all playing us too right ,1,conspiracy
StrizzMatik,lol now you are just jumping to your own conclusions and making tons of assumptions about me i went down when i was 14 i am now 33 and no longer religious as if that has any bearing on this conversation whatsoever in the first place my only tie with russia is that i do not want ww3 that it and if you have read my other response to you you will know that i am not ignorant whatsoever in how and why mossadegh was kicked out maybe you were under the assumption that this was an actual conversation back and forth instead of you just writing a book of text and making more idiotic assumptions about my knowledge on the subject when you have no fucking clue about me or my motivations personally i do not really care about how russia handles their lgbtq policies it has no bearing on my life and there are far worse persecutions of other cultures and people going on right now that deserve more attention at least it not a muslim country they handle their gay problem with much more brutality i do not agree with their stance on homosexuality but i do not live there so it a moot point but nice try making another assumption about my supposed religious background if i wanted to be a douchebag and make the same sort of ignorant and prejudiced comments about you i could say that since you are iranian you are probably a muslim and therefore a child rapist woman hater inbred and a fanatical terrorist see how stereotypes work ,1,conspiracy
StrizzMatik, here where you are wrong a stable iran is in the interest of the us that why they supported the shah he was increasing the living standard and iran was starting to slowly flourish that why the us told the shah to use his army and strike down the revolution which the shah refused because he did not want a bloodbath wow never thought i would see somebody idolizing the shah as a good thing this was a corrupt western puppet who deposed the popular pm mossadegh in a coup d etat for daring to nationalize iran oil supply against british interests who was backed by the cia and mi5 persecuted the baha i faith manipulated oil prices against the west flaunted his obscene wealth regularly while the iranian poor starved ruled as an autocratic dictator and used the savak brutally to suppress all political dissent and lock up almost 3 000 political dissidents it was his meddling with opec that ultimately turned the us uk governments against him and had us strengthen ties to saudi arabia instead and his educational reforms eventually led to widespread joblessness when they were unable to accommodate the new educated class which turned into support for the revolution and led to the current iranian regime great guy smashing success on the contrary iranians inside iran have no sympathetic feelings towards russians and this goes back decades russia disinformation campaign is entirely ineffective in iran whereas in the west it finds a place to root amongst the disheveled no this has nothing to do with any sort of sympathetic feelings towards russia people do not want world war 3 that pretty much it and it common sense for america to have stable relationships with the only other country on the plant that can wipe us out simple as that russia has nothing to do with the fact that the united states has an incredibly corrupt government that does not follow the will of its people they are not far more honest they are extremely conniving and you should stand up for your fellow americans against russia psychological warfare waged on america refer to the 9 11 expose they did that is honesty you will never find in america reporting it clear cut that you have a completely skewed view of reality so there no point in continueing this conversation lol you mean kind of like your entirely tenuous and provably false connection of trump russia gtfo of here with that discredited buzzfeed bullshit ,1,conspiracy
StrizzMatik,he has also been a big proponent of open source technology which is essentially the crux of what advanced technology will be and he talked about the pentagon black budget before which is where a lot of that tech is created fun fact the creator of the haarp array originally created it to redirect the jetstreams over drought stricken countries and areas like the sahara desert to promote terraforming and generally benefit humanity before the dod air force bought it ,1,conspiracy

StrizzMatik, i was merely demonstrating with a recent example how right wingers will easily take money from companies that wish to limit the freedom and privacy of citizens in europe a number of right wing politicians and movements have already been linked to receiving funding from russia and my point is that this behavior is in no way unique to right wingers and corrupt congressmen and senators voting on a bill against the wishes of the millions of constituents that do not agree with their decision should not be a strike against right leaning people in general our politicians do not enforce our will you understand and i do not think any normal people on either side of the political aisles agreed with that decision republicans in america are typically pro constitution pro freedom the actions of the democratic and republican globalists in our government do not represent us the idea that the republican and democratic parties have any real difference other than wedge issues is a massive misconception and the reason the two party tyranny continues today either way you are still drawing an incredibly tenuous and flimsy link to russia just because some european right wingers happen to have financial ties to them pardon me russia is supporting the theocrats that are oppressing the population in the place i am from there is no xenophobia towards russia there is simply an adequate reaction to russia support for the oppression of my people granted you are in a fairly unique position there but do not think for a second that just because the united states does not support the ayatollahs means that they have any intention of letting a moderate secular iran flourish if that was the case we would have gone in a long time ago and taken care of the ayatollahs but we do not because dictatorships are easy to deal with compared to democracies and republics where they are beholden to the will of the people american government hates secular muslim nations or any nation that expresses self determination outside of the whims of washington you forget that our government wants to go after iran too and it certainly not to free those poor people from oppression like i have said i have been looking into this subject for over a decade you are underestimating the effectiveness of their disinformation campaigns maybe in iran that a huge issue considering they are your neighbors and because iran state media is nowhere as effective as ours but russian propaganda does not have a thing on america propaganda system and have no serious effect on our political process or general viewpoints and they will admit that themselves russians did not convince people to vote for donald trump russians did not need to tell us that hillary clinton was a corrupt pos we figured all that out for ourselves through wikileaks and other alternative media and are you that naive to believe that rt would do this just to educate and inform the american public because the russian state cares so deeply for the truth russia in essence is a mafia state opposition leaders are gunned down in broad daylight critical journalists are murdered on their doorsteps of course not it does not change the fact that they are far more honest than our own media at reporting the truth their reasons for doing so are totally irrelevant rt does not really report anything surprising to people who already look into this stuff in the first place they are just slightly less slanted in the direction of globalism and pro americanism i know enough to know that as a citizen of america i can safely state that all of the bad things you talk about russia can be easily levied at our government and much worse we would not even be here if it had not been for the wholesale extermination of 200 million native americans ,1,conspiracy

StrizzMatik,oh i am sure all those people getting executed their limbs chopped off for minor crimes women being raped and stoned and gays being thrown off rooftops and thousands of people jailed for expressing political opinions that dissent from the royal family all love and support their dictatorship that why the us military has standing orders to invade saudi arabia just in case the civilian population ever rise up against the royal family right btw answer is 33 million population as of 2017 and although estimates place the amount of wahhabi sunnis at 60 70 percent of population they differ widely on matters of personal and social politics and the population itself is becoming increasingly more moderate and wahhabism itself is being phased out in power and importance both culturally and by the government in saudi arabia either way i think it oversimplifying to say that the majority of the population of saudi arabia agree with the actions of the royal family especially when it an absolute monarchy that allows no dissent even if many people in saudi arabia do support the regime it does not change the fact that they the house of saud are the worst human rights violator in the hemisphere and that the united states implicitly supports them and even praises them yet you say russia is this demonic entity with all this power and you cheerlead for war against them my point is what makes you think america is any better in this regard or any more innocent than russia as an american i can say for a fact we have a lot more blood on our hands as a country than russia does here a tip though if you are having a discussion with somebody irl and they ask you how you can tacitly support one despotic regime while downplaying or praising the actions of another the normal reaction is to debate the topic and not threaten physical violence kinda makes you look like you have anger issues just saying ,1,conspiracy
StrizzMatik,how does conservative senators voting for isps to have more power have a thing to do with russia russia is not the first or the last country to engage in censorship and their population traditionally conservative leanings do not have anything to do with american conservativism a great number of conspiracies came up with the us during the cold war because that was when the united states government got down to their dirtiest most immoral and imperialistic shit behind closed doors and in the third world gulf of tonkin being a fabrication our military going around the world and killing third world leaders that did not play ball with us and jfk rfk mlk jr being assassinated by our government actually happened so what conspiracy theories are you talking about that were supposedly propagated by russians this response leads me to think that you are buying into obvious jingoism and xenophobia towards russia and give them far too much credit for what they deserve when it comes to the effectiveness of their anti american propaganda they do not really need to make up much about the united states that is not already true sadly we engender propaganda about our country due to the notorious nature of our deeds around the world and the reason rt and other outlets have americans on there that have different narratives from the establishment in american politics and media is because those traditional outlets universally reject anything that does not jive with the official narratives that they manufacture for the public you are certainly never going to see anything on mainstream western networks that admits that 9 11 was likely an inside job but rt has done it and that does not make it any less true the idea that russia is some fascist dictatorship it not looking to destroy america it not is cold war bullshit that was false even back then when russia was actually a communist country let alone now a vast amount of the cold war was manufactured hostility from the military industrial complex and their compliant media to justify the increased defense budgets of both countries and use the war as an excuse to crack down on personal freedoms overall it was far more likely for a kgb and cia agent to have a beer in a bar together and compare stories then it was to have a james bond style shootout ,1,conspiracy
StrizzMatik, his wall was received rapturously by republicans primarily to stem illegal immigration which is a totally different topic from infrastructure rebuilding he specifically asked congress for over a trillion dollars earmarked for infrastructure separate from the wall something that even the democrats would likely vote for because fighting him on one of their own key platform points would make them look even dumber than they already do is the bar so low that verbal pretense of hearing from the other side is significant considering that the entire gop basically said they wanted no involvement from the other side against his wishes which is pretty much the entire reason it failed miserably i would say yeah that not insignificant you seem to lack the nuance to understand that just because somebody is a republican or democrat it does not mean they automatically support all their party policies i provided you with more than a few instances of trump straight up breaking from the party lines and not going along with their agendas which is the whole point of this conversation and you just declare it to be irrelevant when it does not suit your shallow argument and blanket statements ,1,conspiracy

StrizzMatik,he has turned on trump almost completely since the syria strike and he has a long and storied history of not getting behind politicians in the first place jones is a hardcore libertarian classical liberal and people forget that he trashed clinton bush and obama equally and viciously and not for nothing but trump is barely even a republican in the first place he is solidly to the left of the core gop party principles historically a centrist democrat and probably the least ideological president we have had in decades if not ever his administration on the other hand is a totally different story ,-1,conspiracy

StrizzMatik,ok so you admit that you banned me for having a difference of opinion for partially disagreeing with something that you clearly have an emotional and vested interest in defending also known as bias and because you considered it disrespectful that i even inferred that your assumption that the jesuits are the only powers at the very top did not take into account the possibility that they have bosses that predate them which you wildly hyperbolize as me lying about you that says to me that you are exceedingly arrogant completely inflexible in your viewpoint and place entirely far too much stock in the weight of your own opinions to consider any others i am so sorry if your shallow defense of i have done this for years and how dare you question my opinion is not sufficient enough for me to not question your viewpoint so now you say it your opinion when you just said it was fact and that there was tons of evidence for it yet you base it on absolutely no supporting facts whatsoever you hypocritically state it as fact and have the nerve to make this unsubstantiated assertion and lie about me it was always my opinion and i never said it was fact this seems to be projection on your end i was only asking about the subject in the first place and said there was ample amounts of evidence that there might be something to it mind you i said there evidence not necessarily hard proof two different things i gave you a list of family names that are quite real that have familial and genealogical ties to ancient nobility that predate both the vatican and the jesuits families that themselves have tons of ties to the origins of the vatican and the jesuits and you claimed it was irrelevant and a distraction it is a fact that there are families older than the rothschilds rockefellers and european nobility that have been continuously intertwined with high religious power for centuries and i think that worth looking into truth of this matter is that i disagreed with you and that where the root of your animus is coming from quit playing professional victim your overblown persecution complex is not fooling me so where your proof for any of this you openly admit that these are peoples opinions and that it is even your opinion while just a few hours ago you stated it as fact the whole point of me posting about any of this was to invite discussion about it and see if there truth to any of it it is a matter of fact however that these family names have been linked to the vatican papacy and multiple popes throughout its entire history which if i am not mistaken constitutes evidence that they have more power than people know i did not make any of this shit up the black nobility zoroastrian vatican babylonia connections has been talked about amongst conspiracy minded people for centuries and i am only now jumping into the deep end with it craig oxley is only one of many who discuss this this gentleman here did a fine presentation on the subject https youtu be jvcxbiq33dg there is no such thing as a grey pope these families are not zoroastrain or ptolomaic either do you know where this talk even came from i do it was made up by craig oxley who got his information from vittorio vivaldi who ended up having a nervous breakdown and trying to damage people reputations and craig oxley today is a jew bashing sodomite this is why i asked about it i would like to see your sourcing and reasoning as to why or how it simply impossible that someone could be above the superior general or that families do not exist today that directly descended from the ancient mystery schools of babylon and egypt you make incredibly bold claims from an authoritative attitude but do not provide the evidence either i am freely admitting i am not 100 informed on this subject which is why it was posted for discussion saying it does not exist is not enough and using your heavily opinionated reasoning and personal anecdotes to prove it is not sufficient either i will have to look into vittorio vivaldi myself jew bashing sodomite hmmm yikes what is wrong with him liking men or anal and what does that have to do with him or his work considering the fact that you referred to him as a sodomite and yourself run a white nationalist subreddit preaching segregation of races forgive me if i think there something to me thinking that you are a prejudiced bigot as for being a jew basher i cannot substantiate that but you yourself have told me that khazarian jews do not exist which immediately makes me doubt your opinion on a lot of things so now that you have attacked me and lied about me and even called me a racist i will be reporting you the former moderator at romerules is of hispanic descent and is aligned with me on matters of racial separation unto nationhood for your information it gets worse i think you are a close minded insufferable crybaby with a persecution complex an arrogant zealot and a thin skinned bigoted religious extremist with his head so far up his rear quarters he thinks daylight is a myth you banned me before i could even reply or defend myself simply for stating my opinion and daring to disagree with you which makes you a coward unable to deal with criticism and judging by your ban anybody who questions you mentality and apparent groveling to authority a big fan of censorship too and i could

StrizzMatik,yeah no if you looked at my actual post history you would see i am anything but a democrat or progressive and have been a pretty staunch supporter of trump and his agenda i am just an independent thinker that does not buy into obvious propaganda or political rhetoric on either side and calling out trump many hypocritical actions and massive policy flip flops these past few weeks despite remaining supportive when he does good just means that i am logically consistent try it sometime ,1,The_Donald

StrizzMatik, so to make this clear you believe that people should have a right to privacy except for people who run a public business like a restaurant restaurant owners are not entitled to a right to privacy obviously privacy is an inherent right until you put that info into the public arena which is your own fault and responsibility not sure what your argument is here which is why you were able to see them calling for an actual investigation entails digging through things in his life that he did not make available to the general public wrong it calling for an investigation into material that he posted in public that qualifies as probable cause to committing potential crimes which would certainly qualify as such with many people in law enforcement again maybe he should have put his page on private did somebody make him post that content you are talking about a man who posted a picture of a toddler with the hashtag hotard another with a stack of foreign currency and date rape drugs as well as another picture where a young child was taped to a ping pong table with hands splayed go ahead tell me that funny or normal and i will tell you you are a fucking weirdo and probably a pedophile too if there was any evidence that he committed a crime he like anyone else would be under investigation but you have literally zero evidence that he has committed a crime there are mountains of circumstantial evidence that would make anybody think something is certainly off about the entire thing and your assumption that he would be under investigation like anybody else while conveniently ignoring the fact that he insanely rich and connected with incredibly powerful friends like it has no bearing on the subject is childish naivety at best and ignorance of history proving that exactly the opposite happens there 2 different justice systems in this country the justice system for the proles like us and the justice system for people like the dupont heir who was found guilty of raping his three year old daughter and got away with a slap on the wrist guess which one applies to him and by the way i never directly called him a child rapist i said there is tons of circumstantial evidence based on his own words statements and posts that could easily qualify as probable cause that says he likely involved in pedophilia and that there should be an investigation to see if those accusations are in fact legitimate while we are on the subject of victims i am assuming you did not catch the ama with the individual claiming to be a victim of james alefantis that showed up here and did his ama which was then was summarily deleted with no reason why would that count as evidence for you probably not you apparently need these people jumping up and down wearing light fixtures and holding signs admitting to crimes before you think there anything fishy going on the truth is that james alefantis is probably not under investigation because he rich connected and protected by higher ups because that how it goes for people like him in america ,1,conspiracy

StrizzMatik,it been talked about and established to death at this point that james alefantis has tons of connections to known pedophiles hangs out with tons of people who identify as them or posts art statements and material that is pro pedophile none of that is disputed by anybody being intellectually honest and in and of itself would make a normal person in command of those facts suspicious and likely to inquire into an investigation just because i do not have a video tape with john podesta fucking a child holding a sign saying i fuck kids does not mean that evidence does not exist or that the circumstantial evidence does not warrant a look into it if you are reading podesta emails seeing all the odd uses of food terminology in completely non contextual instances or his obvious use of code and not considering that as highly strange or worth an inquiry there not much more i can tell you and how many times have i linked you to verified conspiracies like the franklin scandals the marc dutroux affair the vatican or ongoing investigations in the uk or australia that conclusively prove that a high level pedophile ring exists all around the world you can conveniently ignore that all you like and act like there no connection but then i would say you are looking at nothing but the surface and not delving any deeper into the obvious implications you are taking one very small part of the equation pizzagate and claiming that the tons of circumstantial evidence surrounding it is irrelevant which it is not and then using it as a way to slander the entire topic of pedogate as being false you clearly have an impassioned defense for these people and incredibly thick denial that it even possible so why are you even arguing with me even if i handed you supposedly ironclad proof you would find a way to dispute it or pretend it irrelevant to protect your worldview so i honestly do not care whether you believe it or not it affects my life exactly 0 ,1,conspiracy

StrizzMatik,i am sure that just like pretty much everybody else in this country he is being surveilled and possibly with a bit more interest than the average person for sure granted he likely does not really have that much of an audience in comparison to people like alex jones at least enough of one to be considered a threat to the agency itself and aside from some of his insider information on what is going on in trump administration via the ic he not really telling anybody anything that they did not already suspect or know he has run for president on the reform party ticket in the past almost definitely has some friends in the intelligence services that have his back and especially lately with how many interviews and speeches he been giving his high visibility makes him a harder target to just rub out if they chose to without alerting people to it so far i have not seen him reveal anything that would likely violate an nda ,1,conspiracy
StrizzMatik,i meant to reply back to your original post but there just so much there that predicated on one very dubious notion the nist report was accurate and true no way in hell they themselves eventually had to admit that world trade center 7 came down at freefall speed but essentially had no way of explaining how that was possible without explosives in any way that made physical sense or did not outright violate the laws of physics or conservation of momentum i should reiterate and specify my original point no steel frame building has ever collapsed due to fire and only fire in history before or after 9 11 let alone three different times in the same day the mathematical odds of that even happening are pretty much millions to one and no buildings do not collapse straight down into their own footprint after being hit by an airplane laterally common sense would dictate that the collapse would have happened at the weakend point of the superstructure and tipped over in the direction of the impact you must also remember that according to the building engineer himself these buildings were built to withstand multiple boeing 707 impacts and still remain standing the building was built in such a way that it would be virtually impossible to collapse or even suffer any structural damage from an impact a decent analogy would be to poke a pencil into a screen door is the entire screen going to lose its structural integrity and collapse the way the steel was layered into the foundation and superstructure should have prevented this completely the steel and the columns themselves were rigorously fireproofed but somehow the top 1 5 of the buildings essentially collapsed through the remaining superstructure into the ground at or near freefall speed how does that make any sense without explosives being used to destroy the load bearing points on the superstructure itself removing the path of resistance how does a gravitational collapse pulverize steel and concrete into fine dust and pyroclastics how were multiple ton galvanized steel i beams shot outward and embedded into adjacent buildings how was debris being launched upward and outward from the collapse points when this would violate the laws of gravity why would dozens of first responders and witnesses report explosions before and after the planes hit and before the collapses why did the destruction of the towers exactly mirror that of a controlled demolition what about the fact that there were four peer reviewed studies done independently that conclusively proved that thermite was used i suggest you go on youtube and check out one of christopher bollyn speeches on his investigation of 9 11 i posted a link not that long ago on to the main page it probably the most thorough report i have seen when it comes to naming the names and explaining how and why ,6,conspiracy
StrizzMatik,the idea of once a spy always a spy might be convenient to paranoid thinking but that does not make it true if you have actually watched some of his stuff and theory on spycraft you would see that he probably the most outspoken critic of the cia and the us intelligence agencies largely because he seen how incompetent they really are first hand ,1,conspiracy
StrizzMatik,i have posted maybe five times total on td the vast majority of my reddit posting is done here or r kappa so no your sad attempt at de legitimizing my opinion is not going to work his own words he gets 4 hours of sleep on average and works until midnight or 1am on average good enough for me http nypost com 2017 02 08 trump is only sleeping 4 5 hours a night ,2,conspiracy
StrizzMatik,i am not talking sales i am talking perception despite some people experiences the pixel has a very good reputation as the fastest smoothest android phone ever and the closest android has ever gotten to an iphone like experience i do not think anybody would agree that samsung phones approach anywhere near the fluidity or speed of pixel nexus devices even the s8 with the sd835s will lag just because touchwiz is garbage and samsung now also has the reputation of making phones that blow up despite the s8 looking like an incredibly good phone i guarantee that many people who originally bought a samsung back in the day are no longer doing that now ,2,Android
StrizzMatik,not that you are not telling the truth but there no way whatsoever to substantiate that as accurate so it does not really mean much and your accusation that i am a td poster is pretty much part and parcel of shill logic but while we are at it i am also dating ariana grande on the side i just like to shitpost here for fun ,3,conspiracy
StrizzMatik,it about an hour and a half long but as far as i am concerned christopher bollyn is the ultimate red pill to understand who directly benefited from the 9 11 false flag and why the israelis and the mossad were ultimately behind it names are named money is traced and not one stone left unturned ,3,conspiracy
