thedominoeffect_,as far as mistakes go this is not a bad one in a surprisingly odd fashion there are so many things you did correct to set yourself and your wife up for financial security head over to r personalfinance if you need further reassurance but once you are able to remove yourself from the shock consider this nbsp what if you have two debt obligations high interest student loan the home mortgage and you and or your wife lost your jobs what then what if you have two debt obligations and an accident happens what if you and your wife gets sick what happens then nbsp it always wise to clear out your high interest debt first before taking on a new one there are too many uncertainties in life all tough to consider but being debt free and increasing your net worth is the best defensive maneuver that most of us have i understand that buying a house is a very emotional process but once the disappointment wanes you will be able to set a singular priority rather than feel the burden of taking on paying off your high interest loan and paying off your mortgage at the same time also do not forget to set up a rainy day fund for your self just in case shit happens good luck ,2,tifu

thedominoeffect_,have you done research around any programs you might take for web development there are bootcamps available and be wary there are reputable ones yes but some are definitely not worth your time and money nbsp also have you tried web development before have you dabbled in programming you will want to at least get a taste to see if you enjoy will enjoy it if you have not done so already sign up for free resources like codecademy com and coursera learn to program course comes to mind invest 4 6 hours of effort into it every week so 20 30 a month and see if you can see yourself doing it for the long term coding bootcamps such as general assembly or hack reactor are way more time intensive and dedication heavy so definitely consider that nbsp also in which part of the country do you live in based on location resources might be thin so you will need to be self taught and potential job prospects may vary it easy enough in the sf bay area where i currently live to see major career switches eg from sales to front end dev by attending a bootcamp for 3 4 months and braving the interview process for as long as it takes but in certain areas of the country prospects are as not as lofty i have friends who are not in the sf bay area or nyc and they struggled as freelancers for a long duration of time before finding permanent full time jobs as an developers nbsp ,1,personalfinance

thedominoeffect_,the pryda snare is a well known production technique that was first created by eric prydz and featured heavily in his track miami to atlanta the sound itself is basically a compressed and sustained snare sample it has a gritty and snappy feel to it and has become a popular item in the repertoire of many big house and trance producers it most often if not always deployed to mark the end of a 16 bar structure this article https splice com blog pryda snare explains the phenomenon in greater depth nbsp for this specific live performance we can assume that joel and eric are using mpc controller s and joel probably mapped various pryda snare samples of varying compression and sustain length to these controllers the end result is that joel or eric can tap a button on the controller or tap it multiple times and play the mapped sample repeatedly ,6,ericprydz
