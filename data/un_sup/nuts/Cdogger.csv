Cdogger,they are lunatics they actully think this is impeachable material comey literally testified that he unprompted informed president trump that he was not under investigation but nevermind that clearly asking your fbi director to be honest and loyal is nefarious ,1,The_Donald
Cdogger,page 3 and 4 i added that i was not reliable in the way politicians use that word but he could always count on me to tell him the truth a few moments later the president said i need loyalty i expect loyalty near the end of our dinner the president returned to the subject of my job saying he was very glad i wanted to stay adding that he had heard great things about me from jim mattis jeff sessions and many others he then said i need loyalty i replied you will always get honesty from me he paused and then said that what i want honest loyalty i paused and then said you will get that from me ,1,The_Donald
Cdogger,second page i felt compelled to document my first conversation with the president elect in a memo creating written records immediately after one on one conversations with mr trump was my practice from that point forward this had not been my practice in the past i spoke alone with president obama twice in person and never on the phone once in 2015 to discuss law enforcement policy issues and a second time briefly for him to say goodbye in late 2016 in neither of those circumstances did i memorialize the discussions ,2,The_Donald

Cdogger,the us is not the largest co2 emitter and not the highest per capita either china is at 10 6 billion tons annually us is 5 3 billion tons i think the big problem a lot of people have with the paris agreement is that if you assume anthropogenic climate change is real and we need to keep global co2 output below 40 billion tons per year developed nations cannot do it alone china accounts for 68 of the co2 output increase since 2000 so unless china gets their growth under control it wo not matter what the rest of the world does the us actually cut co2 emissions by 12 7 billion tons but chinas growth outpaced that 10 times in that time period 2000 2014 ,4,The_Donald
Cdogger,even frankenstein does not want to go near that mess ,29,The_Donald
Cdogger,how would forcing china to slow down it emissions utterly stifle it economic growth again virtually all developed nations co2 emissions are flat or trending down the us for example is down 0 7 billion tons from 2000 12 decrease in this same period china increased emissions by 7 billion tons 10 times as much if developed nations are expected to make massive 20 30 cuts over the next 15 years there absolutely will be a negative economic impact most western nations are already cutting emissions just not fast enough to offset chinas uncontrolled growth it not at all unreasonable to expect china to make some sacrifices too ,1,The_Donald
Cdogger,according to the paris agreement the target to keep us at 1 5 degrees c is 40 billion tons of co2 annually globally we are at 35 6 billion tons as of 2014 china is at 10 6 billion tons china accounts for 68 of global co2 increase since 2000 if co2 emissions are a problem then china is a big part of that problem it ridiculous to expect developed nations to hobble their economies so that china can continue growing theirs massively especially considering china already puts out far more than their per capita share of co2 ,1,The_Donald
Cdogger,https www c2es org docuploads chinas contributions paris climate agreement pdf china is allowed to increase output until 2030 i do not know that developed nations are meant to half their output but clearly if china india and the rest of the developed world increase output eu japan usa and russia will have to make deep cuts to keep annual emmisions below 40 billion tons ,2,The_Donald
Cdogger,because it not about climate it about wealth distribution first of all developed countries have basically expropriated the atmosphere of the world community but one must say clearly that we redistribute de facto the world s wealth by climate policy obviously the owners of coal and oil will not be enthusiastic about this one has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy this has almost nothing to do with environmental policy anymore with problems such as deforestation or the ozone hole this was ottmar edenhofer of the ipcc in a 2010 interview http www thegwpf com ipcc official climate policy is redistributing the worlds wealth obviously the big losers in this arrangement are wealthy nations if you are worried about co2 emissions know this almost all developed nations are flat or trending down since 2000 meanwhile china has accounted for 68 of the increase in that same period china currently accounts for over 25 global co2 emissions and rising the paris agreement does not require china to stop increasing emissions until 2030 ,2,The_Donald

Cdogger,that is interesting but for it to have any meaning you would have to compare temperatures over the same time period the best i can find is this one http imgur com a rin3r note the wild fluctuations but because it not on the same scale it hard to tell if there is a correlation with atmospheric carbon even if there was climate is more complicated than co2 and temperature ,1,The_Donald
Cdogger,i understand temperature has been trending up since 1880 i do not think that proves anything i actually claimed that between 2000 and 2014 the line is virtually flat and this is why annual emission in billions of tons 1990 2014 22 5 to 35 7 13 2 billion tons 59 increase 8 2 billion of those tons were from china by the way 1990 2000 22 5 to 25 6 3 1 billion tons 14 increase 2000 2014 25 6 to 35 7 10 1 billion tons 39 increase 6 8 billion was china yet the temperature data from this period is backwards almost all of the temperature increase occurs between 1990 2000 while 2000 2014 is nearly flat again i understand this is too small a sample size to prove anything but i thought it was interesting that a period with the highest volume of co2 increase shows almost flat temperature by the way i only split the dates that way because thats how it is split in the eu report i linked i used 1990 2014 because those are the co2 emission dates in the report ,2,The_Donald
Cdogger,again i do not feel i am cherry picking accurate temperature data only goes back as far as 1880 the earliest accurate co2 data i could find goes back to 1970 i would love to see accurate sets from 1750 industrial revolution but i doubt it would prove anything either the data we do have shows temperatures trending up with peaks valleys and flatlines that do not correspond to co2 output the only relationship is that temperature is trending up from 1880 and co2 output has been increasing since 1750 i am with you on the paris agreement the ability to have actual discussions with people i do not agree with is one of my favorite things about this sub cheers ,3,The_Donald
Cdogger,i did make one earlier this morning but it did not get too much attention fortunately it a slow ass day at work and i caught the stickied thread ,2,The_Donald
Cdogger,no doubt i actually misread the numbers too china actually accounts for 6 8 of the 10 1 billion increase since 2000 that 67 not half ,2,The_Donald
Cdogger,i presume you are talking about the co2 increase from 1990 2014 those dates are not cherry picked those are the years the report had data for if i was cherry picking i would have only showed from 1998 to 2014 which is even more damning the point of the post was not to disprove anthropogenic climate change but i do think that acc is bullshit but lets look at it annual emission in billions of tons 1990 2014 22 5 to 35 7 13 2 billion tons a 59 increase 8 2 billion of those tons were from china by the way the noaa temperature data does not reflect this especially since the vast majority of this increase comes from 2000 2014 10 1 billion tons and that period shows almost flat temperature the point i was making is even is causation correlation it does not the data does not reflect this yes the data shows an upward trend in warming but there is no relationship between the temperature rise and the co2 output this is even more evident if you go farther back 1970 60 and 50 when co2 output was increasing and temperatures were dropping i agree that it too small a sample size to draw a meaningful conclusion but so is the data from 1880 2017 an upward trend from 1880 does not mean anything especially since we know earth temperature is not stable ,10,The_Donald

Cdogger,sure right wing news has bullshit too thats not what we are talking about we are talking about this russian narrative and the fact that there no evidence for any of it the fact that there have been a string of hit pieces coming from the left that cite anonymous sources many of which are demonstrably false then you use this media shit storm to justify why he must be a traitor and why we need an investigation but when it comes down to it most of this controversy is made up do i think the president is perfect no do i have criticisms yes too bad there isnt a political subreddit where one could have political discussions because here we are too busy pushing fake news and propaganda to the top trump had 2 scoops of icecream trump will be impeached turmoil in the trump whitehouse is this the end for trump this is not a politics subreddit this is not a leftwing politics subreddit this is not even an anti republican subreddit it just another anti trump subreddit ,-4,politics
Cdogger,sure it possible that an anonymous source could be true however when wapo and nyt over and over again put out fake stories citing anonymous sources then yes my default is not to believe just off the top of my head there were the claims that the healthcare bill treated rape as a pre condition fake news deputy ag rosenstein was going to resign anonymous sources false trump and mcmaster do not see eye to eye unverified however trump leaks israeli intelligence to the russians meanwhile everybody who was in the room including mcmaster says it did not happen israel has also said they have full confidence in the us and president trump and you call me the purposeful liar of course to you he the traitor in chief evidence who cares we have an agenda to push ,-5,politics
Cdogger,keep in mind trumps aproval rating among republicans is 84 and has been between 89 and 84 since his inaugeration http www gallup com poll 203198 presidential approval ratings donald trump aspx also still no actual evidence of any russia collusion or hacking just innuendo and anonymous sources your hysteria aside the nation is doing just fine remember when obama was elected and people were freaking out he gonna build fema camps and intern people or he a foreign muslim agent 1 you are the left wing equivalent ,-2,politics

Cdogger,that true but it been 6 months clapper has said and i believe testified that he saw no evidence of collusion and he was dni head until january 20th so in 3 months late october to january no evidence 40 second clip of him saying so https www youtube com watch v yczj5 5kjwa it possible there is such evidence but considering the amount of leaks going on i am extremely doubtful both yates and comey said they could not talk about it in a non classified setting but there have been many closed door hearings if there was concrete evidence somebody would have talked by now ,1,politics
Cdogger,we already know there are recordings because trump has been wiretapped no it means there may or may not be recordings of some comeys and trumps conversations my guess which is no better or worse than anybody else is that the embarrassing thing trump could have on comey is exactly what he said comey told trump that he was not under investigation i am not sure what kind of blackmail you think trump could have gleaned from comey through their conversations but i suppose it possible ,-4,politics
Cdogger,it means he almost certainly did tell trump he was not under investigation trump may or may not have recordings but i suspect comey doesnt want to have answer that question while under oath with such a possibility in the air ,-5,politics

Cdogger,i doubt the election was rigged macron snuck in because the previous front runner fillion was hit by a big corruption scandal after the first round in april macron had the whole establishment and almost all of the media behind him he also much more of an obama than a hillary so was able to woo voters with his slick message i sincerely hope he is able to deliver on some of what he promised namely lowering unemployment but i would not hold my breath ,0,The_Donald

Cdogger,the canadian health care system evolved out of a near universal healthcare system from a resource poor and not populous province the aca was modelled after the massachusetts system was it not if new york california or the whole pacific northwest can implement some kind of health care system that is affordable amd works would not necessarily have to be single payer or universal that will do much more for reforming healthcare in the us than trying to impose a federal system that half the country will oppose on principle and frankly if the syatem cannot work in some of the most populous and wealthy states its not going to work nationally ,1,politics
Cdogger,it this weird holdover that a lot of other western countries have basically the media is not allowed to talk about anything regarding the election such as the candidates polling preliminary results until the blackout ends canada used to have media blackouts during elections also because the majority of the population is in the east so the election would essentially be decided before voting finished in the west of course such laws are ridiculous considering the fact that people have access to the internet ,3,The_Donald
Cdogger,for sure it just makes me laugh when coastal liberals think the electoral system of the country should change in a way that would likely benefit them because their preferred candidate lost ,17,The_Donald
Cdogger,is funny,3,The_Donald
Cdogger,oh ok in my few minutes of research i saw that california had passed it 3 times and it had been vetoed twice so i am assuming that was the governator but now it passed and the only was it can be reversed is by the state legislature i am surprised states can do this it seems like it could fairly easily be gamed though i suppose it unlikely a state would lean d and vote in an r majority legislature and governor or vice versa ,5,The_Donald
Cdogger,well that news to me however it sounds like since that would be through state legislatures it can just as easily be reversed and also could be vetoed by a governor ,7,The_Donald
Cdogger,it just laughable when leftists talk about this that would require a constitutional ammendment which has to be ratified by 3 4 of the state legislatures the only states that would benefit are new york texas florida and california good luck convincing the other 46 states to agree to give up political power of course how this country works does not matter to leftists but it not fair the popular vote is the right thing hillary should have won reeeeeeeeee ,24,The_Donald

Cdogger,you have not fought pirates or a war in 40 years you should been able to salvage something if you have cruiser tech before lvl 2 weapons you are either the most unlucky person alive or you chose to focus on the wrong areas ,1,Stellaris
Cdogger,i have this horrible memory of the french wiping out a massive stack of knights and catapaults on a mountain tile in civ2 so i think my initial fuzzy memories of civ2 were wrong but you are exactly right about how it works in alpha centauri you always wanted to get a drop on the worms ,2,Stellaris
Cdogger,nah they just inevitably adopt the master format ,2,Stellaris
Cdogger,how the hell are you wiping out fe within 80 years you are right about the ai not colonizing nearly as aggressively as they could and simply stgnating as a result ,1,Stellaris
Cdogger,how does that not solve the problem im fairly positive that in hoi if you brought 2 fleets into a battle the senior admiral took command and all stacking penalties would apply im not against large fleets or stacking units but sticking all of your ships into one giant fleet should not always be the best strategy as it is the only reason to have a small fleet is to bait the ai into a system where your main superfleet can intercept them ,3,Stellaris
Cdogger,it should definitely be a wargoal demand just like open borders,1,Stellaris
Cdogger,exactly i mentioned somewhere else in this thread its annoying that even civ2 and alpha centauri had better solutions to the problem im not even against giant unit stacks it just should not always be the best strategy there should be some drawback ,2,Stellaris
Cdogger,thats kinda true but even then having 1 massive fleet wasnt always great because of how fleets were deployed the edge units rarely engaged unless you were fighting a similiar sized fleet ,1,Stellaris
Cdogger,are you sure its been a long time sonce i played civ2 so youre probably right i know for sure in alpha centauri which used almost all the same mechanics as civ2 stacked units recieved collateral damage when one of their number was attacked and destroyed if they took enough damage the whole stack could be wiped either way thats still better than stupid one unit per tile or massive doomstacks of civ4 ,2,Stellaris
Cdogger,its a planetary policy that costs influence it gives 20 governing ethics atteaction for 10 years you supress the faction to hopefully prevent more pops from joining it and then use re education campaigns on planets where the pops exist to switch their ethics but yes supressing the factions makes faction members unhappy and im not sure if unhappy pops ever switch to government ethics ,1,Stellaris
Cdogger,the point is there should be a reason i dont stick all my ships into one giant fleet im fine with average fleet sizes increasing as the game progresses they should in reality there are reasons armies and navies dont have all their assets in one giant group and paradox games have mechanics that roughly model those considerations i cannot think of another 4x game where the best strategy is to have 1 massive fleet its just silly ,3,Stellaris
Cdogger,you have to combine reeducation campaigns with suppression to very slowly reduce their prominence happiness is also a large factor it seems like unhappy pops have a strong pull to opposing ethics ,1,Stellaris
Cdogger,in hoi2 your admirals could only effectively command so many ships you could assign them more but the higher you went the harsher the damage malus became other than the ai not being so good at it but lets be real one can easily bait the ai with a wimpy fleet then smash them with the real fleet the way the game is now i dont see why a similar system couldnt be used in stellaris i would love to see raiding or some other good reason to actually have more than one massive fleet ,5,Stellaris
Cdogger,but thats what it is you stick all of your ships in one giant fleet and smash it against your enemy who puts as many of his ships in one fleet as he can and usually whoever has more ships wins its dumb in every other paradox game there are mechanics to discourage doomstacking such as attrition lowering effectiveness of massed fleets combat width pillaging sieging and probably others i cant think of ,7,Stellaris
Cdogger,actually the earlier civ games had an even better solution units in a stack always recieved collateral damage if a unit in the stack was attacked and defeated they removed that from civ4 hence the doomstacks you never saw giant unit stacks like that in civ2 civ3 or alpha centauri ,10,Stellaris

Cdogger,that or command capacity or whatever its called in heart of iron for fleets if you go over the capacity the effectiveness of every ship goes down i dont know how well the ai would handle it though i would also like to see a system where not every ship lost in a battle is actually destroyed say 10 escape to emergency ftl and show up at your homeworld in a few weeks months that way a catastrophic battle loss isnt necessarily a total war loss ,4,Stellaris

Cdogger,the transcript i bolded the relevant bits q thanks a lot sean the alliance between russia and syria is a strong one it goes back decades president putin has supplied personnel he s supplied military equipment to the assad government what makes you think that at this point he s going to pull back in his support for president assad and for the syrian government right now mr spicer i think a couple things you look we did not use chemical weapons in world war ii you had someone as despicable as hitler who did not even sink to using chemical weapons so you have to if you are russia ask yourself is this a country that you and a regime that you want to align yourself with you have previously signed on to international agreements rightfully acknowledging that the use of chemical weapons should be out of bounds by every country to not stand up to not only assad but your own word should be troubling russia put their name on the line so it s not a question of how long that alliance has lasted but at what point do they recognize that they are now getting on the wrong side of history in a really bad way really quickly and again look at the countries that are standing with them iran syria north korea this is not a team you want to be on and i think that russia has to recognize that while they may have had an alliance with them that the lines that have been crossed are ones that no country should ever want to see another country cross it came back later in the press conference q sean thanks i just want to give you an opportunity to clarify something you said that seems to be gaining some traction right now hitler didn t even sink to the level of using chemical weapons what did you mean by that mr spicer i think when you come to sarin gas there was no he was not using the gas on his own people the same way that assad is doing i mean there was clearly i understand your point thank you q i am just getting mr spicer thank you i appreciate that there was not he brought them into the holocaust center i understand that but i m saying in the way that assad used them where he went into towns dropped them down to innocent into the middle of towns it was brought so the use of it i appreciate the clarification there that was not the intent ,1,The_Donald

Cdogger,admittedly i have not even heard of most of these however the philippine american war was just classic imperialism but i suppose in the end it worked out we just had to kill a few hundred thousand people i think it arguable that us intervention in world war one came so late it only emboldened the entente to force the outrageous treaty of versailles even then the entente powers wanted the us to intervene in the suez crisis i do not think any us military forces were involved in any case it was not just the us it was the whole world giving france and the uk a proverbial bitch slap and it was resolved diplomatically the us was also asked to intervene by the lebanese government in 1958 i think there is a big difference between responding to a legitimate governments request for military assistance and unilaterally intervening militarily in another nations affairs those are the only 4 i know enough about to really comment on when i said foreign interventions i was talking about the unilateral regime changes and invasions based on flimsy pretext like vietnam iraq spanish american war ,11,The_Donald

Cdogger,actually the fillibuster was never used to block judicial appointments until the democrats did against gwb in the 2000s when the republicans turned around and did the same to obama the democrats changed the rules so the fillibuster could no longer be used on judicual appointments to be fair the republicans talked about doing the same in the bush years but a senate agreement gang of 14 was reached so it didnt happen ,6,politics
Cdogger,ah the old its only ok when we do it liberal logic ,1,politics
Cdogger,romney was the embodiment of the duplicitous flip flopping politician that would say whatever he had to in order to get elected if it had been 2000 i think he may have been able to get elected but it just too easy for people too see and hear their lies now so politicians that do not actually stand for anything are going to have a hard time of it ,6,The_Donald

Cdogger,the aca is going to collapse in less than 4 years so something will have to be done trump does not want people suffering for lack of healthcare he said so during the primaries so yes now all the republicans screaming about obamacsre for the last 7 years look like fools because they didnt actually prepare or have a plan ,3,The_Donald
Cdogger,reality check for you the aca is going to collapse it is already well on the way its only functional in states that accepted the medicaid expansion which is completely unsustainable https www c span org video 426197 3 washington journal tom scully discusses medicaid expansion medicaid and medicare are already 1 2 trillion dollar programs if more states take the expansion it will add another 300 billion these are good programs that provide valuable services but they are horribly mismanaged financially as the president said politically it would be better for him to just let it collapse but that would hurt ordinary americans the worst so he wanted to repeal and replace the aca before that healthcare reform is still going to happen because the current system is unsustainable ,6,The_Donald

Cdogger,the whole speech was great and farage was not wrong either http imgur com a uxf7n we were told when we had a president we would see a giant global political figure the man that would be the political leader for 500 million people the man that would represent all of us on the world stage the man whose job was so important that of course you are paid more than president obama well i am afraid what we got was you ,9,The_Donald

Cdogger,that a good point i had not thought of how the hell did the fcc pass a regulation that would give their own agency authority over isps ,1,The_Donald
Cdogger,i am just reading about it now it looks like this would have transfered authority over isps to the fcc from the ftc first off it has not taken effect so by not passing the law we keep the status quo second as mentioned elsewhere this would result in the isps having much more strict rules than google facebook or any other online company so now there would be 2 sets of rules and the companies that already have huge influence would have an even bigger advantage ,1,The_Donald

Cdogger,deported ,3,The_Donald
Cdogger,the thing is no sane person would say human life does not have value no sane person thinks murder is ok and no sane person thinks it ok to toss a baby in the trash can so we can talk about the sanctity of human life but i think we would agree about it what it all comes down to is when does human life begin you say it begins at conception and i can understand and even respect that position but i do not think it an absolute truth i do not think there is a clear easy answer and it always going to be arbitrary i brought up the catholics and the prohibition on contraception to highlight the absurdity if taken to an extreme i assumed the prohibition had to do with the sanctity of life i guess i was wrong though i doubt there would be such a prohibition for going against the natural order if sex did not lead to babies would there be a prohibition on having mediocre sex ,1,The_Donald
Cdogger,everything you are saying makes sense but you are just arguing life begins at conception in a different way a catholic would take your sanctity of life argument a step further and apply it to sperm but even at that while a catholic would argue that birth control is immoral i dont think they would equate it with murder but to me sperm is no more sacred than toenails or poop i could even agree that abortions are immoral i usually say undesirable but i dont think a fetus at conception is the same as a human you are 100 correct though its a grey area and if you allow for abortions you are implicitly allowing for the potential killing of a human ,1,The_Donald

Cdogger,ah san francisco another democratic utopia http imgur com a 9k30r ,2,The_Donald
Cdogger,i would not agree that it human from the start as to your second point in an ideal world there would be no abortions but we do not live in that world unwanted pregnancy happens either through carelessness birth control failing or whatever i do not like abortions but i do not see how forcing somebody to have a baby they may be unable or unwilling to raise is better ,1,The_Donald
Cdogger,well obviously at some point a fetus becomes a human isnt that really the heart of the abortion debate ,2,The_Donald
Cdogger,why do not you check my post history dumbfuck i actually enjoy the discussion but you are as bad as a shitlib attacking me because i do not agree with your dogma i raise some valid points and you reply with wat were just apes then get ur toobs tied hurdurdur i get its a divisive topic but some people are just so entrenched in their views it a waste of time to have a discussion ,1,The_Donald
Cdogger,i can have a rational discussion about abortion with people i disagree with you are clearly not one of them ,0,The_Donald
Cdogger,yeah i could definitely get behind that ,2,The_Donald
Cdogger,that just silly though people like to fuck and we are not exactly rational when we are horny also sometimes bc fails abortions do not make me happy but i think its a better alternative than forcing somebody to have a kid they do not want as if we need more kids looking for foster care ,-1,The_Donald

Cdogger,there more elections coming up this movement has only just begun unfortunately i probably wo not be eligible for citizenship in time to vote for president trump in 2020 but that the price of doing it legally ,1,The_Donald
Cdogger,i am neither dutch nor familiar with dutch demographics so i do not know another pede said he was from the south so that could explain his popularity in the south or because the south is the border regions ,2,The_Donald
Cdogger,socialists are sp yes they might not be much help if what i am reading is true the governing party will have to put together a coalition with 75 seats please correct me if i am wrong my understanding is vvd cda and pvad are already in a coalition so they will very likely cooperate that gives 61 seats sp with 14 seats could get in on that for an even 75 d66 could join with 19 seats putting them over 75 they are left leaning but i believe they are pension focused gl also left leaning maybe a little too hard left though they also have 14 seats so that would get the coalition the required 75 there are also a few minor parties with 2 or 3 seats though i am not familiar with them i am sure some are liberal and willing to play ball though fvd 2 seats is right wing if 75 is the number they need and the current numbers hold it looks like the left will have many options for forming a government but at least the opposition will be stronger than before ,1,The_Donald
Cdogger,true that he actually did better than i expected but worse than i had hoped it not all bad it looks like the established liberal parties got shaken up so perhaps it the winds of change a comin ,7,The_Donald
Cdogger,fuck yes thanks pede perfect salve for the post dutch election blues,8,The_Donald
Cdogger,i believe they are one of the many leftist parties according to another user who did a great analysis in the election megathread vvd current pm pvda left wing party pvv these are the guys we want to win sp socialists cda christian democrats think merkel d66 center left to left gl upstart leftist party basically it was a big shift between the leftist parties 16 parties will hold seats with the establishment losing the biggest and the right wing made small gains ,10,The_Donald
Cdogger,wilders did not do as well as some of us hoped but the movement is alive ,12,The_Donald
Cdogger,some dutch election news for y all geert wilders did not win but he looks to be in second place https lfverkiezingen appspot com nos widget main html his party is pvv we will just have to meme our way to better things http imgur com a txknd ,30,The_Donald
Cdogger,good night europede maybe it not the result we wanted but it could have been worse next time we will need a bigger vote http imgur com a txknd ,3,The_Donald
Cdogger,i was hoping they would take more than 19 seats but it could be worse it also looks like the governing vdd lost a good amount of seats so you are right at least it a shift in the right direction ,2,The_Donald
Cdogger,damn well i gotta step out for a bit but i will be back do not stop posting do not let your memes be dreams ,1,The_Donald
Cdogger,i am only looking at the online counts but have not the other leftist parties that already work with vvd grabbed enough of the vote percentage that their coalition could stand however i may be too drunk too count right but the numbers seem off between vvd and pvda 40 seats have been lost i am only seeing about 25 gained between pvv cda d66 and gl ,3,The_Donald
Cdogger,cda already works with vvd though right i mention because they seem to have picked up as many seats that the ruling vvd losts unfortunately it looks like enough leftist parties will pick up seats that they can probably build a coalition though pvda was decimated so the math may work out that some concessions have to made to the right wing to form a government it not over yet ,3,The_Donald
Cdogger,you think they will drop ,3,The_Donald
Cdogger,still in second place it not ideal but could be worse,8,The_Donald
Cdogger,and some spice http imgur com a txknd for your trouble,4,The_Donald
Cdogger,unfortunately in elections we do not always get what we want unlike the leftists we wo not throw a temper tantrum we will prepare for the future ,3,The_Donald
Cdogger,doubtful at this point 222 of 388 municipalities have reported so i would not expect to see the percentages jump too much they have been stable for the last 2 hours it looks like the right wing parties will have gained a bit of ground but the government will almost certainly be a left wing coalition built around the current pm mark rutte but this election is only 1 of many http imgur com a txknd ,3,The_Donald
Cdogger, u dontfallforcl might know more but according to another user vvd current pm pvda left wing party pvv these are the guys we want to win sp socialists cda christian democrats think merkel d66 center left to left gl upstart leftist party,10,The_Donald

Cdogger, best live update site i am aware of https lfverkiezingen appspot com nos widget main html interactive map and all that not that i know anything about dutch demographics or regions ,5,The_Donald
Cdogger,i do not think so 198 of 388 municipalities reporting maybe that means 78 6 counted of those municipalities or that is the turnout so far i do not know that percentage keeps changing ,7,The_Donald
Cdogger,not at all and check it out pvv in 2nd place https lfverkiezingen appspot com nos widget main html now ,7,The_Donald

Cdogger,it weird i think it their percentage of the portion of the vote that was counted in 2012 it would be better if they just displayed the final percentage of the vote the party received last year vs percentage of the vote they have currently,4,The_Donald
Cdogger,moar results in pvv intensifies do not let up this this wave has not crested yet http imgur com a txknd ,9,The_Donald
Cdogger,it happening ,9,The_Donald
Cdogger,that whats awesome about this place spicy memes and great discussion ,2,The_Donald
Cdogger,no thank you i am super interested in politics and elections so i am glad you posted it made things much easier to follow,3,The_Donald
Cdogger,it would appear so it a bit disappointing but still early so do not toss your tendies yet it could be worse and while the results might be worse than we had hoped for there are still 2 big elections coming up in europe do not let your memes be dreams http imgur com a txknd ,3,The_Donald
Cdogger,pvv is pretty far right and there is 1 more for sure but i forget it abbreviation just like canada eh leftist party even worse leftists party and the leftist french party vs the conservatives too bad harper was such a fuck ,3,The_Donald
Cdogger,ok going to do my best to make this easy for everyone based on current numbers here is what it looks like major party only for the outcome and how that changes from the last election vvd 31 10 current pm pvda 9 29 left wing party pvv 19 4 these are the guys we want to win sp 14 1 socialists cda 19 6 christian democrats think merkel d66 19 4 center left to left gl 16 12 upstart leftist party for a ruling government heres my prediction vvd 31 cda 19 d66 19 and gl 16 gl or d66 could easily be replaced by the pvv to create a more center right right government but all reports say that no major party wants to work with wilders so we are probably going to see the current pm stay on and rebuild a coalition government that includes a leftist and center left group these numbers could change pretty easily and if they do i will be back to update also please note by left and center left i am using how they are labeled in europe not in the us they are pretty far left by us standards all thanks to u blu3yeti this is 100 a copypasta of her earlier comment ,8,The_Donald
Cdogger,but only if they had become us citizens right ah well i was just curious if they had voted i recently moved to the us and while i could have voted in the canadian election i was too lazy had no desire to vote for any of the options ,1,The_Donald
Cdogger,it ai not over yet but so far pvv wilders party is slightly outperforming their 2012 results so not great but it could be worse keep in mind only 30 of 388 municipalities have reported results spezzed i should say it is unlikely that he will win the majority of the votes at this point however i am not familiar with dutch demographics or regions so who knows maybe it is all super liberal areas reporting and the later numbers will show huge for pvv ,3,The_Donald
Cdogger,awesome glad to help does the netherlands allow overseas absentee votes ,2,The_Donald

Cdogger,the shills mist be reinvigorated by the massive stumping trump received last night kek,7,The_Donald
Cdogger,it just virtue signalling if wilders wins the most seats they will bend the knee it either that or they attempt to bypass him and form a coalition with more smaller parties i am not dutch but if you read about it you can see they are afraid of him winning the most seats should mr wilders come out the strongest then that will be a political crisis and this is a chance for a big democracy like the netherlands to make a point to stop this toppling over of the domino stones of the wrong sort of populism ,15,The_Donald

Cdogger,they also get that number by combining legal immigrants and illegal aliens immigrants do have a significantly lower crime rate probably something to do with the difficulty of the emigration process and all the screening illegal aliens not so much ,3,The_Donald
Cdogger,its true its also the only time im aware of that the number of illegal aliens were tracked in state prisons ,2,The_Donald
Cdogger,this is correct if you try to beat somebody over the head with something religion politics sports movies whatever it will never work you have to have a dialogue and make strong valid points then over time you may convince them rome was not build in a day plant them seeds ,2,The_Donald
Cdogger,this is actually federal prison so there are about 40 000 non citizen inmates in 1994 there were about 17 000 illegal aliens in california prisons or 13 5 of the inmate population it on page 15 https www gpo gov fdsys pkg gaoreports hehs 95 22 pdf gaoreports hehs 95 22 pdf ,8,The_Donald

Cdogger, on illegal immigrant crime here are some 1994 california statistics that demonstrate that illegal immigrants have a very high representation among the inmate population so we can conclude that they on average do commit more crime than non illegals california total population 31 500 000 illegal aliens 1 868 500 or 6 of population http www ppic org content pubs report r 996hjr pdf pg 85 california total prison population 125 605 illegal alien prison population 17 000 https www gpo gov fdsys pkg gaoreports hehs 95 22 pdf gaoreports hehs 95 22 pdf pg 15 illegal aliens 13 5 prison population it only gotten worse because while it is no longer tracked at the state level illegal alien prison population is tracked federally and makes up 22 of inmates https www bop gov about statistics statistics inmate citizenship jsp this idea that the majority of illegal immigrants are just peaceful people looking to work hard and provide for their families is demonstrably false this demonstrates that illegals have a higher crime rate than non illegals i am sure somebody more talented than i could put it more eloquently but the statistics do not lie 6 of the population made up 13 5 of the inmate population ,5,The_Donald
Cdogger,i hate when they reference reports but then do not actually provide a link to it ,1,The_Donald
Cdogger,too bad they do not track it at the state level anymore in 1994 there were 125 000 illegal alien inmates in california that 13 5 of the total prison population ,3,The_Donald

Cdogger,one could assume they are simply idiots that fail to realize that us student loan policy wo not affect them but a lot of these young socialists are globalists not necessarily in the sense that they want a non elected council controlling everything but they tend to have a favourable view of supranational institutions such as the un and eu and favour the expansion of their power so perhaps they want to show their approval for policies that if implemented in the us might be exported to other countries ,1,The_Donald
Cdogger,also from canada but live in the us its because canadian politics and politicians are boring us politics is way more interesting and what happens here affects the resr of the world including canada also if they focus on trudeau they have to admit he lied about election reform and he lied about legalized marijuana so the only thing he has going for him is hes not stephen harper they would rather bitch about trump and his hateful policies but i think deep down even the shitlibs like how effective he is ,1,The_Donald

Cdogger,hah it true my fiancee sent me a video a few weeks ago and this clown was arguing that trump calling out media lies was a bad thing never mind the dishonest media he a demagogue also the president communicating directly to the people is a bad thing the media is supposed to be the intermediary that where the word media comes from after all therefore do not listen to the president listen to the media spin it so crazy i did not think i would ever live to see people actually saying lies are truth and truth is lies but here we are the regressives just cannot handle their narrative being shook ,1,The_Donald
Cdogger,i mean i heard him say it i looked at the site and i am not finding the same numbers he was saying perhaps the more recent stats could be buried a bit but i was looking it seems like total number of crimes increased 4 in 2015 from 2014 but im not sure how much the population increased so that number may not even be relevant ,1,The_Donald

Cdogger,yeah it would likely split 4 4 so lower courts ruling stands so obviously they delay it until gorsuch is confirmed however they can only delay it so long i am not really sure about this so maybe they have to ram the confirmation through faster than would be ideal due to democrat delays but this looks kinda bad then the case goes to the sc goes 5 4 and libs riot and lose their minds so it still a win but it gives all this libtard trump is authoritarian bullshit more fuel it would have been better if the 9th circuit just ruled appropriately and let trump do what many other presidents including obama clinton and carter have done before ,1,The_Donald
Cdogger,i think the only 4d move here might being bringing attention to the activist nature of the 9th circuit but even then libs do not give a shit taking the extreme action of splitting it will still look bad and wo not change the ruling unless he wanted them to blow their load on something that long term does not matter either way this going to sc is not good for the president ,5,The_Donald

Cdogger,depending on where you live a rental property could be a great idea i am also in alberta grande prairie and i was recently able to buy a duplex for under 300 000 that crazy cheap for here so it probably worth looking into where ever you happen to live even if the average house is more expensive you can still find property on the cheap do you own a house if not you could pick up a place for only 5 down live there for a bit and rent out rooms or a suite the key is getting a place that you can rent out for enough to cover the mortgage taxes insurance and still have some left over if the rental income cannot cover all of that plus at least 500 a month i personally would not bother ,2,personalfinance

Cdogger,to get that 279 price for the hd 7950 you have to send a mail in rebate what a pain in the ass this hd 7970 http www newegg com product product aspx item n82e16814202008 is only 399 here http us ncix com products sku 68334 vpn hd7970 dc2t 3gd5 manufacture asus another from ncix it only 350 and free shipping back order though i am actually in the same boat right now i was going to settle for a gtx 660 ti but now i have convinced myself that i might as well spend 100 150 more and get a hd 7970 or a gtx 680 ,1,buildapc
Cdogger,maybe go for a hd 7970 3gb http www newegg com product product aspx item n82e16814202008 instead 100 more though i have read that nvidias sli is more stable than crossfire but i have no idea if that just fanboyism at work ,1,buildapc
Cdogger,it certainly not a bad mobo but the asrock z77 extreme3 http www newegg com product product aspx item n82e16813157330 is similar for 100 less even with the combo savings but does not have the built in wifi it does seem a bit expensive to me ,0,buildapc
Cdogger,yeah i was thinking i might be better off with the extreme3 or 4 the gtx 680 and hd 7970 look very comparable not sure if you noticed my edit but the 7970 is 100 cheaper i have never had a radeon card but maybe now is the time 120 gigs wo not hold all my games but neither will 250 i am thinking i will just stick with my 2 tb hd for my games and use the ssd for windows i have this big old copper heat sink http www newegg com product product aspx item n82e16835118003 tpk zalman 20cnps9500 20at 202 20ball 20cpu 20cooling 20fan 2fheatsink i am pretty sure i can reuse it i will just have to really clean the old thermal paste off the bottom but in reality i probably wo not oc anyway because i am incredibly lazy ,1,buildapc
Cdogger,you would for sure notice a difference it looks like an hd 7870 can be had for around 230 30 more than a 7850 on newegg between those 2 i would spend the extra 30 and go for the 7870 just make sure your motherboard has a pci express 3 0 slot ,1,buildapc

Cdogger,i was quite clear you seem to agree if the receiver is of low quality and does not correct this properly you get bad video audio if by bad you mean audio and video will cutout have artifacts it will clearly be not working my point was that a cheap cable won t give you inferior av if it does not work not enough insulation for length cheap ass broken chinese connector it will clearly not be working properly a cheap hdmi is not going to only give to 720p video if it does not work you will know it ,1,technology
Cdogger,are you retarded if all there was to a car was is it able to go from a to b there would be no difference in cars if you do not take top speed 0 60 handling ride hp style into consideration there is no fucking difference other than it works or does not work there more to a car than does it drive you are actually right though i re read your comment i thought you said when you get above the typical length you need an expensive cable you actually said better and you are not wrong though i still think comparing cars to hdmi cables is a shit analogy ,1,technology
Cdogger,if the signal loss is so great that it is not error corrected by the receiver it will be perceivable as the cable not working it not like an overlong cable is only going to give you 720p or degraded audio if the signal is being interrupted you will see and hear it ,-1,technology
Cdogger,oh i am not arguing that they could make you fight just the only way to get out of draft mms without going to jail is medical college uni or be a co it my understanding that only members of certain religions are granted co status depending on the country that right there is the problem being a member of a certain religion can you out of doing something that would be required of anyone else ,1,exjw
Cdogger, aretha franklin stress fart just prior to her high a in her recording of you are all i need to get by thank you for the link,1,technology
Cdogger,that a shit comparison there alot more to a car than going from a to b an hdmi cable does one thing it sends signals it will work or it will not work a really long cable might have to bulkier so if you have an overlong cable that is not insulated well enough there will be perceivable problems the cable will not work properly ,1,technology
Cdogger,unless they sell even cheaper chinese junk where you live you would have to be ramming that bitch pretty hard to break it ,3,technology
Cdogger,i got a 25 foot 30 cable off ebay it is quite hefty appears heavy duty it works totally fine absolutely no difference from when i use my laptop with its 4 2 foot cable maybe i got a good cable for cheap or maybe by pricier you meant 30 for an hdmi cable i am just saying you do not need to spend a fortune to run a 30 hdmi cable from your pc to your tv ,2,technology
Cdogger,the key there is the signal if the signal is being interrupted the cable wo not work i have never seen or heard of a partially working hdmi cable ,0,technology
Cdogger,i had the exact same argument with a bestbuy guy he tried telling me the cheap cable would not do 1080p then when i called him on it he tried telling me it would not do audio he was indeed full of shit i always wonder though did he believe the shit he was slinging or was he trained to be a cockfaced liar ,3,technology
Cdogger,to be a conscientious objector do not you have to be a member of a certain religion though i was under the impression that you cannot just say i conscientiously object and dodge the draft or mandatory military service i do not agree under any circumstances that religious affiliation should exempt a person from societal obligations ,1,exjw
Cdogger,i did not claim they were magical balloons they are hot air balloons my point was that pop3 is a stone age magical game that in fact has airships ok balloons but it has air transport it does not break the game i am unsure what non magical hot air balloons have to do with magical space travel pop3 is a great example of why air transport can work modifying the environment was a big part of that game and air travel did not render land bridges useless also pop3 was awesome ,1,CastleStory

Cdogger, q is it possible to make mines in the mountains and than build a castle inside of it or will that be a problem for the camera a germain this is a really difficult system we re talking about to be able to slice in the terrain and see what s inside is a really difficult system to build we ve been working on it for more than a year and it s not ready yet but it s so important to the finished game that we wouldn t release the finished game without the ability to see inside the island so yeah if you can see inside a cave i don t see the reason why you couldn t build your castle inside one from the q a,3,CastleStory

Cdogger,hah that nothing in alberta canada they privatized auto insurance so it would be cheaper see then inevitably insurance rates skyrocketed funny how that would happen when they have a captive market required by law to buy their product they have since introduced some regulations to make it a bit more reasonable but when my brother first moved here from another province so he already had a driving record and insurance they wanted 9k a year he had a few year old pontiac sunfire so it was worth maybe 5k ,6,WTF

Cdogger,well in the thread someone claimed i was too lazy to check the links that an hiv woman with proper care will only have less than a 1 chance of passing on hiv to the child in that case is certainly no worse than somebody with certain heritable genetic disorders having children and at 1 who cares ,17,childfree
