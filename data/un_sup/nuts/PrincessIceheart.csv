PrincessIceheart,that not how did works the dissociation happens involuntarily during the abuse to shield the brain from the trauma it is not something that occurs when the victim is thinking about the abuse later when you are using did as justification for your view you should have a more thorough understanding of it at not misrepresent the disorder i do not mean this in a rude or condescending way and i apologize if i am coming off that way ,4,changemyview
PrincessIceheart,your description of how did occurs is not accurate did occurs because the person is so traumatized by the abuse that they dissociate as a defense mechanism to protect themselves from the trauma it is not caused by hating themselves for being abused additionally many trans people have felt out of place in their bodies their entire life whether they suffer abuse or not abuse does not cause gender dysphoria there are cases of children under 6 years old knowing that they are supposed to be a girl rather than a boy the feeling of having a body that is alien to you is what causes the majority of the emotional trauma that transgender people experience transitioning eases that trauma ,6,changemyview

PrincessIceheart,i respect your view that you should defend your family to the death i also have a lot of respect for your statement in general i do believe that women should work for the things they want in life just like men i do not think we should have anything handed to us on a silver platter that what my mom believed so she hopped from guy to guy while all eight of us children ended up in foster home after foster home i truly believe everyone should work towards what they want in life including children appropriate to their age of course mommy wants a new purse work hard to get it junior wants a new video game do well in school and complete your chores in a timely manner i think everyone having things handed to us on a silver platter in the 90s and early 2000s has created the lazy disrespectful apathetic disrespectful offspring we all see in front of us however it is your family therefore it ultimately your choice ,2,The_Donald
PrincessIceheart,i agree with most of your post except the portion about compulsory service i was stationed in korea for 2 years and worked alongside the korean army south korea requires 18 months of service in the military police or civil service none of them want to be there so they do the bare minimum that is required of them to keep from going to jail i would much rather have people defending me that chose to be there than someone who only is there to check the box i 100 agree that discipline and respect are almost completely eroded across our country and it a shame i watched it happen as i transitioned from junior soldier to sergeant each new group of soldiers we got was lazier than the last to the point that 80 of my company could not pass a simple pt test 2 miles in under 15 mins for males and 18 min for females 50 push ups for males 20 for females and 50 sit ups for males and females i consistently exceeded the minimum and maximum for males my entire time in service until i was injured noncombat injury and i could not understand why they were failing it was pure apathy if a 4 10 female can exceed the male standards there no excuse for any healthy soldier who passed basic training to be failing it was not only pt either they failed rifle ranges medical lanes drill and ceremony and basic military customs ,2,The_Donald
PrincessIceheart,when drafted they would still go through testing and training for the job suitable for their specific physical and technical skills if they are more suited for administrative work that where they will be trained the front lines are reserved for those who pass the required training to be there the military is not like it used to be just sending everyone into trenches most of the jobs in the military now are behind the scenes technical jobs even in rear echelon jobs physical training disciple and combat training are required but in most units that training is on the backburner in order to complete their specific mission whether that be replacing id cards or transporting casualties the common opinion within the military is that women have their place as long as they are held to the same standards as men of course a few ladies make the rest of us look bad by flirting with seniors to get out of labor details but that is the minority and mostly happens in administrative units in combat units which i have served in women are equal to men as much as is physically possible i do understand your concern for your loved ones though and am not trying to change your opinion i am simply trying to add a female combat veteran perspective thank you very much for your support i truly appreciate it ,3,The_Donald
