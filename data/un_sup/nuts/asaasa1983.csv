asaasa1983,not really they are over reacting to the feminist movement look at pictures of how women dressed in iran before the islamic are volution and after and you will see that feminism sure was progressing there it a knee jerk reaction and it overdone hence the extreme before the name but it a reactionary movement nonetheless ,1,pussypassdenied
asaasa1983,because they are told they are disposable not told as in you disposabale ashat but told in the sense you are a man you should do the hard work you are a man you should take the lead when i do not want to you are a man you should protect women around you you are a man you should volunteer for military duty you are a man you should just know what to do etc years and years of that and yeah terrorists thinks they are disposable and that actually killing themselves to make a point is better than living a worthless life of irrelevancy because they cannot 1 find a girlfriend to marry 2 find a good job with a high salary 3 do all that and yet be told that he should contribute more to the family more time taking care of the kids more time doing chores more time repairing stuff etc all around it a shitty time for men from pretty much eveywhere and extremist islamism certainly has it roots in the feminist movement being unfair to males it a knee jerk overreaction but i am pretty sure those people find that the only way to prevent men from being repressed is by overrepressing women and making a point about it it sucks but someday hopefully feminist will get off their high horse and extremists also and everyone will live in an actually equal society until then let pretend feminists are still fighting for equal rights instead of supremacy ,1,pussypassdenied
asaasa1983,he does and then people has just as much a right to not go there anymore business is not about legal rights it about moral rights as long as you do not break any law by doing so you can be as right as you want if people find you are using asshole tactics to be right they will not want to go to your store no matter how right you are if people do not give you their money your business is done period unless of course you are a millionaire who just needs something to pass the time and then it leads to really weird businesses we have a few of those around here it really weird to go there ,17,quityourbullshit

asaasa1983,y e 1 x was that supposed to be a hard question to expand i never said it was the better answer but if someone asks you to do something and you do not do it as intended even if mathematically right it still wrong ok so why not something like this y z 18 z 2 x sqrt w 6 5 6 3 as long as z w 0 this is still a matematically good answer so should the teacher be ready to accept it while we are at it why not use definite integrals in your answer i mean as long as it simplifies to 0 2 x it right is not it ,2,softwaregore
asaasa1983,on the other hand honestly if your boss is fine with you being on reddit i think it safe to assume that a picture with a typo on it would not make them lose their shit if your boss is not ok with you being on reddit than anything on reddit is nsfw and therefore no labels necessary since you know you have no business clicking on it anyways not saying you are wrong but sometimes common logic is more important than tags i would never click on a reddit link written big tits slut gets creampied at work because i know it more than just a picture of a word but i would not hesitate to click on a link of a menu item that was named creampie labelling both as nsfw only confuses people as if it really bad stuff or relatively harmless one ,3,softwaregore
asaasa1983,mathematically identical does not mean it the good answer the same way some teacher will say if you have 6 12 you should had simplified it to 1 2 they are mathematically equivalent but if someone asked you a proper format you have to answer in the proper format if you want to be pedantic you can say an answer of y 3z 15z x would also be correct since you can simplify it to 0 2 but it obvious that if it asked to simplify it to the maximum than it not correct anymore if the question states to put it into fractions you have to do so period here it does not seem like it does so it a problem but maybe the indications beforehand was put all your answer in a fraction format just because two things are equal does not mean there is not a good reason to ask a specific format to the answer ,-1,softwaregore
asaasa1983,you know that this is in fact an incredibly bad advice if you need such artifice as filling your belly in order to restrain yourself you know that it will just end up with you eating chips chocolate pop candies whatever sugary processed food later on if you have the will to eat less you do not need such artifice if you do not have it good luck not eating those calories in even worst food later in the day or simply eating more at the next meal also for people with digestive problems this advice will make them suffer unnecessarily as it put more strain on your stomach for no reason a real lpt if you want to lose weight do it gradually eat smaller and smaller portions until your new normal meal is 25 50 smaller and keep it that way afterward sure it takes a bit more time and more self control to not just go back to your old meal size but it sure beats twisting your calorie perception and in case people will say well i do not buy junk food therefore i wo not eat more snacks yeah you are not kidding anyone you might not buy them at your weekly grocery run but you will go to the convenience store or a donut place or an ice cream vendor or whatever an even better lpt there is no easy way to lose weight if it was as simple as this lpt puts it no one would be overweight you need good food habits all around not just a imple trick to fool your mind ,1,LifeProTips
