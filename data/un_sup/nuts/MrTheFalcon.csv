MrTheFalcon,how can you get her to ease up you cannot she has kids and responsibilities she going to be thinking about you fit into her world there will always be a frame conflict your best bet is to set your limits and only move forward you are basically starting her at soft next text phone date home sex if you date and hit asd and question gauntlet with no advancement soft next if when she calls invite her over and just say no thanks to public dates i talk to single moms who ghost only to reappear sometime later asking if i am still interested i always escalate and they either go along or ghost again just know that even when you break her frame she compromising sex and expecting a provider the exception here is if you are alpha prime then she banging you right away with no expectations she will make the exception because of your high smv online that means you are top 1 of the 1 ,1,asktrp

MrTheFalcon,underrated comment excellent point ,1,asktrp
MrTheFalcon,i feel for you man she pretty much forcing you to move on if you stay you lose frame i think you are handling it perfectly take everything she said in text and change it to the affirmative that is exactly what is happening here example i would put myself in the position for it to just happen i have romantic feelings or attraction for my male friends whether or not you are uncomfortable with something i want to know because i did see a problem with it because i am not so in love with you that i know something is capable of just happening but if it really is a problem then of course i want to bother you and will hangout with people you do not want me to she may as well say that she definitely cheating on you at some point in the future being open but covert gives her plausible deniability so that when something does just happen her female solipsism can rationalize that not only is she still a good person but she also the victim ,2,asktrp
MrTheFalcon,you asked her out right great move on ignore anything from her that is not confirming a meetup call your fb and meet more women in the meantime single moms just have more risk and responsibility and they have been burned by pump and dump because nobody wants to take on their baggage i do not understand the hate in comments single moms are fine it not extra work they just take more time getting to a decision and have conditions that may not work for you sometimes it works out sometimes not let it be what it is ,1,asktrp

MrTheFalcon,the link to rational male should be the top response from the article men tend to approach love from an idealistic perspective and women base their emotional investments on opportunistic contexts we re conditioned from an early age to believe men and women share a mutual concept of love thanks to an ever present presumption of egalitarian equalism between males and females and this is where a lot of intersexual problems find their root you solved all her problems that the problem now she bored you can possibly save this with dread game find a new project that takes all your time do not answer most calls and texts do not respond to her eventual anger and do not apologize then also randomly take her on exciting dates and sweep her off her feet arguably you should be doing whatever the fuck you want anyway ,3,asktrp

MrTheFalcon, monk mode i am single 42 after a 15 year emotionally abusive marriage i have almost zero social time but i managed online dating got shitty dates and eventually a shitty relationship that i ruined i shifted focus to working out towards a goal accomplishments at work and building character i do not play video games or watch tv i eat well and get decent sleep i have also volunteered for charities with social opportunities and i make conversation i am open with anyone i meet i actively kill expectations of myself and others as they appear in my life i am much more content now and random women smile at me often i am still at the point where i wonder if i should have done something but always the next day i am happy that i let nature take it course i have a mission and work to do on myself some guys just roll into the next woman and other guys work through it in their head i do not think either is wrong as long as everyone is honest if you really want to go out there and fuck you need to ask yourself a lot of questions the guys who do it have an honest process for it if you are using a woman covertly to get over another woman it wrong you will get attached to the new woman and dump you old relationship baggage on her ,2,asktrp

MrTheFalcon, you are not afraid of your heart being broken you are afraid of your ego being shattered you are correct and that what has always happened i have always picked insecure women with abandonment issues thinking that they will never leave me not only that i have always been the one to break up out of frustration when my attempts to fix them have not worked i have a lot of work to do women will begin appearing in your life and you will find you do not really care this is what happened to me a few years after college when i finally ended a long distance ltr and made peace with myself i was content to be alone then i kept meeting women all the time and oddly women from the past started calling me then i met my now ex wife and she had my number i got christian cucked with marriage vows and beat into submission by dogma and marriage counselling ,3,asktrp

MrTheFalcon,ten context pb one itis though college had a couple of drunk hookups but mostly friend zoned myself or disqualified the woman post college went celibate christian and dated a lot of girls but nothing past making out married my ex wife and did not look at other women even in the sexless last couple years of marriage on the other side of marriage disqualified a dozen women in three months all online dating turning down sexual advances on at least two dates got hooked on one woman who was a hot mess she played hard to get with constant shit testing then slingshot into my life before i knew it she lost her job and was living with me six weeks later i cracked and told her to gtfo then i felt bad about it and took all the blame but let her go that about when i found trp a couple months ago and it pretty much shattered my entire worldview pretty much my who life has been selectively picking only the hottest women well 7 9 with the biggest problems then one itis and titling back and forth between savior and doormat with them feeling either rescued redeemed or shitty unworthy ,1,asktrp

MrTheFalcon,oh god what is the point then is everyone broken now ,4,TheRedPill
MrTheFalcon,amazing introspective and expressive i have only recently killed my inner white knight so i am asking as much as i am observing your attitude in the pickup phase is arrogant is that necessary for example if the girl is falling all over you do you need to game her that hard is it possible to pull back a little so that you are still leading that way you are in charge but not completely dominating her even if you are purposefully creating a more balanced dynamic does not that increase intimacy and is not intimacy rewarding i also think it a virtue that you have compassion for these women god knows i have learned the hard way that i cannot fix people except for myself but you can listen and if asked you can give honest advice i am thinking that instead of leaving feeling bad for this girl you can be a bit of light in her life even if it just for one night there got to be more to it than just getting off i mean if that all there is then for guys who have any compassion at all is it even worth the next day feels at that point why bother once you have proved you can do it bang an hb9 10 then peace out and porn ,2,TheRedPill

MrTheFalcon,if it matters to you you need to bring it up he may even think that everything is fine and actually be surprised that you have an issue with his behavior guys are dense like that sometimes ,2,relationship_advice
MrTheFalcon,he may be agreeing with you because it important to you but he a tiger agreeing to change his stripes he was also raised a certain way i know this is a tough situation but maybe you should compromise on a rule that is less specific for example agree not to get into intimate situations with a person of the opposite sex no calls needed to clear specific situations just trust from that point neither rule will be effective if he decides to cheat and his cheating is not anything you can control unless your goal is to push him closer to cheating ,2,relationship_advice
MrTheFalcon,if i am reading this right your guy said he is going with this woman because nobody else wanted to go with her yet his excuse for why this was okay is because there will be co workers at the restaurant so then how is she alone the fact is your guy was in some precarious situations when you were dating and marriage wo not change that pressing rules will only push him further down the path to cheating your best bet at this point is to trust him you certainly cannot control someone with rules ,1,relationship_advice
MrTheFalcon,again great points thanks for the direction this time i do know what she likes about me she told me she likes how accepting i am of her situation dogs everything how well i have treated her and she likes how intelligent i am and how i am able to see things from so many perspectives i pretty much blew it on the accepting thing i really am accepting but i felt trapped when she lost her job by not showing up she really had nowhere to go so either i was generous or she sleeping in her car i did not really have a choice and i knew shacking up was a bad idea especially so early i would dog sit for her any time we always had the dogs in bed i would want her to stay over all the time if she had her own place i would always buy the food and drinks you know but this way i could actually be generous from my heart instead of choosing between her staying with me or being on the street i just got in this head space where i thought she was using me until she got back on her feet she spent a lot of her days binge watching tv and doing nothing while having no job and impending payments she would be drunk by the time i got home and she can be contrary and belligerent when she drunk a friend pointed out that she was probably depressed she would promise me that this is not how she was and sure enough her fb had pictures of her having a lot of fun going out i believe she started to emerge from that depression but the sex started to trail off pretty quickly it was good when we had it i started feeling like her buddy who pays for everything in retrospect maybe that was her finally calming down and feeling safe but i started to get flashbacks of my ex where i would bail her out and she would take it for granted so here i am thinking that maybe this woman is good for her word and is not trying to take advantage of me she just felt safe with me and i pulled the rug out from under her i sent her a letter i am owning it and respecting her silence i will check in with her here and there to let her know that i am still thinking about her maybe i will get a second chance likely i wo not i have learned from this and will improve myself either way edit spelling ,1,relationship_advice
MrTheFalcon,really good points here well taken every one i guess there are a lot of reasons for her not to take me back in light of this i can think of two reasons for her to take me back i know what i did wrong and i am willing to improve myself a new guy will be a whole new mixed bag i have been with her through by her admission the lowest point of her life we have had many nights where she unfairly projected past relationships onto me i have been there with her through that i let her stay with me when she lost her job she done and said some pretty dark things and been there for her i have paid her bills and cleaned up after her dogs she does not owe me anything but it more than any guy has ever done for her i really like all the things about her that i listed i think they might be negatives for some people actually she had suggested that those things bothered other guys which is why i listed them as reasons she would want to stay with me ,1,relationship_advice
MrTheFalcon,i understand now thanks guys ,1,relationship_advice
MrTheFalcon,that why i called it the basics that baseline it gives context to the other points ,1,relationship_advice
MrTheFalcon, 1 what is going to stop us from breaking up again this goes for any future relationships i will trust her she is not my ex wife and i will stop looking for ulterior motives i will take ownership of my life and schedule whether she stays with me or not i will maintain my schedule it may mean less overall time but more quality time and respect i will limit our time together we would text back and forth all day and talk on my drive to and from work and most lunches we spent nearly every night and weekend together that felt good but i think it was killing us i will not expect from her anything that i haven t asked for and that she has agreed to i will hold her accountable for breaking any agreement we have instead of having a huff about it i will do my best to let things go and not read into off hand comments i will not seek validation instead i ll own my choices as i have done when i was single basically i will keep good boundaries and lighten up if she hurts me she hurts me but if i just stick to my mission and don t worry about it it will show confidence and she will respect me 2 why should she get back together with me the basics ie money i have a nice apartment and i am a good provider we go out a lot and i always pay i am willing to talk to her about any topic we re both pretty foul and share a dark sense of humor she less now drinks a lot and smokes and it doesn t bother me she comes with three small dogs who have pooped and peed in the apt on occasion i grew up with a lot of dogs so i m cool with that she s very loud and can be obnoxious i find it charming that she has no filter even if she says some mean things now and then i m extremely encouraging when she s down which was often at first but now less so she is also encouraging we have awesome sex no really note there is one comment about how i don t do well alone which she has said to me as well we re both co dependent i know this isn t helping i will do fine but i like to have a companion or a roommate just someone else around i don t need her but i want the chance to go in 1000 instead of the 50 i was before with full trust it s not that i have grown in a single day i had no time alone at all by my poor choice but the separation brought clarity i realize my issues and i m willing to work on myself i will do that if she stays or goes edit fuck markdown ,0,relationship_advice

MrTheFalcon,you are correct she used projective identification and presented very black and white terms i would have to steamroll her which i have done but it not in my nature to argue and very much in her nature to argue i just got beat down over time the truth is had i been a stronger person with a better sense of self i probably would not have married her in the first place looking back i can see red flags at the first date ,2,AskReddit

MrTheFalcon,from the camelot unchained website camelot unchained is not just about the battle between three realms it is a world filled with rich lore ancient yet written anew while dungeon raids are not part of your daily ritual you can fall deep into the depths a creation from the mind of studio co founder mark jacobs which draws inspiration from the mythos of h r giger and h p lovecraft it is a truly twisted place a dark abyss that lives and breathes evil if you dare to explore know this even after death a player soul can haunt and hunt other adventurers i believe this is a reference to the massive grind fest dungeon darkness falls the entrance would only appear at night and people would log out in the dungeon so that they would not have to wait for it to open i spent something like 50 hours in there once it ws fun because the deeper you go the more dangerous it gets sometimes an idiot would come running from the depths with a train of demons following him they would follow you all the way out then some other idiot would help out by swinging at one of the demons and suddenly it was a free for all with this huge mix of creatures at different levels also the realms were all connected to this dungeon so a clever or stealthy player could raid one of the other realms through this dungeon then there were the demon princes holy crap having a lot of people did not always win it for you you needed tight strategy and sometimes less players was better ,1,MMORPG

MrTheFalcon,i was a senior analyst not even a director so i may as well have been a cashier i went on to be software developer once i realized that most execs do not actually want root cause fixed problems are something to be managed and actually having problems or creating them means they still need your executive leadership to get though ironically an executive who keeps things running smoothly will be torpedoed by other execs or let go since he not needed in the best case scenario he will be given more to manage until he cannot keep things running smoothly and he now managing the problems the peter principle at work ,1,AskReddit
MrTheFalcon,the formulas that gamestop uses to determine buy back price are consistent employees need to judge condition but they cannot change the price bracket it is a crappy amount of money if you assume that gamestop immediately sells the game what really happens is that the game is processed buy enter in system stocked and sits at one store for a while if someone in another location wants that game the game gets sent there and maybe the game does not sell so it gets marked down and eventually goes in the bargain bin a lot of those games never sell gamestop needs to cover those losses with profit on other games ,2,AskReddit

MrTheFalcon,i do not know all the details but gamestop was courting valve for the steam platform early in the platform launch valve wanted 150 million and gamestop laughed at the offer they were thinking single digit millions later gamestop bought impulse for 15 million i think that was the number and they did this weird thing where they let impulse run itself but insisted that dev be located in the dallas corporate offices they tied it closely to the e commerce division which was another train wreck then gamestop would do things like host daily loss leaders the heavily discounted item that gets customers into a brick and mortar store where they see and buy other things so what happened is people including me would log in purchase the sweet digital download deal and not buy another thing ,5,AskReddit

MrTheFalcon,gamestop source worked at corporate spoke to many execs and worked closely with business processes gamestop depends on the buy sell trade model meaning that they make most of their money buying your games cheap and re selling them at a relatively large margin their retail margin is something like 1 5 i forget the exact number but it dismal video games do 90 of their sales in the first two weeks then it just a matter of letting the price down slowly over time as soon as consoles exclude dvd cartridge the buy sell trade model is done you might remember x box threatening to exclude dvd well gamestop convinced them not to i am was not at gamestop at the time but i know there is a perpetual love hate necessary evil relationship between gamestop and the consoles finally if you chart gamestop stock over time you will see that the stock follows console release cycles the stock spikes when new consoles are released then is drops steadily until the next console execs at gamestop will point to the spikes but if you analyze the stock over time you will see a steady downward trend the spikes are not as high and the lows are lower i spoke to a senior vp in the hallway once and said you need to embrace digital he told me i had a lot of nerve then he told me people line up for new releases just they always have and that was his indicator that brick and mortar is still the future i told him that the same 1 will always line up for new releases but the other 99 will download and unlock at midnight he blew me off after that i left gamestop soon after that because i saw that leadership was an old school boys club with a third party business model that filled a niche at one time but was slowly becoming irrelevant the leadership continues to focus on brick and mortar the lease stores they do not own many and digital and e com always come second and attempts are ham fisted they even had a chance to buy steam but they undervalued it they tried to get into the game later and did not finance the effort or implement properly i could write a book ,540,AskReddit

MrTheFalcon,peter also had a history of impulsiveness and poor choices he was uneducated and actually had a documented falling out with paul peter also took it upon himself to name paul as an apostle jesus never commanded that the apostles had a specific commission from jesus but paul was not included as an apostle and the apostles were never commanded to name other apostles paul extends a lot of what christ says but i do not view him as more of an authority than any other pastor priest albeit a great one if you take all of paul writing from the bible combined with james and basically anything that is not the gospel or acts as a historical record and put those in another book how is it any different from any collection of essays that extrapolate god word and interpret meaning ,1,Christianity
MrTheFalcon,sort answer yes you answered my questions thank you it was very enlightening i am now armed with more facts that will get me nowhere in what is basically an emotional discussion it confirmed the conclusion that i have already come to and why i do not qualify to be a member of my church i do not believe that the bible in this case protestant is the word of god i believe that it is a curated collection historical accounts with man made instructions on how to live out the christian life i think smart people have chosen books and letters that are in line with the teaching of jesus inspired writings but there is no evidence to suggest that god wrote through the hand of any of the new testament writers or worked through men to assemble this particular bible or any for that matter unfortunately my family and many christian friends will hear this explanation and shake their heads in disbelief because i am not grasping such an obvious truth that the bible is the word of god and then my very faith in christ will be questioned because if i do not believe the bible is itinerant how can i truly believe in the gospel i will self examine am i missing something but no i am not i guess i need to accept that my view is not a popular one among my group of christians fortunately i have some moderate atheist agnostic other christian friends who are willing to accept something less than dogmatic adherence to a specific set of cultural christian beliefs and of course i have my friends on reddit ,3,Christianity

MrTheFalcon,but this is paul writing a letter to timothy before the modern bible was assembled did they have any bible at that time how could paul be referring to all scripture as the specific collection of books and letters in the bible and if so what specific bible all scripture was he referring to greek orthodox catholic the future protestant the mormons do we interpret that as literally all scripture so then including the apocrypha the gospel of james etc ,1,Christianity
