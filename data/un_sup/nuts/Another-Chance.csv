Another-Chance,comey was already in the job so yeah not what was going on here at all ,0,conspiracy
Another-Chance,anything is possible but my take on it now is as it was before you only have so many police and tons of leads you need more police and money for them and investigations to follow up and watch everyone reported to them it is like the seth rich case 65 unsolved murders for detectives to work on from 2016 alone more than that from 2015 and that does not count current homicides they are working how many detectives do you think they have i will have the answer to that and more soon just got an email reply back from the dc police on that today letting me know they will have an answer for me soon ,0,conspiracy

Another-Chance,i understand what you are saying but here are the issues as i see them do not trust russia ever romney was right but so was obama try to build a bridge but do so with caution the conspiracy here is that people with power and ties to russia loans and such are in power now and using that power for personal gain regardless of the impact to the us removing sanctions returning embassies etc trump has been bailed out by the russians and others and that shows he is in a position to do favors for them russia has been a general enemy since the end of ww2 me i like russians overall used to play chess with them in the 80 no personal issues with them but i want you to consider this they have a state run media they want to exert power for their own benefit like we do across the world and their desires conflict with ours in many places you cannot trust them anymore than say you can trust what people call the deep state here except the deep state is more us centric on the politics side we have seen people bash obama hillary for years over trying to make relations better but then those same people who firmly believed in a defensive posture today want to abandon that how did that happen one way is that propaganda from russia converted hard core conservatives which means either they abandoned their true principles or they were suckered into softening things again via a propaganda push by the kremlin the goal is to find out what is going on who the players are and hell this could all be a push from the global elite to want a one world government ran by two of the biggest super powers question here is why are not people on this sub wanting to look into what could be a huge conspiracy with all of this answer is they have abandoned what they claim to care about for one man and that is disturbing ,2,conspiracy

Another-Chance,how is this a conspiracy ,2,conspiracy
Another-Chance,as far as the police i played it from a different perspective i called a radio host which i am and began with the basics how many detectives are there to investigate homicides what is the ratio of cases to detectives spoke with three people and have contacted the press office for more details was directed also to their annual reports info in my thread the coroner office called me after i emailed them about who can get reports not easy except for family and how you can get cause of death just need a name and to call em when you look at some people out there they have no idea of how any of this works former leo so i have some exposure there are people i have seen cannot recall the thread here who are suing the coroner office over the report and other things relating to the body cam footage which i also covered real investigations take time and working through proper channels to get information my biggest issue as noted with seth rich case is that there is a huge case load 64 other unsolved homicides in 2016 and only so many people to work on them and i as noted some time ago again been some time so do not have my own link handy the department takes donations to make videos recreating crimes to help get more info people could be helping them with that but are not ,3,conspiracy
Another-Chance,i think he is just a showman who wants attention i started to look into this on my own and the guy has missed basic points in it all and the only place i have talked about it is here do not need a channel website for clicks money he is riding this cash cow and does not actually care if he solves it or gets anything real to report ,-4,conspiracy
Another-Chance,he sure seems to whine a lot he has not covered or understood the basics but he sure knows how to speculate and talk a lot hospitals wo not give you information if you want the coroner report you have to be a family member or a company that has a signed release from the family you can get cause of death by calling the coroner office the dc police have a lot of unsolved homicides and only a handful of detectives to work them they wo not release the body cam footage generally speaking on an open investigation right away and even for some time there are exceptions ,-3,conspiracy

Another-Chance,i think it is way overused and detracts from actual information it is like saying the boogeyman did something example i have been looking into the potash mining in eritrea from a company headquartered out of australia chase is involved in the funding the leader of the country is a dictator basically lowest press freedom in the world and he conscripts people into the army and uses them as labor hence perhaps the lower cost of mining when all done i can just claim the illumanti is involved because this resource is used in fertilizer for crops etc but then that does not really tell a tale at all who are the players companies people what do their contracts looks like trying to get copies etc and so on there are i think some practical as i call em conspiracies by people companies to get this operation going and funny money labor issues potential crimes that investors would want to know about as well as the aussie government and who in that is involved anyway real investigations are difficult take time and you do not need a daily video on the web to generate money clicks you do it because it is what you have a passion for rant off,0,conspiracy

Another-Chance,the chinese will buy it all up they have been hot on us real estate and homes for a long time ,3,conspiracy
Another-Chance,the problem here is that these people do not give a shit about seth and the investigation it is about smearing the dnc and nothing else so they will push anything and everything true or not to keep his name out there and the implication i would bet anything at all that if the killer s is caught and they are just some thug s that the right wo not give a shit at all there will be hundreds of posts here a day about he she was a secret dnc member they will find ties from 7th cousins to a democrat etc ,16,conspiracy

Another-Chance,it should not be but it is look at how no one wants to talk about republicans and trump around here net neutrality net privacy etc republicans are freaking scum but they get a pass why because bots and the donald are working hard here to prop up one old man we literally have one party in power right now and no one is talking about that and calling them out this is basic shit when it comes to conspiracies when the dems were in power in 2009 people talked a lot about it and how obama sold out single payer etc and they were right to call em all out on it why on earth are republicans getting a pass right now on here when they are literally tptb ,8,conspiracy
Another-Chance,they wo not because those people cannot help them push a political agenda there were also a ton of robberies in the area and the dc police have in store videos of many of them which shows a pattern of armed robberies around there but so many dismiss those or wo not look at them because they want to push a narrative this is not about seth this about using him ,-1,conspiracy
Another-Chance,he has done no such thing and here in a few weeks or days when this part of the story dies ala kimdotcom and others i will be proven right what i am not getting in all of this is why some folks who say they want the truth are not being critical of stuff and just accepting anything anyone says ,29,conspiracy
Another-Chance,you mean like with seth and all the idiots out there investigating on the internet and pushing lies real investigations take time and effort they are not based on 4chan larpers how is pizzagate working out btw those internet investigations clear up anything with any facts yeah no ,-3,conspiracy
Another-Chance, democrats are helplessly corrupt same with the rnc yeah well you wo not see much about the rnc here and for a reason those discussions are shut down i like real information not the shit i have been seeing that just smears someone dnc in this case how many threads have we seen here that turned out to be bullshit when it comes to seth a lot people talk about the msm pushing something and then turn around and suck up to the other part of the msm conservative side that is pushing a narrative hell that is a conspiracy in and of itself oh and side note i do not trust the msm a lot either but respect some major papers who have a verifiable history over someplace like 4chan etc when people are racing to post the latest on this case with no care about whether it is true or not and when those lies get upvoted you start to get suspicious of things ,7,conspiracy
Another-Chance,you mean republicans ,0,conspiracy
Another-Chance,yeah that is what i am trying to figure out watch this be the top post shortly with no answer to that ,13,conspiracy
Another-Chance,uh prosecutor for what ,10,conspiracy
Another-Chance,no he is not and that might just be a conspiracy in and of itself wants out of a contract wants to go out in a bang and get clicks to his website radio show i hear so often follow the money and in this case we have sponsors money and him maybe wanting to jump the ship at fox or put on a show to make himself look like a victim to get more people tuning in make no mistake hannity is all in for himself not saying others are not am sure they are hannity and others have existed solely to make money and they know their audience he is not interested in a real investigation he is interested in a narrative as is his audience there is a way to do this his way is not the right one ,6,conspiracy
Another-Chance,if you want this on the front page you should link to 4chan and make the title seth was killed by dnc proof by anon oh and something something about trump people around here do not seem to care about that guy in power now no more conspiracies exist it is like we live in happy my little pony land now ,-5,conspiracy
Another-Chance,and most killers robbers rapists here in the us are christian yet pointing that out here in the us usually does not go well ,8,conspiracy
Another-Chance,hope this post gets traction trump wants this to happen so watch out for downvotes here ,0,conspiracy
Another-Chance,see that shit right there most everyone hates the democratic party corruption this is not about truth it is about an agenda bernie people are pissed off and see you post in bernie and the donald and they want to push an idea and attack someone they hate that is not looking for truth that is looking to smear someone you do not like which makes you blind to people manipulating you i never voted for bill or hillary been an independent since 1984 voted for reagan both bushes but on w once regret that and obama when you are just looking at a situation like this through one lens it is easy to just rush to people who tell you what you want to hear just like we hear others here do with trump and the msm ,6,conspiracy
Another-Chance,if they are working for me i would want to see them and the president does work for us shit people wanted to see everything about obama but then one thing i have learned about conservatives is that they are full of shit and liars all that stuff they spewed for 8 years suddenly did not matter with trump funny how that works never ever trust a conservative they waffle all the time and do not really believe anything they say ,5,conspiracy
Another-Chance,if the op runs for president they probably would unless they had something to hide and if they ran as a dem your tune sure would change ,8,conspiracy
Another-Chance,and these threads usually end up being exposed as fake bs pushed here by the donald ,1,conspiracy
Another-Chance,fair enough ,1,conspiracy
Another-Chance,there were 64 other unsolved murders there in 2016 not to mention 2015 and this year is anyone posting about those ,1,conspiracy
Another-Chance,oh please george is rw shill and his interest in this case is about politics and giving the rubes what they want same as fox hannity kimdotcom deadbart etc he is selling this and people are buying without question ,4,conspiracy
Another-Chance,i like evidence not some person on 4chan just saying shit about a politician they do not like ,9,conspiracy
Another-Chance,ah but you are thinking they have be consciously in on it this is a conspiracy about the system and it failure now there may well be many in on that in various roles who did not plot together but still failed and looking into things like that is how you get a system to change that is a conspiracy of the system and its impact on us all ,0,conspiracy
Another-Chance,well i am sure he will make some money off of this always remember follow the money months from now let look back on this and see if it was real or bullshit pushed by him for clicks i know what my money is on ,7,conspiracy
Another-Chance,depends is 4chan evidence seems to be around here i could go there and make up shit about the case and be on the front page here and no conspiracies do not always require such things what we can see here is the failure of those in power all the while those same people are treating other cases in a different manner why was not this caught earlier who failed in their due diligence etc this about a broken system that allowed it all to happen in the first place for so long ,-1,conspiracy
Another-Chance,so you got nothing i figured as much ,9,conspiracy
Another-Chance,wtf this is the definition of a conspiracy she murdered kids and got away with a lot of those murders for a damned long time i see shit here all day long about seth one murder and yet here is something that has gotten away with many murders for years how why did not the people in power look into it all more this goes to the heart of problems in our justice system you do not want answers is that because you cannot use them for politics ,1,conspiracy
Another-Chance,the point is you have no real evidence here look i did not like bill voted against him twice and hillary as well in 2008 primary and in 2016 but what we have been seeing on this sub is an attempt to attack the clintons and the dnc while sucking up to tptb now it is a concerted effort by the alt right as evidenced by the front page here and bot votes that is a conspiracy in and of itself who benefits from this i do not give a damn about the dnc or bill but the timing of shit like this from a freaking 4chan link is pretty damned suspicious we have people in power now doing shit why is that looking into them right now is bad and gets downvoted ,-6,conspiracy
Another-Chance,not seeing any truth just seeing more of the donald leaking here and trying really hard to detract from trump issues hillary and bill are not in power right now we have people from the donald wanting to push narratives about them for some reason reason being is that they do not want us talking about trump ,-14,conspiracy
Another-Chance,oh look another clinton hit piece no shock there ,-17,conspiracy
Another-Chance,i never do lists to give people i just make some basic questions based on research and let them know i will be giving them time to talk and me to question them and learn their viewpoints ,3,conspiracy
Another-Chance,also do you have an idea of questions you want to ask will you challenge them on things examples how many other unsolved cases that year 64 how many detectives to work those cases and the ones from previous year and current year etc and so on real research is not meme and bs from 4chan and twitter accounts i spent a lot of time researching before i talked to harry do not be afraid to ask some hard questions ,1,conspiracy
Another-Chance,well be careful there you will certainly get people who use dubious information and have investigated from a single angle ie political angle which can be fine in some ways but overall it goes from looking for real answers to looking for something to support their ideals while ignoring everything else ,4,conspiracy
Another-Chance,i have interviews before me being the interviewer one of the ones i did was with harry fear on the israel palestine conflict what are you looking for in an interview watching your video now can you send one i did not sure all the others are online long story but it was a solid hour with no commercials our station is independent are you just looking for the common person take on things do you want video or just audio in the interview ,1,conspiracy
Another-Chance,and yet trump is president and does not have stamina and has to ride around in a golf cart while the other g7 leaders walked ,4,conspiracy

Another-Chance,neocons are back in power now but attacking trump and crew on here does not fly people finally trust their government and do not see any conspiracies at all with their new master ,-4,conspiracy
Another-Chance,maybe because congress doj fbi are investigating the russia stuff tell me are they investigating links to other countries ,3,conspiracy
Another-Chance,it just more larping bs it would probably fly over on the donald though those idiots believe everything unless it is negative about their lord trump ,2,conspiracy
Another-Chance,you want to march on dc because someone posts lies and the donald bots upvoted it ,1,conspiracy
Another-Chance,well if we do not have much info then why are there so many fucking posts about him claiming to be true probably because the donald called for this shit to be pushed and their bots upvote the threads ,1,conspiracy
Another-Chance,well they are posting pro trump and anti hillary dnc shit so it is all ok afterall the donald is welcome here but holy shit a post about trump gets to the front page here flaired you want evidence of a conspiracy in a conspiracy sub it is all right there on the front page ,50,conspiracy

Another-Chance, if it was a robbery why was nothing taken robbery gone wrong if you shoot someone you tend to run away quick duh why would assange go out of his way to mention seth rich in a tv interview attention whore and pushing a narrative and i thought he was dead according to people here why would wikileaks offer a reward for information of his murder why would not they it helps to push their narrative which has always been anti dnc hillary democrat why were the police going through his laptop he had with him any proof they did and that he had it on him and if he did why would not they they would be checking to see if he was meeting with someone like buying something from craiglist etc why would donna brazile personally warn off a pi looking into his murder source and what do you consider a warning why did the dnc hire a spokesperson to be the talking head for the rich family ask the family he is their spokesperson and hiring someone makes sense there are a lot of wackos out there making up shit let that person deal with it instead of the family why does the dc police insist it was a robbery gone wrong when there zero evidence to come to that conclusion there have been many robberies in the area and 64 other unsolved murders they are dealing with around there too look at their youtube page and see how many robberies they are dealing with it a shit ton ,4,conspiracy

Another-Chance,yeah they should have used 4chan ,7,conspiracy
Another-Chance,there is a difference in starting wars and being wary what happened to conservatives they were loving romney over his russia comments and telling the left and obama that they were naive over the russians and we should not trust them the left said we do not trust them but we should work to keep the peace and avoid ww3 but again cons said libs were stupid and we needed romney in power to counter the threat now all of the morals principles and values the right said they had they threw out for one old man lots of the right are conservative christians who whine about gays and how god will punish us because we let them sin all the while trump grabs pussy lies daily cheated on his wives is a lover of money etc christian conservative abandoned all their morals for this man ,9,conspiracy

Another-Chance,that ok they are allowed to and encouraged to brigade here just do not let people from all or politics do that then it is bad ,36,conspiracy
Another-Chance,kim is using a dead man for clicks and bs ing people on the right because he knows they are suckers hannity deadbart fox etc all know they can just make up shit and people on the right wo not even think once to question it that to me is pretty damned sad but it is also true look at trump and how conservatives act now everything they swore they believed for 8 years under obama and criticized him for they have suddenly abandoned for one old man you want to see mouth frothing slavishness look no further than the people who gave up all they swore they believed in for 8 years for one man and how they defend him now ,-1,conspiracy
Another-Chance,you do not either ,0,conspiracy
Another-Chance,do you want o know the truth of the other 64 people who died there and are unsolved cases that these detectives also have to focus on i do not think anyone here even knows their names or anything about them but then those people cannot be used for political reasons and their lives and deaths mean nothing oh and most of them were black guess black lives do not matter you want a real conspiracy look into when poor people die no one cares or why when a poor person is charged with something they get fucked over and the wealthy do not there are a million things to focus on and loads of people who have been murdered with no leads at all but this one guy gets focused on by the caring right because his death is a tool to them it all politics and when people tell me they care to find the truth i just laugh because they only care when it is suits their needs ,0,conspiracy

Another-Chance,ok and what do you think is the truth because that is important here if you want it to be one thing and it is not how will you react are you locked into a narrative because some folks are and no matter what happens they wo not change example if some random dudes are arrested for it and found guilty then the conspiracy narrative will shift and turn into they were fall guys etc ,1,conspiracy
Another-Chance,wow so much bs and lies in one post ,33,conspiracy
Another-Chance,do you give a shit about seth or not and why ,2,conspiracy
Another-Chance,maybe people are waking up to the bs being pushed by the right it is not wrong to want to find out who killed someone we all want that but the right is only caring about it because they want to push a narrative that it was the dnc they do not give two shits about seth and they never did he was a liberal someone they hate i posted two threads about it and was willing to work with people on things but they shunned it all mainly because i approached it from a realistic perspective and not one that uses 4chan etc to fan flames ,-2,conspiracy

Another-Chance,omg people visited the white house before seth was robbed and murdered there were 64 other unsolved murders that year as well we need to know every person that visited and who worked there and all their movements and we need to know if any of them have ever in their life said they like pizza nobody but child molesters say the word pizza ,2,conspiracy
Another-Chance,who cares leaking is good are not we supposed to be encouraging all the leaks we can and for them to be made public ,0,conspiracy
Another-Chance,it means they are sacrificing kids to satan on top of pizza dough before cooking them i heard someone in the white house likes pizza and we all know for a total fact what that means and i have evidence of it all too trump gave a gang sign while at the g7 and had tea there a sure sign the fbi says of child raping satanists damn this shit is easy ,-13,conspiracy
Another-Chance,put this right there by the fake fbi doc people wanted to believe shit i should make a twitter account and just make up things will get lots of clicks and followers sounds easy ,4,conspiracy
Another-Chance,i agree they should and they should do the same with flat earth crap too that is easily debunked ,1,conspiracy
Another-Chance,you go something new and real post it here then otherwise look at all the zillion of threads already here and comment on them but what we have now is people posting every single thing they can find on the internet without even stopping to think about it they have one goal in mind flood twitter fb here etc with seth name to push an agenda of branding the dnc etc as killers it is propaganda pure and simple you want a conspiracy look at who is profiting from all of this it is not the dnc it is hannity deadbart kimdotcom etc and so on people are making money off this man death and other folks are here pimping links out for them follow the money ,3,conspiracy
Another-Chance,i did and you got a lot of bot upvotes in that sub that sub has called for brigading places with seth stuff they are not interested in his death unless they can use it for political reasons anyone posting in the donald to me is suspect as that sub is nothing more than a place to worship one old man which you seem to be wanting to do you want to investigate seth death then do some real research i posted 2 threads here about it and real research and they were downvoted to oblivion because the people talking the most about it are just bullshitting https www reddit com r conspiracy comments 6dk459 well lets start over here see text and look at i will work with you to find answers but not for political reasons which is all the right cares about when it comes to him ,1,conspiracy
Another-Chance,and what were those topics about ,6,conspiracy
Another-Chance,there were 64 other murders in 2016 that are unsolved that the detectives have to deal with and there were many in 2015 and some this year robberies of people walking alone at night do go wrong apparently this one did nothing bad about wanting to solve a murder but when the only reason you want to solve it is that you believe it was the dnc and you only care about the politics then i think you are sick using the body of a dead man to push an agenda is just wrong but hey that is what conservatives do i guess ,3,conspiracy
Another-Chance,i love watching people from the right lap up this shit i should go on twitter and claim i have stuff just to get the clicks what ever happened to vetting information before posting it oh right the donald says to post it and his slaves follow ,-6,conspiracy
Another-Chance,https snoopsnoo com u gofyourself2x towards the bottom click on karma default is posts and you can pretty much see where most of yours comes from i did my research ,1,conspiracy
Another-Chance,hmmm so when i complain about a seth post i am a hill and here you are calling out a post about him and being critical of it welcome to conspiracy and being critical of something ,0,conspiracy
Another-Chance,yeah but if that topic is anti trump then it will be flaired as brigaded has this one been flaired ,7,conspiracy
Another-Chance,oh look another the donald poster brigading this sub with seth stuff keep dragging his body around for your political bs like your masters have told you to do so if you really want to find out who killed him do some real investigative work other than being a tool for that sub ,1,conspiracy
Another-Chance,what cover up of his murder the dude was one of 65 people killed in that area in 2016 the fake news part is that the alt right is trying to make this about something it is not why are you enabling them ,1,conspiracy
Another-Chance,funny most replies here are calling this what it is bullshit but this post has a slew up upvotes guess it is ok when the donald brigades here ,2,conspiracy
Another-Chance,there is no point in arguing about something as asinine as flat earth shit the earth is not flat do not pretend it please sick of this bs ,-1,conspiracy
Another-Chance,so conspiracy is now the msm basically narratives pushed by the right are taking over fox hannity rush deadbart etc now seem to own this sub ,2,conspiracy
Another-Chance,the donald has asked people to push anything and everything about seth guessing you knew that though and they are brigading here pretty hard they want to use this as t d 2 0 and they are succeeding ,3,conspiracy
Another-Chance,he is all about himself how hard is that to see ,2,conspiracy
Another-Chance,would be nice to have all these conservative outlets offering rewards for seth info to pony up some money to help get these tested doubt that will happen though ,-2,conspiracy
Another-Chance,i get it pretty well what i do not get is why it is pushed here now from one side as though it is political the whole pedophila thing is not about a party or right and left it is about people in power always getting away with shit and not just pedo shit but tons of other crimes drugs rigging things etc again my issue is with how this playing out here in this sub and how it detracts from real issues by making it about one party or one part of a party ,1,conspiracy
Another-Chance,i do not fully agree but do in some ways there are puppet masters and such hillary trump were the same in some ways but at the core there are people within the parties that are different in what they want the right stands for the dictators companies the left in general stands against such things even though some use the left to prop up that shit note not talking parties here trump got elected because many people were misled by him and the right and it was their turn ,1,conspiracy
Another-Chance,he lies nothing new there he gets clicks and attention from people he does not care about anyone other than himself ,1,conspiracy
Another-Chance,no fe is bs and does not belong here it is not a conspiracy it is a religion but this is a nice place to post links to youtube to get clicks and revenue ,1,conspiracy
Another-Chance,i am sorry but flat earth stuff is just bs i love all kinds of conspiracies from ufo to jfk to 9 11 and will entertain many things i do not agree with on the face of them but fe stuff is just bs and i wo not argue about it there really is no argument there is only a few who have a belief and that wo not cut it tell me honestly do you believe that the earth and only the earth is flat ,3,conspiracy
Another-Chance,i agree upvoted btw what we have seen here is the donald once again brigading this sub for political reasons i am all for looking into the death of seth and many others but that does not mean we should have only that being discussed here if those people really cared they would just make a sub about it and post there they do not care they just want to use his corpse for politics and this sub to push their agenda ,4,conspiracy
Another-Chance,i see many things and one of them i see is how the right has been continually pushing fake news like this story which is on the front page here the left and the right are different on many things but yes some in power are the same i love how this whole conversation goes the right is seen spreading bs and when called on it some will yell out but they are the same if they are the same why did so many vote for trump an idiot who has no idea what he is doing why do we see the left here in the us pushing more for protections for the working class and the poor while the right pushes for more power and less restrictions on corporations sure they both fuck up but the right and the left in this country are different and fight for different things which side are you on the side of big money and companies or the side of the people workers ,2,conspiracy
Another-Chance,if it is fake why is it one of the top posts in this sub right now who upvoted it and all the other seth stuff on the front page btw i see it as fake too but that still does not answer the above questions ,11,conspiracy
Another-Chance,give me some examples do you think i am one what is your definition of a shill ,2,conspiracy
Another-Chance,i buy into it on this story because that is what it is you really think some people here are interested in the truth on this story ,1,conspiracy
Another-Chance,and yet it is on the front page here 79 upvoted you cannot blame that on ctr but you can on the donald who has stated they want his name out there no matter what and yet people who are skeptical like me are considered shills and such maybe some of us have seen how the alt right is using this to get people to accept anything at all as long as it fits their narrative you want a conspiracy ask yourself why so many are out there pushing this story with no facts now ask yourself why one sub here the donald is telling people to get his name out there despite any facts and why others hannity kimdotcom etc are playing to the crowd answer clicks and money deflect from trump tell people what they want to hear make money from clicks seth body is income to the right now ,1,conspiracy
Another-Chance,hell i do not trust most of this it could be that seth did leak things could be true someone found out about it and killed him but that is all on seriously shaky ground and appears to be all just made up bs it is just sad how this is all being used by partisans here on this sub i want the truth on many things what i am seeing is not a search for truth but a brigade by people to make something true they want to be true hillary and the dnc suck ass imho and seeing them brought down and new dnc emerge is something i would like myself but i wo not buy into shit just because i do not like them if people are not looking for truth they are not worth bothering with i want a strong liberal party not too liberal and far left because i align with their ideals socially am independent and do not agree with them on some things but what i have seen around here is shit pushed by the donald to protect him and deflect from his many issues the man is scum imho ,0,conspiracy
Another-Chance,they were not all black most were and do you have proof that seth did and even if he did do you have proof that others knew about it well i am sure the russians knew about it i mean it has been a year and no one has produced evidence that he did leak and that others knew he did why is that ,1,conspiracy
Another-Chance,well he is an attention whore ,2,conspiracy
Another-Chance,what is missing here is the downright brigading of anything seth by the right the donald has stated before that their goal is just to get his name and the accusations out there that is aided here by this they do not want truth they want to smear and even if this is fake and it is they will run about talking about it to get his name and their accusations out there propaganda 101 they are winning this battle because they have people who will push it for them no matter what people make money from his death the right gets to seed doubts into the minds of others etc the right is using people here day in and day out ,2,conspiracy
Another-Chance,i saw those posts let see how they fare tomorrow the donald brigades here and look right on the front page here 3rd post from the top rambobiggs releases fbi documents from seth rich file and how many on the front page about this and seth in general if so many are skeptical why is the front page littered with such upvoted posts ,2,conspiracy
Another-Chance,you say that because you want to believe it pretty sad ,2,conspiracy
Another-Chance,i am all for that my investigations though do not involve just rushing about blaming a party or throwing out accusations randomly am more of a slow burn type person who looks long and hard into things and does not just jump on the next train because it makes people party i do not jibe with look bad having a rush to judgment is not good imho and it sucks seeing so many being led astray as they buy into anything they want to hear there is a real conspiracy here that goes to the core of many things power money injustice and it is not about politics at all it is about those with money and influence and how they play us for rubes ,2,conspiracy
Another-Chance,i have doubts that dnc clinton did the killing but also see this as fake the question that needs asked here is why so many will rush to believe something that they want to be true what happened to critical thinking and analysis we can literally see bs being pushed to the top here is there a desire to make conspiracy people look dumb ,3,conspiracy
Another-Chance,not a canned response at all just a general observation ,4,conspiracy
Another-Chance,lol look at you and what all you just said i am not pro establishment i did not vote for bill or hillary i do not like anthony or jacob etc what has happened with you is that you are blind to so many things because you want to make this all about politics and party maybe you are not seeing how you are being used here to spread propaganda and divide people oh and as far as pedo pizzagate i was fighting against child porn back in the 90 back then the fbi had only one guy in ohio to handle computer crimes like that i would know because i spoke with someone from the fbi about it and worked on a local case involving it i am all for catching pedos i do not associate them with a party but with those who are sick and those in power who get away with a lot justice system favors the rich regardless of party you and others are being used for political purposes oh and the same people who for 8 years attacked obama over every little thing are now discarding their principles morals values to protect one single man and his family and cohorts do not be that guy try looking at things from a whole new light people are being used by a few to make money they are playing to a base that hates someone some group they are using you for their own gain they are making this about politics because they know it sells and you will buy it you want a conspiracy well there you go look at who pushes what and why look who profits from all of this ,1,conspiracy
Another-Chance,this is interesting if you look at all the seth stuff on this sub and then look at 2016 dc unsolved murders most all of them 65 total were black men people do not care about them because they are black and they cannot use them to push an agenda you can see a list of the unsolved murders on the dc police site the real conspiracy involving power and its abuse can be seen in how so few care about the abuses in the justice system to the poor and those who are would ifferent the right suddenly cares about justice when it is something they can use to push politics ,4,conspiracy
Another-Chance,and if this turns out to be fake will you be more vigilant on further releases from people who are wanting to make money from this ,2,conspiracy
Another-Chance,there were 65 unsolved homicides in dc including seth in 2016 why have not the few detectives they have solved those ones yet and that does not include any from this year or 2015 ,2,conspiracy
Another-Chance,i know what they are but do you really think people who do not agree with you here on this sub are those people ,1,conspiracy
Another-Chance,makes sense i just do not get what they are trying to say here ,0,conspiracy
Another-Chance,say what ,4,conspiracy
Another-Chance,yeah probably knew it was fake but he also probably wants more clicks and attention beware attention seekers who claim they want truth and do not vett things ,3,conspiracy
Another-Chance,i would like to see more skepticism around here if a memo came out like this saying saying trump russia hacking etc and only blocked out one letter in a name etc people would be more critical of it like i said elsewhere looking for the truth is one thing blindly believing everything and posting it ad hoc without any thought is silly and counterproductive and can hurt the cause people say they care about but the donald and crew are not about finding the truth they want to push a meme onto the minds of people to create doubt and a false truth and they will use anything to that end ,4,conspiracy
Another-Chance,that is not how they would redact it smells like bs and someone wants to play the right yet again but there will be clicks and ad revenue ,9,conspiracy
Another-Chance,yeah that is just dumb notice how they redact one letter in the last part that is not how it works right gets scammed again because they want to be ,15,conspiracy
Another-Chance,did not he only come back when in jarden will killing him elsewhere have a different result ,2,TheLeftovers
Another-Chance,i like it makes sense in some ways to me i had a dream the other night about the ending of the show i wo not go into all of it but the ending in the dream was that everyone returned just as mysteriously as they had left it made many people feel foolish for how they acted in your version maybe they all ended up on the island of misfit toys that no one wants ,3,TheLeftovers
Another-Chance, before anyone criticizes me for being biased or something yes i am fucking biased and so are you all of you sure we are but we do not have mod power to flair anti trump articles so it makes it hard to abuse power we do not have in this case you and the other mods are congress and president all rolled into one and how you use that power is at times rather telling which leads me back to the solution of using megathreads for things you know are being brigaded here from the donald still lets them post the threads of the month they push so they are not being censored and allows that info to be all in one place you know there are bots upvoting them know the plan to flood this sub is there and you are asking us what we think should be done about either mass delete such threads to cut down on the spam or put it all in one place so people can read it all together and investigate it there i do not see any other viable options ,49,conspiracy
Another-Chance,easy to do on the donald where their bots upvote things for you ,9,conspiracy
Another-Chance,why should they the dc police already offered 25k the other people on the right doing so are grandstanding and trying to cash in on it all the only reason they care about this is that they want to pin it on the dnc mark my words if they catch the guys that did it and they were just hood robbers the right will claim that is fake there are 65 unsolved homicides for the detectives to sift through from 2016 and that does not obviously include the ones from 2015 or the ones they are currently working on this year do you care about any of those how about you all raise money to hire more detectives you care about this murder for political reasons only period ,-3,conspiracy
Another-Chance,i do not watch tv news maybe you should not either so it is good to see this information here but wait are you saying something is not true is the msm covers it cause i hear that from the right a lot but then those same people bitch that the msm is not covering seth so if they do does that make it not a conspiracy how the fuck does this twisted logic all work ,0,conspiracy
Another-Chance,so you support some dude that twists shit lies makes up stuff etc let me guess you are a conservative here in the us i see all these christian conservative people whine about gays because it is in in the bible but then they run off and cheer on liars like hannity war mongers like bush and people like trump who lie grab pussy cheats lover of money etc hannity is a showman who makes money off of rubes by lying to them and telling them what they want to hear so they feel validated ,4,conspiracy
Another-Chance,none of that is relevant he was a man who molested kids why do you want to use the hell they went through from this asshole for politics do you think him being a dem is what caused this i mean really what is your angle use seth dead body to attack dems use some child molester and the pain of those kids for politics etc really sick shit ,-4,conspiracy
Another-Chance,i monitor about 600 tv news stations across the us i see shit all the time that never makes national news maybe you want this to because you think it means something what is it you think it means he molested kids he is a criminal anything other than that is just pushing an agenda it is like you are happy he hurt those kids so you can tell people democrats are bad or something pretty damned sick if you ask me ,1,conspiracy
Another-Chance,she lives in your mind free of charge on your deathbed you will probably be thinking about her maybe you should get over it she lost why do you care to read about her now help keep your mind of the idiot trump ,5,conspiracy
Another-Chance,the guy is a virtual nobody if he was in congress or was president sure it would be covered but some people want the news to cover any crime a person commits who is a democrat that sounds fishy to start with i am guessing he is also a christian should they use that angle as well lots of christians molest kids should that be on the news every day ,-3,conspiracy
Another-Chance,how is him being a democrat related to his sick criminal activities you do not think people can be political and criminals one does not influence the other does it ,-7,conspiracy
Another-Chance,fine with me we arm people bomb people sell out people and then when folks flee where would you want them to go i mean trump and conservatives are all about personal responsibility right well that is what this is suck it up ,5,conspiracy
Another-Chance,good we helped create many of them by our middle east policies and elsewhere so we have some responsibility in helping these people out ,4,conspiracy
Another-Chance,i did not vote for the idiot back then voted republican from 84 2000 and if you did not like him and him doing it i did not like a lot of shit he did then you should not like it now when trump does it ,0,conspiracy

Another-Chance,here are my ideas for what they are worth when you have a topic that is repeated day in and day out and takes up a lot of screen real estate create a megathread new one each day for the topic now hear me out on this take the seth rich thing everyone is saying they just want to find out who killed him not the other 64 people killed there that year that the same detectives have to work on and if you put all those threads in one place each day it will help with collecting the info i mean the goal is to find out who killed him and not spam twitter facebook and here like the donald has called for just to keep his name and insinuations that the dnc did it floating around do the same with the russian stuff i would like it all in one place there is a ton going on with it congress doj fbi all investigating it a real life conspiracy in the government here and now should be a hot topic for real conspiracy theorists collecting it all in a thread makes sense just about any idea will require some work from the mods being able to filter out topics would be fine but those topics will change rather quickly here admittedly i have more questions than answers like why do only some threads get flairs and how is that decided and in a sub like this where pretty much anything goes it is hard work for the mods more so than most subs in that regards i do know one thing you can do is let the admins know that other subs call for brigading here on certain things and that that has degraded the variety of this sub greatly still love coming here but seems less and less oriented towards actual investigations and discussions ,6,conspiracy
Another-Chance,do not have my notes on it all on this system and is a work in progress but here is a start https en wikipedia org wiki the terramar project note the media and how quickly it rolled out cnn bloomberg etc that does not happen with most charities she is well connected obviously look over the board and other members there have been a lot of fundraisers but really hard to see where the money is spent laundered when i am all done with looking into it will be posting about it here ,1,conspiracy
Another-Chance,look into ghislaine charity and it funding https theterramarproject org panel1 1 rather interesting ,2,conspiracy
Another-Chance, various agencies and organizations do hire shills and vote bots to influence social media but even if they did not the wisdom of the crowd is only so good in a sub like this where people opinions are driven largely by media narratives from multiple political persuasions each with their own agenda and or personal bias if you want to get closer to the truth on any topic you need to develop your own critical thinking faculties this means examining the source of information the credibility of that source any ulterior motives that source may have etc well that is all obvious but what is not is why the only time the mods flair a post for brigading is when it is negative towards trump seth stuff here has been an obvious brigade the donald has called for such off and on and yet nothing happens with those threads not saying they should be pulled flaired but it seems inconsistent and i am all for people investigating it but it appears they do not honestly want to do so and just want to plaster this place with meme like posts tl dr what is the decision process for deciding to flair a post here ,10,conspiracy
Another-Chance,it is also a forum that gets brigaded from the donald which is allowed apparently and ends up shutting down discussions and i do not mind discussing an issue what i do mind is people posting something as a fact when there is nothing to indicate it is and by nothing i mean pretty much not a damn thing points to it being true other than them wanting it to be that religion shit not conspiracy unless of course you state i believe like i believe there is life on other planets and i believe that ufo that people have seen throughout history are alien spacecraft i cannot prove that at all and would not state for a fact that they were how people discuss things is important to the overall narrative not calling for people to follow a rigid methodology but having some structure does help ,16,conspiracy

Another-Chance,wait a minute something is off here suppose the msm does discuss it and looks at things and says well yes another person in that district was killed and it is unsolved seth was not the only one then what well then it is they are not looking into this one murder enough which makes one wonder why someone is saying that in this case and not others there so what some folks are saying is if someone is a democrat and is killed they are more important than others and we want the media to focus more on dems killed than others ,0,conspiracy

Another-Chance,so we agree they are true about fox at least what makes it different for me anyway is that fox is supposed to represent the right which is if you listen to the right supposed to mean they love god and country when in reality they lie more than other networks distort and push gossip all sins according to the conservatives who run about telling us gays are bad because of the bible and helping the poor is a sin the right and fox push it as flag waving bastion of truth the american way and a god fearing people all the while those people are like israel before led off to babylon it is the hypocrisy i find so amusing ,8,conspiracy
Another-Chance,see the thing here is we can be divided party wise always have been but we can also work together in that system the problem today is that we have lost a sense of right and wrong and we have put parties before country if hillary had won thankfully i did not vote either party this election but i have voted for both of them over my many years and was acting like trump and had the same people etc in there the right would be going nuts look at how they bitched and moaned about obama for a million different things and yet they give one man a pass on it all now you might say hey the dems are the same and you would be partially right but the thing is that the left is made up of many tents lots of them bitched about obama and bill for many reasons many wanted bernie and refused to vote for hillary the right is not like that trump knew this he said he could murder someone on fifth ave and would still get the votes he was right because conservatives are for party over country period ,4,conspiracy

Another-Chance,it is mainly conservatives pushing this just like pizzagate no proof just propaganda you want to talk about hillary and how she treated bernie based on facts good nice topic that progressives should talk about want to talk about internal power issues with the dnc and how to reform it awesome but when people are simply pushing shit that is speculative bs and making up lies distortions then we should all be alarmed that is not looking for facts and serious discussion that is a smear campaign and that is also different than personal opinions on a party person etc in the end shit like this harms the cause because it gets riddled with bs that the public ends up seeing fox retracted shit today quietly vs when they loudly proclaimed it kimdotcom was a bust who did not see that coming and so on this serves no good to the cause you are for being critical of things makes you a shill around here and elsewhere but maybe we should all be more critical of how these things are done so we can get actual truth instead of bs speculation shoved around for optics ,6,conspiracy

Another-Chance,here is my take on this it is rather simple law enforcement knows about many people and their ties past etc that does not mean you can just arrest them for the hell of it it also does not mean you can do surveillance on them each all the time not talking automated data collection remember you need humans to analyze that information and make decisions that costs money and it takes each one time to analyze the immense trove of data how many people 24x7 do you think the government employs to just read and analyze translate track etc now think of how many people they are aware of going by the alt right version of things any muslim in the uk was a suspect and had to be watched how many of them are there vs human analysts you starting to see the issue here ,17,conspiracy
Another-Chance,problem is it will be replaced by a new attack on the dnc if not right away as soon as there is flairable news about trump afoot then the donald and such will push to brigade something else here and around the web shit will be made up 4chan will have anon sources claiming bs kimdotcom will say he has proof to get clicks etc and so on rinse repeat not real conspiracies just real propaganda to mislead people and for some people that is what they want ,8,conspiracy
Another-Chance,that is how you desire a lie to look because you want it to mean something to justify the time you have spent on it and your hatred of the dnc but then again the actual goal of conservatives was to get a story public that is negative about someone they do not like those good moral christian people lied and used a dead man to push hate never ever trust people like that ,3,conspiracy

Another-Chance,first off why use hillary as an example here obama was president for 8 years never her second the parties are different in some key ways conservatives want to put gays in a closet make abortions illegal cut aid to americans that need it cut taxes on the wealthy and give corporations complete control of everything liberals on those same issues are different so both are not the same in some big ways the fact that they compromise and meet in the middle is an expected outcome on some issues the biggest problem lies in the fact that humans are all similar rich people grease their palms to get what they want and the poor people get screwed over yes we need a third 4th party i have been a registered independent my whole life and have yet to see independents get anywhere ,3,conspiracy
Another-Chance,damning to the russians apparently they knew a lot enough to suspect they killed him with the goal of blaming hillary the whole bs about a running gun battle with automatic weapons does not add up at all this whole thing reads like propaganda by them aka lies and notice how it is all being brought up again now even though hillary lost maybe because they want to deflect from something else going on with trump and them one thing i would expect from conspiracy minded folks is to be wary of propaganda whether from home or abroad the only people at all that have profited off the death of seth have been republicans and russians that is another angle to think about ,1,conspiracy
Another-Chance,the real question here is who profits from this and how much of that money is being laundered does trump son etc own stock in the companies that make the weapons to further investigate would be good to know all of the weapons purchased and quantities model numbers so we can see if anything is being inflated might also be good to dig up info on the suppliers to the manufacturers and see how they are doing are they really supplying more or are there phantom weapons that is is some of this money just a gift to a few companies ,1,conspiracy

Another-Chance,some being people those who do not actually do serious study and just want a confirmation bias like flat earthers for example or those who thought jade helm was a lot more than it was i get speculation that is one thing but he just tries to entertain and is not looking for the truth let me give you an example from my life my son and i investigate ghosts and legends one grave we came across i spent months researching and have 200 megs of information on was a murder case from 1875 old papers books ancestry information photos etc one of the legends we investigated was bloody mary which links to a cemetery here after a lot of research we got to the truth of the matter on that one looking at one now of a typical crybaby bridge just started on this one will be a lot of driving and looking at records for murders obits etc and so on if the supposed events did not happen then that busts the ghost stories there or could confirm them as some have captured evp on the bridge what chaps me just a bit is when i go to websites that talk about ghosts legends here in ohio with no documentation to back them up again speculation is fine as a starting point but failure to follow up or at least try is not something we do and i feel the same with conspiracies in general create some charts pull together facts be open to new info that shows things are not as you believe them to be modify reassess shouting yelling etc is just showmanship ,1,C_S_T

Another-Chance,i remember the mylar scare now it is diet soda etc and so on always a new diet as well that is the best ever and all the others will make you sick etc and so on big difference between studies and hard science asking people questions and trusting their answers then correlating that to x y z always seems a tad iffy the media and even our schools do not seem to be able to handle science in an intelligent manner you should teach people to be skeptical while also explaining when skepticism is just plain silly think flat earth crap here the media teaches through their news not to trust science but in a different way than how science teaches us how to do the same by examining the data testing it etc and so on ,1,worldnews
Another-Chance,spike in this case means current vs past does not count the future which could go higher or lower depending on many variables like a comet strike nuclear winter etc and yes it can change rapidly without human intervention but there are generally traceable causes volcanic impacts etc and things like quick change brought on by other changes such as when ice melts one of the culprits currently based on previous changes deals with carbon levels and such something which humans contribute to to say climate has changed before without us does not mean that current changes are not heavily contributed to by us and if the mechanics of the change are similar in composition and we are fueling that then we could say that this change is not the same as past ones ,1,worldnews
Another-Chance,the ice age did not change the whole world into an ice cube most the world was not covered in ice but was cooler warmer cooler and that happens over a long period of time it took a long time to cool down who knows about the mammoth was northern fell into freezing lake etc try to be skeptical there as well as others have tried to say it is about the rate of change and what we humans have contributed to that rate you want to argue that no matter what we do that over the next 500 000 years the earth will warm anyway ok but that is different than a spike in it so now we have two things one you admit it is warming rapidly and two you differ as to the cause is that about right ,1,worldnews
Another-Chance,here is the real issue with what you are talking about scientists around the world are studying things like this and post new data all the time for each other along with an analysis so it is new the problem is our media and how they write and handle the information not to mention their headlines the problem is not the science it is people and how they react to news media instead of trying to learn or be taught by the media they just read something while on the toilet and then next trip to the bathroom see another article and think it contradicts something else etc ,3,worldnews
