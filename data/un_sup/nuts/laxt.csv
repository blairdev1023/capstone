laxt,i do not have much advice to give except something really good that the guy who hosts the one i go to every week does that seems to save his face with the venue owner he makes a point every week in announcing to what little dwindling crowd there might be that these are comics either just starting out or working on their new material it obvious to us of course but not to the patrons ya know it sets the tone for what to expect he makes a point in mentioning you never know that you might be seeing the next comedians coming up in the business right here tonight ,1,Standup

laxt,i am kind of wrestling with this myself the balance between trucking through my set regardless of the response and acting reacting with the audience even though these two seem mutually exclusive i believe that somewhere in each one of us there a balance that depends on our character will power and patience since each crowd is different every time we as performers can learn when to interact with the audience and when to just keep going through the set i guess what i am trying to say is that both talents are essential because you never know what kind of crowd you will get ,1,Standup

laxt, tv edits are the death of comedic timing exactly you have won the thread this explains what is wrong with the use of the wave it is not their fault or even how they are used in the show but rather how comedy central edits together the show to fit the schedule and commercials and all of that not that i would want that job either the job of television network producer in charge of editing a live comedy competition special has to be tricky as fuck ,2,Standup

laxt,well you seem to be quite an expert on this matter what do you think is the reason that it does not translate well for television i would imagine in theory having them pop in randomly every few minutes and then going away after a quick 3 5 second bit would be perfect for a television show but personally it gets a little annoying after a while i mean i can tolerate it and all but i can see why some people get straight up annoyed at the wave after a while ,1,Standup

laxt,well that academic stuff was exactly what i thought you were asking for but i am glad to hear that you are coming from the more practical side not that academic analysis to an artform does not have its place but you know what i mean you are absolutely right about studying the greats we have now and the greats of recent decades george carlin certainly comes to mind but you know who louis ck was lauding in interviews up until recent unfortunate news bill cosby i believe he was using the words zen master of comedy you describe him after going to see him live and i would not at all be surprised if a lot of the best comics working now are still studying his shows you know the people to study though you do not need any of us to tell you you were asking if there was any place to discuss the crafting of jokes i do not see why that cannot be here as most members seem quite entrenched in the stand up comedy business the question is how to go about it i guess i mean maybe make a post asking a specific question regarding joke writing and that might get it going certainly you have plenty of active comedy brains here ,3,Standup
laxt,thank god this is terrific news congratulations ,1,pics
laxt,your description reminds me of the same kind of analysis that songwriters will often use which would be music theory i imagine a lot of us choose not to analyze joke writing on that level because mainly too much analysis can lead to losing the essence of what drew us to becoming humorists in the first place but if you want to research various constructions of jokes and of joke writing i would imagine that it would be covered in some sort of joke theory or humor theory a terse attempt to look this up on the google gave me this https www wikiwand com en theories of humor are you just now beginning to write jokes or have you been writing jokes and are now looking to expand your horizons ,4,Standup

laxt,i am in it and my advice is this if you respect steve martin contribution to comedy in general and want a whole hearted no bullshit series of short lectures on various aspects that he encountered in his career and you have 90 of expendable income to improve your career in comedy for the long term do it if you know steve martin is this guy that people like and talk about like he a big deal but you do not really get then forget it if you are looking for insight specifically on stand up comedy well i have only gone about 1 3rd of the way through but i suspect that he will definitely give encouraging reasons to stick with it if you feel you have got a genuine talent and hunger to succeed in comedy not to mention that he will guide you on the writing aspect and finding your voice so ultimately he probably wo not get you kicking ass at the open mics like you are the damn karate kid or anything but he does an earnest job at coaching the student in the finer lessons that he would picked up through his illustrious career including with movies get it so it sure as hell is not a waste of money if you are wondering that depending on your budget of course if you have 90 to spend you will get plenty more than that worth of wisdom but if you do not see yourself learning from that old guy who plays bluegrass on grampa vhs letterman show tapes well frankly you have got a shitload of quality film to watch perhaps starting with three amigos but seriously it probably not for you then again i believe you can take it at any time the only temporal pressure to do it right now is the participation with flash glitz glam the online community by which i have gotten literally nothing from the community on there makes this sub look like times square in the 40s so as far as i see there is not any reason to rush this decision the videos and the pdf course textbook for lack of a better word are probably going to be available for as long as that whole masterclass deal is in business ,3,Standup

laxt,you remind me if this guy in one of my english classes at a community college i went to in the late 90s he seemed like a nice enough guy but tried way too hard to make friends like i dare say he put on a heavier presence than the marine corps recruiter i went to see my senior year of high school when i was considering to join even worse the poor guy practically breathed marine corps down to one of the first days he came in wearing this bright red tee shirt with the marine corps emblem over the left breast and kakhi shorts like a damn uniform now i pray to god that you did not come on as strong as this guy to this day i feel terrible that i did not reach out to him but i am not sure my circle of friends who were just getting into strong psychedelics at the time had much room for a straight edge jarhead sadly though no one else in that class was really reaching out to him either though at the same time it was not much different between anyone else so it was not even like they were avoiding him either ya know i just feel awful looking back how he had no idea that coming off stronger than even the teacher was not a way of finding good friends it was like a 9 or 9 30am class too so some of these folks had just woken up which i know the army says they do now before that time than most civilians do all day and surely the marine corps does more than that but the whole point of that statement is that civilians are not asked read ordered to do that that said i grew up with a pretty hard headed military father and had hardly enough of a social life in high school outside of the chores indoor and outdoor i did every week so i can understand shaking your head when you learn how soft spoiled and naive and dare i say at least at that point in their life practically worthless that a lot of these college kids can be and to clarify by worthless i only mean that they do not do anything but indulge they have never bust their ass to achieve anything or god forbid spend time doing something that they would rather not be doing anyway that what i have seen on the civilian end ,1,dataisbeautiful

laxt,we will look at it this way how many games over the years so you wish you could play again since nes genesis snes up until maybe 2013 at the end of the ps3 xbox 360 generation here got to be hundreds by now and there no way you remembered every nook and cranny that got you through those games i will bet you will even need to look up hints and maybe old cheat codes for fun on the internet because there no way you remember all of them off the top of your head take the zelda franchise for example i am old enough that the original legend of zelda came out when i was in elementary school and we were lucky enough to have cool enough parents to buy it not because the game was controversial or anything but because this was back before you could rent games at the video store and each game cost the same 50 they do now and forget the whole used game discount because that had not come along either so i tied an onion to my belt because that was the thing in those days alright fast forward to my college days i had an n64 and my buddies bought an nes at a goodwill for like 2 and the very same legend of zelda for like 25 cents maybe even 50 cents well those of us in that circle who were gleaming in nostalgia with super mario gold coins over our eyes bought a couple cases of cheap beer and sat around the tv with that nes zelda game for what at least feels like a week and a half trying to remember how the whole adventure went and the stuff you needed to do until at some point we used the internet for hints a few months later ocarina in time comes out now talk about a whole new set of challenges if you have ever played that game fast forward to last year i found out that you could install an n64 emulator on a galaxy 5 and with the controller and usb device to connect the controller we are talking like under 20 before you try it yourself i should warn you that the controls namely the joystick do not work all that smoothly it might have to do with the usb connection device but i dunno anyway i got lost just figuring out where you find the first wooden sword which you will need before going to the deku tree i had to go online to look up that so my point is our memories are not that sophisticated that some old games can seem somewhat new again ,1,gaming

laxt, remember when america was normal you mean before we invaded iraq illegally for weapons of mass destructions that did not exist or before we were attacked by terrorists on 9 11 before the president was impeached for lying about an affair with his wife or before the president conveniently did not recall any knowledge about the cia under his administration and a faction within the military selling arms to a country who we had issued a full trade sanction and then used the money from that transaction to fund a secret war in nicaragua by means of highly brutal death squads perhaps you mean before the nuclear cold war against an adversary that stockpiled more nuclear warheads than we did or when europe was literally divided down the middle with a border where you will get shot for crossing without permission how about before watergate before vietnam before the president was assassinated and we still argue over why it happened before we issued a stalemate with north korea how far back do you want to go before we emancipated slavery but still an enormous percentage of americans of european ancestry refused to welcome the newly free people into society for over a century and a half or how about when there was indeed slavery of human men women and children in this country or the government supported genocide of the native american because of the contrived concept of manifest destiny of course i am belaboring the point but here why almost every one of us including myself has fallen for this concept of things being normal at one point in our lives which is always always always when we are younger and not yet hip to the context of current events you see the very same thing happen quite embarrassingly for them to baby boomers who watch fox news when they talk about how decades ago people used to exercise better manners and my personal favorite had more courage than people do today including grown ups but if you look back i do not think white people pouring bleach into a swimming pool because they do not like black people swimming there is a am exercise of good manners do you i do not consider unnecessarily waging a two front war afghanistan iraq that they are too old to fight and this force the younger generations to take on the responsibility to be a case of exercising bravery do you and these are just examples off the top of my head to summarize what you are describing as normal is just an illusion that likely everyone has at some point in their life because we cannot help but be ignorant to the urgency of current events when we are too young to understand what is going on now that you are hip to it i will oblige the popular statement the only thing necessary for evil to exist is for good people to do nothing ,28,politics

laxt,you are absolutely right hmmm heh you are right but was not the clone army originally ordered by palpatine i mean sure he would sell it under the guise that the clone army was made to protect order in the galaxy which goes back to your point that in order for the republic to accept it they have to seem until the time came for order 66 like protectors of the law lest there be another uprising by the trade federation or something like that i guess i am over justifying a matter that ultimately comes down to personal preference ,3,StarWars

laxt,it appalling that people at this level of government do not seem to recognise at best or at worst they do recognise it and do not care the powerful conflict of interest that this puts this particular advisor to the president imagine the president chief of staff owed even 300 million in gambling debt how would you feel about the administration ability to act on behalf of the american people as demanded by the us constitution then now this is obviously an exaggerated analogy next to kushner situation but the difference between the two circumstances only differ in a matter of degree when someone enters into business with someone else or anything that involves money even if it a bet over a football game they enter into an agreement that they oblige whatever portion of their equity whether they actually have it or not with that other person i do not think jared kushner has 1 billion to hand over should the fit hit the shan as they say on family television it puts him in a position that most of us should find quite uncomfortable as someone who is held in such esteem by the president of the united states ,9,politics

laxt,as someone who does not listen to alex jones at all i have picked up that george soros has been the billionaire to back campaigns of democratic candidates kinda known as the good guy billionaire if you lean left like me that not to say other billionaires have not been immensely generous with philanthropic charities that do things other than to tow the republican party line to use two examples in order to make that last sentence less confusing warren buffett and bill and melinda gates have handed over a more than generous sum of their own wealth for causes that help needy people both home and abroad just as ted turner gave one billion dollars to the un which was evidently quite an unprecedented sum at least that how it was reported at the time as well as turner speaking out as a liberal himself what sets these folks apart from soros however is that they have not been known to contribute to the campaigns of democratic candidates or at least they have not been as frequent and or public about it as soros so naturally george soros is persona non grata on right wing cable news radio and as it turns out alex jones program ,3,politics

laxt,brilliantly said the only thing i have to add is merely to expand on your first point which is as follows let say you got your driver license today but are waiting for the card to come in the mail similar situation happens when you renew or happen to lose your driver license so what they have you do in my state anyway is to carry around a printed sheet from the dmv indicating that you are waiting for your license to come in the mail how is every cop everywhere supposed to have an up to the minute status of every person driver license even with their central servers instead of this crazy data traffic of constant updating this info most likely they update the central servers with the day dmv records at the end of the day or end of the hour or hell maybe even at the end of the week but i doubt it it probably at the end of the day when they update the traffic police servers or maybe every twelve hours so to avoid any confusion a physical driver of a car must carry a physical indication of their license to drive that car whenever they are driving it it a simple solution to a very potentially complex problem also as with the potential problem with anything that relies on the cloud servers can be hacked that all i have to add thank you ,2,explainlikeimfive

laxt,your 83 votes as of this post quite contradict your statement do not they anyway i am cool with people bashing hillary clinton she has no business speaking for liberals she speaks for the establishment and only because the establishment feeds her lust for status and all the status she has she attained through marriage hillary clinton is an awful person and i wish more people would acknowledge this ,1,SandersForPresident
laxt,but hillary clinton was an awful candidate ,2,SandersForPresident
laxt,hillary supporters are too ill informed to realize that a candidate is only as strong as their ability to convince voters to vote for him her hillary clinton is not much better for the us presidency than donald trump she a bad candidate all around just not as bad all around as trump so why would i want to vote for that i was more inclined to show up to protest vote so at least then my voice would be heard because there no way my voice would be heard from either hillary clinton or donald trump ,8,SandersForPresident

laxt,i could not ever find the first godfather game on ps3 i even had a game stop employee try to tell me that it does not exist that it only existed for ps2 which is the one that i had i knew for sure that there was a ps3 version because it was known as the don edition or something like that and unlike the brilliant ps2 version it probably lacked the one nearly fatal flaw of that version which was that when you drove three blocks of manhattan you would stop in your tracks and wait for the game to load the next three blocks new york was still stunningly beautiful for its 1930s depiction on the ps2 they just did not work out the obvious memory issues which is why i wanted the ps3 version so badly sure would be great if they re released it on ps4 where the hardware can handle games 10 times its size ,8,PS4

laxt,i have no idea how to tell whether you are talking out of your ass here what makes you think you know so much about private investigators and particularly this private investigator and there sure is an awful lot of support for the suicide theory without any articles or documentaries that support it i find that to be rather curious do you guys support the lapd conclusion behind biggie murder too official record is always going to be taken for granted now ,-1,Documentaries
laxt,that is literally one aspect of the conspiracy and to then say that evidence is seriously lacking shows that you avoided this documentary altogether there literally more evidence spoken about in this thread than you claim here if you think heroin is the whole story ,-5,Documentaries
laxt,the documentary of the trailer op posted goes into these things i am open to seeing the documentary or article that supports the possibility of cobain suicide but no one seems to be posting any so if anything it the argument that cobain death was irrefutably proven beyond a reasonable doubt a suicide that is light on sources curious that it almost as if those who believe that kurt cobain committed suicide are the ones who are gullible ,-4,Documentaries

laxt,yeah cats can be very different from one another it sounds like that cat had lived all his her life around affection from people had it been a cat who was raised around lots of other cats and no affection from people they are less likely to even want to be petted due to trust issues if there is anything consistent that i have known from cats who i have been around all my life it that they err on the side of caution so this cat you are talking about is rather unusual in its trust like that i think dogs cats in general also react to strangers accordingly with how their owner acts to them though maybe this is more of a dog thing it really quite unusual for a cat to be so affectionate as to walk up to you after barely knowing you this must be one particularly happy kitty ,1,offbeat

laxt,socially people are revolting against the trump presidency but in terms of constitutional legality barring any controversy involving the election process that has yet to arise trump won the election fair and square clinton game since at least the dnc primary was that she was sure to secure more electoral votes with a focus on those superdelegates which she was so savvy about since their inception early on in the 2008 race again during that primary in short electoral votes were clinton game and trump beat her at it that why no one is contesting the results of the 2016 presidential race and do not fool yourself in believing that hillary clinton is this glorious shining candidate like jfk in fact she has all the charisma and shiftiness of richard nixon this certainly does not make trump anything like kennedy in this analogy shudder at the thought that is needed to be pointed out my point is that the popular vote most likely came from people voting against trump pence than for clinton caine ,3,LateStageCapitalism

laxt,well in lieu of the fact trump victory means it the closest influence the ku klux klan has held in the oval office since the days of woodrow wilson i can understand why certain people might be upset at the result i gotta say i miss the days when you were holding rallies in public even when you hid underneath those sheets at least we knew where you stood ,-4,pics

laxt,exactly what gets me is that this lie about ss that has been perpetuated since at least the 90s by right wing talking heads gets repeated and repeated by those who clearly have failed to question the validity of the statement i used to be gullible about these things myself when i was ya know a teenager and barely paying any attention to civic matters but like you said all it takes is some fact checking especially for a matter as consequential to our society as this we cannot have an entire generation and more starving and impoverished just because of the short sighted greed of a few lizard brains on capitol hill and their pathetic loyal toadies on am radio ,2,news
laxt,while i agree with your sentiment defense spending has been outrageously favoring defense contractors for decades now it like hyper corrupt socialism how these defense contractors get away with blank checks from the taxpayer that is one way or can surely be scaled back without affecting the efficiency of the us military ,1,news
laxt,okay but i am trying to find here what you think is the right thing to do just because republicans do not like something is not an excuse for the program to be reformed so that it can continue apparently congress has been using funds set aside for social security to spend on emergency measures through the decades so why should it be a surprise that congress remedy that with interest adjusted for inflation it seems less to me like a matter of budgeting and more a matter of republicans dragging their heels in order to kill a program that they dislike ,1,news
laxt,i was not commenting on the side of the rich paying social security as being ridiculous but rather that them receiving social security becomes ridiculous i fully agree with the progressive tax system it should be seen like the cost of doing business a rite of passage if you will it is necessary for keeping a civil society functioning ,1,news
laxt,oh i see i misunderstood and i did not mean to come off aggro was merely trying to clarify my initial statement ,1,news

laxt, it just frustrating sometimes knowing that we are paying into it now and not going to get anything from it later says who though consider the source the only people who i hear making this claim are those who listen to limbaugh and hannity i also hear from the likes of sanders that we would easily save social security by reallocating the funds you know for example by the government being a bit more frugal with the defense budget or simply frugal at all ,65,news
laxt,well for as often as i am sure most of us heard from our elders that we will not have enough in social security by the time it our turn to collect which is complete horse shit considering we could scrap some of those ten billion dollar contacts for tanks that do not roll on sand and other such ridiculous spendings to then put into whatever deficit that sean hannity and neal boortz all but gleefully claim is killing social security it wo not bother me too much to see the look on the faces of these same grumpy old stooges that gosh it looks like we are going to have to put a temporary hold perhaps one that lasts oh let say 10 15 years or whenever it will be when baby boomers are expected to croak on the promise made to us our children and our children children by the greatest generation known of course as social security considering the reckless misappropriation of federal funds during the time of our baby boomers and the ridiculous global financial bailout illegal war in iraq and the exponential rise of the military industrial complex that would occur under their watch it would only seem fair that we take that allowance away for the time being ,3,news

laxt,no you are not you see i can shoot you faster than you can throw maybe if you are one of those who spend the game somewhere by a bottleneck laying down charges you will surely blow up anyone who is not mindful of the charges because that only works maybe once twice if the opposing team is not paying attention because by the first time you do that the other team will know to look for you and seeing as this is battlefield the maps tend not to have many bottlenecks for you to pull this off regardless i think you meant one on one you will have to look for enemy players who do not see you because if they did they can shoot you faster than you can throw your dynamite seriously i do not think you have ever tried what you are talking about i have no doubt that if i am headed to my objective and you are in my periphery so that i do not see you you would git er done for sure but you see my point is that this is the tactic of a moron you will have more success in a tank where your target cannot reach you with bullets running around with tnt like you are describing though you will get shot ,1,Battlefield

laxt,i get the sense that the person s who said that were coming from a place of bias do not get upset if you start agreeing with some of the stuff he says he does win the reader over at first by making statements that only a fool would disagree with but then when he takes the sharp turn into anti semitism yeah you will recognize the adolf we have all been told about think about it if nothing he said was reasonable he would never have established credibility with anyone bad people do not merely make bad arguments rather the worst ones sound very convincing at first and are very sly at weaving in their extremism making them ever so effective at bringing the gullible weak minded and worst of all ethically pliable to their side though as someone who seems unsusceptible to arguments of anti semitism i doubt you will miss his attempts to ruse the reader into accepting his fascist premises ,1,Documentaries

laxt,that is a truly interesting article clipping you linked that author clearly had not read any of mein kampf i did not even finish more than 1 4th of mein kampf and that first bit i read had lots of very clear almost subconscious anti semitism in the way that he would go on about his early life and making general statements that most of us would deem reasonable until wham he turns the narrative in the direction of jew hate it is not quite my soup was cold this afternoon and the jews caused this but i remember him blaming things that could have many factors to their cause but instead nope if we just got rid of jewish people that would be the solution kinda thing like he spoke very coherently in that direction and without much explanation again i gave up on the book so maybe he goes into better detail later in the book but somehow i doubt it regarding why hebrew people are such a problem to him and unfortunately he was not alone as it was not unlike the way upper middle class white people speak today of sharia law except in 1930s europe spoke anti semitism in a much more stern tone but dammit if he were not persistent on his insistence the russians and the jews those were the targets in his crosshairs sorry for the run on sentences go ahead and read up on mein kampf i downloaded a pirated pdf of it somewhere as i am not too sympathetic of anybody making money off that material unless it went to the holocaust museum fund or something i do not know who owns the rights to it for the record but for research i felt justified pirating it as long as you realize going in where he stood on global matters see above and that ultimately you are reading the thoughts of one of the biggest assholes of all time it wo not be offensive as much as maybe pitiful hell i would even say that he was a much better writer than a painter https upload wikimedia org wikipedia commons 7 7d adolf hitler der alte hof jpg ,3,Documentaries
