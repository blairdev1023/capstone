rstcp,in practice there a whole system that developed where all parts work together to reproduce these perverse incentives to get more people behind bars different levels in different states for sure but there a reason why the us has way more prisoners per capita than any other developed nation on earth here some insightful bits from an investigation into a private prison when a federal court declared in 1985 that tennessee s overcrowded prisons violated the eighth amendment s ban on cruel and unusual punishment cca made an audacious proposal to take over the state s entire prison system the bid was unsuccessful but it planted an idea in the minds of politicians across the country they could outsource prison management and save money in the process privatization also gave states a way to quickly expand their prison systems without taking on new debt in the perfect marriage of fiscal and tough on crime conservatism the companies would fund and construct new lockups while the courts would keep them full and then there are courts inside the prisons too when inmates are written up for breaking the rules they are sent to inmate court which is held in a room in the corner of cypress unit one day our class files into the small room to watch the hearings miss lawson the assistant chief of security is acting as the judge sitting at a desk in front of a mural of the scales of justice even though we treat every inmate like they are guilty until proven innocent they are she pauses for someone to fill in the answer innocent a cadet offers that s right innocent until proven guilty this is not a court of law although it issues punishments for felonies such as assault and attempted murder an inmate who stabs another may end up facing new criminal charges he may be transferred yet prisoners and guards say inmates who stab others typically are not shipped to a higher security prison the consequences for less serious offenses are usually stints in seg or a loss of good time sentence reduction for good behavior according to the doc winn inmates charged with serious rule violations are found guilty at least 96 percent of the time inmate counsel has your defendant appeared before the court miss lawson asks a prisoner standing at the podium no ma am he has not he replies the inmate counsel represents other inmates in the internal disciplinary process every year he is taken to a state run prison for intensive training miss lawson later tells me that inmate counsel never really influences her decisions for removing a broom from a closet at the wrong time this inmate will stay in prison an extra 30 days the absent inmate is accused of coming too close to the main entrance would the counsel like to offer a defense no ma am how does he plead not guilty mr trahan is found guilty the entire trial lasts less than two minutes the next defendant is called he is being considered for release from segregation do you know your bible miss lawson asks yes ma am do you remember in the gospel of john when the adulteress was brought before jesus what did he say i don t remember that ma am he says sin no more she points for him to leave the room the next inmate an orderly in cypress enters he is charged with being in an unauthorized area because he took a broom to sweep the tier during rec time which is not the authorized time to sweep the tier he starts to explain that a co gave him permission miss lawson cuts him off how would you like to plead guilty i guess you are found guilty and sentenced to 30 days loss of good time man y all this is fucked up man y all gonna take my good time he runs out of the room they done took my good time he screams in the hall they took my good time fuck them for removing a broom from a closet at the wrong time this inmate will stay in prison an extra 30 days for which cca will be paid more than 1 000 ,1,Drama

rstcp,i am not saying the bbc is perfect or that it completely neutral i am just once again saying that they are fundamentally different from other media because they are a public service accountable to the tax payers and heavily policed for their neutrality year in year out they receive about equal accusations of bias from both sides and whenever complaints tilt heavily to one side there are usually inquiries and attempts to rectify the recent brexit coverage is a good example it nice to think you can get news that does not have a slant i do not you probably also think hillary clinton had the best interests of the common people in mind when she ran for president i do not care for hillary i am not even american i am european but i have a strong interest in global politics and trump worries me because he is perhaps the most incompetent leader of a global power the world has ever seen that affects the entire planet hillary was quite clearly a hyper ambitious self interested uber politician chasing power her politics were too neoliberal for my tastes and her foreign policy too reckless and interventionist but at least she would not have been nearly as paranoid incompetent petty narcissistic impulsive and out of her depth as the current potus and that saying something because she had plenty of those qualities in significant doses all on her own ,1,POTUSWatch
rstcp,they get called out from both sides go to r uklabour or even just r ukpolitics and you wo not have trouble finding a lot of left wing brits who think the bbc is biased against their candidate of course they are not perfect but they are genuinely different from for profit media because they are a public service paid for by tax payers and ultimately controlled by them as well i know of no other media platform that has to go through such lengths to attempt to enforce neutrality but obviously it not always 100 possible at least al jazeera is not publicly known to have covered up a child prostitution ring aka jimmy savile typical complete off topic blabbering by a trumpie try to stay on the subject ,1,POTUSWatch
rstcp, biased not bias also read my comment again what i said is that they are not for profit having said that the bbc is definitely in a unique position because it is a public service you can read their charter http www bbc co uk bbctrust governance regulatory framework charter agreement html where they outline their binding commitment to neutrality they have to take their commitment to neutrality seriously or there are consequences and they can be sued of course you probably think breitbart is a centrist platform and t d has trustworthy posts so i am not surprised if you think everything is a vast left wing conspiracy,1,POTUSWatch

rstcp,for the few actual examples of true veblen goods observed it would be cruel and pointless consumption of rice and other cheap staple foods in desperately poor areas can rise as the price of those goods go up if there is no other staple available for substitution the logic is that the poor consumers have extremely limited food budgets most of which are spent on the staple foods anyway and a fraction on luxury sides if all else stays the same the rising price of rice would mean a smaller budget which would mean buying even less luxury foods or less rice however since the consumer has to meet their caloric needs they instead cut back on the still more expensive luxuries and buy more rice to replace the lost calories from the luxury foods so if you go and tax the veblen good rice even more you will literally kill the poor,2,neoliberal

rstcp,also from nl was going to say the exact same thing it looks like this map is literally just someone going into paint and putting dots wherever they think it fits their agenda having said that all of these terrorist attacks can only hardly considered to be terrorist attacks due to their utterly small often only barely political and simply pathetic nature they were not in any way related to islam but you know that if the perpetrator in either of these cases was a muslim they would absolutely be considered terrorism by people like this map maker regardless of the actual claimed political goals of the attacker they pick targets that they consider to be of strategic importance exactly this is also supported by a chronological representation of terrorist attacks in europe http www datagraver com thumbs 1300x1300r 2015 11 t kills png if muslim immigrants were causally linked to islamist terrorism there should have been a huge spike in islamist terrorism at the very beginning of that graph since that when most muslims started coming to western europe if muslim refugees are supposed to be causally linked to islamist terror then there should also have been a big spike in the 1990ies when thousands of muslim refugees fled the former yugoslavia especially from kosovo and bosnia clearly none of this is the case instead the spikes for islamist terror follow a pattern similar to the spikes for other terrorist activity it linked to conflict and war the few pre 2004 islamist terror attacks were almost all linked to palestinian organizations with very clear political and not religious or ideological stated objectives the big spike in 2004 comes surprise surprise right after the invasion of iraq it no coincidence that the uk and spain two big supporters of the wars in afghanistan and iraq were targeted here then there another spike which is not really visible on the graph but it comes in recent years just after european countries started bombing isis in syria it correlated somewhat in this instance and only in this instance with an increased refugee flow but even then it lags and there is no causal link refugee flows increase as wars and conflict intensify and terror spreads as war and conflict intensify it idiotic to immediately assume that refugees are what is causing terror when the rest of the data we have refutes that ,7,SRSDiscussion

rstcp,i know what a counterfactual is but you have not exactly made it clear what yours is in this case it so outlandish that it basically nonsensical i presumed that the india you are talking about would still contain the same area ie current india pakistan bangladesh i do not see how the british could conquer subdue and contain that entire area and not have it break apart the way it did in this actual timeline it does not make any sense ,0,neoliberal

rstcp,what counterfactual british india shortly after independence broke up and parts of the pieces broke up again not much later are you really not familiar with the partition or the pakistan split ,0,neoliberal
rstcp,ok so let me get this straight what you are imagining is that britain somehow without violence or force peacefully incorporated all of what is today pakistan india and bangladesh and that the entire indian subcontinent would become an equal nation in the uk so you would have the uk parliament with say 10 000 seats of which about 9 000 would be mps from the indian subcontinent on the other side of the planet that makes total sense i am sure the brits would be thrilled to be ruled by pm modi right about now they can barely contain scotland india itself could not be sustained in its british form for just a few years until it broke apart ,3,neoliberal

rstcp,how old were you when the invasion started it was not exactly a rare fringe idea not to invade practically unilaterally with no follow up plan based on intelligence already widely judged to be flimsy with several non military options on the table and no immediate threat against international law without regional support while already fully engaged in another war in afghanistan without the 9 11 rally around the flag militaristic nationalism boners the rest of the world was pretty united in their ability to see that it would end horribly and there was plenty of domestic us opposition to the idea by citizens but also in the security intelligence and academic communities ,12,neoliberal
rstcp,the us led invasion of iraq in march 2003 caused many civilian casualties but it did not immediately create a major humanitarian crisis or set off mass migration soon after however coalition counter insurgency operations including massive attacks on cities like falluja led to substantially increased mortality and large displacement affecting hundreds of thousands of people beginning in 2006 sectarian clashes worsened and inter communal violence led to rising death and injury as well as massive new displacement iraq death rate has risen sharply with stepped up coalition bombing and ground attacks as well as rise in sectarian violence a growing number of iraqis are being forced to leave their homes and minority groups are now seriously at risk according to unhcr there are 1 9 million internally displaced people in the country and 2 million refugees escaped to neighboring countries especially syria and jordan unemployment and poverty rose sharply too according to the united nations development programme one third of the population now lives in poverty education has broken down further iraqis basic needs in drinking water food sanitation and electricity are not met hospitals lack basic medical supplies and are understaffed the international relief system has not been able to respond to the growing humanitarian challenges international agencies have themselves faced serious problems in reaching iraqis at risk iraq humanitarian emergency has reached a crisis level that compares with some of the world most urgent calamities https www globalpolicy org humanitarian issues in iraq consequences of the war and occupation of iraq 35742 html i think that gonna be a no from me dog seriously though the fact that you actually thought this was some sort of killer comeback just betrays your absolute ignorance once again stop embarrassing yourself and pick up a fucking book for the love of money,6,neoliberal
rstcp,i agree following the iraq model would have been even worse since it would have meant overthrowing al bashir practically unilaterally occupying the country with heavy reliance on unaccountable private military contractors purging the entire educated elite torturing its citizens and then leaving while propping up a different sectarian dictator from a different ethnic group in the case of sudan that would have been a recipe for a situation that would make darfur or the current situation in south sudan seem absolutely placid what the us actually did is less than nothing they were so invested in scoring a diplomatic victory by being shown to have facilitated a short sighted peace between the south and the north that they helped to actively suppress the evidence of the genocide in the west when undp director and whistle blower mukesh kapila attempted to present it to western governments then when he eventually publicly resigned and presented the information anyway the bush administration chose to use the situation in darfur rhetorically as evidence that their war on terror and the axis of evil was justified without attempting to help devise a constructive solution to the issue i am not saying it would have been easy but there were a vast number of options between would o an iraq and cover it up then do nothing while politicizing it in speeches i can see that you do not have a clue what you are talking about so i can forgive your ignorance but i recommend reading up on it before you spout off again kapila de waal and mamdani have written some good stuff about it for starters ,18,neoliberal

rstcp,yes but saying the us pays 73 of the budget is just straight up false the us does not spend so much on its military because of nato it spends a ridiculous amount because it wants to project power across the globe and because the military industrial complex is self perpetuating the european nato countries would be perfectly capable of their own collective defense without the us who are they defending against anyway russia their economy is the size of spain and they spend only a fraction on their defense than europe as a whole does i think the 2 target is unnecessary and raising spending just to meet the target is wasteful and would just start off a regional arms race at best,0,NeutralPolitics

rstcp, as sexist as it sounds i think the show really nails female behavior and male behavior the show i think accurately portrays gendered behavior within a subculture completely obsessed with certain traditional notions of masculinity and femininity the mafia is a perfect example of an actual patriarchal secret society where any deviant behavior from the heteromasculine norms meets with excessive violence on the male side you have the rampant homophobia very central to one really important plot but evidenced throughout the taboo on cunnilingus again with great consequences the pressure to pretend violence does not emotionally impact the men the homosocial bonding rituals which are integral to the family running smoothly most prominently the initiation rites but also the general behavior of the men the normalization of and even pressure to have a gumare baccala was mocked for not having one while a wife cheating is hinted at as an extreme taboo and many more examples where the patriarch tony laments the decline of the trong silent type as the standard male behavior the women are all expected to be submissive constantly cooking chaste but attractive and generally to just be involved with the nurturing tasks they are assigned whenever a woman breaks out of this mold just like when a man does not behave like a man it causes great stress to tony and to the family as a system see the way tony aggressively fights the idea of his wife having her own projects or being involved with finances or the way he struggles to accept that his mother was not the nurturing caring ideal he has imagined his whole life women who do not submit to the norms that the wives adhere by like the strippers and prostitutes can be tolerated as means of income but are ultimately completely disposable a made man again note the phrasing like ralphie is immune from even being admonished for the murder of a girl as long as she is a whore proper wives on the other hand are financially supported and cared for even when their late husbands are found to be corrupt none of that is a portrayal of biologically innate gendered behavior the family again not a coincidence that this is what the mob likes to call itself constantly clashes with the messy realities of fluid gendered behavior and all the rules and taboos have to be constantly monitored the fact that those rules are not only so deeply embedded but also constantly under pressure shows that the gendered behavior is an ongoing performance at odds with the natural behavior just like the business of the mob is in constant decline throughout the show so are the gendered norms tony visiting a shrink is the first act of the show and it is an emasculating act of weakness which almost kills him ,11,thesopranos

rstcp,regarding the referendum i am cautiously optimistic as to the long term future of the country far less so i can think of two countries which were at similar points on the path from democracy to dictatorship that held very similar referenda to extend the power of the state zimbabwe in 2000 and venezuela in 2007 in both cases the ruling parties were authoritarian but ostensibly still democratic and the leaders broadly popular both referenda were also narrowly defeated i feel like authoritarian democratic leaders are very good at using their cult of personality and repression to keep winning elections as candidates but when the vote is regarding a more abstract extension of power there is a higher turnout against in the end though while mugabe and chavez accepted the results they found other ways of bending the rules of democracy in their favor whole continuing to slide further towards authoritarianism some even say that accepting the defeat gave them the external legitimacy they continually leverage to maintain their position as a nominally democratic state,8,europe

rstcp, we are prisoners to that language i agree for now but i see a lot of fascinating critical work in international relations which confronts this language feminist critical analysis especially gives me cautious optimism about the future as it is being taken more seriously feminist theory challenges the international relations analyst to understand power as integral not only to the maintenance of world order by and between states but also within states as legitimising and stabilising of them following from these observations about the nature of power in international relations feminist theorists posit new understandings about the exercise of power these have included framing power in terms of cooperation as opposed to domination this reformulation has been applied in terms of the way that questions of power in international relations are approached that is the methodology employed by the analyst and in terms of recognising the impact of cooperative power alongside the power as domination understanding which according to feminist critiques is the more widely studied within the discipline these perspectives have gained ground academically and i see it reflected already within the foreign policy of some scandinavian countries hopefully eventually this will filter through to the us as well ,1,ChapoTrapHouse

rstcp, the only question is where does china stand after north korea plays it final hand do they invade from the north to stop the refugee crisis before it starts almost certainly china has no reason to defend the nk regime once they make that move so getting involved at that point is their last chance to shape the future of the peninsula china would prefer not to have a unified korea with the same security arrangements and the same political system as the current south korea and it absolutely would do anything to prevent that new korea from being a nuclear united korea while sk might like usurping the nk nuclear institutions in a new geopolitical situation where their primary security concern would be china and not nk and where they could be more independent from the us and more directly china immediate concern would indeed be refugees china cares deeply about stability above all and they have shown in the recent past like with the south sudanese independence and in peacekeeping missions that they are willing and capable of working together with the other major powers to ensure stability even if it costs them i bet china would be willing not just to invade militarily in the immediate term and cooperate with all the other powers to contain further threats and refugee flows but also to help fund a korean marshall plan of sorts to ensure that the koreans stay in the newly unified territory anyway none of it is too relevant because the kims are a lot more rational than people think a first strike is extremely unlikely to come from pyongyang ,7,ChapoTrapHouse

rstcp,yes absolutely if the us france and some other countries had not blocked the urgent requests for a stronger un mandate with more soldiers to enforce the ceasefire the escalation would have been halted i am not saying it would have all been peaceful and free of tension but the biggest problem in early april was a complete power vacuum after president habyarimana was assassinated hardline forces in the remaining government seized power and at first slowly and only in certain regions started escalating the violence and directing it at civilians while the rpf rebels pretty much simultaneously started the attack on the capital as the rpf quickly got the military upper hand the remaining government forces ramped up the killing in a response to the existential threat the un mission in place had a window of about two weeks where they could have halted the rebels from proceeding while shutting down the roadblocks protecting the moderate hutu leadership and securing the stadiums and churches where tutsi civilians were congregating that would have almost certainly been enough to bring the parties back to the negotiation table it would have certainly saved the lives of the civilians who would otherwise have been slaughtered in the churches and stadiums the reason that things escalated to the drc is that the rwandan army and the militias fled there when the rpf took over and eventually used it as a base to threaten the new rpf state enacting the ceasefire and reaching a negotiated settlement which was already underway when the plane was downed would have prevented at least that ,2,ChapoTrapHouse

rstcp,i do not think it dumb to try to analyze one of the largest tragedies in human history to try to figure what could have been done to stop it there are patterns of genocide which are useful in cases that might be similar consensus about the development of the genocide and the perpetrators of the habyarimana assassination seems to have shifted from a pre planned genocide which was already largely planned out years prior to 1994 by the same hutu extremists who shot down the plane to set it in motion to the theory that the rpf shot down the plane and that the genocide escalated step by step as the surviving government factions found themselves in a power vacuum facing an existential crisis with imminent state capture by the rebels two new books which came out last year independently set out a similar thesis scott strauss making and unmaking nations and guichuoa from war to genocide reviews by other rwanda experts like de waal who previously held on to the notion of a carefully planned large scale hutu conspiracy show that they are pretty convinced by the arguments guichuoa book in particular adds some new information about the downing of the plane which refutes the rpf story anyway i am not just saying all this to win an argument about the rwandan genocide i think that if this new history of the events is accurate it fits into a model of the process of genocide and mass state violence against civilians which is very useful for protracted conflicts like syria and i think it can inform us about the best options there ,2,ChapoTrapHouse

rstcp,of course when the situation is a threat to instead of from a government the call is logistically legally geopolitically so much easier not much to debate there the problem arises when it the government killing its own civilians in rwanda the genocidal government had a security council seat at the time of the conflict and it ended up being responsible for the death of an estimated 600 900 000 of its own civilians that the kind of situation where the hard decisions come in and i genuinely believe that a humanitarian hawk like hillary formed her views on intervention during this crisis her husband decided to back away from it and they both felt culpable for the consequences similar story with the late reaction to the balkan genocides those types of situations are more similar to what happened in lybia and syria and i can fully understand why someone would see non action as being potentially complicit in avoidable slaughter after having gone through that twice before american operations tend to focus first on overthrowing governments and then hopefully letting the good ones be in charge of the new government this describes the cold war policies pretty accurately and while the us was clearly a disgusting imperialist threat to peace and openly supportive of dictatorships and complicit in genocidal and anti democratic regimes i think the situation is very different post 1990 there are the actions which i think were justifiable which prevented further loss of life and which ultimately resulted at least temporarily in more stability reversing the haiti coup preventing genocide in bosnia and kosovo and pushing saddam out of kuwait there the case of overthrowing the taliban in afghanistan which is borderline then there are the obvious failures libya and iraq 2003 a final category is failures to act but that one is almost impossible to agree on i would put at least darfur and rwanda in that category and possibly syria ,11,ChapoTrapHouse
rstcp,nah i was speaking more broadly because the kuperman paper was speaking more broadly as well i agree to some extent with your point about the me especially i do not think the trump administration has the brains or the heart to improve on that record even if they tried but a lot of people would argue that they have basically shat on the region up until this moment means that the us if anything has a responsibility in the me invading iraq occupying it instituting a disastrous deba athification program which leads to the proliferation of conflict in the region and then stepping away does not seem like the right thing to do obviously there are terrible and shortsighted ways to intervene and the us generally does do those things but that does not mean we cannot discuss what ought to be done i think the us at least owes it to vulnerable minority groups who are largely victimized because of us involvement to grant them some form of protection obama decision to launch airstrikes against isis because of the genocide against the yazidis is one of those situations where i find it very hard to say fucking imperialist us dropping bombs in iraq again i am also against the pursuit of regime change or the supporting of rebels as the ultimate goal but like i said in the case of rwanda it is almost always the case that humanitarian missions take place within a conflict and it is extremely hard to avoid striking one side committing atrocities without rewarding some other side does that mean it better not to intervene at all even if it means you miss out on saving the lives of thousands of civilians and promoting impunity at the hands of genocidal dictatorships it an unbelievably hard call ,7,ChapoTrapHouse

rstcp,it is still an incredibly hard decision with only a very few possible exceptions every genocide occurs in the context of war and since wii practically all genocides took place in a civil war where rebels are active the consensus with hindsight is that military intervention in rwanda in early april would have halted the escalation from civil war to genocide and save hundreds of thousands of lives and that just considering the immediate genocide in rwanda if we add the subsequent wars in the congo which can be traced back to the rwandan civil war the number goes up into the millions at the time though intervening on humanitarian grounds against the genocidal militias would have certainly rewarded the rpf rebels who were already poised to enact regime change in a volatile situation like that how do you pick sides in a way that is not haphazard if you had the ability would you have sent military forces to kigali in april 1994 or would you let the genocide take its course i get that this is not really a sub for serious discussion but it a difficult topic i always struggle with and the knee jerk humanitarian intervention is always imperialism so stay out of it response does not seem like the right one either ,20,ChapoTrapHouse

rstcp, how it less stressful for the animal i am not saying it is less stressful i am saying it should not necessarily be more stressful as the video which prompted these measures shows non halal slaughter can be truly horrific enforcing animal welfare standards should be done across the board the reason behind ritual slaughter halal kosher was to prevent the eating of diseased animals i have seen different reasons for the rituals some of them focus on respect for the animal animal welfare and others hypothesize about health concerns fuck it religion was never rational agreed but people will cling to rituals so i think the most productive solution is to not ban something outright because it is religious but to ban the practices which are inhumane which leaves space for everyone to devise a method of slaughtering of their preference as long as it is legal and equally painful ,55,europe
rstcp, aka under perfect conditions i dont see that as being likley in the majority of slaughters i would prefer this be enforced than simply banning ritual slaughter outright the whole reason for ritual slaughter is supposed to be animal welfare so they should be on board as long as the conditions are enforced across the industry ,19,europe

rstcp,i agree i think the strike was proportional and justified but the problem is that trump emboldened assad to commit the attack on the first place his policy has been erratic and unfocused i do not see the way this was carried out as leading to more stability ,41,PoliticalDiscussion

rstcp,putin did not have a say in the matter there was no negotiation or diplomatic communication it was just the military informing russia,7,geopolitics
rstcp,it a complete flip flop on the policy of regime change in syria a week ago that was no longer on the table now the admin is dedicated to a future in syria without assad it a big deal,7,PoliticalDiscussion
rstcp,no way power was behind that just read her book or comments like this last week in a powerful speech that should have received more attention than it has so far samantha power the america ambassador to the united nations seemed to rebuke the administration in which she serves for its handling of the syria catastrophe power was speaking at a holocaust memorial museum dinner at which she presented the museum elie wiesel award to the canadian general romeo dallaire one of the few westerners who tried to protect rwandans as they were being slaughtered as opposed to weeping for them after they were murdered which was the more common western response in the course of her speech power condemned those who argue that the choice facing the west in syria is between full on military engagement and doing nothing she was also particularly harsh on the subject of leaders who avoid acting until humanitarian crises spin into chaos in preventing mass atrocities we must redouble our emphasis on early engagement power said the sooner we act the more options we will have that requires developing solutions to potential atrocities before they become actual ones and to those who would argue that a head of state or government has to choose only between doing nothing and sending in the military i maintain that is a constructed and false choice an accompaniment only to disengagement and passivity ,1,PoliticalDiscussion
rstcp,the most worrying thing is the complete and sudden reversal on regime change policy only last week the us ambassador to the un nikki haley said washington was no longer prioritising the removal of the syrian president also on thursday us secretary of state rex tillerson signalled a sudden shift in policy by the trump administration saying that basharal assad should have no role in a future syria ,52,PoliticalDiscussion
rstcp,i think that a signal that might affect china in other places scs but the nk situation is different in that sk and seoul in particular will remain the most important factors to consider any sudden unilateral attack on nk will see retaliation in some form against seoul and china position does not make a difference in that ,6,geopolitics

rstcp,seoul makes nk a completely different ballgame,2,geopolitics
rstcp,well it is because at the beginning of the admin they clearly backed away from that that two 180 turns back to the status quo ante only last week the us ambassador to the un nikki haley said washington was no longer prioritising the removal of the syrian president also on thursday us secretary of state rex tillerson signalled a sudden shift in policy bythe trump administration saying that basharal assad should have no role in a future syria ,47,geopolitics
rstcp,the entire reason for the nk nuclear programme is as a desperate deterrent against regime change this will only put that programme in overdrive,16,geopolitics
rstcp,it a strike accompanied by a statement that assad needs to go that the part that people seem to be missing and it indicates future escalation,53,geopolitics
rstcp,the fact that trump has suddenly and radically altered his position on regime change also makes nk even more invested in getting long range nuclear capability it their only deterrent this wo not ease tensions in that region,12,geopolitics

rstcp,it not just the connection with putin it the fact that the trump admin openly backed away from regime change which was the policy of obama and spoke of assad as a partner in the conflict against isis ,3,worldnews
rstcp,i fault him for his completely erratic behavior on this first he emboldened the assad regime by backing away from the policy of regime change by saying assad would be a partner against isis by siding with russia on this that why assad felt he could do this again this does not bode well for global stability ,0,worldnews

rstcp,i was not going to comment any more on this drama because i am not a sikh or a subscriber but i just have to point out as the op of that post that there was brigading but it from two sides someone posted it on r subredditdrama where it got a lot of traction and it has an anti trump subscriber base as does reddit in general and obviously there was a large influx of t d subscribers from the ama it laughable to think that a clinton pac would pay people to comment there but you are right that the votes and comments were not organic ,4,Sikh
rstcp,thank you for that explanation it was really helpful and i am genuinely interested i also concede that it was inappropriate to refer to the virtues without any understanding of them i think i understand them a little better now they are the natural consequences of sikh spiritual practice and not practices or goals themselves that interesting it sounds there are a lot of similarities to zen buddhism in as far as i have studied that at least in regards to the precepting of the ego and the panentheistic nature of the religions if you are familiar with buddhism would you say you recognize these or other commonalities and is not it possible to recognize virtues or the opposite of virtues in other people like leaders and thereby recognize good and bad leadership ,0,Sikh
rstcp,you know i completely agree and i would love to know about the actual meaning if the virtues on a previous thread i asked about it but got no answer so i am ready for an education what i do find remarkable is that this is the first time i see you point out someone using the sikh philosophy when the donald does it constantly to defend their worldview the guy i responded to did exactly what i did to paint a hate sub as a persecuted minority the sikhs should run to defend but i did not see you admonish him the way i was just now anyway without hostility i am genuinely open and curious to see why i misunderstood do the videos not indeed show the opposite of the virtues and if not how should one incorporate those virtues into daily practice cheers,3,Sikh

rstcp,knowing t d this and some of the other worst parts of the ama will be taken out of context and spammed many many more times on that sub over the coming years exactly none of the in depth historical and religious comments will be remembered and the comments will as they already do on that post just perpetuate the disgusting narrative of sikhs as natural allies and model minorites in the fight against mudslimes and illegals good job you have given them a lot of ammo this is the definition of being a useful idiot,17,Sikh
rstcp,thank you i will have a look sikhi is still a fascinating faith,11,Sikh
rstcp, just based on the answers and conduct in the ama i am not saying that i equate all sikhs to those who participated in the ama all i said is that the answers and conduct in the ama to me did not reflect positively on r sikh i thought the ama was an outreach effort to non sikhs that my feedback as a non sikh i do not see how that makes me like djt,3,Sikh
rstcp,i have not i was very clear about that in the first thing i posted here on this very thread i am interested in politics and religion and i am always interested in learning more and talking about it that how i found the original t d ama thread and that how i got here i am banned from t d so i could not ask anything there the interactions i have had with you guys are my first impression of the r sikh sub and so far it seems like about 50 of the responses i got from the pro ama folks have been something about cuck tears not a great introduction to sikhi i gotta say ,18,Sikh
rstcp,well it just about all you seem to be capable talking about i hope you grow out of this fast,23,Sikh

rstcp, you would be surprised at how many non trump supporting sikhs on this subreddit use those words in casual light hearted conversations anyone who has been on here for a while knows exactly what i am talking about like i said i am familiar enough with the subculture i am in my twenties just not a teenager cuck is not something i hear in casual light hearted conversations with non alt right people could you link it this right here https www reddit com r the donald comments 63pf3p we are sikhs ask us anything dfw2dai context 3 is what i am talking about a group of people who post aggressive anti muslim memes where they talk about mudslimes and glassing mecca and carpet bombing the middle east and on and on and on asks about a guide to visually identifying the differences between a muslim and a sikh and the answer is oh well you can spot the difference from the turban and the steel bangle thank you for the friendliness based young pede come on you know why they want to know and it because they want to know how to recognize those they hate i have seen a different response from a sikh before and it was this they say the average american does not know the difference between a sikh and muslim they tell me the average american associates a turban and a beard with isis taliban or bin laden said mr singh we are not the victims of mistaken identity we are in fact doing exactly what our identity was supposed to do it was supposed to absorb hate and ignorance so others would not have to mr singh stresses sikhs should not seek to other themselves from muslims but to stand in solidarity against racism faced by both religions our religion provides us the guidance that there is no other there is no difference there is no better there is only divine light which shines in all my hope is of a better america where tolerance is not just a word that is thrown around but actually practiced by every individual till then the average sikh will be out there with our turbans and beards easy to spot and ready for any challenge that may be presented http www independent co uk news world americas man gives perfect response to those who cant tell the difference between sikhs and muslims a6777041 html now that was an unprompted answer within the context of the general concern from americans being asked that question on a sub dedicated to hating muslims i would kind of expect at least the same that is exactly what they were to us and we are not going to lie and pretend they were not these things in the ama you did not say you have been so nice to us you said the sub is a great open welcoming platform for discussion full of nice pedes that different ,19,Sikh
rstcp, please be aware the mods do not represent the views of everyone the sub i got that impression as well from some of the threads i have seen about it but then the mods keep emphasizing in the ama that those people opposed to it are just brigading sjws i am 100 sure that most actual sikhs irl are nothing like the ama but it sad to see that this is the way you are represented i guess it comes with the reddit territory ,19,Sikh
rstcp, no this is not right wing pandering these are internet memes slang jokes that typical teenagers 20 year olds in the west know about and engage in i will admit i am not a teenager or 20 year old but i know enough about the subculture to know that cuck and ick and tired of illegal immigrants and praise kek and trump wall are not just teenage memes they are alt right memes i honestly cannot believe that someone using them so often would not know this so i do not believe you are being honest with me or yourself right now how about you pull up posts about how we represented sikh beliefs and how sikhi relates to the aforementioned subjects rather than foolishly equating internet humor with pandering to the right wing like i said i was writing this in response to a mod maybe you explicitly asking for and denying examples of right wing pandering i did see how you represented sikh beliefs in other ways some of it was informative but the most upvoted stuff was basically the how to spot a sikh guide which was clearly the most important question to the pedes because they are scared of labeling the wrong minority as the terrorists this whole ama could have taken place on any other sub and you could have informed people of your faith when you choose to do it instead on a sub that is defined by hatred and censorship at least have the courage not to call them kind open friendly and welcoming ,22,Sikh
rstcp,with 3000 subscribers you can have a nice subreddit with actual good discussion which it seemed to be before this debacle some of the mods also seem very dedicated to sikhi and post about it all the time which all makes it a lot more mystifying i feel like there one or two clueless teenagers who just got carried away by it all because of all the praise from the pedes but it sad to see them play right into the whole model minority cover story t d blatantly uses to pretend they cannot possibly be racist hate fueled ,9,Sikh

amazing not only are we blown away by all the high energy questions we have received but personally we are so grateful for the warm welcome we have received from everyone on the donald all of us knew

anything dfw3y51 context 3 would you say that is not right wing pandering shit just for the record i am indeed not a member of this community and i am sure you will call me a brigading sjw cuck with salty cuck tears i just saw the sticky for the ama on the donald yesterday and posted it here because i am banned from that sub but also interested in learning about sikhi the concept of panentheism alsways fascinated me and discussing the topic of the ama as it was announced on the donald sikh perspectives on trump and politics in america i was surprised that sikhs would look favorably on trump given the things he stands for and would be completely at odds with r the donald since it is pretty clear to anyone who even so much as looks at their top posts that they are completely fueled by hatred https www reddit com r the donald comments 5qlzqi late night crew 01282017 exteme vetting btfo ref search posts i got some interesting replies about the religion and the mods implied in what they told me that they would challenge the donald on some of their hateful rhetoric https www reddit com r the donald comments 4swulp this cancer called islam needs radiation therapy after reading the ama it clear that that just bullshit now i come here to see what sikhs thought of it and you are saying that it was great and pretending that talking about cuck tears is not pandering while praising t d for being an open sub of discussion full of kind welcoming friendly people it been interesting learning experience and i am sure you have attracted a lot of new alt right folks to your sub and maybe even one or two to your religion but as a non sikh i am not left with an overall more positive view of the sikh community just based on the answers and conduct in the ama then again i am sure the religion does not welcome salty cucks anyway so i guess no loss there eta you reap what you sow https www reddit com r the donald comments 63s6i9 i asked for a dad joke from the guys at the sikh it great to see that they have been so educated about sikhi that comments like these are now upvoted on that thread i remember my indian friend when i was middle school his family was fucking awesome his

rstcp, why are you against discussion obviously i am not against discussion i am saying open discussion is impossible in a forum like t d where any form of dissent is censored and anyone who does not rally behind trump and his ideas is swiftly banned going into a sub like that which glorifies a leader who embodies many of the things that seem antithetical to some of the very core tenets of sikhi could be interesting if discussion were possible but since it is not it quite clear that t d would just continue to leverage such an ama to achieve what they have been doing every time sikhs are discussed on that sub to paint them as an ally in the fight against islam in your words if you please is that alright or do i need to make it simpler still ,14,Sikh
rstcp,i was just linked to a thread on this sub about this ama from 3 months ago and u skeptic54 says it better there than i could https www reddit com r sikh comments 5jy2va sikhi religion has been noticed on rthe donald dbk09it i would ask anyone who decides to participate in this to be extremely careful trump supporters like using our history as a kind of backdrop excuse to discredit islam while we are not muslims and our history must of course be remembered we should bear in mind that fundamentally we are being used to vilify another religion in my experience with the edl in the uk who do things similar to this the same ones who would praise sikhs for standing up to big ol bad islam are often the same ones who would and often do attack us and our families in the streets im not saying that sikhs cannot get along with trump supporters im saying that we shouldnt get carried away with flattery trump doesnt like or dislike sikhs it just occasionally praising us lines up with the overall narrative he pushing right now if that changed tomorrow youd get the same people talking about how we carry daggers and are practically a violent cult the truth of gurbani is eternal whether the politicians like it or not ,17,Sikh

rstcp, maar ook afrika trevor noah heeft daar een interessant en later ook hilarisch hoofdstuk over in zijn boek born a crime hitler although an unusual name is not unheard of in south africa part of it has to do with the way a lot of black people pick names black people choose their traditional names with great care those are the names that have deeply personal meanings but from colonial times through the days of apartheid black people in south africa were required to have an english or european name as well a name that white people could pronounce basically so you had your english name your traditional name and your last name patricia nombuyiselo noah nine times out of ten your european name was chosen at random plucked from the bible or taken from a hollywood celebrity or a famous politician in the news i know guys named after mussolini and napoleon and of course hitler westerners are shocked and confused by that but really it s a case of the west reaping what it has sown the colonial powers carved up africa put the black man to work and did not properly educate him white people don t talk to black people so why would black people know what s going on in the white man s world because of that many black people in south africa don t really know who hitler was my own grandfather thought a hitler was a kind of army tank that was helping the germans win the war because that s what he took from what he heard on the news for many black south africans the story of the war was that there was someone called hitler and he was the reason the allies were losing the war this hitler was so powerful that at some point black people had to go help white people fight against him and if the white man has to stoop to ask the black man for help fighting someone that someone must be the toughest guy of all time so if you want your dog to be tough you name your dog hitler if you want your kid to be tough you name your kid hitler there s a good chance you ve got an uncle named hitler it s just a thing at sandringham we were taught more about world war ii than the typical black kids in the townships were but only in a basic way we weren t taught to think critically about hitler and anti semitism and the holocaust we weren t taught for instance that the architects of apartheid were big fans of hitler that the racist policies they put in place were inspired in part by the racist policies of the third reich we weren t taught how to think about how hitler related to the world we lived in we weren t being taught to think period all we were taught was that in 1939 hitler invaded poland and in 1941 he invaded the soviet union and in 1943 he did something else they re just facts memorize them write them down for the test and forget them there is also this to consider the name hitler does not offend a black south african because hitler is not the worst thing a black south african can imagine every country thinks their history is the most important and that s especially true in the west but if black south africans could go back in time and kill one person cecil rhodes would come up before hitler if people in the congo could go back in time and kill one person belgium s king leopold would come way before hitler if native americans could go back in time andkill one person it would probably be christopher columbus or andrew jackson i often meet people in the west who insist that the holocaust was the worst atrocity in human history without question yes it was horrific but i often wonder with african atrocities like in the congo how horrific were they the thing africans don t have that jewish people do have is documentation the nazis kept meticulous records took pictures made films and that s really what it comes down to holocaust victims count because hitler counted them six million people killed we can all look at that number and rightly be horrified but when you read through the history of atrocities against africans there are no numbers only guesses it s harder to be horrified by a guess when portugal and belgium were plundering angola and the congo they weren t counting the black people they slaughtered how many black people died harvesting rubber in the congo in the gold and diamond mines of the transvaal so in europe and america yes hitler is the greatest madman in history in africa he s just another strongman from the history books in all my time hanging out with hitler i never once asked myself why is his name hitler his name was hitler because his mom named him hitler ,46,thenetherlands
rstcp,alright thank you there seems to be an interesting and long sikh history i will have to look into one day i agree with your point about engagement but i would just caution that it seems quite clear that r the donald is not a place of or for engagement dissenters are banned and their comments scrubbed and only full on trump zealots are tolerated you can go in there with a range of views and question and confront them but in the end all that will be visible after the mods clear the path are the comments that help sustain the narrative that the based sikhs hate muslims just like us it very hard to not become a tool for someone propaganda when they control your voice ,2,Sikh
rstcp, along with this i think we should also consider why the 6th guru befriended jahangir and the 10th guru was ready to associate with aurengzeb were jahangir and aurengzeb gursikhs embodying sikh ideals to the highest degree do we really think trump is worse than jahangir and aurengzeb could there possibly be another reason the gurus may have found it prudent to engage with them i am very much out of my depth here but it sounds interesting could you give an elins explain like i am a non sikh what i am getting from your last bit is that it is good to engage with people who do not conform to your ideals that understandable following them and considering yourself a supporter is a different matter altogether is it not ,6,Sikh
rstcp,alright thank you for so nicely answering a stranger pointed questions about your own affairs that does seem to represent the sikhism i know again i understand that it not really my place to question your decisions but it piqued my curiosity i will surely tune in to find out and i hope you do not come to regret the decision or have to deal with too much of a backlash since i was banned long ago from t d for posting a link to a unhcr page and since there surely wo not be any critical questions allowed on the ama i would like to just ask one question here to any sikh trump supporters when i look at the 5 treasures or virtues a sikh should abide by compassion https www youtube com watch v p 9ycsaw9tc daya truth http www politifact com personalities donald trump statements byruling pants fire sat contentment https www youtube com watch v wof03zaueme santokh humility http ww3 hdnux com photos 43 12 16 9216906 9 920x920 jpg nimrata and love https www youtube com watch v bq2zibez xw pyar i cannot help but think trump displays the very opposite of each of these virtues on an almost daily basis why if you care about being a sikh would you follow a man who seems to embody the opposite of some core tenets of your belief ,5,Sikh
rstcp, edit regarding the edited portion of your post the mods are aware of what could possibly happen by doing the ama most of the active mods have expressed that the positives outweigh the negatives and that they would be willing to put in more work to clean up any potential spam trolling fair enough that their call i am not even a subscriber so i do not have any right to question them i just thought it was odd that they would do so without even informing this sub so i posted the link here ,3,Sikh
rstcp,that why i said the mods that participate in that ama if those mods are indeed big trump fans they still participate as mods of r sikh and represent the subscribers to be clear i am not a regular or even subscriber here or in t d in fact i am not even sikh i just know some american sikhs and they hate trump with a passion edit disagree strongly is probably a better phrasing i saw the sticky on r t d and was surprised that there would be any significant overlap between the two subs and even more surprised there was not anything here informing the subscribers that their mods are doing this i am also curious to find out if my perception of the sikh community and principles as generally opposed to trump and what he stands for is flawed or if the mods are a good representation of sikhs after all ,6,Sikh
rstcp,then i will look forward to seeing them banned from r the donald within minutes tomorrow i mean seriously have you seen the people that do ama there and the way the sub deals with dissent either the mods that participate in that ama are full throated trump supporters or this sub will be brigaded by a the donald army screaming cucks soon after they find out that the mods are not true believers seems like a bad idea either way ,62,Sikh

rstcp,i hear ya i know where you are coming from exactly i have been there but for me it has been a life saver at times going on tinder and just finding someone anyone to go and do something with can be a good first step in fighting the self constructed isolation as long as you do not put such huge expectations on it and see it as an exercise in getting out of your comfort zone rather than a desperate search for a life partner i always looked for matches who seemed empathetic and not super social themselves meet up to do some activity like going to a museum for a walk in a park or a cheap concert and you wo not have to talk much about yourself you will be surprised how many people of your preferred sex are not so different from yourself and just looking for that bit of human interaction do it just for the sake of the experience set zero expectations except going to see that exhibition and see it as a potential opportunity to talk openly and honestly with a stranger you never have to see ever again ,2,depression

rstcp,i know we are all just laughing at the jingoistic idiots over on t d but this kind of revisionism is not a whole lot better is not america the only country that had to fight a war to end slavery the haitian revolution comes to mind as the most obvious other example it was a brutal but effective war some say even a genocide with the explicit goal of ending slavery it shook the entire caribbean and the imperial core in europe and without it i doubt slavery would have ended quite so quickly throughout the region in the caribbean and the guyanas slaves followed the haitian lead and fought sustained rebellions that the reason why it eventually made sense to say hey we should stop this slavery business it started to affect the bottom line in suriname for instance slavery was only abolished in 1863 after too many rebellions and run away slaves made it more profitable to simply import labour from indonesia and china to work as contract workers for a small wage in many other latin american countries abolitionism was born out of war even if those wars were not always fought over slavery simon bolivar the liberator of many south american countries from the spanish empire realized the strategic importance of black soldiers in the fight for independence and declared the abolition of slavery in 1812 and again in 1816 after promising haitian president alexandre p tion that he would secure freedom for slaves in return for haitian military aid slavery ended in uruguay because during the uruguayan civil war both the blancos and the colorados had abolished slavery in order to mobilize the former slaves to reinforce their respective military forces i would argue that a lot of the armed struggles against colonialism in africa and asia were also effectively about ending slavery it just that the type of slavery was not always quite as visible as the american form less debatably well into the 20th century there were sustained conflicts between native congolese and the belgian force publique which were essentially wars over slavery https en wikipedia org wiki batetela rebellion ,4,TopMindsOfReddit

rstcp,i mean they were relaying their personal experiences rather than assuming he was lying i imagine the very high levels of testosterone made him view interactions as more aggressive than they really were testosterone is a powerful hormone so i would not be surprised if it made you read very different things into social interactions that looked like nothing from the outside ,24,ThisAmericanLife
rstcp, but that dude was clearly depressed and projecting like hell the lack of testosterone probably caused that depression but that does not mean they are the same thing what makes you say that he did not mention a lot of the symptoms of depression like feeling sad anxious hopeless worthless helpless guilty or irritable in fact he said he felt quite content but he just had extremely low levels of motivation and energy along with the sexual symptoms low libido erectile dysfunction the symptoms he mentioned seem to fit exactly with the symptoms of having very low testosterone levels the only other diagnosis that fits would be that he was experiencing the negative symptoms of schizophrenia 1 apathy the person may have a lack of interest in activities that previously were important to them they may be reluctant to leave the house or even their bedroom and may lie in bed for the larger part of the day 2 absent blunted or incongruous emotional responses 3 reductions in speech 4 social withdrawal avolition 5 impaired attention 6 anhedonia this describes an inability to experience pleasure people with schizophrenia who experience this often describe life as being grey or empty devoid of the normal emotional ups and downs that we all take for granted 7 sexual problems 8 lethargy people with schizophrenia experiencing negative symptoms will often have a profound lack of energy and find it difficult to do any more than light activity this may lead to them spending a large part of the day in bed or watching television but since he told us that he was diagnosed with very low t and since the cure was to reverse the low t it seems a pretty obvious case depression is not just something you can pick up for a few weeks without most of the negative symptoms and then lose it when you get higher testosterone levels i am not a psychologist but i do not think it makes sense to jump to depression like that ,4,ThisAmericanLife

rstcp,klopt maar dat is wel uniek van nederland en het zorgt er voor dat de vrouwen die w l 40 uur willen werken en carri re willen maken gezien worden als te ambitieus te bedreigend en er wordt vaak van uit gegaan dat ze uiteindelijk toch een stapje terug doen mijn vriendin werkt bij een redelijk technische multinational buiten de randstad en daar is ze zo n beetje de enige ook nog eens buitenlandse vrouw iig op haar afdeling die fulltime werkt wil geen kinderen maar iedereen gaat er van uit dat ze ze heeft of wil hebben dat werkt behoorlijk vermoeiend omdat je elke dag weer moet bewijzen dat je net zoveel recht hebt om daar te zijn de meeste medewerkers zijn niet openlijk seksistisch maar juist daardoor vraag je je vaak af of je wordt afgerekend op je werk of dat je sekse ook meetelt dan wordt de druk om minder te werken of je ambities naar beneden te stellen al snel heel zwaar al heel ver beneden de absolute top zelf heb ik toevallig eens precies het tegenovergestelde meegemaakt toen ik bij een ngo werkte waar de meerderheid vrouwen waren en ik de enige blanke man was ik merkte dat er misschien wel meer en sowieso niet minder serieus naar mij werd geluisterd ,5,thenetherlands

rstcp, veel partijen zoals het cda en de sp aarzelden of zij dit keer wel moesten meedoen aan de doorrekeningen er is toenemende kritiek op de modelwerkelijkheid van het cpb het planbureau zou te rigide zijn louter oog hebben voor economische parameters en te weinig voor andere aspecten van de kwaliteit van de samenleving toen jesse klaver werd aangesteld als nieuwe fractieleider van groenlinks en later als lijsttrekker voor de komende verkiezingen presenteerde hij een nieuw woord in nederland economisme dit sloeg volgens klaver op de doorgeslagen fixatie op cijfers voorspellingen en berekeningen waar veel van het economische en financi le beleid van nederlandse regeringen op gebaseerd is spil hierin is het centraal planbureau cpb was de partij voor de dieren ooit de enige die principieel weigerde haar programma te laten doorrekenen dit jaar doen ook 50plus en pvv niet mee maar ook andere partijen morren begin vorig jaar polste de sp groenlinks d66 en cda of het niet tijd werd ermee te stoppen de sp wilde een boycot en probeerde daarvoor medestanders te werven in geen geval wilde de partij alleen komen te staan roemer zou anders tijdens de debatten worden afgedroogd de vrees om niet serieus te worden genomen was echter zo groot dat de een na de ander afhaakte ook de sp is uiteindelijk gezwicht dat is waarom het laf is om wel mee te doen de sp gl en cda weten dat het een slecht idee is maar ze weten ook dat de cijfers te serieus genomen worden dus verzinnen ze een leuke manier om hun programma in cijfers te vatten leveren ze het netjes aan en pikken ze de leuke resultaten er uit net als alle andere partijen daarom is het lef om het niet te doen het is een stuk moeilijker uit te leggen wat ook blijkt uit het feit dat je schijnbaar afhaakt zonder echt door te lezen en in te gaan op mijn argumenten en dus wordt je er eerder voor afgestraft toch doen ze het omdat ze principes hebben ,1,thenetherlands
rstcp, maar dat wil nog niet zeggen dat als de verzorgingsstaat op het amerikaanse niveau was ze ook hadden bezuinigd misschien dat vvd wel ongeveer hetzelfde niveau verzorgingsstaat nastreeft als de democraten en dat die in de vs te zwak was en in nederland te sterk daar heb je wel een punt het is heel lastig om ze met elkaar te vergelijken maar qua einddoel ideale overheid zal de vvd dichter bij de democrats uitkomen ,2,thenetherlands

rstcp,nja zo werkt het niet helemaal ik heb jarenlang in de west kaap gewoond en noah boek gelezen en het ligt net iets anders de coloureds zijn inderdaad would eels zwart en wit maar veel van hun voorouders komen ook uit maleisie voc slaven verder is zwart nogal een ruim begrip omdat de bantus die tegenwoordig de overgrote meerderheid van de zwarte bevolking uitmaken genetisch totaal verschillend van de khoisan die tegenwoordig bijna uitgestorven zijn maar die wel deel uit maken van de mix van voorouders van de coloureds tegen de tijd dat apartheid werd ingesteld en verhoudingen tussen verschillende rassen verboden waren waren coloureds tot een apart ras geworden anders dan zwart wit of een mix van zwart en wit je bent alleen coloured als beide ouders coloured zijn noah vertelt in zijn boek dat er maar een handvol echt half zwart en half witte zuid afrikanen zijn geboren omdat het verboden was de overgrote meerderheid van de gemengde koppels zijn naar het buitenland gevlucht hijkende niemand in za die net als hij half zwart en wit was en er was dus eigenlijk geen naam voor mensen zoals hij hij lijkt dus op coloureds maar hij is het niet omdat geen van zijn ouders coloured is geloof me dat niemand in za hem serieus een coloured zou noemen hij is een xhosa met een witte vader ,4,thenetherlands

rstcp, ik ben afgestudeerd op een analyse van 25 jaar geschiedenisleerboeken voor het nederlands onderwijs de kwaliteit daarvan is al 25 jaar een inhoudelijke bende het gevolg van slappe consensus politieke desinteresse en een poldergijzeling van het geschiedenisonderwijs door docenten en historici er zit geen rode draad in het waait mee met de winden van het heden er zit geen onderliggend idee in voor de toekomst dit lijkt me wel heel interessant om een keer te lezen ik heb zelf in nl aan een internationale school het meeste geschiedenis gehad en daar was het european history https en wikibooks org wiki ib european history waarbinnen een heleboel onderwerpen die je aangeeft juist werden benadrukt daarna aan een buitenlandse uni afgestudeerd op geschiedenis maar sindsdien en vooral tijdens deze verkiezingsperiode vraag ik me vaak af wat ik nou eigenlijk gemist heb aan nl geschiedenis en ik ben ook wel benieuwd wat de geschiedenislessen op de middelbare school nou voor invloed hebben op het werled en nederlandbeeld van nederlanders want ik begrijp ook steeds minder van de nl identiteit discussie als je een scriptie oid hebt die je zou willen delen zou ik dat heel graag willen lezen ,3,thenetherlands
rstcp, moeten houden dat blijft een politieke keuze en als het aan de vvd lag zouden ze daar nog verder in gegaan dan strict noodzakelijk ,2,thenetherlands
rstcp,er zijn meerdere partijen die op verschillende manieren het cpb de rug toe keren de pvv heeft geen programma heeft geen visie op de economie en maakt alles ondergeschikt aan angst voor de islam ze vinden het cpb waarschijnlijk net als alle andere instanties een linkse elite die ze een hak zet natuurlijk zou ik dat ook niet accepteren de pvdd maakt een onderbouwde keuze om het cpb niet hun programma te laten doorrekenen en die keuze vind ik gerechtvaardigd het heeft niets met angst te maken ze zouden er heel goed vanaf kunnen komen als ze net als zoveel andere partijen hun plannen creatief in cijfers zouden vertalen die heel een heel leuk plaatje kunnen laten zien praat in je programma over het radicaal aanpakken van klimaatverandering maar vertel het cpb dat je de kosten van die plannen allemaal toevallig precies een dag na het moment dat het cpb meeneemt in de begrotingscijders op je zal nemen dat soort trucjes gebruikt iedere partij ze hebben in tegenstelling tot de pvv wel een heel uitgebreid economisch verhaal en onderdeel van dat verhaal is de kritiek op de centraliteit van kortzichtige oppervlakkige indicatoren die zoals zij het noemen een chijnzekerheid bieden over de toekomst en een heel belangrijk deel van de welvaart onbetaalde arbeid vervuiling klimaat etc en van de structurele risicofactoren banken die too big too fail blijven zeepbellen op de huizenmarkt investeringen van pensioenfondsen compleet buiten beschouwing laten door het door te laten rekenen help je dan om deze visie op de economie te legitimiseren door als enige serieuze partij er luid voor te kiezen dit niet te laten doorrekenen krijg je aandacht om uit te leggen wat er mis is met het huidige politieke discours en wat de grote onzichtbare risicofactoren en mogelijkheden zijn binnen de economie je hoeft niet ver terug te kijken in het verleden of over de grens om te zien wat daar de gevolgen van kunnen zijn op de vooravond van de global financial crisis was dit de voorspelling van het cpb let op tot op een fractie na de komma gegeven deze onzekerheden zijn de vooruitzichten op korte termijn voor de nederlandse economie gunstig na het voorzichtige en aanvankelijk haperende herstel van de conjunctuur in 2004 2005 is de economische groei vorig jaar op 3 uitgekomen ruim boven de geschatte potenti le groei ondersteund door een krachtige economische groei elders in de wereld en de sinds 2006 weer toenemende koopkracht worden ook voor dit en volgend jaar mooie groeicijfers verwacht te weten van 2 in beide jaren de voorspelling over amerika door de gematigder groei van de binnenlandse bestedingen zwakt de bbp groei in 2007 naar verwachting af tot 2 daarmee is de groei voor het eerst sinds 2003 lager dan de potenti le groei in 2008 kan de economische groei naar verwachting wat oplopen doordat de correctie op de woningmarkt dan achter de rug zal zijn de economische ontwikkeling elders in de wereld gunstig blijft en het amerikaanse monetaire beleid minder restrictief zal zijn natuurlijk kan een economische voorspelling er een keertje naast zitten maar dit is wel disproportioneel slecht nog erger is dat ze niet geleerd schijnen te hebben van hun fouten omdat dezelfde structurele risico bij de berekeningen van de invloed van partijprogramma op de economie niet eens ter sprake komen een partij zoals pvdd die hard inzet op het verlagen van deze risico zal in de cijfertjes eerder afgerekend worden dan beloond worden voor iets wat veel economen zien als hoognodige maar voor de bankensector pijnlijke hervormingen die risico op een herhaling van de bankencrisis verkleinen dus als het over ontwijken gaat heb ik juist het gevoel dat alle andere partijen de belangrijke economische gevaren en trends ontwijken als je het cpb ziet als een paar oogkleppen is het niet lafheid maar lefheid is dat een woord om ze niet net als al die andere partijen op te zetten ,2,thenetherlands
rstcp,dan heb ik het verkeerd verwoord het cpb is terecht altijd heel voorzichtig met conclusies dat moet ook wel als je bijvoorbeeld hun prognoses van 2006 leest over de periode 2007 2011 zoals ik zei heeft hun analyse best een plaats in een discussie over een nauw onderwerp binnen de economie ik vind nog steeds dat hun modellen grote fouten hebben maar dat kan je over elke economische analyse stellen het probleem ligt inderdaad bij veel van de media die in interviews en artikelen gemakshalve economie reduceren tot een paar indicatoren van het cpb maar ook zeker bij de politiek heel veel politici kiezen ervoor om makkelijk punten te scoren met kortzichtige plannen gestaafd met vrijwel nutteloze cijfers van het cpb in plaats van de grotere structurele en lange termijn problemen te benoemen en aan te pakken ,3,thenetherlands
rstcp,ik had geen idee dat hij daar heeft gezeten grappig zijn wat meer ontspannen stijl spreekt me ook veel meer aan dan dat schreeuwende grijnzende hoooly shit gedoe van last week tonight misschien heeft hij dat hier mede ontwikkeld ,1,thenetherlands
rstcp,helemaal mee eens en toch als de molukse treinkaping vandaag plaats zou vinden zouden de internationale en nederlandse reacties en gevolgen behoorlijk anders zijn ben ik bang ,3,thenetherlands
rstcp,ok rustig volgens mij zijn we het meer eens dan oneens mijn punt is niet dat het cpb afhankelijk is maar dat het t centraal staat in de verkiezingen ik vind het prima dat ze bestaan en dat ze programma doorrekenen hun cijfers hebben als ze in de juiste context worden geplaatst en als de limieten van hun analyse serieus wordt genomen en als er duidelijke wederhoor is een bescheiden plaats in de discussie over specifieke gevolgen van specifieke plannen ik weet ook wel dat er nog meer onafhankelijke economen zijn die programma doorrekenen het is alleen bizar en tekenend dat er mensen zijn die cpb analyses verplicht willen stellen en partijen willen forceren om hun programma te laten opstellen door het cpb het politieke debat over de economie wordt zo gereduceerd tot een paar vage indicatoren op de korte termijn hoe het zo gekomen is komt imho doordat veel politici en journalisten de cpb projecties klakkeloos overnemen en centraal stellen als waarheid la onder de vvd zal de groei in 2021 toenemen met 2 3 het enige waar ik voor pleit is dat de journalistiek wat minder lui wordt en zich wat kritischer opstelt tegenover het plan bureau dat andere economen naast het eveneens onafhankelijke cpb meer gehoord worden en dat er in het politieke debat meer ruimte komt voor een discussie over de economie die breder is dan de kortzichtige projecties over middel lange termijn werkgelegenheid koopkracht groei enz en meer ruimte voor andere structurele toekomstige aspecten van de wereld economie want dat is veel interessanter je hoeft echt geen engelen te heten om het daar mee eens te zijn neem bijvoorbeeld deze kritiek over n van de belangrijkste cijfers die ook het cpb nog steeds gebruikt om groei te meten waarbij economische groei automatisch als positief wordt gezien en centraal komt te staan in de analyses van de politieke partij programma a nation well being depends on many factors ignored by gdp such as leisure time income inequality and the quality of the environment gdp was developed primarily as a planning tool to guide the huge production effort of the second world war it was never intended to be the definitive yardstick of economic welfare this approach has distorted our view of society and the economy ever since wash your own windows and gdp is unaffected employ a window cleaner and output is boosted smash your car on the highway and the costs of repairing it add to gdp the production of cigarettes that cause lung cancer and handguns that are used in murders are also counted as a positive in gdp terms gdp should ideally be reduced to take account of pollution and the using up of non renewable resources longer holidays and shorter working hours increase an individual well being yet conventional national accounts completely overlook such benefits gdp measures only output and makes no claims on the quality of that output let alone on subjective concepts such as social progress or human happiness it does what it was intended to do offer a value of marketed goods and services produced in a country in a given time frame and does it reasonably well politicians have increasingly come to rely on this measure as a singular tool for calibrating public policy this is a mistake we should take better account of non market production like household work that affects the economy economists are generally converging on the idea that some measurement of environmental impact could be added to gdp the current system doesn t account for pollution the depletion of natural resources or the economic benefits nature can provide bron n of andere hippie denktank partij voor de dieren nee dit komt gewoon uit artikelen in the economist tien jaar geleden en bloomberg misschien wel de meest mainstream neo liberale outlets die er zijn https www bloomberg com view articles 2013 01 30 gdp an imperfect measure of progress http www economist com node 5504103 ,3,thenetherlands
rstcp,het opmerkelijke aan de kaping is dat de molukse gemeenschap er echt op vooruit is gegaan omdat de politiek het terecht zag zonder het goed te keuren als een desperate noodkreet van een specifieke groep met hun eigen belangen angsten en doelen als een soortgelijke gewelddadige actie tegenwoordig plaats zou vinden zou het onmiddellijk gezien worden als islamitisch extremisme en direct escaleren ,6,thenetherlands
rstcp,berekeningen van 1 economisch bureau niet alleen verplicht stellen maar ze ook de macht geven om programma aan te laten passen zodat ze beter passen in het cpb model is echt te gek voor woorden ik zou veel liever zien dat er meerdere onafhankelijke economen naar programma keken en serieus genomen werden want n enkele instantie heeft altijd hun eigen ideologische wereldbeeld en vertekende aannames de geveinsde neutraliteit slaat elke discussie over economie dood net als in andere sociale wetenschappen zijn de tegenstellingen en discussies tussen de experts belangrijker dan het verheffen van n groep economen tot de arbiters van de politiek ,3,thenetherlands

rstcp,het is een verloren strijd tenzij ook cda buiten een coalitie wordt gehouden gl vvd cu d66 pvda en vvd ineens ontdekt dat ze toch een heel ander soort partij zouden kunnen zijn op letterlijk elk thema van enig belang staan gl en vvd zo ontzettend ver van elkaar af dat het gewoon niet gaat lukken https www partijgedrag nl partijgelijkenis php ik denk dat ze het beste kunnen hopen op een zwak kabinet dat zoekt naar meerderheden zodat ze met de andere groene partijen als een blok kunnen onderhandelen om toch wat voor elkaar te krijgen ,1,thenetherlands
rstcp, ja maar komop de systematische fout in deze aanpak is dat stel dat er toevallig gewoon veel voorstellen komen over een thema waar ze het niet eens zijn en weinig over een thema waar ze het wel eens zijn kijk dan hier maar uitgesplitst per thema vertel me op welk thema gl en vvd ook maar meer dan 50 overeenkomst hebben https www partijgedrag nl partijgelijkenis php dingen als het homohuwelijk of geslachtsregistratie zijn in n keer gedaan of niet vandaar en daar zijn gl en vvd het vooral over eens met elkaar nogmaals die zijn al klaar dat zijn niet het soort overeenkomsten waar je iets aan hebt in een kabinet wat wil je een ministerie voor het blijvend erkennen van het homohuwelijk die partijen zijn ook voor het opzeggen van geslachtsregistratie bijvoorbeeld dit is gewoon een simpel wetsvoorstel dat je door de kamer kan jassen niet een basis voor een coalitie prostitutie laten blijven bestaan opnieuw dit is heel erg breed alle niet christelijke partijen zijn het hier over eens en opnieuw hoe is dit een basis voor een regeerakkoord de status quo over marginale onderwerpen staat toch niet ter discussie en wel andere dingen die wel spelen en die vind ik allemaal net iets belangrijker dan de hoogte van de bijstand en wie hoeveel belasting gaat betalen zoals kijk eens naar dat overzicht als je op onderwijs wetenschap infrastuctuur buitenlands beleid economie sociale zekerheid klimaat en milieu migratie huisvesting financien lanbouw enz enz enz diametraal tegenover elkaar staat gaat overeenkomst over een standpunt over nog verdere uitbreiding van de al bestaande euthanasiewet je niet helpen in de onderhandelingen tuurlijk als gl in de coalitie wil komen zullen ze water bij de wijn moeten doen over klimaat omdat ze daarover de meest extreme partij zijn het is de kern van hun partij daar kunnen ze niet heel veel wijn bij de water doen en het is maar 1 van de 12 thema waar beiden een compromis moeten sluiten gaat niet gebeuren als er een vvd d66 gl nog wat anders kabinet komt dan komt er waarschijnlijk een einde aan geslachtsregistratie en recht op zelfdoding want dat zijn dingen waar die drie partijen niet over hoeven te onderhandelen je zal sowieso het cda nodig hebben en die gaat niet akkoord dus wordt het een kwestie voor de tweede kamer dus heb je er geen coalitie voor nodig ,2,thenetherlands
rstcp, moderate and friendly haha he called mohamed a pedophile and ranted about the fifth column of islam infecting nl if that moderate i do not want to see extreme ,8,europe
rstcp,ja dat zou me niks verbazen de meeste stemmers verdiepen zich niet zo in programma en rutte klinkt als hij z n best doet net zo degelijk als klaver als het gaat om een coalitie is het gewoon compleet onmogelijk op elk terrein staan ze super ver van elkaar af volgens dit overzicht https www partijgedrag nl partijgelijkenis php is er niet 1 terrein waar er uberhaupt meer dan 50 overeenkomst is daar kom je niet heel ver mee ,3,thenetherlands
rstcp,een coalitie waarin vvd en cda de meerderheid vormen zal niet groen worden dus bij groenrechts denk ik dan aan vvd d66 gl cu aangevuld met pvda of pvdd ,1,thenetherlands
rstcp,immigratie klimaat sociale voorzieningen zorg infrastructuur ontwikkelingshulp defensie drugs milieu belastingen nivelleren privacy onderwijs vluchtelingen immigratie integratie op practisch elk belangrijk onderwerp staan ze heel ver van elkaar af gaat niet gebeuren jongens ,7,thenetherlands
rstcp, vvd en gl hebben vrij veel met elkaar gemeen https www partijgedrag nl partijgelijkenis php 37 overeenkomst in gelijknis obv stemgedrag in tk de enige 2 partijencombinaties die nog minder gelijk scoren zijn vvd en pvdd en vvd en sp en dan heb ik het niet over welke partijen ver af staan van de vvd maar welke partijen het verst af staan in de hele kamer sgp en pvdd hebben nog meer overeenkomsten dan vvd en gl als je fluctueert tussen die 2 partijen dan heb je sinds halsema paars i niet helemaal goed opgelet gl is veel linkser geworden vvd veel conservatiever en rechtser zoals hoeveel je van homotjes houdt dat is toch totaal niet relevant meer in 2017 wat voor wetgeving zou er nog zijn waar partijen elkaar over zouden uitsluiten zelfs de christenunie is niet tegen het homohuwelijk meer ik ben voor splijtingsenerige met meer onderzoek naar fusie om dat te doen dat is leuk maar met een dure gok kom je er niet de klimaatmaatregelen klimaatregelen van gl zijn duur en ingrijpend en daar gaan ze weinig op ingeven vvd vind het allemaal wel prima zo middenweg is heel ver weg en dat is nog maar 1 thema buiten arbeidswetgeving kan ik niet 1 thema vinden waar ze niet mijlenver uit elkaar staan ,11,thenetherlands
rstcp, een verhoging van de uitgaven aan ontwikkelingshulp heel nipt 76 om 74 maar correct sluiting van kolencentrales daar zijn meer partijen tegen dan voor volgens de tabel geen verhoging van de uitgaven aan defensie naar de navo norm maar wel een verhoging afschaffen verhuurdersheffing meer goedkope huurwoningen geen meerderheid meer partijen tegen ,2,thenetherlands
rstcp,sowieso onder voorbehoud denk ik als gl in het kabinet stapt kan ik me best voorstellen dat iets hogere belasting op vlees en hoge inkomens als compromis wordt aangenomen door de anderen ,0,thenetherlands
rstcp, you are conflating correlation and causation as noted earlier in the thread ah forget it,2,dataisbeautiful
rstcp,phew zou erg sneu zijn als ze weer net een paar stemmen te kort hadden voor een extra zetel ,1,thenetherlands
rstcp,thank you seriously how is it this hard to grasp what a causal link is,2,dataisbeautiful
rstcp,if you only define the size of the military in terms of people and not capabilities material projected force etc etc sure in that case nk is bigger than the us there is still a causal link between expenditure and size because each soldier costs money so more soldiers higher exp size,2,dataisbeautiful
rstcp,50 of pvdd krijgt n zetel meer of minder afhankelijk van die uitslag,6,thenetherlands
rstcp,ze hebben niet gewonnen ze hebben verloren maar de grootste partij heeft nog meer verloren daarbij is niet elk persoon even veel geraakt door de aardbevingen en weinig mensen buiten het epicentrum stemmen alleen daarover zelf merk ik in het zuiden van de stad weinig tot niks van de aardbevingen en alle rijkelui in haren al helemaal niet ,1,thenetherlands
rstcp,yeah no shit obviously there a causal link between expenditure and the size of the military though come on,5,dataisbeautiful
rstcp,29 is not that old ,7,Tinder
rstcp,no causal link whatsoever come on you mean they are not equivalent,6,dataisbeautiful
rstcp,nogmaals 85 stemt daar niet op vvd een vvd gaat juist achteruit links is gewoon versplinterd,11,thenetherlands
rstcp,of zoals d66 dat zelf deed toen ze de laatste keer in een kabinet met cda en vvd stapten https www nrc nl nieuws 2006 10 17 nu heeft d66 weer nul zetels 11211657 a425017 amp,4,thenetherlands
rstcp,de partij die de premier levert krijgt meestal een premiersbonus het zijn eigenlijk altijd de junior partners die kapot gaan tenzij er een grote economische crisis komt,1,thenetherlands
rstcp,ik stemde altijd groenlinks maar zijn artikelen en inderdaad vooral de kanarie hebben me doen inzien dat die partij en ikzelf te na ef zijn over europa en globalisering mijn eerste persoonlijke eye opener was dat ik zelf had gezien hoe de nl ambassade in een afrikaans ontwikkelingsland gewoon openlijk en schaamteloos de belangen van heineken behartigde maar pas nadat ik meer las over de enorme invloed van en steun voor de banken en multinationals op nl en eu beleid herkende ik de enorme blinde vlek van groenlinks op dat gebied de volgende economische crisis en de huidige ecologische crisis komen steeds sneller steeds dichterbij maar groenlinks zal voor genoeg nieuwe windmolens gezellig meedoen aan een centrum kabinet ,2,thenetherlands
rstcp,hoe kan je liegen over het hebben van populistische idee n lijkt me een beetje contra productief,2,thenetherlands
rstcp,it really is sad groenlinks also absorbed a similar party the evangelische volkspartij ,1,PoliticalDiscussion
rstcp, 16000 is erg veel komt zelden voor ga ik niet op vooruitlopen als het gebeurt neem ik dat zeer serieus klinkt alsof hij het wel wil anders zou hij het uitsluiten thieme moet ook gek zijn om hem niet in de fractie te willen hoe dan ook heeft hij de partij groter gemaakt dit jaar denk dat ik ook maar lid moet worden,3,thenetherlands
