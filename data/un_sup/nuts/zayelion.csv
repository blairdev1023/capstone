zayelion,i have seen it a guy cowboys a central feature he has over 10yrs experience and its turns out to be complete shit the two girls on the team integrating with it lock themselves in an office with a whiteboard and beast mode a fix the guy quits my team comes around i am looking at the code base and sure enough the code was shit where it wasnt one of the women overwriting with proper techniques merit is merit the issue here was more so seniority staying edged in tech is hard and the new guy girl can often best you the thing is both those women are extremely talented and wont be bullied off they are witty and are no bs they can roll most other women after 2yrs move to another roll like testing or admin assistant thats my field report they can do the job but there are very few for reasons explained via redpill ,1,TheRedPill
zayelion,i am going to have to disagree with this js is a terrible language for people that dont learn js and think it is like any other language in the way it is built much like redpill where you limit your attachments and seek understanding to her bizarre behaviors so is javascript douglas crawford talks on the language expound on this much like rollo did hell he even got ran off as a speaker for slut shaming the internet when you learn the difference between a fruit and a gorrilla in a jungle holding a fruit you can write some lean testable maintainable shit fast and then your boss lets you go to the gym in the middle of the day goals man goals 90 functional 10 oop learn it ,2,TheRedPill

zayelion,salvation is just a manual system now like duelingbook basically same feature set ,1,yugioh
zayelion,i usually dont need to they usually lack monsters to knock the card off and make an extra deck play in the first place i then just put the buster back on and kill off the extra deck mosnter ,1,yugioh
zayelion,the optimal opening play of the deck is a dragon in grave and a cyberdark summoned from the hand for that to have the highest odds statistically you need to run them at max additionally 2 more grave sending cards in the form of foolish and dragon shrine this puts the statistics of a good hand over 50 the math says run max ff is at one overload only works if ff goes off or late game same with impact really and they are the only access to cyberdark ness dragon upstart is at one foolish is the preferenced psudo claw cannon but its at one i needed 2 so i ran one shrine to get over 50 rank up 7 only works once per duel else its a dead draw really most importantly i can search and reuse all my one off tech with my extra deck monsters most my space is dedicated to draw cards ,2,yugioh
zayelion, most recently that after fiddling with a calculator that cyberdarks optimal start play with 3 of everything is only 30 adding foolish burial and then dragon shrine puts it over 50 the ocg is more focused on power plays so its a good idea to look to them for spicy tech tcg players are more concerned with consistency nearly obsessed and thats the key tcg pro players have money to travel and create a cycle of promoting their own play styles where as the people supporting them can sell cards sorta like inside trading the last lp is the only one that matters is still fundementally flawed watch your opponent kill themselves by not investing in big boards paleos and zoodiacs regularly over extend true dracoslaying king needs limit to 1 or ban ,1,yugioh
zayelion,dont mill search draw and send milling is carelessness ,1,yugioh
zayelion,http puu sh waimg 567b0ae044 jpg single buster for extra deck lock down no zoodiac paleo plays rank up 7 engine send 71 stack 7th summon c107 rank up to full armor to pop if needed omega to recover 7th one if i draw it not ss and other key cards after they have been exhausted predaplant chimera send to the grave to search future fusion or overload fusion single cyberdark impact for pushes demise for speed and dumping things pulse bomb tech of the week when your opponent goes off chain this and stop them from attacking that turn basically leaves their field vulnerable to horn and keel lost wind over solemns doesnt cost lp has double usage single dimenstional barrier tech for paleo zoodiac and true kings in the side deck overall i have good draw speed a bricked hand is rare but workable even in a tough situation because its defensive i plan on adding bird when its released on ygopro ,7,yugioh
zayelion,with bird and buster with inferno but thats not the point you send omega to grave with claw omega recycles cards you need like future fusion overload fusion cyberdark impact number 71 cyberdarkness dragon raigeki etc ,1,yugioh
zayelion,i remember reading that thats why i said what i said poor guys ,1,runescape
zayelion,ok so i am going to say this because in most the thread im touting the merits of the card thats a fucking wyvern in the artwork its clear cyberdark support but maybe they are releasing a new archetype in this set and its part of it the name the art does not match the effect and stats ,1,yugioh
zayelion,its a toolbox option to fluff out cyberdark cannon you often draw just it and you have to send something from the deck single normal summon for proxy dragon and then topographic firewall vullet load dragon 2500 atk to get over a few things 2500 damage per turn with cyberdark edge thats 31 lp btw 5000 damage potential with horn your opponent has to process limiter removal for game with inferno you can summon a single level 8 synchro one per turn with buster and it in grave you can equip multiple for the effect vs claw and cannon once per turn its a third dragon for enabling dark matter dragon summoned via number 71 and cyberdark claw ,2,yugioh
zayelion,5000 damage to the face is not suppa ass ,1,yugioh
zayelion,you are better off sending rebarian shark over quasar quasar can miss timing and rank up magic the seventh one actually summons the card if you are worried about drawing seventh run zexal or pitch the card use it as a bluff then send psyframe omega to the graveyard to reclaim 7th or do that in reverse to summon zexal either way by the time cyberdark ness dragon comes to the field there is a huge dragon in the grave but with rebarian you can summon and resummon it i find this to be less gimmicky and stressful to your opponent while making multiple uses out of bird here ,1,yugioh
zayelion,it can do rank 3 plays to bring back dragons via number 71 c107 has its negation effect re enabled and its 4500atk ,2,yugioh
zayelion, number 71 rebarian shark special summons a number monster properly summoned from the graveyard cyberdark claw sends 71 to the graveyard allowing setup for rank up magic the 7th one for a early game c10x lets say c107 because synergy if you run 2 71s or sent it back to the extradeck with psyframe omega you can start throwing 3000 4500atk dragons at your opponent one having a very powerful negation effect this is an option not a focus this and buster also very easily make proxy dragon with a normal summon who is a loathsome thing for your opponents extra deck monsters ,1,yugioh
zayelion,its searchable via cyberdark cannon sending it to the graveyard where it needs to be ,1,yugioh
zayelion,this card fixes the fact that you need something send with cyberdark cannon foolish or dragon shrine that wont be a dead draw sometimes you just need to go in for that 5000 damage potential for game or fly for 2500 no one is suggesting run this over cyberdark claw or cannon its an argument of it vs buster or a dragunity if you are maxing out your utility with claw extra deck will be tight honestly i just see this as a fodder game ender card the deck needs to be able to fight no matter the hand and this card helps ,2,yugioh

zayelion, drugs legalize tax regulate tracking so people abusing can get help drug war has statistically failed from the redpill view it incentives the inner city men to to beat out the goverment ablity to take care of women better than they individually can resulting in inner city people regardless of race being locked up more breaking up families the male can then never properly provide the lady then leaves because the male is a deadbeat financially and emotionally because he is never around legalization will reduce inner city gang violence because there will be nothing but human trafficking to fight over for decriminalization legalization because redpills are rational prostitution legalize regulate tax like normal work human trafficking will go up but rapes go in the trash can i think prostitution is one of the last few true feminist issues it being illegal theortically protects both genders women can more easily control men via their lust because they are almost literally useless to a man making over 40k in this country that doesnt want children shes a financial boon thats it it protects men because they dont get as easily cucked stds arent as easily spread we can keep our current college system because most women will just become sugar babies to fun themselves im for it knowing the risk men are happier over all and women cant abuse men forcing them to work in the relationship resulting in more stable relationships decriminalization legalization because egalitarianism mgtow and quicker mass redpill mic its a bad thing but its hard to de institutionalize it tactically set up to create large amounts of jobs in every state practically it benefits all classes because it creates middle class low and high skilled jobs doesnt change the fact that we are selling weapons to terrorist government states dictators and so on bombing innocent civilians so the mic can keep its pockets lines this isnt ethical religiously right or moral we should have an overblown military but it shouldnt be deployed into countries to pick on uneducated defenseless people military service for voting is archaic and stupid that said i think military service should be required to exercise the 2nd amendment right for life you can own a gun if you have been trained to function in a militia you go in you go out you keep your gun like in sweden i regrettably have to say for maintenance against activity the job creation prevents male abuse provides women with good husbands and the second part benefits both because the military gets you ripped and an more masculine generally i think we should defund the military via stopping most external wars on poor countries take the differnce and put it into infastruture spending creates the same amount of jobs and betters the country in a very clear way urbanizing it more this will kill off voters that can make selfish decisions people tend to be ok paying higher taxes when they can see the resulting social benifit like new roads internet cheaper power water and transportation anything where you are not giving out straight cash to people ,2,theredpillright

zayelion,if you didnt understand me i am not changing this tournament this tournament is setup and has been planned for a few months just like you want me to cater to you competitive the casual base wants us to cater to them i am rewarding them first because they actually use the software even after we put in goats newgioh and accurate battlepack they also have helped very politely resolve bugs where as more competitive players have been very rude with the staff so yes there is a basis but we are trying to shift it as more competitive players have joined the staff we are going to do a second tournament with a larger prize that is tcg only and a few hours of development time away from manual game play the online meta is a completely separate meta defined by the sims themselves if you dont like the format then sit it out and wait your turn i heard you ,1,yugioh

zayelion,i mean this with a happy tone a non sarcastic tone but thats the best news i have seen in a while this shows that konami is trying to make duel disk that said one of those systems does sound like ygopro but the filed patent is attached to a card game machine with diagrams that dont describe anything i have seen related to yugioh if the patent stood alone im sure they could sue all card games that have any type of sim specifically heartstone cuz it sounds like yugioh or magic or heartstone or rs new card game it sounds like alot of products but its attached to hardware lets keep researching this im enjoying this conversation ,2,yugioh
zayelion,maybe but i would love to see that for sake of legal precedent ,1,yugioh
zayelion,the creator of ygopro stopped working on it directly around the time devpro was created he does updates very rarely the project has been long forked and developed into various variants years ago with new ones popping up every now and again the source has to be declared illegal which is very unlikely given its history and development i think those two points are mute ,3,yugioh

zayelion,i have always found this stupid and very annoying if anything very distracting when i started going to tournaments initially it seemed to me that my opponent was doing it to gain an edge by annoying me after dueling online almost exclusively and going back to tournament play i learned to understand when my opponent would know what was in my hand and when they placed cards face down based on other psychological markers knowelege of yugioh and the meta use it only when your opponent is staring at your cards rapid hand shuffling is anaglous to a person with a basketball dribbling it oddly before you snatch it in an embarrassing fashion if you do it constantly it gives away the fact that you are nerveous and your opponent can and will use that against you psychologically being very calm is far more intimidating than being a jittery mess im pretty sure some ocd kid that did well at a tournament started it and then everyone joined in thinking it was a technique ,3,yugioh

zayelion,from what i gather everything we see in the manga i dont think ichigo is in any true form a soul reaper up until he has a sword fordge for him by zero squad his powers are basically his own mostly quincy ablities yes they take the form of a shinigami but functionalily they are quincy that massive blast from his sword nothing more than an extremely unrefined arrow or a heilig pfeil rukia equips him with all the basic equipment but the power he wields till he seeks to get his powers back is quincy and even after the mask manifesting is a remnant of whitey and because hallows share a dual nature with shinigami formes the nature of that weapon the power is there unwielded in the form of his mask power upgrade mostly when ichigo did the things to get his powers back the first time he started the process but i dont think he actually finished more so that his qunicy powers kicked in to save him so when his shinigami powers kick in he goes into that hallow form and his swords inner spirit with no device to contain it takes over his body the technique he used to defeat aizen was letzt stil and he lost his quincy powers in the same manner then regained them basically in the same method as uryu not his combat badge is in the shape of a quincy zeichen and he uses it like a quincy cross but not much information is given on spirit weapons seems to be dependent on the users personality and because ichigo identifies as a shinigami he forms a sword so by this logic ichigo true shiki and bankai have not been seen and his sword is just now formed so i feel we will see his shiki his bankai and a volstanding from him ,1,bleach

zayelion,ah you missed the point the card is coded and in a sim now for people that want to test it not that it exist ,4,yugioh
zayelion,link ,2,yugioh
zayelion,thats the one i was thinking about ,2,yugioh
zayelion,something of this nature is a bi monthly occurrence at my job i just roll with it ,2,programminghorror
zayelion,looks like he developed the code else where and copy pasted it in after he got it working the extra space around it is to give him visual room to see what he is focused on programmers arnt robots you know also install fn beautifier if you are concerned about that stuff the poor naming convention is just habit reject his code on commit ,3,programminghorror
zayelion,i have seen a number of these pop up like https github com giuseppedicosola ygoprodeckconverter tree master ygoprodeckconverter and many of the other projects have similiar things ,3,yugioh
zayelion,o o i was just about to post something about snarkychild being back online at salvation devbot source code can be found here https github com iceygo windbot and what i plan to do to increase its intellegence is found here https github com salvationdevelopment windbot issues 1 and what mycard is doing to implement that can be found here https github com mycard windbot ygoproaiscript is the ai programming used by percy it uses a seperate setup and interface which windbot needs to be adapted to use then its a matter of expanding the lua scripts which the community is fairly comfortable doing the main issue is that each archytpe and tech situation needs to be explicitly programmed ,4,yugioh
zayelion,re coding autocorrect we would have to recode ygosharp and ygopro to extract it if available and to act normally other wise ,2,yugioh

zayelion,so i brought salvation back online and im trying to help out other sims i wonder if people even care it keeps me up most night t t,3,yugioh
zayelion,short answer no we are reverting to a place where sims historically have not been bothered and adjusted the sim to the best of functional ability to coincide with the new orders we are very much in a yukuza situation we only seek to do what we see as social good we are currently seeking a license to everything needed but im not sure how to get in contact with the people that i need to to get it rolling any help with this would help the community out not just salvation but the other sims like dn also ,1,yugioh

zayelion,personally what broke me was this image http i imgur com h75cdb7 jpg while it looks abrupt to you there is a soft dying that happens inside the person first where they notice that a teaching is not practiced a hypocrisy in the organization and then guilt the guilt grows till it can no longer be tolerated by the person this isnt something that you can repent from this isnt something you can push out your mind because it is your very own conscience that you have kept sharp by jah asking telling you that if you do the right thing by jw standards you are wrong and if you do the wrong thing by jw you are wrong people try to keep their family so they dont say anything till they snap most people try to fade but if they are in a family like yours its much more difficult the story of the good sumerian and matthews 22 35 40 make it clear that it is not the religion but the actions taking the bible as a whole and understanding its spanning context the message is to just be a good person he could not do that as a jw so he left it falls apart more and more but we are not here to convert you only give you closure and honesty all of here grew tired of living with the guilt ,5,exjw
zayelion,for me it was multi fold my fucking sex drive i couldnt get in line how it was suppose to be unnatural that prevented me from getting dunked my general belief in god waned down over the years cracking point was realizing the hypocrisy of thier hatred of gays final straw was realizing that the bible was just some stories of the time laws of the time and in a specific period context that largely doesnt apply to our time and if taken litterally is toxic combine that with my jw upbringing that all other religions suck because they are not fundementalism then i got stuck in this wierd agnostic atheist place ,1,exjw
zayelion,i grew up in a similar situation if my dad had invested in me spiritually sooner like you are advocating i would have gotten out sooner this is a perfect contract from what i can see jw while i hate to say it here have some things right in exposing the evils of religion in general and explaining fundamentalism the mere exposure of two worlds will tear them away from jw stuff the moment the jw do anything bigoted they will run for the hills have your child and be involved in his her life ,1,exjw
zayelion,it doesnt have anything specific to do with logic because ygo is not to unlike the aforementioned games in how its meta is paced and the ability of a player to stay with the meta it has to do with the show the nature of the game as dictated by the show is completely different from the reality of it its false advertising the main character in most cases uses an un themed or poorly implemented archetype and is shown winning against thought out archetypes with far more consistency and irl only decks styles archetypes like gladiator beast qliphorts and inzectors are not shown there is this subconscious expectation that everyone is running something different and unique and any critique on a player that expresses themselves in an artful manner is seen as an attack on the person even if it is a perfectly logical meta critique of the failings of that deck because this is a purely emotional basis its hard to express because physiologically those lobes of the brain are not connected all of us are thinking it but cant express it usually ,1,yugioh

zayelion,there is alot of planning and debate going into this various opinions on things taking a step back logically none of the groups can put each other in the others shoes and that will have long running sociological effects on the community its not that i cant easily implement something its that half assing it or not putting significant thought into the consequences of my actions will fuck up some kids life or another patrick hoban book people of the mind set of using the sim to test new cards like tcg ocg with tcg ban those from asian countries which will be using the sim in the future will use the ocg ban those focused on preping for locals or a tournament will want pure tcg or ocg for their region and those very into it will want some type of meta filter mechinism which needs to be subjective in a social sense but objective in a testing sense else we get a micro political system that will kill the sim then you get into manual vs automatic for those needs then how judges are suppose to work in this and how much honesty plays a part its a rabbit hole ,2,yugioh

zayelion, 1 http puu sh n1jkr ab416e8ed1 jpg go here 2 login properly you have to be registered with the forum 3 open application ygopro exe in your appdata folder percy and devpro havent updated so they wont work 4 click lan mode 5 type the following information http puu sh n1jp8 f85402718c jpg 6 http puu sh n1jqs 0047edbe02 jpg go back to the site click gamelist 7 i suggest you repeat steps 3 6 8 click the green duel 9 lobby is open to non technical people http puu sh n1jxk 1db27806b8 jpg 10 a preloaded deck can be injected and lock you using demo http puu sh n1jz8 96dc84697d jpg 11 rps should work normal 12 as of this posting there are some issues with player selection so its better if the client wins it ,1,yugioh
zayelion,i dont understand what you are saying elaborate please ,1,yugioh
zayelion,never reread the op and the news on the main site and all the dev development diaries pretty clear as to why ,1,yugioh
zayelion,can i see the tilted pic it useful edit scrolls oh i feel dumb now ,1,yugioh
zayelion, you are connected to the server and have the app running cant do that in ygochrome or on duelingnetwork if you clicked into a duel you would see cards moving around on the field in micro render cant do that anywhere else to me that means it works it works at an data level its obvious from the op its in development why its title development pictures those css issues look like they are browser related wont take me long to clean up but thats all polish salvation is off for users while we do development so i posted this to keep everyone in the loop about what is going on where you expecting something else if so why ,-1,yugioh
zayelion,ygochrome doesnt work on mobile and requires a access rights that may be locked in school enviroments it also loads slow and likely will always load render slow as a professional software engineer thats spent the last 3yrs studying the ygopro code base and specializing in web development it strikes me as obvious ygochrome is just a stopgap dn and portal stop gap and social issues if you dont have admin priveleges or cant figure them out odds are you dont have a flash drive nor the rights to stick it in a drive and then run something off it often updates isnt the issue size of the updates and retrograde fixes to replays and decks which currently cant be done reliably mobile doesnt update often enough or is problematic for the user to manually update those are all valid options but do not adequately fully address all problems we want to solve all the problems related around delployment upgrades and avaliablity thats why we shut down salvation to focus on this ,1,yugioh
zayelion,the aggressiveness was sexual and nature and considering the server logs all conversation in game and chat and those logs are public to not only staff but users im pretty confident it was gender related ,-1,yugioh
zayelion,its highly likely i am missing the point i agree with that salvation is before a ygo sim a social engineering project with its goals being more community harmony its salvation from oppressive administration also i am not a christian so yeah i promise we are going to change the art eventually just its gonna be a while and we arent gonna change it for the reasons most people give ,-6,yugioh
zayelion,you have an obvious internet connection speed bias and lack of understanding of the update system and non systems in other ygopro variants in the vein of a high speed connection and the user has technical literacy and rights to properly install the softeware you are correct there is no issue ,-1,yugioh
zayelion,on the bright side its all social engineering on salvations part not a technical limitation ,2,yugioh
zayelion,i remember tdoane being 500mb compressed in an installer and devpro was 700mb as an installer last i looked installing a client side application is a barrier for 1 in 4 people there is also the issue of updates browser mode reduces the cost to run the server ,1,yugioh
zayelion, hide cards in replay mode that are in the opponent hand then rotate over its running in browser is the main point if you didnt notice that the whole wonder of everything is lost on you ,1,yugioh
zayelion,we have noted a correlation between complaining about her and being unhelpful self centric and aggressive to the female staff ,-4,yugioh
zayelion,not a personal attack uses the word neckbeard art is by a woman staff over the ascetic of the site are mostly women and the only woman that complained about the art did it because she has a personal issue with the artist before suggesting something even more tittastic and salvation has more women on staff than any other ygopro possibly even dn i have failed as a leader in understanding the 5 8 female demographic of the gyo even though they are over represented in our staffing and decision making processes should we remove all the pink that makes up the majority of the design of the sites palette guess we will change it to traptrix or something ,-11,yugioh
zayelion,eventually yes its just very low on the priority list ,-2,yugioh
zayelion,a cultural thing the game is very fractured at least from salvation view due to intolerance of ideas and backgrounds the group of people that run salvation are 1st generation duelist so stuff like this doesnt bother us because we are well into our adulthood we have noticed it turns away people we dont want on our sim that cause drama so she staying additional the art does change from time to time we recently did galleries of the winged dragon of ra harpy ladies and maiden with eyes of blue ,-15,yugioh
zayelion,you can test it now by connecting to salvation via lan mode we bomb would the launcher so its not apparent if you unlocked the defeat accessdenied in a shadow duel achievement then you know what to do 200ooo8000 0 1 5 u xxxxx where xxxxx is case sensitive random chars ,2,yugioh
zayelion,its magi magi gal and thats sexist the two sims with women running them have dmg est logo mascots ,-23,yugioh
zayelion,there are currently two ai systems in ygopro the opensourced on by iceygo tenkei from devpro and dawn and the closed sourced one by percy you are talking about the closed source one sadly percy is the most intellegent one and is locked to percy client which is closed source so there is jacks i can do to improve the ai you are speaking about directly the ai programming is in lua and opensource its interface is closed source i have been unable to convience the other sovereigns to look into it up until recently louis and reina the soverigns from battlecityalpha and mycard are looking at it but no one has agreed to fix it yet the action in the best intrest of users is not in the soverigns interest from an educational standpoint so no one is gonna do the right thing there is a posted spec on salvation ,3,yugioh

zayelion,ygopro is made out of a number of parts 1 ygopro core or ocgcore is a state processor that reads lua files and actually engines the game state it outputs state to a wrapper layer with network cabalities a few other developers have gotten this down to a server side service in a different language extracting it from ygopro thats why we have wide area launcher variants they all have version of ygopro with no gframes running in the back the next part is the scripts community really seems to love lua we arent changing that thats all the magic of ygopro we are not changing of the core aspects of ygopro we are removing the gframe part of it written in c someone playing in the browser can duel someone playing on a desktop client visuals are the only part we are fixing c just feels wrong to me imagine typing a post then for each noun going and writing out the definition and for each verb writing down which nouns it can be near and then you are touching on the annoying factor now before you write anything you first have to format your hdd not joking need a different os to write in it effectively every 15mins is some mind bending gotcha even after 3yrs i still hold my breath trying to compiling this fucker i like to put my energies to the problem not a finicky computer program that is mad i didnt say simon says im able to express what i want very easily in js for some reason ,1,yugioh
zayelion,to be clear i started recoding this thing 3yrs ago im using javascript ,1,yugioh
zayelion,1 dn devpro and percy have leadership issues that cant be solved without the power of an all encompassing sim 2 yes and no i cant elaborate very much but i have already explored the method he is using and he is gonna hit a wall or rather already has also as a c developer there are a few web development things he not privy to and it shows percy is adpet at conceptially copying what the others are doing but this will be a place he wont be able to just stroll into based on his c knowelege giving me an edge so i can do what i set out to do with isnt even about ygopro 3 i am just not that type of programmer i spend most my spare time 3yrs now studying ygopro looking at that source code and i can still barely edit it but i went from making wordpress themes to desktop application with enterprise level server application literal irl job with javascript understanding the user base client side isnt the full answer ygopro is a ample interface by the creators own word its not suppose to be used the way its being used currently the people that work on ygopro dont even know how its gui works really and the devs that do most arent helping or as a group cant agree on policy or what to make so they see it as a toy hobby and end up mistreating the userbase the graphical parts are a mess and thats putting it lightly its barely comprehensible ,1,yugioh
zayelion,at the level of web development we are doing there is no distinction now ,1,yugioh
