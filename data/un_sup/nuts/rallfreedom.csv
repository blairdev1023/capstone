rallfreedom,i lose this matchup more often than not i simply will grab tp and never fight him play passive and get waveclear gap closing items split push and punish when he goes to inevitably help his team and whatever you do do not lose your tower to him ask jungler for help when he pushes if you do not feed him and neither does your team then late game he wo not be able to contest the split without help if he does get fed and you see him just use tp and split elsewhere ,1,TryndamereMains

rallfreedom,it random urf,2,TryndamereMains
rallfreedom,if i am facing a ranged champion like teemo or quinn i rush a bilgewater and let them push me to tower till 6 your cs is going to be awful but you will make it up mid and late game do not take poke for minion money even canon after 6 you usually can all in with ignite and surprise them rush a static and then enjoy the rest of the game any melee champs i build rage asap and all in level 2 if i die and give up first blood i just play back and relax till 6 and repeat there are certain champions though where you simply cannot risk feeding them in those cases just grab tp wait for a gank or just play super safe,1,TryndamereMains
rallfreedom,so in the game you linked for us to watch against phreak you left your adc to 2v1 stole your junglers red buff and gave it to orianna when she got first blood on you then the enemy bot lane got first tower you never laned you were not supporting just jungling and got carried by your teammates even with all of that said i really like a dual jungle meta i hope it catches on still i do not blame them for not liking what you are doing ,1,leagueoflegends

rallfreedom,just an fyi it is still very possible those girls will go to heaven if the only reason you go to hell is sinning then we are all screwed including christians but god had a plan from day 1 and that plan was jesus for god so loved the world that he sent his one and only son that whoever believes in him will not perish but have eternal life if those girls believe in christ and what he did on the cross for us then they still will be saved as much as any christian in heaven there will be no straight or gay or marriages or anything and we will be sinless it almost impossible to be be sinless on earth only jesus could do that ,3,pics
