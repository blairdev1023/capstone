the_baumer,because then we would have a shit ton of single mothers reliant on the government to compensate for child support i am guessing these laws are in place so the government does not have to be responsible i do not think welfare is evil or anything like that but someone gotta pay and these laws are making sure a man whether the real dad or not will do it ,1,childfree
the_baumer,that good i have never used them then lol i am a pads girl for life ,1,TrollXChromosomes
the_baumer,maybe then that woman and most woman should not put so much weight on marriage and just be grateful they have a monogamous partner in life if my boyfriend never wanted to get married but still committed to me i would dumb to walk away for that you do not have to be legally binded to be a life partner just my 2 cents edit here a real story to prove my point friend of a friend walked away from an 11 year relationship because he did not want to get married now she single in her thirties and desperate for a husband hope it was worth the risk for a piece of paper ,1,RedPillWomen
the_baumer,yeah the more active i am throughout the month the overall less pain and lighter periods happen however once it starts exercise does not reduce actual cramp pain for me only a pain reliever can do that for me ,5,TrollXChromosomes
the_baumer,same i have tried multiple times to run bike get on elliptical when cramping and it actually made it more painful so i learned my lesson to not do that ,7,TrollXChromosomes
the_baumer,okay well if loans are going to happen no matter what then it in your best interest to just do what you think will help you get through school cheaper and employable quickly when you graduate i do not plan on taking out loans but in the event that i do i will at least be assured that in my area my community college 2 year rn adn program will be cheap and i will be able to find a job a lot of people end up choosing bsn over a 2 year degree because of employability do you know for sure if you can be hired with a 2 year degree in your area people living in big cities tend to have an issue finding a job because of this i do not have my cna license yet but i applied last week to take the fl exam so i will find out my test date soon i did a brief class in my area to learn the clinical skills to be able to pass pay is very low here like 10 11 hour but it good experience for nursing and works better with schedule day classes than 9 5 hours so that is always an option ,2,StudentNurse
the_baumer,wow this is like eerily similar to me same english degree and same predicament of being stuck in my ft office job that i am growing very tired of i honestly do not think any of those options are bad at all i think which option you choose depends on your lifestyle choice and financial situation if you quit and forgo a full time job for pre reqs do you have a cushion for paying bills will your bf support the finances is he okay doing that if you decide to not quit and do pre reqs one class at a time do you think you will be able to slowly do this for two years without your boss knowing or your job getting in the way of studying and getting as will you have to take out loans to finance a bsn or do you already have the money set aside i have had to ask myself these questions to figure it out myself i will tell you though that after doing a semester of pre reqs with my job it just was too hard to keep up and keep it under wraps i also have to travel to conferences for work from time to time and that would impact my attendance and grades so i am going to quit and try to get a job as a cna for the flexibility it a huge paycut i will be close to living paycheck to paycheck but i have been able to save a lot of money from my job as a cushion for when i am actually in nursing school and cannot work for full time so this is a risk i am willing to take sorry that went on longer than i thought but i hope that helps to make your decision each option is a sacrifice in some way now it choosing which one you are willing to make ,2,StudentNurse
the_baumer,okay i get that maybe some people want that spark it sounds nice but i like the slow burn of living together more than the spark ,1,RedPillWomen
the_baumer,i do not understand where this idea comes from im not married yet we enjoy each other company enough we are happier living together than apart what exactly is the problem edit maybe it just my view point of marriage is that it not holy it a binding legal contract and rewards us tax benefits and other perks like certain rights since i have moved in with him i have treated him as a wife but a wife does not mean you have to be married acting like one is good enough for me and my boyfriend when we are ready to merge our legal identities we will ,16,RedPillWomen
the_baumer,relax man it just a joke ,15,nursing
the_baumer,well it was a typo so ,16,nursing
the_baumer,i am just guessing but i think it because it so mild as a drug it wo not do anything not taking hector actual prescription would cause more harm it seems edit also it so common it not out of the ordinary when doing blood work 2nd edit i just read that people with cardiovascular disease would have adverse effects such as a stroke if they took ibuprofen source https www fda gov forconsumers consumerupdates ucm453610 htm ,4,betterCallSaul

the_baumer,both my of my best friends have bpd not sure why i get attached to those types but that another story but one of them is more severe and textbook than the other she can be difficult to be around to much because she needs attention and constant stimuli she also had an aversion to abandonment or feeling alone so when i have to leave she will guilt me into staying longer she also guilted me a lot when i was dating my boyfriend because it meant less time i could spend with her she also gets suicidal from time to time so i worry about that aside from that she is caring fun and sweet plus we have a lot in common and i know she aware of her bpd and behaviors but it like a compulsion and she cannot help it to some degree most people cannot deal with it everyday i have to limit my time because it becomes draining having to lift up her self worth and make sure she does not fall into a pit of despair ,4,nursing

the_baumer,mine said the same thing too lol but it is an option since you already have a guide mine is wordy as well but break it down into easy pieces per skill you have the time make your own study guide do a very basic step by step to help you we got this ,3,cna
the_baumer,did you get a manual or any study guides from your course you can also look up videos on youtube for certain skills also just keep practicing every day i have not even registered for my test yet but i do not want to forget my skills so i practice one everyday and go through the motions edit also want to add that for some skills you will have to get creative for the transfer skill for example i do not have a wheelchair or a gait belt but i used a computer chair and a regular belt to simulate just remember the most important thing is patient safety and indirect care if you fumble over a few small things it not a big deal ,1,cna
the_baumer,i have been wanting to go to peach fuzz for years how is it ,1,Miami

the_baumer,i mean i am sure the numbers prove it but it not as simple as saying they are just defective at birth because they are black males they are a product of their environment and that can determine the choices they make ,3,Miami
the_baumer,my boyfriend could not be further away from the player type but i would marry him on the spot if he asked me to and we have been together for over two years i have a passion for him i never felt with my ex boyfriend who i was with for 5 years it not the time that the issue it the desire and the passion it either there or it not i felt the exact same way with my ex that you feel now and i left i grieved and i felt so guilty but you have zero obligation to stay in a relationship when you are not even married yet you know what you need to do just pretend you have already made the decision and process it it will make it easier once you are ready to tell him ,5,RedPillWomen

the_baumer,digital marketing i majored in english and that pretty much all i have been doing since i graduated college starting pay can vary but once you get a few years in you are looking at 45 60k salary ,9,personalfinance
the_baumer,what exactly is the calling like you want to help people yeah who does not want to help people that part of the reason i am drawn to it but i also want the job security being able to do travel nursing only working 36 hours a week and doing something i am more interested in healthcare than my current field so i cannot say that my intentions are completely altruistic if you want to be altruistic go volunteer if you want the warm fuzzies get a pet in the end as a nurse you are still exchanging your labor for money so how much of a martyr can you be ,17,StudentNurse
the_baumer,i have seen one but it 90k for the entire program so if you have money anything is possible ,1,nursing
the_baumer,i know bc is insanely difficult i have literally talked to current students about it but having 60k of student loan debt is no walk in the park either trying to pay that back on a new grad salary in our area that a tall order have you looked into mdc or pbsc adn programs fau or fiu bsn programs ,1,nursing
the_baumer,i never could because of maturity i have just always been a few years ahead of people my age so much so that even strangers would find out my age and assume i am older by how i carry myself ,1,RedPillWomen

the_baumer,do not you at least want to be able to support yourself you seem to assume that getting a bachelors means your first job is some high powered job with an 80 hour work week trust me it will be far from it i work in digital marketing that was not the case for me but i found good jobs that were standard 40 hours a week and a big factor in getting those jobs was because i had my bachelors and internship experience so get the bachelors get internship experience so you are desirable to employers and pay down your debts as quick as possible you wo not be intimidating men because of a bachelors degree more women are in college than ever before it pretty standard now ,9,RedPillWomen
the_baumer,yeah anytime i watch a nyc centric show i always get the urge to move there but i do not think i could ever feel comfortable there the winters are long and wet i grew up in a tropical climate and its crazy expensive also pretty loud and crowded it not easy peasy unless you have wealth ,3,MasterofNone

the_baumer,i am 26 and i do not have the one then again i have never really been dumped or wondered what if with exes i think the one is often reserved for people who got dumped or hastily left the relationship there was some doubt that it could have worked out but now they will never know so they paint this person in a more positive light not to sound full of myself but i know i am the one for my ex bf it been 3 years and i know from mutual friends he not over me he mostly avoids any places that me my current bf go to with friends it awkward ,2,TwoXChromosomes
the_baumer,it common but does not make it okay pino was not perfect but he does not deserve a fianc e wife that only stays with him because it safe you stay with someone because you love them and want to be with them i have been lukewarm to a long term partner and i had the balls to leave she should have left too but not into dev arms ,2,MasterofNone
the_baumer,i think you might be thinking of esthetician they require a state license to operate and those programs are shorter than rn programs they still do not give botox injections though ,3,nursing

the_baumer,god i still do not know why dev got such cold feet with rachel after spending a year with her but somehow fell in love with francesca in a few weeks rachel and him were such a great stable couple and he threw it all away and sparked her to leave to japan rachel was available she loved him and took a chance on him i think dev just has incredibly shallow expectations of relationships and is too selfish to be in a long term one ,13,MasterofNone
the_baumer,being in an ltr when it not just your first one but only one it extremely common for you or your partner to change or want something else you are growing as a person and may have different wants than you did when you first got together that normal regardless francesca is emotionally stunted in some ways she thinks it okay to stay with someone because it comfortable and stable wrong and jump into another relationship with someone after another just ended wrong not to mention carrying out an textbook emotional affair so wrong and dev being the selfish person he is because he tired of being alone does not see those red flags and guilts her into being with him this is a recipe for disaster if francesca has any emotional maturity she would have called it off with dev when she started to have feelings broke up with pino and figured out what she wanted in her life ,22,MasterofNone

the_baumer,i manage our shared expenses and make sure bills are paid and so is rent i coordinate all logistics for our travels and keep ourselves on a budget i am also the bread winner in terms of salary and often pay upfront for large purchases because i can although this will change since i will be a part time student soon i drive more for us because he drives a lot for work and we do not want his car mileage to go over his lease terms i will fix things if i can but i often just replace things if they are low on supply and find ways to de clutter and make use of what we have ,2,RedPillWomen

the_baumer,makes no sense that she an equalist and yet does not think healthcare should be equalist meaning equal care regardless of things you cannot control like your sex or pre existing conditions edit i just want to add that it obviously okay to have conservative views on healthcare in the us but do not give some bs answer on that people need to work if she said that it would collapse an entire industry if it would bloat our government spending if it would reduce quality care those are valid points a career beauty pageant contestant telling average citizen they need to work to get healthcare is laughable ,3,RedPillWomen

the_baumer,congrats taking my cna course at the end of this month excited to get started ,3,StudentNurse
the_baumer,i am kinda in the same predicament as you but as i read it from outside perspective i would say the bigger risk is getting into paying for a bsn program only to realize nursing is not for you then you would really be stuck i know cnas are not the same as nurses but it the closest thing to it at the moment and it the surest way of knowing if it going to mesh well with you quitting your current job to get the cna job is the least riskiest worse case scenario you do not like it and can work a job making the same pay and a few weeks months were wasted if you go straight into bsn and do not like it a few years were wasted and you are now thousands in debt i do not see the point of becoming a cna after you are already in school if you are unsure be sure before you get into a program and make a big commitment like that i work an office job that pays 3x more hourly than cna but i signed up for a cna course and if i get a decent job offer i am probably going to quit the hours of cna are much more flexible for my pre reqs i am going to get good experience for nursing and more importantly i am gonna be able to judge more accurately if i will like it i think i will but i want to be realistic and not romanticize a job i do not know a ton about worse case if i end up hating it i will go back to my field and figure something else out you are young smart have more freedom now is the time i do not think you will have much to lose by becoming a cna ,1,StudentNurse
the_baumer,while i am not a nurse yet or a nursing student i am taking my pre reqs now i also was split between ot and nursing and ultimately i stuck with nursing because it way more flexible and varied than ot and ot jobs are not numerous as nursing long term nursing demand will increase faster than ot edit also the human body and processes are also just so fascinating to me i have a natural curiosity towards that since i was a kid i do not think you will go wrong if your motivations are not only helping people but helping them with their health and improving their condition there are plenty of ways you can help people social work teaching etc but if healthcare is something you are passionate about then nursing or even pa is a good path ,1,nursing
the_baumer,the 2nd point is very important to internalize no one is going to be universally attractive it just impossible one of my friends is very much into achieving beauty ideals and when she got rejected by a guy for the first time in her life she was shocked and felt bad about herself i thought it was silly to feel that way considering she already attractive ,2,RedPillWomen

the_baumer,so your classes are all accelerated 9 weeks instead of the standard 16 week semester and you are gonna take them all at once what is the rush here do you work at all cause if you are just a full time student you could probably be fine by why overload yourself like that ,1,StudentNurse
the_baumer,my mom did for a long time growing up she has been an rn since her early 20s and would tell me it too stressful for the pay and that i should aim higher well now i am serious about getting into nursing after i aimed higher and got what she wanted me to get an easy job that pays well except i did not ever want it and it just happened she fine with me pursuing nursing now i guess she wanted me to make an informed decision before i did it ,3,StudentNurse

the_baumer,i know exactly what that like that was me this past semester in my ap class i work full time 9 5 and would go to lecture class in from 8 9 15pm and lab 7 30 9pm i know after working it mentally draining to study but the days where you do not have class are crucial for studying any day i had class i did not study unless it was just reviewing for an exam because at that point your brain just cannot handle any more information so my advice is to only study on days you dont have class this includes weekends and to use quizlet to cut down on time taking notes i used to take notes in class and then put them into quizlet but it was just faster to put them into quizlet during lecture as the teacher goes over them any way you reduce the amount of time compiling your notes study materials is key also for lab practicals i took pictures of all the models we used during class printed them out and identified the parts on paper i even did this for histology slides and it paid off cause i got an a and the highest grade in the class for the first practical we had hope this helps you ,1,StudentNurse

the_baumer,it really relative to whether nursing is worth the money some it will be and some it wo not for me personally it wo not be my current field pays better than most nursing jobs but i am still leaving it anyway i would not ever make someone feel bad for going into nursing for money because they probably are struggling for money and are striving for something better money was the sole reason my mom went into it and she has no regrets it helped her raise four kids and not be in poverty ,5,StudentNurse
the_baumer,okay i definitely know which one is it cause i am taking pre reqs there p good luck edit if you can also share your experience there that would be awesome i know it a good program but i have read and heard negative things about how the students are treated that only reason why i am looking elsewhere to apply ,1,StudentNurse

the_baumer,someone mentioned it might be bard college ,4,girls
the_baumer,yes yes exactly which is also why she extended an invitation to marnie over hannah though marnie hooked up with ray she wanted marnie there because she is attractive charming and more importantly would impress her other friends more than jessa and hannah would ,54,girls
the_baumer,you ask where ray was but you answered your own question with your analysis of shosh she is superficial and is very concerned with appearances and impressing people she admires ray at that party is the total opposite of what she aiming for imagine ray mingling with the other guests he would stick out like a sore thumb much like hannah and jessa ,1,girls
the_baumer,you are concerning yourself too much with comparing men vs women in the same exact roles or thinking that men or women cannot take risks in choosing non traditional role it not like it competition between who played a specific role best it who has the best performance in their own role maybe a woman absolutely nails it as a ruthless ceo or a man nails it as a single father but it should be determined on their own performance does not matter if it a traditional fit or not you cannot let society or outside influences get in the way of a simple question who had the best performance that it ,3,television

the_baumer,been out of college for 4 years and also work in marketing full time started my pre reqs this past january it looks like you want to do 2 accelerated classes at the same time that is a lot for someone who just starting the pre reqs i do not think it doable with a full time job you only have so much time to attend class plus study and do assignments and then also time to devote to your job and your own responsibilities i would start with just one accelerated class and see how you do then you can decide if you can handle two classes for the remaining summer right now i am only doing ap 1 and ap 1 lab for a full 16 week semester and it a lot more time than i realized i study everyday but that why i have an a average in both classes you have to be absolutely sure you can achieve an a otherwise it will be a waste of your time and money bs in pre reqs wo not get you into an absn im taking two 6 week classes this summer but one at a time because i know it going to be a lot of material in a short amount of time edit i also want to add that it completely on track for people who work full time to take 1 2 years to do all the pre reqs before applying it would be awesome if i could not work get them done sooner and apply sooner but it not the best option ,1,StudentNurse

the_baumer,my gut is telling me not to go but my brain keeps rationalizing that i can be one of the few that make it through since you are a student already is this type of behavior this program does common among nursing schools it just looks like the administration does not give a crap about the students and only cares if their nclex rates stay high enough i am sure they are high cause only a few people even get through to take the exam lol ,1,nursing
the_baumer,this is more pre nursing student but i need some advice on this adn program i am aiming for it known to be very tough academically but also tough mentally now i am not scared of academic because i am doing well in my pre reqs and i know that when i put in the time and effort i learn and retain the material i am scared about the mental toughness i have been reading reviews of this program over the past few months and the feedback is pretty bad instructors that yell at you bully you pick favorites sure i can develop my thick skin but then i read of these ridiculous reasons people fail out one person forgot their calculator to clinical one person during clinical did not lower a patient bed and failed 10 student were late to lecture because of an accident on the highway and the dean of the program wanted them to withdraw because of it pushing them back another 6 months and then this weekend i meet someone who is taking pre reqs at the same school as me and also warned me not to go there she said it brutal and she knows people with years of medical experience that are struggling and the people who did not have any failed out she applying to other programs on the school website the nclex pass rate is 96 but the completion rate is 36 is the completion rate like that concerning i was so set on going here but i have never heard anything remotely positive except that it prepares you well i am not even sure if it worth attending when i have such a huge probability of failing any thoughts ,1,nursing

the_baumer,i personally would not because even if you enjoy the high you are left with the side effects once the high wears off i quit for good last september and since then i have smoked a few times and every time i would smoke i just felt so shitty after i was groggy had brain fog was depressive for days after it just sucks to make so much good progress in my mental state since quitting and smoking just brings me back to depression so if that resonates with you i would not do it however if you do decide to do it be self aware of the effects and how it makes you feel i think you may find that the temporary high is not as great as we all thought it was and that the side effects are not worth it edit i also want to add that you should not feel bad if you do smoke it part of the process in the long run when it comes to quitting by smoking again you may even reaffirm why you quit in the first place ,3,leaves

the_baumer,i am just gonna go off the reasons why i chose adn over absn and maybe some will resonate with you 1 my adn program is way cheaper i would not have to take out loans for it unlike an absn and since it not accelerated i can work part time if i wanted to getting job experience while i am in school is so worth it than getting a bsn with no experience cause it was too fast paced for me to get a job plus you can always do a rn to bsn and sometimes the employer may reimburse or pay for it fully a lot of these programs are also online 2 i do not want to be in debt it kinda funny seeing how cooly people are to just taking out 50k for loans for school and then paying them back on a new grad salary like it nothing that gonna be a burden on you for years possibly decades my bf has over 50k in loans and it not fun or carefree to manage really think about this before you agree to take out that much money 3 absn programs are oftentimes much more competitive than adn and require more pre reqs i chose adn cause i needed less pre reqs and the criteria to get into it is so much less demanding i work full time so i do not have a ton of free time anyway ,1,StudentNurse
the_baumer,i work in marketing and becoming woke and a socialist in the past year or so has pretty much destroyed my previous dream of becoming a vp or cmo in a large tech company after some self reflection i am making the transition into healthcare nursing which is more interesting to me anyway it never too late to make a change in your career if you feel in your heart you are not meant for your line of work edit i do also agree with what u thehagueface says and that no matter what you are going to have compartmentalize in almost every career i too will have to deal working in for profit hospitals with for profit admins who rather cut staff in order to maximize profits ,1,socialism

the_baumer,more importantly than the career is the type of person he is my former ceo of a tech startup actually married a high school drama teacher when he was running his company so it not like it cannot happen he is incredibly nice smart driven and is very happy with her years later if your husband has more narcissistic qualities and is generally shallow or materialistic then that more likely he will be willing to upgrade in my opinion ,1,RedPillWomen
the_baumer,yeah it scary and not uncommon i remember a post on the twoxchromosomes subreddit about how a woman supported her husband through med school and residency and in turn he began to criticize how she looks and how much less she was than other doctors trophy wives she felt like he was getting ready to have an affair or just divorce and upgrade altogether this is why i am likely to stay away from high status men it great they have career success but then that translates into wanting more and more into your personal life if you can support yourself and have ambitions other than career thats the right balance for me personally there more to life than work and having the best things ,2,RedPillWomen

the_baumer,i gave you advice and this is what you reply have fun not getting gains then you clearly know what you are doing ,38,StrongCurves
the_baumer,it either you need to lift heavier weights add more protein to your diet and or increase your time for each session so if you are only going two days week double your time there so it would be as if you are doing 4 workouts a week i also recommend that if you are only lifting two days a week cut out the time spent jogging and lift instead you will get the same benefits cardiovascular wise if you are lifting heavy and breaking a sweat plus you are much more likely to see results cardio will not help you build muscle and in fact it may be setting back your gains i am a cardio junkie but i am cutting my cardio down to once a week just so i can start the bb program and lift 4 days a week ,29,StrongCurves

the_baumer,i see how your getting confused between the goals of rpw and rpm i was at that point too when i first discovered rpw the thing is that while both follow the truths of red pill they in practice operate against each other both are sexual strategies designed to benefit each sex so the male sexual strategy of rpm is to have sex with as many women as possible with no commitment and or marriage the female sexual strategy of rpw is to get commitment and or marriage from a man foremost before sex occurs rpw says that a man will commit to you if your n count is low and you have qualities that make you worthy of a relationship otherwise he could just be having sex without commitment with other women so why should he settle hope that helps you ,16,RedPillWomen

the_baumer,yes i agree with a couple people here that you should not take his porn fantasies seriously and try to mold yourself into that they are exactly that fantasies and do not have a basis on what he can find attractive about you in real world that does not mean you cannot strive to improve yourself how you see fit by all means go to the gym do those squats watch your diet that all healthy what is unhealthy is striving to meet unrealistic standards because of what he jerks off too there always going to be a girl with bigger boobs bigger ass and a smaller waist than you do not beat yourself up for it or put yourself through unnecessary things for a fantasy by the way i am no fitness expert but waist trainers and doing any sort of fat spot reduction does not work long term the only way to reduce fat in certain areas is to reduce your total body fat percentage and gain muscle in its place the only booty enhancement you need is more protein in your diet and glute building exercises ,3,RedPillWomen
the_baumer,like you i did not realize it until coming here that i have pretty much been an rpw since i was ready to date and have relationships even though i did not know what rpw was at the time i hated being single as a teenager and in my early 20s when i was single and casually dating fwbs for a few months i did not find much enjoyment from despite what i was told by my peers and most women on reddit that it was liberating and freeing it was not for me it was me wasting time for something i really valued which having a man in my life i truly care and love after 6 months of being single i finally found my ideal match and my own mom was telling me it was too soon for me to settle getting out of an ltr and at age 24 but you know what i am so happy being with him for 2 years and i can see us growing old together so i hope you continue on your path and do not let others make you feel bad for following what you value and want in your life ,3,RedPillWomen

the_baumer,if you have lost respect for him it too late you will never get it back and he will never change from your actions he has to be the one to change and frankly how long are you willing to wait i had a ex boyfriend similar to yours we dated in college for 4 years and i left him about a year after i moved in with him it was only after i lived with him i saw his true colors he was my first love and i cared about him so much but despite that his laziness untreated depression and lack of ambition was destroying any respect or future plans i had for him so one day on a saturday i moved all my stuff out when he was at work and said it over never called or kept in touch i will admit the first two months were bad for me i cried everyday for the first two weeks even but i told myself that this was right for me even though it hurt and i felt guilty i kept myself busy did a lot of self improvement started yoga and zumba exercised a lot and 6 months later i found my current boyfriend i would not say he a full blown captain type but he a hard worker and sensible and he understands that i have high expectations for him and wants to achieve them we have goals and want more whereas my ex bf was content living at home with his mom and not giving a fuck about getting his degree well it been almost three years since i broke up with him still no college degree still living with his mom people do not change unless they want to and i am glad i did not waste anymore time if he gets his act together you can consider getting back with him but after being on your own and meeting new men i doubt you will want to so i really hope you make the right decision for yourself even though it not the easiest right now but it does get easier ,3,RedPillWomen

the_baumer,i live in south florida and these are at public universities state tuition here is usually cheaper than average ,1,StudentNurse
the_baumer,so i had the same dilemma with choosing adn or absn for a few reasons i am going to the adn program here why cost when it done adn will cost me 5 6k total during an 18 month program i have no debt currently and i am saving my money now so i do not have to work for at least the first two semesters in an absn in my area would be over 20k total so i would have to take out loans flexibility while the adn program is full time it still possible to get a part time job with the workload in an absn even a part time job would be difficult you are covering much more material at a much faster pace than adn getting in the program i really dislike my unfurling full time office job as well and want to start nursing school asap the adn program is less competitive than absn programs in my area they have way less pre reqs and do not require superfluous stuff like volunteer hours letters of recommendation admission interviews i do not have time for that stuff employability adns in my area have no problem getting hired at hospitals not only have i looked on job sites i have talked to nurses on reddit in my area and asked them about it i think you should do more research on this before you jump for a absn make a post on reddit and call the local hospitals and ask them ,6,StudentNurse

the_baumer,you are right i put it lightly i am just making the point that it will probably not ever escape hip hop no matter how critically acclaimed an artist may be i am actually a woman and yes my reaction to hip hop is not a typical female response and i have listened to a lot of mainstream hip hop and maybe i am just desensitized to it ,2,RedPillWomen
the_baumer,there hip hop that is not misogynistic and vulgar someone in thread mentioned a few that i also would vouch for as much as i would like some reform in that regard i just do not see that community ever being 100 feminist even biggie and tupac two of the most influential rappers who music was critical about racial issues and classism had their moments of calling women hoes and devaluing them as objects ,2,RedPillWomen
the_baumer,i mostly listen to indie electronic and indie rock music which would fit your not offensive lyrics criteria and as for hip hop i do listen to 90 of it i do not take seriously at all it just fun beats and rapping the other 10 is more serious message oriented like kendrick lamar although he still uses profanity and grew up in compton so he not perfect ,2,RedPillWomen

the_baumer,i was awkward looking and incredibly shy which resulted in almost no male attention one guy had a crush and me and asked me to a dance and i went but it did not go anywhere cause i was not interested it was not until my senior year that a guy finally kissed me and wanted to have sex with me and after that i got male attention a little bit more but it was not until 23 when i broke up with my long term bf from college that i got a ton of male attention that to me was my peak now i have a long term bf again and i could care less about other guys ,1,RedPillWomen
the_baumer,watched singin in the rain this week the night before debbie reynolds passed away weirdly and it funny and so entertaining the dancing sequences are awesome also recommend network and a face in the crowd especially with the way politics and news are going i really liked citizen kane and la dolce vita so my tastes might not hold up to what you like ,1,movies
the_baumer,there a couple reasons why but i am not switching because of struggling with it i majored in english and did marketing internships in college and i have gotten several promotions throughout my career the problem is that it not challenging actually and i am not happy with my work environment i find nursing appealing for the challenge it brings and that i will be helping people and not sit in front of a computer all day another reason it more appealing than marketing is the job security and the fact that ageism is rampant in white collar professions and i do not want to be laid off when i am 50 assuming i do not have a vp or high up job title by then with nursing i can work through retirement if i want to also it the lifestyle of nursing it mostly shift work which means more days off and my work does not follow me around when i am not there do not have to check emails or do urgent work outside work hours so it not marketing itself that bad it just the office lifestyle is not as appealing to me as it used to be i will say that marketing is not too difficult of a profession if you are a quick learner and are willing to try new things it also pays pretty well if you work for certain industries like tech finance pharma and at a director level you could easily make 100k a year ,1,isfj

the_baumer,i think the ensemble was a great choice for a less character driven route i rather see a bit of each character during a two hour movie than a bit of just one character the entire time and it accomplished that not every scene focused on jyn and cassian if it did with still no major character development from both of them it would have been way less entertaining edit i get where you are coming from i just do not think the movie point was to have fleshed out likeable characters i wanted to know how the death star plans were stolen and i got that through an entertaining film ,2,movies

the_baumer,maybe do some research on higher paying positions in your field and see what the requirements are if you find that they require a bachelors or possibly a masters then it would be worth using some of your savings for a degree i once read on this very subreddit that you cannot save your way to wealth you have to invest your way to wealth that can mean investing in yourself for much higher income potential ,1,personalfinance

the_baumer,those people who think abortion is murder will hands down fight for the rights of the fetus over the woman in order to prevent the murder from happening in their mind murder is never justifiable now i do not subscribe to this belief but even then they do not consider their stance as a belief the think fetuses have an inherent right to live but inherent rights are not really inherent we as people created our rights and we twist them around a lot when it convenient re slavery ,1,TwoXChromosomes
the_baumer,yeah and that the rub is not i had a debate with a guy on socialist programs and i said the world needs ditch diggers and because of that do they deserve to be poor his response if they do not want to be poor they can get another job what about the next guy and the next and the next just a revolving door of unfortunate circumstance but as long as it not you it okay ,25,LateStageCapitalism

the_baumer,just be wary about bias nyt washington post npr although fantastic reporting do have a more liberal bias where as breitbart infowars fox news has a conservative bias in addition major news networks and publications are often owned by huge multinational corporations which can affect the reporting they publish as well consider non profit non corporate news sources like propublica wikinews the real news ,2,indieheads
the_baumer,it not in my senior year high school yearbook there a quote of me saying i want write for a music publication and be an english lit professor none of that happened and i actually do not want to do any of those things anymore but the point is that life does not stop after college and now you will have money to start traveling or doing what you want ,2,indieheads

the_baumer,then what is your definition of petty when i looked it up it defined as being mean spirited and spiteful which i was not that what you implied when you said my comment was petty if you look back in your previous comment to me you are not following your own advice by passing negative judgment onto me for my comment it negative comment yes and i offered an alternative and much healthier choice that she can do or may already be doing it ironic how i am being critiqued for my negative comment and yet her entire action of celebrating the split of someone she once loved and cared about is not viewed as a negative action ,3,TrollXChromosomes
the_baumer,i am not stopping her from doing this or feeling this way i just shared how i felt i am letting her live how she wants to how am i being spiteful or mean to her by offering my opinion ,7,TrollXChromosomes

the_baumer,we can still unite we can still make our stance that we will not tolerate bigotry in any form but it cannot be vitriolic otherwise we will never be able to come together as a class and overturn the system we need to keep the lines of communication open these protests against each other fighting name calling is what the ruling class wants and we cannot keep giving it them ,1,LateStageCapitalism

the_baumer,i did not vote for trump but i would have preferred losing fairly with bernie democrats were getting fucked the second hillary was chosen by the dnc and it disillusioned a lot of democrats by letting them know their voice did not matter ,1,AdviceAnimals
the_baumer,people in the republican primaries voted for trump and he won it fairly people in the democratic parties voted for bernie and because of proven collusion from the dnc he did not get far despite a big swell of support the dnc knew they had to stop them because they already chose hillary i do not blame republican voters for voting for their party candidate who won the nomination fairly i blame the dnc for obstructing the democratic process that should have happened as a democrat our votes in the primaries literally did not matter ,1,AdviceAnimals
the_baumer,he so pro trump already has a fence up on his border to keep the muslims out ,1,worldnews
the_baumer,yes and even in creative fields that are more lucrative marketing and advertising you deal with a lot of ass kissing working 50 80 a week oftentimes a shitty vacation policy because you cannot just have some one swoop in and take over your job want to go away for a month i hope you like answering calls and emails when you are away cause it never stops when you leave the office if you value financial and job security if you value a work life balance then arts and creative field is not for you unless you are willing to make it be your life you can be an artist as a nurse but you cannot be a nurse as an artist so think long and hard if your passion can carry you through as a creative professional or artist ,1,StudentNurse

the_baumer,i am not demonizing trump at all i just said in my previous comment i would vote for him if he represented my political beliefs why would i vote for someone who does not share my values in their own fucking platform ,5,television

the_baumer,thank you for reinforcing this i am coming across all of these horror stories for how hard it is to get through the nursing programs i want to go to i had a feeling it was from people who were not prepared to take on the course load and do not have good study habits now this will motivate me to not slack and over prepare during my pre reqs ,6,StudentNurse
the_baumer,i live in south fl as well and considered doing fau or fiu accelerated program simply because of how short it is however compared to broward college that is much closer to me i do not need as many pre reqs for the accelerated program admission which is good considering i am working a full time office job but i am wary because it will take two years and i do not know if i will have enough in savings to last that long i think what i will do is not work my first year of the asn program and then during my second year i will become a cna and pick up per diem shifts to make some money and get some experience worst case scenario i take out a small amount of loans but i rather have some nursing experience before i graduate and start looking for a job ,1,nursing

the_baumer,check out fort lauderdale critical mass group on facebook bunch of people doing weekly casual rides in big groups and it mostly people in their 20s and 30s i want to get a bike myself and start doing it i did a ride with them about two years ago and i was in the back the whole time since i had not rode a bike in years but hey if you want to hang out feel free to message me i am 25 female and always down to make new friends i have a boyfriend who friends live in ny so he in the same boat we are really into film tv i like doing outdoorsy stuff going to concerts i saw your post about going to tate i get the struggle of being nerdy but not socially awkward lol it hard to find the right balance in a person ,4,fortlauderdale
the_baumer,just as an fyi accelerated bsn programs are much more competitive than asn programs if you already have a high gpa and can apply to more than one school it worth a shot i am in the same boat as you i majored in english and after working for a few years in marketing i am ready to make the switch to nursing since i am going in with zero science classes and working full time i am only applying to my local asn programs the accelerated bsn programs around me require double the pre reqs 3 8 gpa or higher interviews recommendations i simply do not have the time for that and most likely i cannot compete on that level since my cumulative gpa is only 3 5 a lot of people will tell you asn degrees wo not get you a job but that mostly depends on where you live plus there are a lot of rn to bsn programs that are cheap and only take a year to do so weigh all of your options before you start your path you got this ,2,StudentNurse
the_baumer,there is a r fortlauderdale facebook group and they will do meet ups or small get togethers i have lived here all my life and i know how you feel the only friends i have i know from high school or college and it really hard for people to break into friend groups because of the shared history and yeah most people have the no new friends squad attitude down here so they have no incentive to be friendly but shared interests can help get your foot in the door there are groups for city biking pokemon go yoga ultimate frisbee but if you are introverted like me and do not like the bar club scene it really hard what do you like to do for fun ,5,fortlauderdale

the_baumer,same and now i am actually in a better mood lately ,7,TrollXChromosomes
the_baumer,that sounds similar to me i relate to diane the most because unlike bojack she a high functioning depressed person who does not tend to act impulsively or selfish i think a lot of the impatience and irritability is due to depression i am less inclined to feel that way when i am generally in a good mood and feeling like i am worth something so i think affirmative words and building up the self esteem of this friend can help reduce those negative behaviors also mindfulness and being aware of how you are feeling and if that negative feeling is appropriate for the situation ,2,BoJackHorseman

the_baumer,yep i am in the exact same situation cushy 9 5 office in front of computer all day job pays pretty well not demanding benefits nice coworkers but it bores me i solve this by trying to learn a new skill but then i am back to square one but even worse than boring i feel empty there a part of me that is not fulfilled i want to help people and make a lasting impact and this job barely accomplishes that i am grateful but i am still looking for a way out i am considering non profit or governmental positions or maybe social work i think if you are bored there are probably a lot of online resources or certs you can use to learn and become even better in your role but if you discover it not boredom but a lack of passion and enthusiasm then you will really have to discover what your current role is not giving you and which one would make you happy by the way you definitely not too old to go back to school and start over have a plan be smart about your finances and it can work if all else fails you go back to it and figure out something new ,2,jobs

the_baumer,it totally normal to feel this i am a couple years out of school and while i am doing well in my field but i am slowly losing my interest in it i am finding that while i am good at my job the work itself does not hold a lot of value to me plus the whole office thing sit in front of a computer have to manage people is really not something i want after years of doing it so what i am saying is you are not going to know your calling until you find it since you have a couple options in mind try to volunteer or take a class on it there are free web dev classes online and tools so you can practice with coding there are maybe organizations on campus that need some marketing help this is the time to really find out what you can see yourself doing you have nothing to lose by trying to experience these options while in school worse case scenario is that you do not like it and you cross it off your list another thing to consider is your personality and what you like and would dislike in a workplace setting i am introverted i am not good at small talk or networking public speaking or really stressful fast paced environments so knowing that helps me eliminate a lot of fields where i would would not be a good fit i hope this helps i have been struggling with this for like a year and a half already but i am finally getting the courage to explore my others options i hope you can do the same and avoid doing it now like me although i am in a stable place in my life and career most people coming out of school with debt and are unemployed or underemployed do not have the means to do it ,3,jobs

the_baumer,the cdc confirms there is no test for men that have hpv because most of the time they are asymptomatic and infections usually clear up if they are even noticed the only way you will know is when you start to have the signs of an infection one of which can be genital warts but that is just one of many strains of hpv men can get the hpv vaccine though ,1,TwoXChromosomes
the_baumer,i know how you feel i found out i developed hpv a couple months ago i was always careful and used condoms except for one time but that was enough to get it i guess it made me feel awful but i am telling you it so common for women to have it you would be the odd one out not having it by the time you are an adult gyns are very proactive screening for hpv infections that can lead to cervical cancer so the risk of anything truly bad developing is lessened a lot i still recommended getting the hpv vaccine if you can because it can still help you build immunity to other strains it nothing to feel shameful about i swear if you have unprotected sex just let your partner know but even then it not guaranteed to pass especially if they are male men can be hpv carriers but they rarely ever have complications ,1,TwoXChromosomes

the_baumer,i am quitting to just be less dependent on it i used to use it moderation but it turned into depending on it for my happiness and mood stability at the same time when i was high i would not be able to accomplish the things i needed or wanted to do which left me feeling really down about myself and just further pushed me into a depressive state so far i have been 6 days sober it been a little difficult but does not feel impossible to abstain other than feeling more irritable and having vivid dreams i have been feeling better because i am being more productive and staying busy with things i have previously or ignored i have less of a brain fog and do not feel as fatigued when i was smoking daily i do eventually want to start using again in moderation but i am not sure when that will be for now i am going day by day and making the most of each one ,3,leaves

the_baumer,you definitely will find someone it may not happen as soon as you like but that is the reality of dating in your 20s people in their 20s are still growing it like being an awkward teenager all over again trying to figure out who we are and where we belong in the world for some that means school a full time job traveling the military just tons of options it a transitionary period in our lives and that alone makes it hard to find someone who not only will commit to you but still be the same person they were when they met you it crazy to think how much i have matured and the different things i value from when i was 20 to now i am 25 it not uncommon for people to get cold feet and in fact my current bf was dumped after being in a relationship for a couple months twice in college after that he was single for about 4 years until he met me so my advice is to try to make the best of it i did not enjoy being single until i actually took advantage of the benefits of it more time to try new things meet people hangout with my friends basically just make my own schedule the loneliness feeling is inevitable but that when you turn to things that you enjoy and are not self destructive ,1,depression

the_baumer,since you like the analytical side i like doing both creative and analytical i would suggest you focus on learning programs that can measure marketing metrics and roi you already know marketo and sfdc both of which have good reporting features i would also look into google analytics to measure things like website traffic and conversion with all these tools you can begin to track how your teams digital marketing teams efforts are doing and how it helping to increase sales overtime eventually with all this data you are tracking you will start to see where improvements can be made on the site or from email marketing that can help conversions i also think managing sfdc alone is another huge priority because you want that data to always be as accurate as possible now for getting an mba this is a decision i have been struggling with as well i am four years into my marketing career from graduating with my undergrad and i feel like i have learned so much just from my jobs in marketing alone i have mostly worked for software companies too in my opinion i do not believe an mba is necessary to rise up and do well in marketing it very expensive and time consuming and i just do not see the cost justifying the benefits of simply knowing stuff that i most likely will never use in my role plus i have heard that most bay area companies do not care about advanced degrees and often disregard mba type thinking because it not innovative i think if you take initiative in your role to become the go to analytics person in the marketing department not only will you learn some good skills and tools you will be become integral to your company marketing function i hope this helps you are exactly where i would like to be one day working at a software company in the bay area is a dream of mine so stay hungry and stay foolish as steve jobs would say plus there a lot of online courses that cover mba course subjects i just suggest to really do your research before jumping into an mba program you already have a good foundation from your undergrad studies for what it worth my vp of marketing at my company does not have an mba whereas my coworker at my level has one and does the same type of work i do ,1,jobs

the_baumer,well i was born and raised in south florida and i am still living here from my own experience living here the amount of people that mostly like indie artists is small compared to groups of people that like mainstream pop hip hop edm or latin so we mostly get those artists that come through here on top of that another reason is because touring here is expensive for indie acts that do not have a lot of budget from the edge of the continental america to miami is about 400 miles even bigger indie acts wo not go more than south of atlanta for a major tour ,1,indieheads
the_baumer,it all good but thanks the last half was great and i am glad i got to hear that and the encore uninterrupted i really liked the visuals too they way they did it made it seem like a really intimate experience he was also saying how nice it was for him to be there really genuine person ,1,indieheads

the_baumer,yeah and those were not cheap either it was 50 per seat in my section and i was still not close to the front row the fact that they left halfway through shows me they did not give a shit at all ,6,indieheads
the_baumer,i am sorry that happened to you too i really tried to not let it get to me it still just a show and you have to make the best of it but seeing really good indie artists is difficult even in a big city like miami that type of audience really is not here and for touring logistics it a pain to get all the way down here ,2,indieheads
the_baumer,what you said after we should chill sometime is what you should say instead it not ambiguous and shows what you are really after chill has so many different interpretations at this point it difficult to decipher what a guy actually wants out of you i appreciate the genuine unambiguous approaches but that is just me i cannot speak for all women ,1,Miami
the_baumer,saw sufjan last night in miami his voice live is so on point and perfect it was amazing to hear and he played hotline bling which i was hoping for because it my jam the only issue with the show were the people next to me they were both pretty drunk already and i could tell the second they sat next to me they were going to be obnoxious assholes they did not look like anyone in the crowd at all an older yuppie guy and his scantily clad bleach blonde date or gf and they proceeded to wooo multiple times during every song and have full on conversations during each song i do not mind you being excited and wooing and cheering but for the context of show and the type of songs he singing they were being so obnoxious about it literally no one else was doing it during the songs and everyone else was being very quiet and respectful during the slow songs and this was a sit down concert so really how rowdy are you expecting it to be then the girl said something to the effect of my mom is dying waaah and pretty sure she was mocking his songs by that time everyone around was shushing and telling them to shut up the guy kept saying this is a concert you are all miserable no we are respectful to the artist and everyone around us by not talking and shouting out during each song thank god they left halfway through or else they would have totally ruined it for me sufjan is one of my favorite artists of all time and him coming to miami is a godsend since miami is indie music wasteland ,28,indieheads

the_baumer,if you have seen the show workaholics it basically that but with female main characters same type of humor and situations ,7,TwoXChromosomes
the_baumer,i was hesitant about going to one but i think i am convinced now that i read this thank you where was this one located exactly ,1,Miami
the_baumer,try looking in wilton manors and oakland park these are neighboring cities within the greater fort lauderdale area aside from a few bad pockets in oakland park both are safe and friendly and i have lived there my whole life i would be wary of victoria park while super nice it often a spot for robberies some other nice small neighborhoods towns are lauderdale by the sea poinsettia heights shady banks rio vista coral ridge isles ,6,fortlauderdale
the_baumer,i have looked on ravelry for specific patterns but could not find much although now i will try to look for patterns that have that technique and see what i can find thank you for your help ,1,crochet
the_baumer,i find this true as well the immediate butterflies passion feeling can override your logic i have chased that feeling so many times and later realized how incompatible i actually was to each person you get so caught up the feeling that you do not see the red flags or the true colors of the person i remembered this when i started using okc in september a guy messaged me and it was not until our fourth date when i felt something just click and make my heart beat faster to be fair we are pretty introverted but i liked him and he seemed nice i wanted to try a few dates because i wanted to know if i could see us being together the butterflies and warm fuzzy feelings will come in time if you give the person a chance and if it does not then you will know ,3,OkCupid
the_baumer,check with pp anyway to see if they offer a yi bv test and can prescribe some treatments for you i had a bad case and since i could not see my gyn in a few weeks i went to my local pp instead they ended up taking a swab to test me and prescribed some affordable antibiotics for me they did not take my insurance so my out of pocket was a little over a 100 hope that helps you out ,3,TwoXChromosomes
the_baumer,i went all three days as well overall i really enjoyed it i thought the space was perfect size not too big and small enough to get to other stages super quickly i really liked that it was in one venue since it would have been inconvenient to walk around multiple venues in wynwood most sets started on time as well and parking had no wait there are a few things that could be improved more seating there were ample amounts of empty space and instead of people sitting in the middle of the floor there could have been some benches off to side after being on your feet and dancing for a few hours this becomes an issue including parking fees in the ticket price indoor bathrooms having toilet paper better airflow definitely agree that mainstage got pretty hot if you were not under an a c vent but holy shit the skatespace stage was unbearable after seeing cashmere cat in a packed room i stepped outside drenched in sweat where it was easily 10 degrees cooler too late set times on sunday night they probably thought a lot of people had columbus day off but i do not see the point in putting headliners past midnight if it happens next year i would want to go back miami needs festivals like this i did not get to do any of the activations but for me it was kinda difficult since i wanted to save my energy for the late night acts ,2,Miami
the_baumer,millionyoung did play on the mindmelt stage on friday night i went over at 9 and no one was playing looked around at other stages and did not see him checked his twitter account and saw he was rescheduled for 9 45 that night he put on a great set but iii points should have mentioned that his set time changed ,2,Miami
the_baumer,if you end up not finding the shop head over to r vinyl they may be able to help identify the problem and some ways to fix it yourself ,2,fsu
the_baumer,that my place too i guess it must be a great spot if you are still missing it even in nyc ,1,vinyl
the_baumer,it is a selection bias plus you never know how far these guys get anyway the guys that got into the hookup stage did so because they were just genuine and were not aggressive about looking for sex we all know tinder is mostly used for casual fun so there really no need to be so upfront about it most girls need to meet you first anyway in order to make that decision to hookup or not so you are better off not stating sexual activities right away and easing the pressure off them there is no game or formula to follow be yourself and genuinely get to know them do not overthink it and do not be pushy i think you can be both funny and still reveal who you are what you do in the bio it definitely a plus when a guy does that over some generic lines or random joke ,2,Tinder
the_baumer,girl here you are a good looking guy but i feel it the bio that throwing the majority of girls off it does come off as desperate there are dtf girls on tinder but the cute non crazy ones are going to be much more coy about it and do not want be that explicit about their intentions right off the bat with a complete stranger hence why you are not getting any results with the sexualized bio i would say try the bio without the sexual parts meet up with these girls and see where it goes i think once a girl meets with someone and sees how they are in person they will make up their mind soon enough about whether he worth hooking up with or not ,5,Tinder
the_baumer,of course ,2,Miami
the_baumer,yeah it should be fun have not ever been to one in south florida yet here is the facebook page for the subreddit and they already have an event for it https m facebook com groups 1524567507762169 it at 1pm 8 23 at john u lloyd state park ,1,Miami

the_baumer,i knew a guy i saw on tinder i maybe met him once or twice through a mutual friend over the course of 2 years he was cute so i decided why not we matched and he took me out a few times and we had a good time hooking up so i say go for it and be like hey i know you or something playful ,1,Tinder
the_baumer,so far non sexual has been food sushi brunch sonic gelatto and various non alcoholic drinks since i do not drink much anyway ,3,Tinder

the_baumer,i used ticket titan in january for a careless driving citation i believe i paid 110 for their service and my case was dismissed with no court fees to pay to me it worth taking a chance to fight it because worse case scenario for both options was that i admit guilt and get points anyway ,3,fortlauderdale
the_baumer,i love this and i am really surprised to see very few people for rsd on this subreddit pick up their release it sounds so good pretty much the best record i have so far ,9,vinyl
the_baumer,technics sl d3 found it for 60 and it been great so far but like another person said with their sl d2 i also cannot get the platter off to do an internal cleaning ,2,vinyl
the_baumer,this was my first one and overall it was good i was only looking for two things but made the mistake of going to a more popular record store over another lesser known one thinking they would have more and be worth the wait but it was just like a black friday experience and that made it so unappealing went to the lesser known record store and it was so relaxed with no shoving or madness so lesson learned ,1,vinyl
the_baumer,yep vinyl i got pinback self titled mgmt oracular spectacular and beirut the flying club cup ,3,childfree
the_baumer,it a great place with friendly people unlike radio active they do not have a lot contemporary music aside from the rsd releases it mostly disco dance classic rock and some hip hop but not much ,1,vinyl
the_baumer,went to radio active and the lesser known one i went to after is called we got the beats near federal highway and commercial blvd there was less than 20 people in the store alone ,1,vinyl
the_baumer,i did the crowd was large when i showed up 45 min before opening around 8 15 i did not actually get inside until 10 15 luckily i was not looking for much so i was leaving by 11 and there was still a crowd wrapped around the block probably wo not go there first again just not worth waiting ,1,vinyl
the_baumer,nice i thought about going there but i went to two stores in lauderdale instead ,1,vinyl
the_baumer,it record store day so i spent my morning picking up records at my leisure and will do another day of shopping tomorrow retail therapy is much needed after my breakup 3 weeks ago ,3,childfree
the_baumer,i suppose you went to record rack right ,2,vinyl
the_baumer,from fort lauderdale and this being my first rsd i wanted to go out and see if i could get 2 things i wanted mgmt oracular spectacular and pinback self titled album my only non rsd pickup was beirut the flying club cup ended up getting them overall it was a good experience although i will be hitting up the lesser known store in my area next time to my surprise they had most of the rsd releases even though they sell used and older records ,1,vinyl
