Ninjakick666,i think i would know better than you as to what forums i post on it okay to admit you were wrong your metrics must just be flawed like how did i get this tag you go thru my post history on a regular basis and count the fucking postings in various subs how often do you commit yourself to the arduous task do you start at this sub and check out the post histories of the users here looking for centipedes or do you go to t d and read their post histories looking for conspiracy users again it is okay to admit that you are wrong it will help you learn how to avoid making that same mistake in the future ,2,conspiracy

Ninjakick666,perhaps you are getting confused voting radically accelerates once a post hits the front couple of pages of reddit even if you had solid evidence that a post was artificially boosted with upvotes you still do not have proof that the op was involved in it i know you want people banned but without being able to see upvote farm stats you cannot safely do it mods are busy enough staying on top of rules violations they do not have time to statistically analyze all the posts on this sub in some snipe hunt for evil robots ,9,conspiracy
Ninjakick666,yeah i think your tagging might be a little busted i have never posted 25 posts in t d in all of history the only time i post there is when they are dissecting fbi foia releases ,2,conspiracy
Ninjakick666,yeah but the mods do not have access to upvote and downvote records and a normal users post can get brigaded with votes so banning the op is not a fair way to deal with it i have had a few of my posts get turboboosted with a couple hundred upvotes in an hour or so i do not deserve to get banned just cause bots liked my post ,13,conspiracy

Ninjakick666,yeah i trust government documents that have been filtered through all the appropriate agencies more than i trust a youtube video about a fuckin bing search that just how i roll i could accept that this whole thing was a hoax but the sheer amount of people that would need to be involved is insane and would need to run the gamut of a dozen different compromised agencies the evidence in these files outweighs anything i have seen on this board or anywhere else on the internet if you have got some smoking gun evidence i would love to see it i was always skeptical about what really happened there but these guys have all their ducks in a row looks like the case was handled by professionals and nothing was swept under the rug to me i still wanna know what you think happened do you even think adam lanza was involved at all do you even think he ever existed ,1,conspiracy
Ninjakick666,i am just reading the official documents i am not out there doing a bing search for newtown bee archives minor contradictions can often be chalked up to early reports containing flawed information or just plain old human error the reports give me a pretty large swath of information that all jives together i think a troubled gun nut rich kid went crazy and shot up a whole buncha kids what do you think really happened you think the entire thing was a hoax no one was killed and all the documents and photos are staged ,2,conspiracy
Ninjakick666,there was some bloody hair poking thru the bullet hole in the hat you could still blow a hole in in the top of your head if you stuck a gun on your mouth there was blood in the crime scene photos but all of the ones featuring dead bodies were entirely redacted though the database of photos describes what was in the redacted photos i am guessing the interior of the 3 classrooms is where the majority of the blood would have been located too much detailed documentation for it to be a hoax i know that not what the cool kids think but from the piles of reports i have been thru i do not see any glaring contradictions within the files i have already consumed i still have piles more to go though ,2,conspiracy

Ninjakick666,one theory i heard was that atta did not actually die on 9 11 he bounced off to somewhere else and was not involved in the execution of the plan they why the came up to maine to make sure they stuck out extremely well make sure they were spotted buying boxcutters and remembered later same reason they made sure the luggage did not make it on the flight to leave behind an orgy of evidence including his will which would have been pointless to bring on the flight unless it was printed on the same jetfuel proof paper the other guy passport was made out of so it could be found in the streets beneath the wtc ,9,conspiracy

Ninjakick666,well ya need some bullshit documents and scientific research for the politicians to wave about in the air and they do not come from nowhere they are ghost written by monsanto and handed over to guys in the cdc to sign and claim that they did the research the scientists say that all those pesticides are perfectly fine no matter what the who and the rest of the world thinks ,1,conspiracy

Ninjakick666,maybe the office had waaaaaaaay too many people to begin with and running with a diminished staff is a good stress test of what positions and employees are truly important and which ones are just fluff ,2,conspiracy
Ninjakick666,or maybe assange did not get many emails about sanders because the dnc knew he was a non issue and was not gonna make it past the primaries a forgone conclusion they do not sweat sanders cause he ai not going to be a threat i would help you dig them up but there is no point just dive in and get clicking and i am sure you can turn up some trash talking especially if ya look at the stuff chelsea was mentioned in ,1,conspiracy
Ninjakick666,oh noes wo not someone please think about the fema employees this ai not the correct sub to make those kinda speculations on ,3,conspiracy
Ninjakick666,well i do not think he fired them i just think he not gonna replace them right now there is a lotta sketchy shit going on at the cdc ,4,conspiracy
Ninjakick666,i am not an expert but i remember what i read i am not gonna go digging for it just to appease you cause in the end office gossip is not that important there was not a lot of talk about sanders at all in the leaks it seemed like he was pretty much a non issue ,1,conspiracy
Ninjakick666,eh that political spin prolly wo not work too well in this sub i would guess that the core userbase here ai not the biggest fans of the cdc ,12,conspiracy
Ninjakick666,huh whats special about me those people that thought assange was dead and replaced by a cia controlled cartoon and hannity was in on the whole conspiracy those were mostly children and people driven to post due to political agendas i think the majority of this sub knew he was real when video emerged but a lot were rightfully worried about it for a little stretch there after the internet was cut ,3,conspiracy
Ninjakick666,i would say he released everything he had if he held anything back it would have been a batch that could not be verified but i do not think there was anything like that i read plenty of stuff trash talking clinton and obama it was a shitload of e mails but i read almost all of them so i have seen it it just that is not gonna get much coverage when there is so much juicier stuff in the e mails office gossip does not really get any attention but it is in there ,1,conspiracy

Ninjakick666,yes it does read the article on significant figures not that it really matters cause people talk about 100 accuracy in their published materials and not in their tweets ,6,conspiracy
Ninjakick666,wikileaks is held to a higher standard than other publishers i am sure assange has gotten word that rich was murdered for political reasons but without any evidence he cannot come right out and claim it cause if he did everyone would say prove it and without a leaked file or two to back up his claims he could not prove it ,3,conspiracy
