brlan10,if it relevant for a given person then you will see that reflected in their economic standing and can then use that to make a judgement so there no need to isolate the immeasurable value of racial privilege look at the concrete facts and make a decision from that ,1,explainlikeimfive
brlan10,people experience privilege on a case by case basis there are poor asians even though as a race they perform exceptionally well in american society there are rich black people even though poverty is highly represented in black communities needs should be looked at individually ,2,explainlikeimfive
brlan10,neat thanks ,2,explainlikeimfive
brlan10,i can only speak for myself as a moderate libertarian not a traditional conservative i personally believe basic assistance should be offered based on poverty level more so for disabilities i also believe innate identity racial or otherwise should have no sway on how that need is evaluated ,1,explainlikeimfive
brlan10,at that point the dispute becomes more about how far the role of government extends in the area of leveling the playing field ,1,explainlikeimfive
brlan10,correct me if i am mistaken affirmative action does not look at how poor you are it looks at your racial identity income based financial assistance for college is more along the lines of what i believe you are talking about ,1,explainlikeimfive
brlan10,it would not affirmative action would be a motion toward equality of outcome ,2,explainlikeimfive
brlan10,yeah i would agree with that but terms can sometimes get distorted many self proclaimed liberals will condemn libertarianism as being far right on the economic front ,1,explainlikeimfive
brlan10, will the poor kid even if more talented be able to achieve as high as a result key word is result now you are talking about equality of outcome if the poor kid is more talented then there is a chance he could surpass the rich kid if not surpass at least he would make an above average time equality of opportunity would indeed not be equal either but i will quote my original post some will point out that neither ideology achieves its stated goal ,1,explainlikeimfive
brlan10, i do not have access to due to rich parents connections etc do we have the same opportunities your analogy is a good one the answer would be no but here is how a conservative would view that analogy both runners are in a 100m race but one of them had a far superior coach who offered a far superior training regimen monitoring that imbalance would be outside the racing association ie government jurisdiction ,2,explainlikeimfive
brlan10,by having equal rights for every citizen regardless of race or creed the ideal society in the mind of a conservative as far as i am aware is one that is a pure meritocracy obviously this is impossible to achieve because the family you grow up in is a huge factor in that as well as other purportedly less influential factors but then again equality of outcome is not possible either so you find both sides trying to get as close to their own ideals as they can another way to look at it is this on the liberal extreme you have communism which operates under the motto from each according to their ability to each according to their needs the conservative version of that might look like from each according to their ability to each according to their ability mind you these are both extremes ,4,explainlikeimfive

brlan10,liberal is a pejorative to conservatives conservative is pejorative to liberals this is the way of the world when it comes to opposed ideologies as for equality there are multiple kinds liberals strive for equality of outcome while conservatives strive for equality of opportunity two very different things some will point out that neither ideology achieves its stated goal ,14,explainlikeimfive
brlan10,police officers are supposed to follow the traffic laws when their sirens lights are off however it kind of an unwritten rule that police officers will not pull each other over for minor offenses unless something seems fishy to the officer observing the violation it is generally accepted that police officers need to operate beyond limits of some traffic laws in order to do their job effectively it also not uncommon for a police officer to pull over a civilian car and just let the person go if they show the officer a law enforcement badge it is after all at the discretion of the enforcing officer whether they decide to give a ticket or just a warning ,1,explainlikeimfive

brlan10,disclaimer i do not hold these beliefs but i understand them well as i grew up in a devoutly catholic household and attended 13 years of catholic schooling the idea that personal suffering can be a source of redemption holiness for lack of a better word is a widely held belief in the catholic church this does not mean that you go out inflicting or prolonging suffering on others because it good for them that would be directly in conflict with jesus famous golden rule what it does mean is that when you happen to be experiencing suffering that is out of your control that suffering can be offered in solidarity with christ like your own miniature crucifixion ,1,AskReddit

brlan10,it seems i play a much different style of legion if all you are doing all game is just getting easy duels when the guy was going to die anyway and then disappearing into the jungle until duel is off cooldown what use are you to the team i see duel as a way to force a team fight not just as a damage feed i like to use duel as a disable and get the win and then act as a a tank on steroids in the mid to late game with blademail blink you can win in pretty much any early game scenario if you are not outnumbered bm alows you to create duel opportunities rather than wait for them to come to you blademail also adds to your tankiness and has damage on it so i do not see how those are useless stats after that i head straight for ac this has your attack speed on it plus armor penetration and armor and a teamfight aura the only damage item i will consider on legion if you do not count ac is daedalus more flat damage bigger benefit from crit i do not know why you think attack speed is so important given that you can press the attack before duels but regardless ac fits that bill while also benefiting your team and making you viable as an actual participant in teamfights blademail is great for teamfights as well if you are curious my build is brown boots blink bm ac bkb satanic boots of travel optional cash in of blademail for either heart or daedalus changes slightly depending on the draft ,1,DotA2
brlan10, games like quakelive or starcraft that i really like but never play because the few times i feel like playing i am so out of practice that it isnt enjoyable and i do not want to commit to a full practice schedule just to start enjoying them again completely agree man i was a big starcraft guy a year and a half ago now that i hav not played i do want to go back and play a few games but i am so not current on all the builds and meta that it seems pointless i used to study starcraft for about an hour a day back when i played there no way i could pick that back up again ,1,DotA2
brlan10,this happened to me like 2 days ago ,1,DotA2
brlan10,think about it guys meepo can be a godsend against lich whereas most heroes take the a ton of damage from one bounce meepo takes that same amount of damage from five bounces my strategy is to just eat it and rape face while absorbing all the bounces it saves the rest of your team from having to split and can win you the teamfight ,1,DotA2
brlan10,numbers ftw ,1,DotA2
brlan10,pa is better with omni it imo ,1,DotA2
brlan10,honestly you do not need armlet on legion gasp blademail is much better how can you justify it as being a bad item and why would you get maelstrom either what value does that give you in early game in early game you should be obsessed with winning duels not farming creeps ,0,DotA2
brlan10,overall i agree with this blink blademail as the first items are totally correct i tend to not get caught up in desolator i feel that since legion has such a high potential for flat damage getting a daedalus is better after having an ac and a daedalus duel damage i would much rather have a satanic than a desolator that how you go on rampages just my thoughts ,0,DotA2
brlan10,she a ganker early on but she can turn into a very useful teamfight tank with a monste right click later that why i like to get get the items that will secure her duels blink blademail and then go full tank save for maybe a daedalus ,1,DotA2
brlan10,the thing about legion is that she will become a damage monster by the end because of duel regardless of your build due to this logic i do not desolator has any place in a legion build imo legion builds should be focused on a securing duels and b tankiness as a result i usually build blink dagger and blademail first this will get you all the duels you need then i focus on survivability team fight usually get ac you can get a daedalus because the crit scales excellently since you are going to be getting a ton of bonus damage from duels ,1,DotA2
brlan10,wait call me a lore noob but i thought sargeras was the clear choice for the prime evil ,1,wow
brlan10,boner kill ,2,Berserk
