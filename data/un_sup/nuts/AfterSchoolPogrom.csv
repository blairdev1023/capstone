AfterSchoolPogrom, other choice appointments went to long time members of the bush network these included manuel lujan who was tapped for the department of the interior and former rep ed derwinski who was given the veterans administration shortly to be upgraded to a cabinet post a prominent figure of bush s first year in office was william reilly tapped to be administrator of the environmental portection agency the green police of the regime reilly had been closely associated with the oligarchical financier russell train at the us branch of prince phillip s world wildlife fund and the conservation foundation so many top cabinet posts were thus assigned on the basis of direct personal services rendered to george bush that the collegial principle of any oligarchic system would appear to have been neglected there were relatively few key posts left over for distribution to political financial factions who might reasonably expect to be brought on board by being given a seat at the cabinet table richard thornburgh a creature of the mellon interests who had been given his job under reagan was allowed to stay on but this led to a constant guerilla war between thornburgh and baker with the obvious issue being the 1996 succession to bush clayton yeutter went to the department of agriculture because that was what the international grain cartel wanted the choice of jack kemp a 1988 presidential candidate with a loyal conservative populist base for housing and urban development appeared inspired more by bush s desire to prevent a challenge from emerging on his right in the gop primaries of 1992 than by the need to cater to an identifiable financier faction the tapping of reagan s secretary of education william bennett a leading right wing ideologue and possible presidential prospect to be drug czar is a further example of the same thinking the selection of elizabeth hanford dole to be secretary of labor was dictated by similar intra gop considerations namely the need to placate the angry republican minority leader sen bob dole of kansas a darling of dwayne andreas of archer daniels midland and the rest of the grain cartel later reshuffling of the bush cabinet has conformed to the needs of getting an intrinsically weak candidate re elected especially by accentuating the southern strategy when lauro cavazo left the department of education he was replaced by former tennessee governor lamar alexander when bennett had to be replaced as drug czar the nod went to another republican former southern governor bob martinez of florida all of this was to build the southern base for 1992 when thornburgh quit as attorney general to run for the senate in pennsylvania in the vain hope of positioning himself for 1996 bush tapped thornburgh s former number two at justice william p barr who had been a cia officer when bush was cia director in 1976 for this key police state post but all in all this cabinet was very much an immediate reflection of the personal network and interests of george bush and not representative of the principal financier factions who control the united states we see here once more the very strong sense of national government as personal property for private exploitation which was evident in bush s oil price ploy of 1986 and which will soon characterize his choreography of the gulf crisis of 1990 91 this approach to cabinet appointments could give rise to a surprising weakness on the part of the bush regime should the principal financier factions become disaffected in the wake of the banking and currency panic towards which bush s policies are steering the country bush s shameless exploitation of political appointments and plum jobs for blatant personal advantage became a national scandal when he began to assign certain ambassadorial posts it became clear that these jobs of representing the united states abroad had been virtually sold at auction with the most flagrant disregard for qualifications and ability in return for cash contributions to the bush campaign and the coffers of the republican party these appointments were carried out with bush s approval by a transition team of gop pollster bob teeter bush s campaign aide craig fuller who had lost out on his bid to be white house chief of staff campaign press secretary sheila tate and long time bush staffer chase untermeyer calvin howard wilkins jr who had given over 178 000 to the gop over a number of years including 92 000 to the kansas republican national state election committee on september 6 1988 became the new ambassador to the netherlands penne percy korth was bush s selection for ambassador to mauritius ms korth was a crack gop fundraiser della m newman tapped for new zealand had been bush s campaign chiarman in washington state joy silverman bush s choice for barbados had contributed 180 000 joseph b gilderhorn destined for switzerland had coughed up 200 000 fred bush allegedly not a relative but certainly a former aide and leading fundraiser was the new president s original pick for luxemburg joseph zappala who gave 100 000 was put up for the madrid embassy melvin sembler another member of team 100 was tapped for australia fred zeder a bush crony who had already been the ambassador to micronesia was nominated for the overseas private investment corporation despite a congressional probe of alleged corruption fn 6 as with any group of rapacious oligarchs the bush cabinet was prone to outbreaks of intestine factional warfare among various contending cliques during the first days of the new administration bush s white house counsel boy gray was hit by reports that despite his high government positions over the recent years he had retained a lucrative post as chairman of the board of his family s communications company raising the clear problems of conflicts of interest gray thereupon quit his chairman s post and following bush s own example put his stock into a blind trust gray then lashed out against baker by leaking the fact that baker during all his years as white house chief of staff and secretary of the treasury had kept extensive holdings of chemical banking corp a lending institution that had a direct interest in baker s handling of debt negotiations with third world debtor countries within the framework of the infamous and failed baker plan for international debt service maintenance boy gray also retaliated against baker by questioning the constitutionality of a deal negotiated by baker with the congress for aid to the nicaraguan contras a deal which newsweek classified as bush s only foreign policy success during his first two months in office fn 7 bush had attempted to burnish his image by promising that his new regime would break with the sleazy reagan years by promoting new high standards of ethical behavior in which even the perception of corruption and conflict of interest would be avoided these hollow pledges were promptly deflated by the reality of more graft and more hypocrisy than under reagan ,2,conspiracy
AfterSchoolPogrom,the tarpley book is available to view for free on his website here an excerpt from chapter 23 the end of history http tarpley net online books george bush the unauthorized biography chapter 23 the end of history the bush regime thus took shape as a bureaucratic authoritarian stewardship of the financial interests of wall street and the city of london many saw in the bush team the patrician financiers of the rockefeller administration that never was the groups in society were to be served were so narrowly restricted that the bush administration often looked like a government that had totally separated itself from the underlying society and had constituted itself to govern in the interests of the bureaucracy itself since bush was irrevocably committed to carrying forward the policies that had been consolidated and institutionalized during the previous eight years the regime became more and more rigid and inflexible active opposition or even the dislocations occasioned by administration policies were therefore dealt with by the repressive means of the police state the bush regime could not govern but it could indict and the discrediting committee was aways ready to vilify some observers spoke of a new form of bonapartism sui generis but the most accurate description for the bush combination was the administrative fascism bush s cabinet reflected several sets of optimizing criteria the best way to attain a top cabinet post was to belong to a family that had been allied with the bush walker clan over a period of at least half a century and to have served as a functionary or fund raiser for the bush campaign this applied to secretary of state james baker iii secretary of the treasury nicholas brady secretary of commerce robert mosbacher and bush s white house counsel and top political adviser c boyden gray a second royal road to high office was to have been an officer of kissinger associates the international consulting firm set up by bush s lifelong patron henry kissinger in this category we find gen brent scowcroft the former chief of the kiss ass washington office and lawrence eagleburger the dissipated wreck who was named to the number two post in the state department undersecretary of state eagleburger had been the president of kissinger associates the ambassadorial or proconsul list was also rife with kissingerian pedigrees a prominent one was john negroponte bush s ambassador to mexico overlapping with this last group were the veterans of the 1974 77 ford administration one of the most freemasonic in recent us history national security council director brent scowcroft for example was simply returning to the job that he had held under ford as kissinger s alter ego inside the white house dick cheney who eventually became secretary of defense had been ford s white house chief of staff cheney had been executive assistant to the director of nixon s office of economic opportunity way back in 1969 in 1971 he had joined nixon s white house staff as don rumsfeld s deputy from 1971 to 1973 cheney was at the cost of living council working as an enforcer for the infamous phase ii wage freeze in nixon s economic stabilization program the charming carla hills who became bush s trade representative had been ford s secretary of housing and urban development william seidman and james baker and federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan a reagan holdover who was the chairman of ford s council of economic advisers had also been in the picture under jerry ford bush also extended largesse to those who had assisted him in the election campaign just concluded at the top of this list was governor john sununu of new hampshire who would have qualified as the modern nostradamus for his exact prediction of bush s 9 margin of victory over dole in the new hampshire primary unless he had helped to arrange it with vote fraud another way to carry off a top plum in the bush regime was to have participated in the coverup of the iran contra scandal the leading role in that coverup had been assumed by reagan s own blue ribbon commission of notables the tower board which carried out the white house s own in house review of what had allegedly gone wrong and had scapegoated don regan for a series of misdeeds that actually belonged at the doorstep of george bush the members of that board were former gop senator john tower of texas gen brent scowcroft and former sen edmund muskie who had been secretary of state for carter after the resignation of cyrus vance scowcroft who shows up under many headings was ensconced at the nsc bush s original candidate for secretary of defense was john tower who had been the point man of the 1986 87 coverup of iran contra during the months before the congressional investigating committees formally got into the act tower s nomination was rejected by the senate after he was accused of being drunken and promiscuous by paul weyrich a buckleyite activist and others some observers thought that the tower nomination had been deliberately torpedoed by bush s own discrediting committee so as to avoid the presence of a top cabinet officer with the ability to blackmail bush by threatening to bring him down at any time perhaps tower had overplayed his hand in any case dick cheney a wyoming congressman with strong intelligence community connections was speedily nominated and confirmed after tower had been shot down prompting speculation that cheney was the one bush had really wanted all the time another iran contra veteran in line to get a reward was bush s former national security adviser don gregg who had served bush since at least the time of the 1976 koreagate scandal gregg as we have seen was more than willing to commit the most maladroit and blatant perjury in order to save his boss from the wolves the pathetic drama of gregg s senate confirmation hearings which marked a true degradation for that body has already been recounted later when william webster retired as director of the cia there were persistent rumors that the hyperthyroid bush had originally demanded that don gregg be nominated to take his place according to these reports it required all the energy of bush s handlers to convince the president that gregg was too dirty to pass confirmation bush relented but then announced to his dismayed and exhausted staff that his second and non negotiable choice for langley was robert gates the former cia deputy director who had been working as scowcroft s number two at the national security council the problem was that gates who had already dropped out of an earlier confirmation battle for the cia director s post was about as thoroughly compromised as don gregg but at that point bush s could not be budged a second time so the name of gates was sent to the senate bringing the entire iran contra complex into full public view once again as it turned out the bush democrats in the senate proved more than willing to approve gates still on the iran contra list was gen colin powell whom bush appointed as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff after vice admiral john poindexter and oliver north had departed from the old executive office building in november 1986 reagan had appointed frank carlucci to lead the nsc carlucci had brought along gen powell with colin powell as his deputy carlucci cleaned up the stables of augeias of the oeob nsc complex in such a way as to minimize damage to bush powell was otherwise a protege of the very anglophile caspar weinberger and of carlucci a man with strong links to operation democracy and to the sears roebuck interests the state department too had its iran contra coverup brigade first came thomas r pickering chosen by bush to take over his old post as us ambassador to the united nations a job with cabinet rank when pickering was us ambassador to el salvador during the 1984 85 period he helped arrange shipment of more than 1 million of military equipment to the contras all during a time when this was forbidden by us law according to his own testimony before the congressional iran contra investigating committees pickering did not report any of his doings to the state department but instead kept in close touch with don gregg felix rodriguez and oliver north of bush s retinue pickering when he was ambassador to israel in 1985 86 was also in on israeli third country arms shipments to iran that were supposed to secure the release of certain hostages held in nearby lebanon fn 4 this vulgar gun running filibusterer is now the arrogant spokesman for bush s new world order among the five permanent members of the united nations security council where he dispenses imperial threats and platitudes still on the iran contra coverup honors list we find reginald bartholomew bush s choice as undersecretary of state for security affairs science and technology bartholomew was us ambassador in beirut in september november 1985 when an israeli shipment of 508 us made tow antitank missles was followed by the release of rev benjamin weir an american hostage held by the pro iranian islamic jihad according to the testimony of then secretary of state george shultz to the tower board bartholomew was working closely with oliver north on a scheme to use delta force commandoes to free any hostages not spontaneously released by islamic jihad according to shultz

AfterSchoolPogrom,info zbigniew brzezinski counselor and trustee at the center for strategic and international studies professor of american foreign policy at the school of advanced international studies at johns hopkins university and most famously national security adviser under us president jimmy carter passed away on friday may 26th in a falls church virginia hospital he was 89 brzezinski though hardly a household name enjoyed an influence over international politics that few intellectuals outside elected office can hope to attain in addition to his numerous academic treatises and the role he played in the carter administration he was active in the secretive and influential council on foreign relations and the bilderberg group additionally he co founded the trilateral commission with david rockefeller as investigative journalist daniel estulin exposes in his 2009 book the true story of the bilderberg group all of these bodies convene business and political leaders alongside select members of the press behind closed doors with the aim of undermining sovereign democracies and imposing a policy framework favouring a privileged few estulin s analysis reveals that membership in one or more of these bodies functions as a kind of rite of passage for aspiring presidential candidates in both major us political parties it could be posited therefore that brzezinski given his influential role in these organizations may be more powerful in a sense than elected presidents the application of brzezinski s theories on utilizing ethnic national struggles as a cudgel against the soviet union was supportive in securing the collapse of the ussr however as he would concede in his later writings this approach has proved to be a spectacular failure in terms of attaining what he called us global primacy on the world stage forcing a rethink of his earlier 90s era imperial framework more importantly zbig s strategy has left a trail of bloodshed and mayhem throughout eurasia extending into the middle east north africa and even coming home to roost in major american and european centres zbigniew brzezinski is the author of several pivotal works including between two ages

AfterSchoolPogrom, we must now try to sum up to draw together the threads of what has been said above on the subject of imperialism imperialism emerged as the development and direct continuation of the fundamental characteristics of capitalism in general but capitalism only became capitalist imperialism at a definite and very high stage of its development when certain of its fundamental characteristics began to change into their opposites when the features of the epoch of transition from capitalism to a higher social and economic system had taken shape and revealed themselves in all spheres economically the main thing in this process is the displacement of capitalist free competition by capitalist monopoly free competition is the basic feature of capitalism and of commodity production generally monopoly is the exact opposite of free competition but we have seen the latter being transformed into monopoly before our eyes creating large scale industry and forcing out small industry replacing large scale by still larger scale industry and carrying concentration of production and capital to the point where out of it has grown and is growing monopoly cartels syndicates and trusts and merging with them the capital of a dozen or so banks which manipulate thousands of millions at the same time the monopolies which have grown out of free competition do not eliminate the latter but exist above it and alongside it and thereby give rise to a number of very acute intense antagonisms frictions and conflicts monopoly is the transition from capitalism to a higher system if it were necessary to give the briefest possible definition of imperialism we should have to say that imperialism is the monopoly stage of capitalism such a definition would include what is most important for on the one hand finance capital is the bank capital of a few very big monopolist banks merged with the capital of the monopolist associations of industrialists and on the other hand the division of the world is the transition from a colonial policy which has extended without hindrance to territories unseized by any capitalist power to a colonial policy of monopolist possession of the territory of the world which has been completely divided up but very brief definitions although convenient for they sum up the main points are nevertheless inadequate since we have to deduce from them some especially important features of the phenomenon that has to be defined and so without forgetting the conditional and relative value of all definitions in general which can never embrace all the concatenations of a phenomenon in its full development we must give a definition of imperialism that will include the following five of its basic features 1 the concentration of production and capital has developed to such a high stage that it has created monopolies which play a decisive role in economic life 2 the merging of bank capital with industrial capital and the creation on the basis of this finance capital of a financial oligarchy 3 the export of capital as distinguished from the export of commodities acquires exceptional importance 4 the formation of international monopolist capitalist associations which share the world among themselves and 5 the territorial division of the whole world among the biggest capitalist powers is completed imperialism is capitalism at that stage of development at which the dominance of monopolies and finance capital is established in which the export of capital has acquired pronounced importance in which the division of the world among the international trusts has begun in which the division of all territories of the globe among the biggest capitalist powers has been completed lenin imperialism the highest stage of capitalism ch vii imperialism as a special stage of capitalism https www marxists org archive lenin works 1916 imp hsc ch07 htm ,8,conspiracy

AfterSchoolPogrom,pretty good opportunity to read some lenin socialism and religion https www marxists org archive lenin works 1905 dec 03 htm religion must be declared a private affair in these words socialists usually express their attitude towards religion but the meaning of these words should be accurately defined to prevent any misunderstanding we demand that religion be held a private affair so far as the state is concerned but by no means can we consider religion a private affair so far as our party is concerned religion must be of no concern to the state and religious societies must have no connection with governmental authority everyone must be absolutely free to profess any religion he pleases or no religion whatever ie to be an atheist which every socialist is as a rule discrimination among citizens on account of their religious convictions is wholly intolerable even the bare mention of a citizen s religion in official documents should unquestionably be eliminated no subsidies should be granted to the established church nor state allowances made to ecclesiastical and religious societies these should become absolutely free associations of like minded citizens associations independent of the state only the complete fulfilment of these demands can put an end to the shameful and accursed past when the church lived in feudal dependence on the state and russian citizens lived in feudal dependence on the established church when medieval inquisitorial laws to this day remaining in our criminal codes and on our statute books were in existence and were applied persecuting men for their belief or disbelief violating men s consciences and linking cosy government jobs and government derived incomes with the dispensation of this or that dope by the established church complete separation of church and state is what the socialist proletariat demands of the modern state and the modern church the attitude of the workers party to religion https www marxists org archive lenin works 1909 may 13 htm fwv15e148 social democracy bases its whole world outlook on scientific socialism i e marxism the philosophical basis of marxism as marx and engels repeatedly declared is dialectical materialism which has fully taken over the historical traditions of eighteenth century materialism in france and of feuerbach first half of the nineteenth century in germany a materialism which is absolutely atheistic and positively hostile to all religion let us recall that the whole of engels s anti d hring which marx read in manuscript is an indictment of the materialist and atheist d hring for not being a consistent materialist and for leaving loopholes for religion and religious philosophy let us recall that in his essay on ludwig feuerbach engels reproaches feuerbach for combating religion not in order to destroy it but in order to renovate it to invent a new exalted religion and so forth religion is the opium of the people this dictum by marx is the corner stone of the whole marxist outlook on religion marxism has always regarded all modern religions and churches and each and every religious organisation as instruments of bourgeois reaction that serve to defend exploitation and to befuddle the working class at the same time engels frequently condemned the efforts of people who desired to be more left or more revolutionary than the social democrats to introduce into the programme of the workers party an explicit proclamation of atheism in the sense of declaring war on religion commenting in 1874 on the famous manifesto of the blanquist fugitive communards who were living in exile in london engels called their vociferous proclamation of war on religion a piece of stupidity and stated that such a declaration of war was the best way to revive interest in religion and to prevent it from really dying out engels blamed the blanquists for being unable to understand that only the class struggle of the working masses could by comprehensively drawing the widest strata of the proletariat into conscious and revolutionary social practice really free the oppressed masses from the yoke of religion whereas to proclaim that war on religion was a political task of the workers party was just anarchistic phrase mongering and in 1877 too in his anti d hring while ruthlessly attacking the slightest concessions made by d hring the philosopher to idealism and religion engels no less resolutely condemns d hring s pseudo revolutionary idea that religion should be prohibited in socialist society to declare such a war on religion engels says is to out bismarck bismarck i e to repeat the folly of bismarck s struggle against the clericals the notorious struggle for culture kulturkampf ie the struggle bismarck waged in the 1870s against the german catholic party the centre party by means of a police persecution of catholicism by this struggle bismarck only stimulated the militant clericalism of the catholics and only injured the work of real culture because he gave prominence to religious divisions rather than political divisions and diverted the attention of some sections of the working class and of the other democratic elements away from the urgent tasks of the class and revolutionary struggle to the most superficial and false bourgeois anti clericalism accusing the would be ultra revolutionary d hring of wanting to repeat bismarck s folly in another form engels insisted that the workers party should have the ability to work patiently at the task of organising and educating the proletariat which would lead to the dying out of religion and not throw itself into the gamble of a political war on religion this view has become part of the very essence of german social democracy which for example advocated freedom for the jesuits their admission into germany and the complete abandonment of police methods of combating any particular religion religion is a private matter this celebrated point in the erfurt programme 1891 summed up these political tactics of social democracy anyone interested in richard wurmbrand should read his thoroughly hilarious book marx and satan https www amazon com marx satan
