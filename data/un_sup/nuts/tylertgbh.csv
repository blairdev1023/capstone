tylertgbh, the problem is i only have 90 followers and when my plate sees this things come to a halt how do you know this do you really know for sure that a girl decides not to go on a date with you because you have too few ig followers are they actually telling you it because of that that just sounds absurd ,1,TheRedPill
tylertgbh,are you really suggesting people discard their smouldering cigarette butts into a paper container ,1,toronto

tylertgbh,is there an online opportunity to disagree with or review the ticket online do not know if it similar but i got a parking ticket from metrolinx once there were online options to pay or review it and to fight it i think required going to court i selected to have the infraction reviewed which was an easy process where i think i just typed in why i thought the ticket was incorrect and within a couple days they cut the fine in half and i just decided to pay that 20 ,1,askTO

tylertgbh, the company has a policy where all reps make the same base salary of 55k if this policy exists in writing then that 55k must be denoted in a specific currency assuming it may just be listed as 55 000 in the policy then i would suggest it safe to infer it usd since it an american company unless they have a caveat somewhere in the policy stating 55k in local currency but i would doubt that based on that then it seems to me that the company policy is 55k usd base try to confirm this and bring it to management ,14,PersonalFinanceCanada
tylertgbh,1 it really depends on what you end up doing after college the college atmosphere world makes it easy to meet girls and go to parties etc after college you have to put in a lot more effort to keep up a social group also once you join the workforce assuming it a typical white collar or otherwise 9 5 job it becomes much more difficult and tiring to keep up a social life like you had in college in terms of game it harder to casually meet girls while in college you will meet girls in class at parties on campus etc once you start working its tougher to casually meet girls as youre spending most of your time at work where you shouldnt be pursuing girls 2 i have not peaked by any means as i am only in my early mid 20s but my smv has certainly increased since university partly because i found trp and started lifting in my last year i will describe my experience like this when you finish high school say approx 60 of people go on to college so roughly 40 stop improving after high school they dress the same they act the same their immature attitude doesnt change much and they are much less likely to further their learning then you go through college and at the end of college 60 70 of people stay the same they dress the same act the same etc and you have only about 30 of the people who went to college who then graduate get good jobs and continue to improve themselves and let keep in mind this is only about 10 15 of people you went to high school with so only that small percentage of people continue to improve themselves once they reach their mid 20s most people become complacent once they get to certain stages in their life so the point of that is to describe what i have noticed as i continue to improve myself most of my peers have plateaued or otherwise give up when you continue to improve yourself after college it means continuing learning for example reading books even though you do not have to reading good quality news sources so you actually understand what is going on in the world and effecting the economy and politics it means getting involved in organizations outside of work which may give you additional skills knowledge or may supplement your work skills that helps you become better than your coworkers all this also demonstrates ambition which is really attractive to girls also you can improve your clothing and style that means having an apartment that looks like an adult with some class lives there not a frat boy that means being able to dress yourself and portray a sense of style and personality i am absolutely astonished when i meet up with old friends from high school who are now in their mid 20s but they still dress the exact same as they did in high school how can they expect to command respect or attract top quality girls when they literally dress the same as a 16 year old all this adds up when you meet girls you are more likely to stand out from the sea of dicks you will be more interesting more mature this means that when you go on tinder or otherwise meet a horny 19 year old girl looking for a casual dick to ride you are light years more sexy and attractive than the fratboys and man children this 19yo knows in her day to day life just think of any movie or tv show characters that young girls drool over they want to go home with a mike ross or harvey spector few men can play that role ,6,asktrp

tylertgbh,i believe there is at least here in canada the health agency has guidelines on what makes the fish safe to consume raw sushi grade the guidelines are about how the fish has been frozen by freezing it to a certain temperature for a certain amount of time it will guarantee that any parasites or worms that may exist in the fish have been killed the regulations require the fish that is intended to be consumed raw shall be frozen before preparation and serving to a temperature of 20 c or below for seven days or to a temperature of 35 c for 15 hours parasites or worms carried by some fish are killed in the freezing process ,1,sushi
tylertgbh,i also wonder why they let their own apartments fall into disrepair i agree if it the landlord obligation to fix things then they should and a lot of repair jobs require special skill but one woman interviewed on ctv was showing her apartment where she lived for 30 years the kitchen cabinetry was an awful pink shade clearly from the late 80s early 90s and was caked in grease and grime and despite her living there for 30 years she had clearly never cleaned or repaired anything how can you live somewhere and let your own living space fall into disgrace like that to not even clean or go buy a new hinge for the cabinet door for 5 bucks at the hardware store or not even buy some paint and paint over the horrid dis coloured 30 year old pink colour hard to give sympathy ,3,toronto
tylertgbh,i understood that scene as blythe just wanting to do whats democratic or otherwise not being interested in ramming through the filibuster maybe he was more loyal to francis and was not willing to help claire out for a split ticket but the thing with that scene was claire was trying to push blythe into supporting her as vp even if it meant her being vp to conway because claire only cares about is more interested in her own advancement not francis so claire wanted him to push for her to be vp so then she could at least be vp and maybe succeed conway claire wasnt interested in tying herself to francis ,3,HouseOfCards

tylertgbh, is a 20 savings rate good yes 20 is the general number you should be looking for but what is spending money in your budget that does not count as a real category a budget is for determining where you are putting your spending money for example personal care or eating out or netflix etc these are examples of discretionary spending aka spending money put your money in real categories the rest you should add to your savings creating a pending money category just gives you licence to waste money also when you mention your net income is this after tax you should be using the after tax amount for your budget in my opinion ,2,PersonalFinanceCanada

tylertgbh,their sushi is crap because it refrigerated so long the rice goes hard but this is not something any competitor can really get around either anyone dealing in their niche will have to deal with the same problem unless someone comes up with a way to stop the rice from going hard and dry in the fridge in which case they have a disruption i agree they have competition in the grocery stores i have had some pretty good sushi sold in grocery stores that made daily on site but bento i think has a good hold on the to go sushi you will find in a gas station or wherever the distributors like sodexo distribute to it a low grade niche but a market for it certainly seems to exist ,1,CanadianInvestor
tylertgbh,those other options you mention are not really competition though nobody is seriously deciding between going to a sit down sushi restaurant or buying refrigerated to go sushi ,1,CanadianInvestor
tylertgbh,their sushi is pretty crappy because it refrigerated for so long but they do seem to have a good hold on the are fridgerated on the go sushi market niche what makes their product not very good is the refrigeration but i do not see how any competitor can get around that i imagine they will lose the grocery store sales over time i have had much better quality from grocery stores that made daily and in the fridge for much less time their strength is probably the food distribution companies like sodexo and being the go to gas station sushi ,1,CanadianInvestor
tylertgbh,lol low wage workers always talk bs like that in reality they wo not make the move and even if they did finally put in the effort to get a new job they will be disappointed when they find out the grass is not greener a minimum wage job is a minimum wage job i would also like to point out how funny pathetic it is that these people would so easily switch to another min wage job just for less stress rather than continue in their current role to maximize their opportunity for seniority to actually eventually more than min wage ,5,PersonalFinanceCanada
tylertgbh,most likely not the only reason to increase your wage is if they have to do that in order to keep someone in the role could you suddenly find a job at another company that pays more if not then your company wo not pay you more ,2,PersonalFinanceCanada
tylertgbh,i agree with you that pay should be regulated to ensure people get paid decently so they can live a minimum standard which is why i also see the importance of mandating an appropriate amount of vacation time for labourers i do not see where you disconnect mandating pay to ensure people have a certain standard of living but then argue that paying them to not work is just bad business i agree those affected by the increase to 3 weeks are the low skill blue collar workers tim horton staff general labourers in a manufacturing facility cleaners etc if you care about ensuring people have a minimum salary to ensure a basic quality of life how do you not see the importance of having time off work as a component of a minimum quality of life vacation time is not necessarily for vacation the people affected by this are the people who end up having to take their vacation days out of necessity these people get maybe 2 3 sick days per year what happens if youre sick for a week they use their vacation days on being sick what happens if your kid gets sick and you have to stay home with them vacation days these are the people who have to take vacation days because they have to spend half a day at the doctors or the hospital to get a test done an extension the of the mandated vacation time is just to try to ensure people have a minimum quality of life the same as wage increases in a modern and civilized society labourers deserve time away from work this is just the government recognizing that part of ensuring a minimum quality of life means ensuring workers get some time off from work without having to worry about losing a week worth of wages ,3,PersonalFinanceCanada
tylertgbh,sorry but it really sounds like you do not know what you are talking about it sounds like you are reiterating a lot of the oversimplified ideas and misconceptions that tend to be pushed by radio show hosts or the sun these companies are already operating in us dollars it does not matter where their manufacturing plant is located so talk about conversion is not relevant also their supply networks already span both sides of the border it half the parts for the car are already coming from the us and half are already coming from canada if you relocate the plant to the us that is not going to change you speak as if you think by simply moving the manufacturing plant to the us the company would suddenly find all new american suppliers to buy cheaper parts from corp tax rates are higher than the us this is categorically false ontario has some of the lowest corporate tax rates in north america have you not heard trump complaining about the need to lower corporate taxes in the us because they are so uncompetitive this is one thing he right on up to now canada has enjoyed a large advantage in corporate tax rates compared to the united states this advantage has benefited canada in many ways like the incentive for multinational firms to book taxable profit here in canada rather than in the united states as exemplified by the burger king head office move back in 2014 the current america corporate tax rate is 35 federally with state rates averaging around four per cent more while the canadian rate is only 15 with most provincial rates in the 11 to 12 range source http www canadianbusiness com economy how the trump tax cuts could drive canadian corporate tax rates down too i merely mentioned they are already closing down plants because the cost to produce in ontario is not viable anymore and you suggested they are going to the us when in fact any relocation of manufacturing is going to mexico canada is a developed country and we are simply not going to be able to compete nor should we with developing countries like mexico for low skill jobs like that and while low skill manufacturing jobs are being moved to developing countries like mexico the auto companies are adding jobs here in ontario to beef up their r d and high tech divisions however also think down the road are people going to want to be working hard jobs making 18 an hour opposed to something that is less taxing on their bodies for 3 an hour not really sure what your point is but yes there will always be young men willing to do harder labour for an extra 8k per year though i do not agree with your premise that people doing hard jobs will have the skill set and experiences that would make it easy or possible for them to simply get a new job in a new industry ,3,PersonalFinanceCanada

tylertgbh, take the us car manufacturers are you really suggesting these companies pay minimum wage to a significant portion of their employees i knew guys in high school working on the line at these companies making way over minimum wage anyways the auto companies receive large investments from the province that are designed in part to counterbalance some of the higher costs of doing business in ontario it pretty silly to say these companies are going to rip up their entire logistics network and multi year business plans and throw away 100s of millions of dollars of government investment for company r d just because a minimum wage salary definitely a small portion of their salary base is increasing a couple thousand dollars ,4,PersonalFinanceCanada

tylertgbh,thanks others have mentioned my transit expense being below the monthly pass if i were to stick with the 1600 rent i will choose a location walking distance to work which means i would only need ttc on weekends and the odd social outing food i agree is high but this includes some eating out as others have suggested i will revise my budget to separate groceries and eating out i like that you have offered critiques to my leftover amount as i mentioned i have no debt and even after paying first last month rent i would have a few thousand or more in the bank obviously not ideal but contributing approx 500 to that every month isnt horrible and certainly allows room for the one time sudden expenses you listed my thinking is that this leftover amount is short term and as i earn higher income over time it will grow into a larger amount as for the one time expenses you mentioned i just got a new phone likely wont need to replace it for 3 5 years i had my last one for nearly 5 years only replaced it because the ios was getting too laggy my mac is going fine but i could manage 1k for a new one trips vacations are a luxury i accept to be out of my lifestyle at this point employer would have benefits for dental and i will add my 25 worth of subscription services to my budget the trade off seems to be a nice convenient place to live vs contributing a meaningful amount to savings it just unfortunate that the housing options in toronto are either you get something really good for 1500 1600 or something crappy for 1200 1400 with very little middle ground ,1,PersonalFinanceCanada

tylertgbh,in white collar work environments you will generally become friendly with a female colleague equal in the company hierarchy who around the same age she may be in the same department or one nearby so you tend to see each other often but you probably do not work together 24 7 she someone you naturally get along with and who you are friendlier with than others in the office this would be a work wife essentially it a girl you are friends with in the office you are not meeting up with seeing her outside of work unless it within a larger group of work mates edit incase it not obvious the work wife relationship should not isnt supposed to be sexual or romantic just someone you are friends with at work but of course depending on the person and workplace culture there could be sexual undertones and these sorts of relationships are no doubt how workplace hookups and relationships develop ,17,TheRedPill

tylertgbh,interesting take in suggesting that it not worth acting morally because most others do not but you are logic and interpretation of machiavelli teaching are not totally accurate in the prince machiavelli teaches that in order to gain and hold power one cannot necessarily act morally all the time because others act immorally as you suggest but one must be amoral in deciding what action to take or refrain from simply because they must follow the strategy he prescribes this however does not mean there is no such thing as morality as another person said machiavelli also said one should appear moral and can act morally when it in your favour your action can be moral despite you being amoral in your decision to act it dangerous to convolute this need to be amoral in making decisions with the suggestion that there no such thing as immorality a prince must be able to recognise what is immoral because as mentioned above one should appear moral also to suggest there is no such thing as morality because many people act immorally is a flawed argument morality can still exist even if literally 100 acted immorally at some point in their lives anyways most people probably would call themselves moral and most people judge others based on whether or not they appear moral which again is why machiavelli reminds the prince of the importance of appearing moral ,2,TheRedPill

tylertgbh,i worked for a lease financing brokerage for a bit what a shitty business but 1 thing i learned is do not sign up to get your credit checked with anyone unless you have to you can never trust whether it will be a soft or hard hit personally i have never even found any explanation or evidence for what these terms mean or if they even exist furthermore you should be more concerned with the fact that mogo told op their system reviews accounts continually and that a no today maybe a yes tomorrow which to me implies that they are hitting your report every month which can significantly lower your score some of the worst credit reports i have seen have 5 hits on the credit history from the same company because almost certainly unknown to the client some car dealership checked their credit month after month after month ,6,PersonalFinanceCanada

tylertgbh,honestly while i sympathize how on earth does your friend get a loan and not know or understand what his interest payments will be i have never used mogo but i am sure the interest was articulated to him likely as a rate and not as monthly payments before he accepted the loan so what did your friend expect to pay in interest i have to wonder why you did not mention this in your post it definitely odd that mogo seemingly does not want to service you as a client seeing as you have such a high score likely they know they cannot make much money off you so it not worth it it even worse that they keep giving you a run around i speed read the second half but why are you still trying to get the monthly credit check report through mogo when they told you their system reviews accounts continually and that a no today maybe a yes tomorrow that most likely means they are going to be hitting your credit report with a inquiry every month are you aware of that or are you going to make another post in 5 months written in all caps complaining that you cannot believe they hit your credit report every month and they never told you edit op it will be very telling whether or not you actually answer the questions being asked here are you interested in learning improving your your friend financial literacy or do you just want to badmouth a company and then go and make the same mistakes again ,12,PersonalFinanceCanada

tylertgbh,i think their primary motivation is an anti establishment discontent i think fundamentally these are people who have seen wealth and company profits climb higher and higher over the last 40 years and saw that all that increase in wealth went only to the rich and the well connected while they saw their own wages go nowhere and saw their own jobs disappear these are people who grew up believing that if you worked hard and played by the rules you could have a good life but then they found out that was not true i think these are people who have seen the rich politicians elites over the last 40 years just make themselves richer at the expense of the average hard working person the same group of people sanders pulled support from ultimately these are people who deep down feel like they have been left on the side of the road left behind and now voting for trump is a chance at recourse a chance to express their discontent with the pillaging of the economy they contributed to and were meant to share the profits of ,6,OutOfTheLoop

tylertgbh,there little to no evidence that the majority of people who make up the alt right are fundamentally racist and sexist this is a common accusation used by their opponents but its honestly pretty baseless and for context i am a card carrying member of the canadian liberal party i in no way sympathize or agree with the alt right except on pot legalization maybe your comment is really no different than a trump supporter saying clinton is literally corrupt while some people who make up the alt right are no doubt racist and sexist it a stretch to say that most people are and there no evidence that racism or sexism is their primary motivation also i think the alt right has a lot of internet trolls from 4chan who enjoy making racist sexist memes this probably gives a misleading impression ,31,OutOfTheLoop

tylertgbh,the youth supporters of all candidates tend to create online communities and promote their candidates online for example many years ago during the 2008 and 2012 elections ron paul had very strong online support much more than any candidate sanders and trump were the two candidates this election who had a lot of support from youth who are active online so there was a lot of organic support for these candidates online naturally with any topic that has a lot of people interested in it different subreddits were created by these supporters moreover i know there are multiple trump subreddits because at one point the admins mods of the original trump sub had disagreements on what sort of content should be allowed or promoted i think it was something along the lines of real campaign content vs memes so the ousted mods created another trump subreddit i dont know why you are seeing sanders subs now i havent seen any since he threw his support to hillary at the convention ,3,OutOfTheLoop
tylertgbh,one of hillary biggest problems is the perception that she is a liar corrupt and extremely elitist in reality she probably no more corrupt and no more of a liar than any other american politician of her caliber but the clinton campaign does a very poor job of fighting this perception for example just last week her campaign was caught lying about and covering up the fact that she has pneumonia so when there are instances of her being proven to be a liar it spurs the hatred and rumours trump supporters on the other hand have a very fascist view of trump that is to say trump is more of a symbol and they idolize him to an irrational level so while trump has actually lied a lot more than clinton during this campaign his supporters just do not care it just an oddity of politics politics is emotional and almost always irrational ,5,OutOfTheLoop
tylertgbh,the clinton campaign has spent millions on online campaign efforts which included trolls memes commenters on internet forums it was her campaign attempt to keep up with organic online support for trump and sanders ,1,OutOfTheLoop
tylertgbh,1 because it makes her look weak and therefore less presidential or less capable of handling the stress and challenges that come with the presidency it also proved many trump supporters right because for the past few weeks they have been attacking clinton as being too weak 2 this is an extreme hypothetical and pretty much certainly not going to happen the dnc is in clinton pocket so they will not remove her unless she wants it to happen which she wouldnt the real question is what if she happened to drop dead and in that case yes the dnc would have to pick appoint a new nominee 3 i do not know the process of how the dnc would choose a new nominee and frankly i doubt if anyone truly understands that process 100 aside from a few poly sci legal geeks at the dnc internal party regulation and by laws and constitutions are very complicated the answer to your question though it probably all of the above from my experience with internal party processes like this is that anything is possible it just a matter of what the power holders want ,2,OutOfTheLoop
tylertgbh,because she saying that half of trump supporters or half of republican voters hold their beliefs simply because they are racist islamophobic homophobic etc she primarily getting flack because obviously thats offensive and just writes off tens of millions of people many trump voters have legitimate reasons to vote for him but her comment makes it seem as if she doesnt care and that their views are just wrong so she just writes them all off as racist is short she saying that the issues to matter to republican voters are irrelevant is was a really stupid comment for her to make because clinton biggest problem is that she is perceived to be elitist and out of touch those comments just confirm that perception to a lot of older blue collar americans who feel that trump represents them ,6,OutOfTheLoop
tylertgbh,edit some other users have correctly pointed out that my description does not describe the origin or intent of the the alt right explained here https www reddit com r outoftheloop comments 533can what is altright d7pr5oe my description below describes trump supporters and their new conservatism i think many in the mainstream and media do and will end up conflating these two groups with one label alt right alternative right it a way to describe the new right wingers or conservatives who now make up much of the republican party that is to say they are strongly associated with trump the alt right is different from the traditional right wingers and traditional conservatives because they tend to be more explicitly nationalist more isolationist anti free trade and they tend to be more socially liberal libertarian libertarian on some social issues for example they care less about gay marriage and are more inclined to support marijuana legalization etc they also have very strong anti establishment views also the alt right tends to be portrayed in the media as and usually are much more willing to be explicitly offensive so they tend to openly oppose sjws and blm they also will openly and strongly oppose illegal immigration and hold strong views against islamic terrorism they also tend to believe more conspiracy theories this is a big change from the traditional conservatives who have made up the republican party over recent years the john mccain and romney crowd were very pro war very supportive of free trade quite tough on social and religious issues like intensifying the war on drugs these are classic establishment types the new beliefs of the alt right are significant because they represent a big change from what conservatives used to stand for in america if you recall the tea party movement that was the most recent significant shift of beliefs among right wing conservative americans but they were still at least consistent with the traditional conservative values i outlined above it was a sort of a doubling down on traditional conservative ideas the alt right now abandons many of these values ,186,OutOfTheLoop

tylertgbh, so what is something i could have done to kake her realize hat ohh he a guy hat wants to date me how to make her realize that you want to actually date her well offer to take her out on an actual date you might settle by doing a simple date like getting coffee drinks not much pressure or since you are in school you could even try to meet her and hang out at a social function party again she will feel less pressure she was open to hanging out rather than jumping to an actual date so she wants to get to know you without committing yet but you shot yourself in the foot when you went from wanting a date date to calling it actually just a hang out which are two very different things and made her think you were scheming to get sex you will have to redeem yourself now by making her feel comfortable not pressured if she meets you ,2,asktrp
tylertgbh,she was open to hanging out casually dating but you made it look like you are just looking for a hook up which you probably were when you say lets have a date date but what i meant was a hang out she didnt wa not to hook up right off the bat so she ended the conversation ,1,asktrp

tylertgbh,makes sense if you are passing a constant stream of cars but if there a gap for you to move over then why not just let the guy pass and move back into the left lane ,3,canada
tylertgbh, the problem is that everyone on the road thinks they are going as fast as any car should be i actually do not think this is usually the case i bet in most cases the person driving slow in the left lane is just clueless if someone tailgates them or even honks they then get offended and out of their own stupidity they fail to realize they are in the wrong and they just blame the other guy as an asshole ,5,canada
tylertgbh,it not about impatience i tend to drive fast but it has nothing to do with patience i also walk fast would you suggest that also because i am impatient when i am driving it to get somewhere and i am paying attention to what i am doing and i travel at a reasonable speed to get me there that how driving should work i would say it actually the contrary those who drive slow especially in the left lane are thoughtless and not paying attention to what they are doing the only times i find myself driving slowly is when i am in lala land or otherwise deep in thought about something and not concentrating on driving people have different preferences for the speed they drive if i am cruising at a totally reasonable speed maybe 120 instead of 100 then why should i have to hit my breaks and slow down and wait behind someone else because they are either too stupid or selfish to stop blocking others in a public space i thought that was basic driving school lesson material too bad driving lessons are not mandatory ,5,canada

tylertgbh,by margin i was just asking what sort of profit you tend to make on avg ex buy land for 100k improvements for 20k sell for 200k gives you a 40 margin just trying to get an idea of the numbers you are working with in this sort of business i am sure it varies quite a bit but i was mostly curious what the average is to get a rough idea ,3,Entrepreneur
tylertgbh,can you approximate or give some realistic example dollar figures you work with if you are selling to the sort of blue collar low income people you describe there and selling properties for double what you paid you must be buying this land for dirt cheap i am really curious what sort of numbers you are talking ,3,Entrepreneur

tylertgbh,thanks for replying my question is more so for a sole proprietorship if you own a business but it is not incorporated you claim these expenses against your personal taxes you declare these things as business expenses and it goes into your tax calculations if you claim the expenses on your personal taxes what are you getting back ignoring other stuff that might cause you to owe taxes you are going to get a tax refund from these expenses but what is being refunded is it all the tax you paid on dollar value of the expenses just a portion of the tax you paid or is there some scheme where because its a business expense for a sole proprietor you will be refunded the full amount of the expense ,2,PersonalFinanceCanada

tylertgbh,i am glad surprised you responded you have offered some good examples some are random comments from who knows who some are links to posts with a rating of 0 which might tell you something but also yes there are elements of sexism and some guys in there are pretty radical but i could equally go onto tumblr and find just as many examples of radical man hating feminists saying crazy shit about how all men should die etc etc there are always radicals on the fringes if you just take a look at the main page of the sub at the very top is a 30 day challenge encouraging men to gain confidence by learning to talk more be more outgoing woman hating no going down the posts i see some pointers on how to deal with relationship problems some political posts a post offering advice to young guys to shut up and learn rather than spouting your mouth off which also encourages them to get outside off the computer a funny story etc none of those look like they are promoting rape or crazy sexism to me that being said i have done some more poking around trp and it seems to have changed since i read it regularly it become much more sex based anyways my conclusion when i first explored the sub a while ago was it was an outlet for guys who have been fucked over by women financially screwed broken heart etc and what it tries to offer is an explanation and advice on how to prevent it in the future does that make the sexism okay no but this is ignored everyone just jumps on the hate wagon assuming this stuff just comes out of nowhere i guess it looks like you have read through the sub a bit but did you wonder just why so many guys are so angry with women i think the ironic thing about all the women hating on trp is that it ultimately just a response from guys who have been heart broken and sometimes financially ruined by women they invested a lot of emotional capital into and while i certainly do not agree with everything trp proposes i have to say there quite a bit of empirical evidence offered to support their theories ,2,canada
tylertgbh,right so it not really about women being dumb the men doing their own thing is about accepting that unfortunately you cannot necessarily rely on women in the same way one would a good male friend this article seeks to explain that i always viewed this as more of a damn your life sucks youre on your own better get used to it thing which is why you need to become confident self sufficient etc ,1,canada
tylertgbh,well this one just fucked ,1,canada
tylertgbh,so then why not explain how it sinister i am asking for the second time now i have no interest in bullshitting a random person on the internet i am telling you what it is the fact that you cannot explain how it sinister just goes to show you either have not read it or you have misinterpreted it ,1,canada
tylertgbh,sinister what do you think it some secret club where they joke about beating women i really dont get where the vilification of these groups comes from the premise is not inister some of the premise used in rp theory of why women act certain ways could be considered sexist i guess though its often very well substantiated with empirical evidence it just designed to explain things from a male perspective i certainly would not call it inister ,2,canada
tylertgbh,so odd how men being confident and living according to how they want are so strongly shamed by society if you have certain preferences for gender roles you are automatically pro rape and view women only as sex objects it fucking absurd this is where feminism has brought us you must subscribe to their world view or else you are evil ,-1,canada
tylertgbh,i am going to disagree with your assertion of red pillers being homophobic i am gay and i have spent some time in that sub commenting etc the general response towards gay guys has been positive in my experience anyways i think it nonesense that simply being confident and not feeling the need to change yourself for women automatically makes you view women as sex objects let stop shaming people for their preferences ,0,canada

tylertgbh,ya you are right you should really examine your exual preference you really need to interrogate what lies behind your claimed homosexuality you probably like women but you have become lazy you must be confused by all the misconceptions out there the reason you think this is almost always because of underlying problems with your thinking you should go to a therapist you are not thinking right fuck you and your pathetic self hate trying to force others to like what you like i have already dealt with nonsense like this in high school ,1,gaybros
tylertgbh,irl not much on here yes whenever there is a thread talking about race or talking about grindr hooking up and race any comment that even alludes to simply not being sexually attracted to non white races is downvoted to oblivion with accusations of ignorance racism etc the article this very thread links to is shaming dw for only having white guys in his videos you can probably assume that what dw is into apparently there something wrong with that though ,3,gaybros

tylertgbh,the problem is is it okay for davey to focus his videos on an archetype he and many people find attractive young fit white men or should he be forced to add every conceivable preference other people might have into his videos just because he has high viewership the latter is absurd i think his videos are pretty dumb i stopped watching them by the time i was about 20 but the only reason i ever watched them is because he and his guests were hot simple that his selling proposition i say if people dont like it do not buy the product ,-4,gaybros

tylertgbh,i have certainly had this problem it far harder to flirt with girls than guys i noticed this when i first switched from grindr to tinder for women and asked my female friends what the problem was i think the problem comes from a fundamental difference between how men and women view relationships or how they view the interaction of getting courted when you are flirting with a guy it an even playing field it an honest conversation if the guy you have struck conversation with is interested he interested and he will put in equal effort on the other hand with a woman she looking to be woo would all the pressure is on you to be interesting and create a connection this is why on grindr hey will generally get you a reply from another guy and every conversation starts with the basic hey whats up etc meanwhile using hey as an opening line on tinder doesnt get you anywhere half the time it not good enough not to mention it makes you 1 of a million also worth noting that many women are looking for attention but not a date hookup relationship i have known far too many women who sit on tinder and engage in conversations with absolutely 0 interest in the guys their talking to it just a different dynamic that i have yet to figure out i do not think you can apply the same approach as you would a guy not that i agree with the theory but there a reason why the whole r theredpill subreddit exists its pretty much a theory on how women view dating sex as some irrational competition to achieve the best mate and how to manipulate them into wanting to have sex with you ,7,bibros

tylertgbh, prentice comments about not preparing and spending frivolously these comments just reflect the conservative fiscal economic values albertans claims to believe in fiscal conservatives preach independence and small government because it the individual job to choose how to spend their own money including saving it themselves to them pay for needed services instead of for example the govt garnishing wages taxes and offering a free service in return it just goes to show that the people like to talk to the talk but do not walk the walk themselves i guess the people got annoyed he pointed it out this also adds to people my lack of sympathy for the albertans where the conservative fiscal responsibility you preach you should have massive savings accounts to last you a long time with bloody 10 income tax that exactly what the pc government did which partly the point i am making they were in government for 40 years but never did the electorate pressure the government to prepare for anything effort was aimed at lowing taxes and government involvement in the economy partly a stale lazy government but i think it was likely a conservative short sighted view that the free market would keep growing ,8,canada

tylertgbh,well from the perspective of a laurentian liberal warning generalizations the people of alberta are at fault for the position they are in they are classically ignorant stuck in their ways short sighted conservatives the entire effing province was based on oil and oil revenue economy and govt revenue any economist with a half working brain could tell you that such a lack of diversification is bad did the 40 years of pc government ever try to diversify no did the voters ask for that no you all thought because you have low taxes and limited government of course your economy is the most successful and will always stay that way now as any business student with a b average could have told you would happen the oil price obviously did not say high rising and big surprise a bunch of people are out of work and the economy is stuttering also you are all stupid for throwing out prentice and the pc just because he was honest in saying that the voters of the province collectively had not prepared for such a situation and had to face some tough times in response now you all throw in an inexperienced ndp government and now you are all angry that they are acting like an ndp government what you have is the result of 40 years of conservative economic strategy it your fault and now you want the liberal federal government to bail you out you whine about all the people out of work and how you need assistance well why did not you think about preparing for that yourselves the last 40 years no you rush to cut taxes and other revenues for the provincial govt you bitch and insult liberal government for being too big and taking your money but you come crawling like bitches looking for a handout as soon as shit hits the fan ,18,canada
tylertgbh, sigh so many people seem to make assumptions like this even though there is so much information to the contrary somehow i constantly see stuff like this on reddit since you are the top comment right now can i just point out prices will be kept artificially inflated to black market level the goal of the gov t in legalizing is to cut out the black market you can probably expect pricing set or suggested by the government and the prices will be determined by what the best price is to reach an equilibrium between profit and competition with the black market and a government monopoly on production it pretty absurd to think there will be a government monopoly on production there are already countless private marijuana production facilities in the country like the massive tweed facility near ottawa with lots of investment already put into more facilities across the country all of which are licensed by health canada they government wo not be shutting them down will probably mean than the home growing option wo not be on the table pmjt said through the campaign that legalization will look like alcohol sale in most provinces just like people are free to home brew they will be able to grow a small number of plants themselves effectively making legalization pointless for those people who already get their weed from independent contractors if you are taking about ordering medical marijuana from a licensed facility that likely wont change except for the fact that you could also walk into a store and buy it charging 100 an ounce for something that can be easily and cheaply cultivated by someone with very basic gardening skills simply is not going to work in my opinion 100 for an oz is cheap you are lucky to get that from a dealer as the market currently stands anyways i call this a false argument you can also home brew beer for a fraction of the price from lcbo beer store but yet very few people do most people do not have the time effort to grow that at home nevermind the smell ,4,canada

tylertgbh,i think the biggest misconception about trump is this idea of i dont know how his supporters still like him every time he made a new outlandish comment everyone thinks his support with desert him but it been the opposite the reality is and this is what is scary that his comments have only increased and solidified his support his supporters truly agree with him they think he the only one who shares their perspective and that perspective seems to be that the latinos and muslims all ought to be rounded up and shipped out i think he rather bright and most of his campaign has been tactical and strategic i have been unsure for a while whether or not he out of control or managed and therefore planned i have concluded i think it the latter throughout the campaign he like anyone has had mistakes but he corrected his mistakes and he never does them again he also is good at tailoring is messaging i have watching his rallies his interviews on fox msnbc and yesterdays on live with kelly he tailors his tone his demeanor his content etc for each audience to me that shows that he in control and it all managed i think his goal may be to sustain enough support by picking up the farthest right supporters running into the gop nomination to be able to threaten a somewhat valid third party run no way would he win nor would he honestly expect to but i think his plan is pretty much to sustain enough support where he can put a knife to the gop throat and force a me or nobody scenario either they nominate him or he runs as an indie and torpedos the gop i do not think he stupid worse he an egomaniac enough of an egomaniac to do that ,2,Republican

tylertgbh,yup two of the 3 major political parties want to abolish the senate the liberal party which just got into power wants to change the appointment process currently senators are appointed by the pm ,1,funny
tylertgbh,well technically they can do a lot but i will explain why it pretty much certain that would never happen as liberal mps they are obligated to vote in support of the government on any bills that enact campaign promises to law which means they would have to vote for it because they campaigned on it they knew this when they ran for nomination to represent the party also btw the pm does not want it done marijuana legalization is not something pmjt came up with legalization has been official party platform adopted in a policy convention years ago meaning it was voted on by grass roots party members so it was a part of the liberal policy platform before the election and before the mps even ran to be candidates for the liberal party so not only would they be booted out the party if they were to vote against the bill it would be pretty stupid seeing as this was party policy when the decided to become a candidate for the party and even if a few liberal mps were to vote against it hypothetically the bill could still pass they have 184 mps and majority is 170 they only need majority to pass it so even if say 10 mps voted against which would be crazy the bill would still pass ,27,funny
tylertgbh,anything is possible but the likelihood is practically 0 ,21,funny
tylertgbh,tbh that so unlikely it not even worth considering the liberals have a majority which means it cannot be stopped in the house hypothetically the senate could block it but that so unlikely especially seeing as their existence is in question right now as it is ,100,funny
tylertgbh,no one can really stop it that commenter isnt totally right only thing is the senate could hypothetically reject it but that super duper unlikely and would be a much larger problem in of itself ,3,funny

tylertgbh,i would call that low skill but the frank response is that just a dead job it really does not make economic sense to make sacrifices to keep that job in canada when it will be replaced by robots in 10 years the important thing to recognise with tpp is this is necessary advantageous for the long term it may cause short term pain but it will help position canada economy to be globally competitive for the long term admittedly you raise a good point that sort of employee is the type of person who will lose out from the tpp the economy 5 10 years from now will look almost nothing like it did 25 years ago when that hypothetical employee started it a job skill set that just isnt needed like it used to be and is no longer affordable in canada governments prov fed will probably make efforts to keep those jobs in canada for some time with very generous grants to auto corporations like they already provide but really it like putting gauze on a severed limb also thankfully thanks to the ndp and liberals canada has pretty strong unions who can press the government on this ,-1,canada
tylertgbh,in the recent election campaign the lpc regularly stated that the party is taxing only the top 1 of earners the salary at which you experience an increase in taxes under the lpc plan was 217 000 or actually 216 xxx the salary needed to make it into the top 1 probably surprises most people in part likely because just to the south in the us the salary needed is probably closer to a million there was a great macleans article that came out back in 08 09 that outlined a lot of this information if i remember correctly earning over 67 000 puts you in the top 10 ,1,canada
tylertgbh,just as the low wage low skill countries will gain jobs by more low end manufacturing we will gain jobs in the high skill tech service industries our banks tech financial services etc sectors will have a massive market to sell to compared to the pathetic 37 million people in canada edit the important thing to note is that this is meant to position canada for the long term it prepares us to compete in the global economy ,1,canada

tylertgbh,correct that they are free to move around once they settle but actually no there is no better use of resources to be gained from settling them in higher concentrations in fewer locations most of the leg work is being done by charities and other non federal govt local agencies also the most difficult to find resource is housing which is already limited in most all cities so actually you would just overload insufficient local agencies resources by doing that which is exactly why they are not ,1,canada
tylertgbh,these cities will likely see the highest amount concentration of refugees but it unlikely to be a majority of the refugees according to the govt they would like to spread out the refugees through many communities not just the few main cities ,7,canada

tylertgbh,ya but clothing does represent gender identity how would it not i am all for progressive social acceptance of lgbt issues obviously but these over the top ideas coming out of bubbles of academic feminist groupthink are a bit much clothes are genderless clothes dont represent sexuality i just do not understand the suspension of common sense clothes are used to express exactly these things in the free market west of all consumer products that you can buy clothes are by far the best example of how people represent and portray themselves to society clothing is used to signal everything from race class religion age interests personality etc clothes and personal style are the ultimate form of self expression including gender and sexuality ,38,gaybros

tylertgbh,it a pretty typical style of body language used by many politicians you will notice the host is positioned on the stronger side of the handshake so that in a picture his cameron hand is seen making him appear dominant pmjt counters this by covering cameron hand with his own it just looks like pmjt is patting cameron hand rather than holding it as a handshake keep an eye out for how politicians shake hands in front of cameras they usually posture back and forth to appear more dominant either by covering the others hand with their own in a pile on hand shake or by going in for the pat on the back if they get out maneuvered in the handshake ,4,canada

tylertgbh,dude there no logical consistency in your argument nor did you respond to my actual question the context of the discussion is modern day my comments are referring to the kkk current existence i completely understand it past but that was a different time actually you have proven my original point in american history there was no widespread vocal condemnation of the kkk by american christians as far as i am aware that because for much of america history the kkk perspective was not that different from mainstream american thinking i agree that there is no factual basis to act like islam is more violent than any other abrahamic religion nowhere in this thread has that been suggested you really are not helping the argument by jumping to responses although accurate that do not actually respond to the question on hand pretty sure op already knows that islam is no more inherently violent than the other religions his her question is what to do about that perception ,1,canada
tylertgbh,whether or not people should have to demonstrate that theyre not extremist is not really the question though op asked why people are acting a certain way and what to do about it what you can do is to point out the difference between yourself and the radicals i am not making a judgment on whether it right that muslims might need to do that just pointing out it could be one method to help fight some of the racism we are experiencing that being said from an atheist position it hard to pity those who believe in religion religion is by definition irrational and illogical faith so it cannot be surprising when freaks use the same faith to further their agenda it comes with the territory of irrational and illogical belief it easy to twist to fit your agenda ,2,canada
tylertgbh,i really do not think that an accurate equivalent sure maybe the kkk is worse than old rednecks doing nothing as i described them but to equate them to isis is absurd ,0,canada
tylertgbh,really how many people did they slaughter in the name of jesus if that true then why was not it covered in the media ,4,canada
tylertgbh,yes you are right that exactly the reason iran for example is probably playing the largest role against isis among the muslim nations they are shia while isis is sunni this however just goes to reinforce the absurdity and the low value of the choice to believe in this series of illogical and irrational beliefs aka religion the fact that the idea that i live my life in accordance to the wishes of the magical man in the sky and you do not so you are wrong is more important than rational action against brutal and barbaric terrorism just reinforces the argument that the choice to believe in the religion on either side should not be respected ,2,canada
tylertgbh,this is such a stupid argument the kkk is an outdated pathetic group of rednecks who do nothing these days if the kkk was blowing up bombs and shooting over 100 people on the streets of alabama in the name of jesus then yes this would be an accurate equivalent and i have full confidence there are be an overwhelming portion of the us christian population who would openly and vocally condemn them for misrepresenting the religion ,16,canada
tylertgbh,until the muslim world stands up with force against islamic terrosists like this you will continue to face these issues these are people who belong to your culture and your religion but yet members of your culture and religion always seem to have a much softer response to these acts than the rest of us that is not right some muslim leaders claim this is an aberration of your religion but yet some of the largest and most wealthy islamic countries do nothing they play no role in fighting isis and they play no role in taking in refugees the raw foundation of this issue in western society is that belief in religion is a choice it is a choice to believe in a series of irrational and illogical medieval beliefs you will have to face the consequences of this choice as others who also make this irrational and medieval choice commit medieval and uncivilized acts the consequences of your choice will become more difficult to deal with but unfortunately that the nature of irrational faith and this applies to all religions not just islam ,12,canada

tylertgbh,except op has simplified things in the title the party hasnt just specifically chosen this one issue to mandate how people vote the actual requirement is that liberal mps will vote in agreement with the charter of rights part of the canadian constitution since the charter of rights affirmed by a ruling from the supreme court guarantees woman the right to choose an abortion therefore mps must vote pro choice ,2,atheism

tylertgbh,i would argue that prices are unlikely to be ludicrous they will likely be close ish to the current black market price the government goal of controlling the substance would not be successful if it still being sold on the black market in order to stamp out black market sales they will have to offer competitive price not to mention the economics of maximum tax revenue it will be taxed but not enough to drive sales back into the black market which would ultimately hurt tax revenue ,2,canada
tylertgbh,hmm i think most views of backwardness are for the beer store but anyways these only seem backward because of the distribution systems you can find in other provinces and states which tend to give consumers better prices which is all most people care about but remember in theory the lcbo exists to control a would angerous substance which was once completely outlawed with marijuana you wo not be able to make comparisons like that except to a few examples in the us so it will be hard to accuse it of being backward anyways remember the government primary purpose in legalization is control of the substance actual retail structure might be up to the provinces but i would not get my hopes up ,4,canada
tylertgbh,i do not understand why people are worried about stuff like this maybe it comes from concerns some americans have but trudeau has already outlined the plan during the campaign cannabis sale will be structured like alcohol currently is in most provinces so pretty much you will most likely buy it from a government crown corporation owned store but you will likely also be able to grow a small amount at home like how home brewing is legal ,3,canada
