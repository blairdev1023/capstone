Kolyin,true like dr seneff i do not have a relevant terminal degree do credentials matter to you or is this just a tactic for disqualifying voices that say things you do not want to think about if credentials matter then of course it relevant that dr seneff are irrelevant to her conclusions of those who do have relevant degrees and do actual research in these fields no one seems to take seneff work seriously why is that more to the point why do credentials only matter in some cases ,1,conspiracy
Kolyin,are not you a treasure none of her expertise is in relevant fields natural language gene analysis is not expertise in genetics generally and does not seem to be at all at issue here that not surprising her work is primarily modeling how auditory systems work glyphosate is a hobby for her and not one where she made any mark with actual experts look at the journals and papers where she publishes her glyphosate stuff seriously check it out notice anything consistent about where she publishes i have a jd from a school down the road from where seneff works on digital ear models and preaches that all boys will be autistic in a few years i am not a scientist but i can tell legitimate expertise from a results oriented wannabe if you started by looking for the best science in these fields instead of the science that agreed with your preconceptions seneff would not be on the radar she lacks the education experience and most importantly research results her papers in these subjects are all hand wavy low impact diatribes she does not produce data or serious analyses that have made any dent in these fields of course maybe that because monsanto buys all the scientists right pays all the neurologists and chemists and biologists and geneticists to ignore her amazing cross disciplinary genius or maybe she just out of her field writing to express her sincere beliefs but without the data or expertise to support them ,0,conspiracy

Kolyin,why would it be relevant that computer ai just beat regular doctors in an analysis of outcome versus diagnosis i do not know what outcome versus diagnosis means but i doubt that ais have outperformed human diagnosticians outside of perhaps a very limited and strictly controlled test and why would it matter even if it was true seneff does not make or work with diagnostic ais she builds simulations of the auditory system if i understand correctly seneff is not an expert in or doing any real research in any field relevant to the op points she just has theories that some people like so they look for any excuse to prioritize her over the people who actually do research in these areas ,-5,conspiracy

Kolyin,i am no chemist or any kind of relevant expert so my thoughts are worth what you are paying for them having said that it looks pretty scammy to me they are selling their potion as what is called a flocculant which is a real thing chemicals like aluminum sulfate or sulfite not a chemist can cause impurities in water to coagulate so they can be removed to get any benefit i think you have to then remove the coagulate either by drawing the purified water off of the top of the container or filtering out the coagulated particles so if that all they are selling great but why pay magic potion prices for a basic chemical just looking at amazon real quick the price they charge for 2 oz of their stuff will buy 2 pounds of concentrated flocculant and personally i would much rather trust someone who selling their product as the chemical it is rather than someone who obfuscates and sells it as a magic cure all bear in mind that most cities already flocculate filter and otherwise treat their water if you are drinking from the mains i think it pretty unlikely you will get better results re flocculating it yourself and you wo not get any results as i understand it if you then just drink the coagulates so you will need to use a filter yourself although if you are buying purifying potions for your water i guess you probably are already filtering anyway that my take i think they are selling a real thing but not a thing that likely to be any real benefit to you since the water supply is already treated in a similar way and they are making vastly overstated claims for it in my opinion as well as vastly overcharging for it ps as someone who grew up in a region with massive natural fluoride deposits in the water dude it not hurting you even people on wellwater did not see any ill effects except fluoridosis turnign their teeth brown as kids and city water does not do that of course it r conspiracy so i get it but do not let people use fear to pick your pocket pps flocculate is a fun word flocculate flocculant flocculating flocculation ,1,conspiracy

Kolyin,1 the us has a high sids rate does not even begin to address the original point that supposedly every office sees deaths following vaccinations it just holding up a fact that sounds a little like the question at issue and using it as an excuse to not reconsider your pre existing belief the numbers just do not support what you want to believe screaming in all caps and bold wo not change that there no font big enough or bold enough to change the data 2 you are overlooking the fact that the vicp pays out table injuries without even asking for proof of causation 2800 payouts may reflect fewer than 2800 injuries as people make claims on unrelated conditions i do not know if the payout rate is higher or lower than the ae rate i suspect it pretty accurate given that vicp lawyers beat the bushes pretty hard to drive in business i know that the professionals who study the question even those in independent labs and centers think the vaccines are safe even thompson 3 wakefield likes to tell people the retraction was just because of an oversight about hooker conflicts it not true the editors stated that hooker undeclared conflicts compromised the peer review process ie more than just he did not tell us he was part of x group and then observed furthermore post publication peer review raised concerns about the validity of the methods and statistical analysis therefore the editors no longer have confidence in the soundness of the findings there were serious problems with his methods and results as statisticians have made clear in public comments about his work it no surprise he also stated publicly that he did not understand the stats thompson is not the leading immunologist in the world and he did not hide a vax autism connection he was worried that he had but actually looking at the data it apparent that a the cdc did not hide anything even wakefield could not identify a single piece of data they tried to destroy and b there was not any problem with their results there a reason hooker could not get the answers he wanted with an appropriate statistical analysis the numbers do not show a real causative connection between vaccines and autism which is why vaccination rates do not autism rates do not believe me find a statistician who agrees with the anti vax interpretation i mean how deep does the evil baby killing conspiracy go all the epidemiologists immunologists neurologists autism specialists now the statisticians too all the research on autism is showing a it not a growing epidemic and b it has prenatal causes so not vaccines it amazing that you think the data is clear as fucking day but somehow only conspiracy theorists and screaming redditors can see it not the you know neurologists and immunologists and epidemiologists and autism specialists there is not enough money in the world to buy all of those people it not a conspiracy the theory is just wrong ,1,conspiracy

Kolyin,i saw the excerpt in the study it does not support the claims anti vaxers make about him and of course that excerpt has not been peer reviewed nor do we know if it was even printed with permission or in context ask thompson about giving personal correspondence to anti vax zealots you are complaining about being seen as hysterical and asking who my handler is in literally the same breath only on r conspiracy does the conclusion shared by a vast scientific consensus get taken as proof that you are a super secret agent i do not have a handler you are a neophyte hysterical no one has ever paid me to post anything at all ,1,conspiracy
Kolyin,did you read the link it does not sound like it it interesting to me that it only bloggers and anti vax activists who think the research is still inconclusive the actual scientists who study it all the epidemiologists for example and no they do not all work for pharma consider the question definitively closed and the autism experts are looking at prenatal indications not vaccines because they too consider the research definitive on the subject vaccines do not cause autism it analogous to creationism answers in genesis will scream all day that the science is still in doubt the science is still in doubt but the actual scientists are off making important discoveries having long since disposed of the conspiracy theory ,1,conspiracy
Kolyin,1 the nvic is an incredibly biased organization and it shows in that bogus statistic if only 1 40 office reports a death they assume that means that there are 40x as many deaths because they assume every office should be seeing deaths no pediatrician or doctor of any kind i have ever talked to has seen a death following vaccination they are not reporting those deaths because they are not happening i do not see any link for the fda statistic i would be interested if you have one because i am obviously skeptical and do not take online bs as gospel 2 the vast majority of vaers reports are things like redness and swelling at the injections site others are things like car crashes because anyone can report anything they want to you say only about 1 4 of claims get compensated as if you are assuming that all claims should be compensated that not how human beings work people do make claims that are wrong or not supported by any evidence like autism 1 4 is much more than would be compensated in normal court where evidence of causation is required speaking as a lawyer the vicp is a claimant dream high comp rates free lawyers non adversarial process 3 yeah thompson was very worried about the study methodology as for its results he personally wrote when he was protected from discipline by the whistleblower act that parents should not avoid vaccination and since he spoke up anti vaxxers have had years and gobs of money to test his claims they have not identified any actual problems with the cdc results hooker tried but his paper was retracted when it came out that a he would deceived the journal about his conflicts of interest why does that never matter to anti vaxers and b his results were garbage because he bungled the math google the statistics of his paper there a great explanation by a statistician the anti vaxers never found a single statistician who would stand up for hooker bogus methodology and eventually they totally gave up on it and made vaxxed instead pandering to conspiracy theorists instead of trying to show actual problems with the research because they could not 4 i do know what taxes are and you are right the taxpayer pays for it and the vaccine manufacturer is the taxpayer they write the check they cannot raise vaccine prices arbitrarily if they could raise a 2 vax price by 0 75 they would already be charging 2 75 so it impacts their profits i think probably some has been passed on through prices but barring perfect price elasticity which vaccines obviously do not have they are eating the cost of that tax ,1,conspiracy

Kolyin,that a google search not actual data and the only link i see that supports your claim says that only 1 40 doctor offices report a death following a vaccination the vast majority of people have no adverse events after a vaccination much less deaths of course doctor offices do not see such deaths and therefore do not report them ,1,conspiracy
Kolyin,you might want to talk to your brother about his research as another commenter pointed out this stuff is just wrong 97 cases of kawasaki disease in 2014 over the last thirty years or so since 1990 only about a hundred cases have been reported to vaers your brother flat wrong and that a pretty glaringly obvious mistake i really wish anti vaxers would not dribble falsehoods like this all over the internet to scare people source https www ncbi nlm nih gov pubmed 19755926 eta same issue with the second stat i checked the heb b adverse events you are taking thirty years of numbers and lumping them into one year and you know vaers makes no claims as to causation right so if dividing these numbers by thirty to correct the bad research does not change your opinion on vaccines what does that say about the basis of those beliefs maybe they are not based on the data after all so your brother group studies vaccine trial design if not can you identify any expert in clinical trials who thinks vaccine trials are done badly this seems like really really bad statistics and motivated reasoning to be honest there a reason the epidemiologists who actually study this stuff unanimously stand behind vaccines and it ai not the illuminati ,2,conspiracy

Kolyin,you are being extremely silly the linked lists over a decade of research papers on vaccine safety those are brochures is an excuse for ignoring the data if you want more papers do a pubmed search ,4,conspiracy
Kolyin,here is a partial list of safety studies https www cdc gov vaccinesafety research publications you will be disappointed the research does not support your scaremongering ,2,conspiracy
Kolyin,you keep telling people that no studies are conducted and ignoring the fact that many many many studies have been conducted here a partial list https www cdc gov vaccinesafety research publications the fact that the studies do not conform to your pre existing beliefs is not a valid reason for pretending that they do not exist ,8,conspiracy
Kolyin,many studies have been conducted here a partial list of over a decades worth https www cdc gov vaccinesafety research publications ,6,conspiracy
Kolyin,the math with citations is here https en wikipedia org wiki herd immunity mechanism if you did not find that in your research then how thorough was that research i think your blanket dismissal of people who disagree with you as vaccine shills and of people who are more knowledgeable than you as big pharma specialists not doing actual science says a lot about your process ,5,conspiracy
Kolyin,i am guessing that they wait as long as they can because it the last thing they want to do once they get violent even against just the car i bet there a ton more paperwork to do and of course the risk to the officers goes up i think it also appropriate as a matter of policy this guy an ass but he should be given every chance to reconsider his nonsense before something gets broken ,10,amibeingdetained
Kolyin,kemtrayls ,11,amibeingdetained
Kolyin,there a few threads around about him https reasonablehank com 2015 12 10 death threats from frank vazquez of south australia ,9,amibeingdetained
Kolyin,a z lister antivax zealot known for bomb death and rape threats ,9,amibeingdetained
Kolyin,thank you i appreciate that ,1,amibeingdetained
Kolyin,weird thanks for the heads up i cannot replicate it but i will keep an eye out i do not know anything about these things so all i can figure is that maybe wordpress is inadvertently serving you a malicious ad or maybe you have got malware no idea if those are even remotely plausible guesses apologies regardless ,2,amibeingdetained
Kolyin,yeah i agree i am the author i analogize it to plumbing or electrical work because it just as applicable there if someone tells me to buy this kind of pipe instead of that one because it got a better flow regulating pvr coating how am i going to tell whether it baloney advice or not on the other hand if someone tells me to rip out the wiring and replace it with lead wires because the electricians are all part of a pro copper conspiracy i would be able to tell that the advice was suspect especially if they could not show me any example of lead wiring that actually worked these theories are definitely in the lead wiring camp but everything a spectrum the fact that very few people fall for it does not mean that no one falls for it so i would disagree only with the very last thing you said the pseduolawyers win the debate with a few people some of the time and that can be disastrous see malheur but in the long run they always lose on the other hand in the long long run there are always more of them so i guess you are right after all this may not have been the most helpful comment i have ever written ,7,amibeingdetained
Kolyin,author here do you mean violent metaphors the linked blog just checked and it up and working fine ,4,amibeingdetained
Kolyin,i am the author and yes it can definitely do that it can also recruit people to join them in their delusions as they find the fight online but if no one engages then the people on the margins of the irrational idea have fewer reasons to second guess it and are more likely to fall for it i think the best approach is to debunk bunk openly and honestly without outright attacking believers ,1,skeptic
Kolyin,there a fantastic book called the last duel about one of the last recorded trials by combat highly recommended just do not google the story before you read it the outcome of the trial is very dramatic and suspenseful and the book is written to emphasize that better to go in cold ,1,skeptic
Kolyin,they tend to see driving as a right citing a right to travel freely between states ,3,skeptic
Kolyin,lots of reasons but among others engaging people before they go full sovereign citizen can keep them from getting to the point where they do something that requires jail time ,6,skeptic
Kolyin,what i meant was that people can of course have their own opinions about what the facts are but that those opinions do not change what the facts are ,5,skeptic
Kolyin,one of the scenes in which the tommeys are using their kid room to watch a video because the family other vcr or whatever is broken disturbed me the kid wanted them out of his space it felt a bit like they were provoking him with a camera running to catch his reaction i thought it was nasty ,4,skeptic
Kolyin,right but i am glad you guys were there i was focused so much on the factual shortcomings of the movie i did not even think about how it tokenizes people on the spectrum the protesters at the kansas city screening got me thinking about that and i hope some of the vaxxed fans too ,6,skeptic
Kolyin,thanks really appreciate the comment new one up ,1,skeptic
Kolyin,you are welcome that my favorite faq of all time we have a vaccine version in the works but have not had time to work on it in over a year ,4,conspiratard
Kolyin,and it seems to me that wakefield hates it he looks so glum all the time and i have not seen him socializing around the ship at all i think he very unhappy about sharing billing with chemtrail and reptile alien experts ,1,skeptic
Kolyin,i think smith is more effective for his cause than wakefield as much as aw tries to rebrand himself as a documentarian he will never get out from under the fraud label and he not a very engaging speaker smith is and very focused on creating new activists not unfortunately on understanding the science behind what he attacking he seems to get all of his science by rote from stephanie seneff who seems to get it from thin air ,2,skeptic
Kolyin,bandwidth exceeded it will be up again before long i wrote another piece that has a short discussion linked below but professor reiss is more in depth and a better overall explanation ,1,skeptic
Kolyin,thanks that my piece i could not believe the nonsense in that nn article ,1,skeptic
Kolyin,i do not think ignoring it will work out vaccination is a powerful issue to people on both sides of the question and you might not be able to keep it submerged better to jump on it now and try to exert some positive influence i think you are on the right track looking for good objective resources when you share them with your so make sure you give him plenty of time and space to talk about his own opinions too you will be more persuasive if you are having a back and forth conversation than if you try to make it a lecture or infodump ,2,BabyBumps
Kolyin,that definitely will make it harder to get traction with her but i think it still a good idea to try to persuade her if you assume that it impossible to make a difference you wo not try and wo not succeed if you do try as long as you do so respectfully and straightforwardly you should not be offending her very much and you might be surprised how much influence you have many people are not used to someone else having a serious involved conversation about their beliefs as long as you do it carefully and give her plenty of space to tell you all about what she believes you should have plenty of opportunities to influence her you probably wo not see much in the way of immediate results but it a long term process and it a worthy goal i think you should absolutely go for it ,1,BabyBumps
Kolyin,i wrote a guide to having this conversation that just posted this morning http violentmetaphors com 2013 12 20 the most important playground conversation how to persuade a friend to vaccinate you should absolutely try to talk your friend into getting the vaccination do not try to scare her with the outbreak though she will probably see it as a pressure tactic and it could make her defensive and harder to reach by sympathetic and straightforward and discuss the facts with her do not expect miracles but this is too important a subject for you to not try to change her mind if you do have this conversation i would really appreciate it if you would let us know how it went we would like to track real world examples of that discussion to see what works best in different circumstances i would also be happy to answer any questions you have personally good luck and thank you for trying to get involved i wish more people took that initiative ,1,BabyBumps
Kolyin,registered an account to respond as i just posted a piece this morning that might be helpful it intended to be a field guide http violentmetaphors com 2013 12 20 the most important playground conversation how to persuade a friend to vaccinate to convincing a parent to vaccinate their child but it should be relevant to your situation as well some of the resources i have found helpful are http www cdc gov vaccines vac gen common faqs htm http www mayoclinic com health vaccines cc00014 http www who int features qa 84 en i particularly like these resources because the facts are solid and the sources are credible there a lot of scaremongering about big pharma running various blogs and whatnot but the cdc the mayo clinic and the who are fairly unimpeachable sources ,2,BabyBumps
