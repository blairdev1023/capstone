quixotic_1,it depends on how many credits you have at your old school and your gpa old credits will still be factored into your transfer school so if you have a lot of old credits it will bring your overall transfer gpa down for the admissions process the good news is many universities base admissions on a comprehensive overview of a student that looks at things like improved grades after a long absence from school also if accepted to a 4 year your old gpa will not transfer from previous schools so you will essentially start with a clean slate finally community colleges will accept pretty much anybody with only the very basic qualifications seeing as you attended a cc before you should have no problem starting at a new one good luck and make sure you are 100 committed before starting school again ,1,EngineeringStudents

quixotic_1,sorry i wrote that while trying to study for my final tomorrow so it probably all over the place i will try and clarify typically someone would only qualify for unemployment benefits if they are laid off wrongfully terminated etc you cannot get unemployment benefits just because you were fired in my state at least as someone that is separating from the military you qualify for unemployment benefits automatically you can go to school full time and collect unemployment benefits and you also get bah through the gi bill you also have no income so you can get financial aid through the school i chose to get a job instead of collect unemployment benefits when i got out because they deem my income to be high enough i do not qualify for financial aid i cannot go to school full time because i have to work so it taking me a long time to get through the program i want to quit so i can go to school full time but i would not qualify for unemployment benefits because i left a job on my own volition it a catch 22 that i could have avoided if i just leeched off the system while i went to school are you planning on going to school in your home state or out of state make sure you read up on the rules about in state tuition most states will not grant you in state tuition if you move to the state explicitly for education purposes so you may need to work for a year before starting school ,1,EngineeringStudents
quixotic_1,i am a 31 y o mechanical engineering student got out of the marine corps in 2012 i had not been in school in over 10 years when i went back and i had to get back up to speed before even starting core program classes you will not be a black sheep especially if you start at a community college i want to congratulate you for planning early and dreaming big too many people get out with no plan and end up on their ass when it comes time to separate some pointers start going back to school now start your schooling now while you are still in if your command lets you sign up at your base education office for tuition assistance and start getting up to speed on your english and math look up the engineering program program at the school you plan to attend once you get out and take as many of those classes now while it free ta does not count against your gi bill benefits so get those classes knocked out so you do not waste your gi bill benefits later do not waste your gi bill benefits hopefully you have taken my advice and knocked out as many pre reqs as you could before getting out you can use your gi bill to take remedial classes eg math80 but you will run out of benefits before you even make it to a 4 year you only have 36 months on the gi bill 4 years no summer do not waste your gi bill by taking anything less than full time pay out of pocket if you need to for the quarters that you cannot take more than full time credits do not get a job as a libertarian it pains me to say this but do not get a job once you get out if at all possible when i got out i lived off my savings until i found a full time job in the city i wanted to move to i burned through my savings while going to school full time paying for classes and books for the quarters i did not use the gi bill my low income prevents me from getting financial aid and my full time work schedule prevents me from loading up my class schedule and getting this shit done to pay for classes i have to work full time but i cannot go to school full time on the gi bill because i have to work to pay for the classes i wanted to be financially and socially responsible by not living off unemployment fuck me right that being said separating from the military will qualify you for unemployment benefits i know quite a few vets that live off unemployment benefits and the gi bill bah e 5 w dependents for zip code where you school is while they go to school full time again fuck me start at a community college depending on where you decide to move to once you get out i would suggest starting at a community college i have been to ccs all over the country and some have been pure shit and some have been amazing so do your research the classes are cheap so pay out of pocket if you can and save your gi bill benefits for the relatively expensive 4 year university unless you think you can finish a engineering degree in 36 months a lot of people at ccs are older non traditional students or fellow vets so you wo not feel like a black sheep there will be times when you will have to restrain yourself from walking over and throttling the mouthy class clown type when they disrespect the instructor or distract the class with their attention seeking behavior do not this is frowned up by the school administration overall most students are great though they are just trying to learn as much as they can at a discount before transferring to a 4 year make sure you find the dedicated ones and befriend them avoid the ones that think that the cc is a extension of high school and are only there to get mom and dad off their back also avoid being the crusty ol battle hardened vet with your camo day pack who takes every opportunity to let everyone know he was a vet no one cares and we all hate you rant make sure you go to see the veteran coordinator are your school it great to hang out with other vets and they have great resources to help you transition back into school let me know if you have any other questions good luck to you ,1,EngineeringStudents

quixotic_1,obviously hoas sound like a terrible idea if all you are going off of is this thread 95 of the homeowners in an hoa are normal hard working people like you or me it the other 5 that ruin it for everybody in theory a hoa is a good idea and some of them are great say you want a house with a pool basketball court gym theater room etc it would be prohibitively expensive for a normal person an hoa allows you to enjoy these amenities by collectively financing it construction and upkeep hoas also serve to protect the property values of the neighborhood by preventing individuals from making changes to the appearance of their property which the hoa deems detrimental this prevents a hoarder moving in and turning his front lawn into a auto scrap yard painting his house neon green and letting his backyard grow out into the african savanna he would singlehandedly lowers the resale value of all the houses around him the stories in this thread are just the rules meant to prevent this but taken to the extreme one of the other reasons i did not mind buying a place in a hoa is because i do not trust myself to be fiscally responsible and save enough money to replace the roof every 10 years replace the sidings etc i also like that yard work maintenance is taken care of so i can spend my days off being lazy on the couch ,2,AskReddit

quixotic_1,i do not really know man again this is just what my friend used to tell me perhaps you were concentrating so deeply as you were reading that you put yourself into a trance like state or perhaps you were falling asleep as you were reading and your brain decided to release dmt to initiate a dream while you were still awake i do know that what my friend did is called astral projection though google it it is the process of spiritually leaving your body also here an excerpt from wikipedia on dmt that sounds similar to your experience dr rick strassman while conducting dmt research in the 1990s at the university of new mexico advanced the controversial hypothesis that a massive release of dmt from the pineal gland prior to death or near death was the cause of the near death experience nde phenomenon several of his test subjects reported nde like audio or visual hallucinations his explanation for this was the possible lack of panic involved in the clinical setting and possible dosage differences between those administered and those encountered in actual nde cases several subjects also reported contact with other beings alien like insectoid or reptilian in nature in highly advanced technological environments 13 where the subjects were carried probed tested manipulated would ismembered taught loved and even raped by these beings basing his reasoning on his belief that all the enzymatic material needed to produce dmt is found in the pineal gland see evidence in mammals and moreover in substantially greater concentrations than in any other part of the body strassman 13 p 69 has speculated that dmt is made in the pineal gland currently there is no published reliable scientific evidence supporting this hypothesis writers on dmt include terence mckenna jeremy narby and graham hancock in his writings and speeches terence mckenna recounts encounters with entities he sometimes describes as self transforming machine elves among other phrases mckenna believed dmt to be a tool that could be used to enhance communication and allow for communication with other worldly entities many users report visitation from external intelligences attempting to impart information does this sound kind of like what you experienced ,1,Glitch_in_the_Matrix

quixotic_1,what you experienced sounds a lot like what a friend described regarding the pineal gland the pineal gland is an evolutionary byproduct in the brain that releases a compound known as dmt also known as the dream drug because it is released as you sleep and also in large quantities at birth and right before you die here is joe rogan explaining his experiences with dmt http www youtube com watch v grcqs9cdun8 my friend claimed to actively exercise his pineal gland through meditation to experience what he described as a feelings of the infinite foreverness different dimensions etc sounds crazy right well incidentally the pineal gland is also known as the third eye which indians to this day symbolize with a red dot on their forehead ,13,Glitch_in_the_Matrix
