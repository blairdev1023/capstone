RubyWooToo,why should women expect to have it all men have never had that option ,2,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,unless you are from a culture where you have no choice in who you marry remember that the person you married is the person you selected for yourself ,1,RedPillWives
RubyWooToo,depends on the circumstances if the guy is poor because he young and just starting out but has a fantastic work ethic and goals for himself that fine but many women fall into the trap of investing in a guy who is poor because he lazy and aimless because they think he has potential even though he all talk and no action or because they think that with enough love and encouragement he will change ,9,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,my husband and i were friends for a few years before we started dating at the time we first met he was couch surfing and working an entry level job that he hated he decided to quit bury himself in learning the skills for the field he wanted to break into which was completely unrelated to his degree or his current job and then got a mid level job in that field i was really impressed by his drive and ambition a few years later he received an offer on the job that would eventually become the catapult to his current lucrative career he called me to brag about the offer he received which he was going to accept without negotiation i told him he should ask for 15k more than what they offered he thought i was crazy at first but decided to give it a try just for the hell of it they accepted his counter offer he then asked me to dinner to thank me which turned into our first proper date ,6,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,some guys are simply not going to be interested in you for whatever reason what i can say is that if you are second guessing your every word and gesture you are probably overthinking things and maybe giving off a whiff of loneliness and insecurity one thing you can try if a guy for example says we are totally checking out that restaurant is say something like great idea how about next thursday one the one hand it not overeager because you are following up on his suggestion and on the other hand you are giving him a concrete opportunity to follow through if he does not then you know exactly where you stand and you do not have to waste anymore time on him essentially i am confused between if he interested in you he will pursue you no matter what and you have to appear approachable and do x y z thing for things to progress what this essentially means is that the hardest hurdle a guy has to overcome is approaching a woman if you are friendly making eye contact smiling at him look engaged when he talks to you and available responding to texts phone calls and invitations then you are opening the door to his advances but if he not walking through the door then do not beat yourself up for it and do not stick around as an orbiter ,1,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,if he does not really have feelings for her and just feels guilty then all he doing right now stringing her alone instead of giving her the clean break she needs if he does love her then he will never be emotionally available to you either way he given you no choice but to dump his ass ,1,relationships
RubyWooToo,just as its important to not write off all hot guys as players its just as important to to not assume that all quiet average looking men are virtuous some of the biggest creeps i ever met in my life were shy nice guys who compensated for their crippling insecurities by cheating on their girlfriends or tearing down women in order to feel better about themselves op if guys are rejecting you before you get a chance to reject them then consider it a favor stop chasing after wallflowers and focus your energy on being available for guys who take the initiative to pursue you ,5,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,it one thing to give him the benefit of the doubt but do not fall into the trap of making excuses for him ,1,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo, u mwait pretty much covered everything that i wanted to say and her advice is spot on the only thing i can add is that if after your sit down if he tells you he done with the marriage and wants a divorce still move forward with the drastic changes you need to make for yourself and for your marriage best case scenario your husband changes his mind worst case scenario you can be a good ex wife with whom he can have an amicable co parenting relationship ,7,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,instead of asking yourself why they wo not choose you you should ask yourself why you continually choose men who are not available to you maybe you pick them because you are not ready for a commitment or you want to blame rejection on something other than yourself you are also making the same mistake that a lot beta orbiter men make which is stick around and try to be friends with someone you want to date in the hopes of getting upgraded to girlfriend status it a complete waste of time ,23,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,does he want to stay in the marriage ,4,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,it does not matter what is normal or not just what works in the relationship if he was just bad over the phone i do not think it would be a big deal but if you are the type that needs warmth and affection than you might not be compatible also the playing rough thing sounds disturbing did he apologize why does not your mother like him it just seems like this post is just the tip of the iceberg ,2,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,what is he like when you are together ,1,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,you already diminished your value by proposing an open relationship with a depressed drunk he basically gave you the it not you it me line in order to break up with you but since you offered him the sex and emotional comfort of a relationship without the commitment of course he going to stick around for the free cake the rpw experience of surrendering to and nurturing your captain is for men who are stable reliable and wholly committed to the relationship it not for winning back girlfriend status once you have been reduced to a plate because that pretty much impossible ,19,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,that perfectly normal and natural if you are going to get over it it going to take a great deal of time and effort on his part if he continues to lie either by omission or otherwise and just expects you to get over it then he given you nothing with which to rebuild your relationship ,2,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,if you felt no sparks when you kissed then you should not have progressed to sex i know you cannot go back in time but in the future you are not obligated to have sex with someone just because you planned to you are allowed to change your mind ,2,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,if they are a married couple her credit and her financial stability is legally tied to his lying to her about the extent of his losses was inexcusable and a total betrayal of trust just because the stock market is more socially respectable than a casino does not mean she should rugsweep his lies and reckless risk taking they had big plans that they made together and he single handed pissed them away at least for the foreseeable future now i am not saying they cannot survive this but doing so requires accountability on his part she cannot forgive him without knowing the full extent of what she has to forgive and he cannot win back her trust if he continuing to trickle truth or omit ,8,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,this is a major betrayal so you two definitely need to see a marriage counselor the initial bad investment can be chocked up to poor decision making but he lied about the extent of it and just the size of the debt is just as bad as if he lost it all in a casino the only way that you are going to move on and trust him again is through consistent action and transparency on his part he should be open about running credit reports on both of you to see if there is any other debt you are unaware of even if you maintain separate accounts you should be completely open with what is coming in and what is going out but ultimately the onus is not on you to fix anything he has to figure out a plan and put it into action for how he going to win back your confidence and respect ,6,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,why not make a list of things you would like to be consulted on like big household purchases bringing in a new pet or whatever other issues are really important to you if she knows what is important to you and what is just annoying you might get through to her ,1,relationships
RubyWooToo,why were not you talking to your parents for a month ,1,relationships
RubyWooToo,i do remember very well what middle school was like but since they did not specify what exactly they were making fun of were they slut shaming calling her a stupid bimbo i did not want to make an assumption op cannot control what other people say or do only her thoughts and reactions i am saying that she shouldnt be ashamed or embarrassed of her mom ,0,relationships
RubyWooToo,no babies without marriage simple as that your reasons for not getting married do not make sense you do not need your family to be interested in order to get married you do not even need much money last i checked a license and ceremony at the courthouse was 50 so what is the real reason also he should not be on your case to bring children into the world which at the moment he is in no position to support he cannot pick up the slack if you need to take time off work to recover and care for an infant ,3,RedPillWomen

RubyWooToo,i got confused during the democratic convention because most of the speakers were spanish and or criminals i thought she was running for president of mexico ,4,The_Donald
RubyWooToo,i have been following your story and i think it really inspiring how much you have achieved in the wake of such tragedy and how driven you are toward happiness and improvement thanks for sharing ,2,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,to be clear i do not believe in waiting a particular arbitrarily set amount of time before sex i believe on waiting until you have established that you are going to monogamous realistically if you have been seeing each other fairly frequently and really like each other people usually know if they want to be exclusive within 1 to 3 months ,1,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,i think it ok to compromise on moving in after you have gotten engaged and set a date for the wedding that within 1 year that what my husband and i did and it worked fine if he balks at the idea do not try to convince him just stick to original position of staying in your own place until your married ,5,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,i am glad that you found my advice helpful you are going to be just fine ,2,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,it was easy for them to throw kathy griffin under the bus because she a d list celebrity unrecognizable to anyone under the age of 35 i would like to see how they would react if she was not a washed up has bin ,8,The_Donald
RubyWooToo,in healthy relationships people do not automatically assume the worst of their partners and keep them in a state of constantly walking on eggshells based on your above examples your boyfriend is either a complete moron who cannot comprehend the very basics of social interaction or he actively seeking excuses to get pissed off at you either way he awful ,4,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,the only circumstances in which its acceptable to hit your partner is if they are attacking you and you are defending yourself hitting a spouse under any circumstances is cruel immoral and illegal the article is correct in saying that there is a double standard in society in that women get away with abusing men but beyond that saying that smacking around your partner is an acceptable response to her pissing you off is utter bullshit ,3,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,i am blessed with very fine barely visible leg hairs so i do not have to shave too often i shave my underarms regularly and have a short buzzcut in my lady parts i do not like waxing and shaving it bald gives me in grown hairs my husband has never stated his preferences i just notice that he much more ahem attentive down there when i am groomed versus not as an aside i have yet to meet a guy who was not a closeted homosexual who genuinely liked or did not mind hairy armpits and legs on women preferences on styling the lady parts vary more considerably ,2,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,you can only get away with refraining completely from all manner of sexual activity if you are having an arranged marriage or a very short courtship 6 months or less with another very religious person men who are secular or who want to date for a while before getting married will want to have sex or at least engage in other sexual activities if you want to marry one of these guys then sexual activity needs to be on the table i also think its necessary if you are going to have a happy marriage anyway if you spent your entire life thinking sex is horrible and dirty and that men wo not love your afterward those negative hangups and attitudes are not just going to magically disappear after you say i do ,1,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,i read your post and your follow up comments and it seems like both these guys though very different people were knights in shining armor who loved coming to the rescue of poor little you and got an ego boost out of being needed men who need to feel like they are better people than the women they are in relationships with are not high caliber guys that even goes for guy 2 who you think of as a prince if he keeps ending up in relationships with women he considers damaged like you and ex what does that say about him the way you get out of this funk is by being alone taking time to heal working through issues with a therapist and becoming the best version of yourself once your self esteem is high and you feel like you have much to offer the people who date you you are not going to be looking back at these duds with rose colored glasses you will also be able to attract higher quality men who are looking for a partner not a project i also want to add that there is fine distinction between being broken and being vulnerable when you are with the right man being vulnerable is wonderful you can come home from a particularly brutal day of work and cry on his shoulder and he will feel valued and good about himself for being able to comfort you being broken on the hand is like having a black hole in the center of your heart that sucks in the emotional energy of anyone who gets close to you and constantly needs to be filled with validation ,6,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,the wide availability of sex is actually a boon to an rpw she instantly stands out because she not desperate if he not commitment minded then he wo not wait around and he less likely lie about being monogamous to get in your pants like they did in the old days it like if there a very long wait at a 5 star restaurant or a months long delay in getting a reservation sure some will say fuck it and go buy a slice of pizza instead but people who are truly interested in the quality of the food and the experience will not only wait but feel like the place is more special because they had to wait ,7,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,my understanding of that book was that you cannot expect a spouse to be exclusively responsible for your happiness it important to find someone with whom you are fundamentally compatible rather than someone who ticks off every box on a long list of arbitrary qualities that may or may not lead to long happy marriage nowhere does the author advocate marrying someone with whom you are not in love and share few interests and who you do not desire ,2,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,all those people who like him are not the ones getting married to him your feelings and opinions are the only ones that matter and i get being attracted to the wrong men in the past i was too my husband was a very slow burn compared the instant fireworks i had with others but eventually the dynamite did go off i am sorry if you were looking for reassurance i just think that just because someone is not the wrong guy does not mean he the right one ,5,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,ah it sounded like you were going to settle for living like room mates forever i am glad to hear that not the case i do not know if you live in utah or in any other state where adultery is grounds for divorce and can determine the outcome custody or assets then i strongly advise you against plate spinning until you have filed for legal separation you should also document any instances of cheating or sexting that you discover on her side going forward ,1,marriedredpill
RubyWooToo,what are you going to do if she decides to divorce you once she finds a better branch to swing would you rather leave on your own initiative and potentially get the best possible custody and asset distribution that you can for yourself or would you rather hand her the grounds to divorce you on a silver platter by cheating and get blindsided ,1,marriedredpill
RubyWooToo,i think the place you are looking for is over here r theredpill,2,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,do not respond to him after everything he has done why are you even still in contact with him take that last message as a life lesson that you desperately needed to learn if you act like a doormat people will wipe their feet on you ,13,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,others might recommend marriage counseling but it not going to working if he cheating and lying to you it will just give him a forum to gaslight the hell out of you i know this might not be a popular suggestion especially here but would you consider hiring a pi or putting a voice activated recorder var in his car ,0,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,a marriage counselor is useless if she does not trust him and if he still actively lying to her ,4,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,it normal for those types of questions to enter your mind when you are making a decision as huge as marriage but i think it a bad sign that something is terribly wrong if she feeling sick with dread instead of excited while planning her wedding it seems to me that she making a huge effort because the guy is perfect on paper and is now entrenched in her family and social circle not because she genuinely in love with him personally i do not think its fair to him or herself to get married if that how she feels ,5,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,it normal to feel a bit jittery before tying the knot but feeling persistent dread and not excitement most certainly is not it one thing for a relationship to simmer down you have been together for a long time if you have never felt burning desire for him and if you are still having unsatisfying sex after communicating this to him then personally i think you are setting yourself for a lifetime of unhappiness eventually you will meet a man who gives you the tingles and what once seemed like a comfortable but lackluster arrangement will now feel unbearable my godmother once said a marriage with passion is like soup without salt it does not matter how great all the other ingredients are it wo not taste like anything ,7,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,there nothing that you can do to change how you got started but the most important thing is whether or not you are on the same page now if you are both monogamous seriously discussing the future and you are happy with how he treats you then you need to get off your hamster wheel and not look for problems that do not exist ,2,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,eventually you wo not have any choice because he going to marry someone else so you would rather get dumped suddenly at some unforeseen time or would you rather leave now on your own terms ,38,relationships
RubyWooToo,if your plan is to eventually marry and start a family do not waste anymore of your prime years on this guy ,3,relationships
RubyWooToo,your friend is a trashy person and a terrible host i cannot imagine why you did not just walk out and go to a restaurant ,23,relationships
RubyWooToo,your boyfriend probably does not even care about the cause he engages in these type of protests because it gives his violent thuggery an air of legitimacy if you want to do this woman and baby a favor you will report your boyfriend and his cohorts to the police on top of their physical injuries your boyfriend victims have likely suffered severe psychological trauma as well ,2,relationships
RubyWooToo,not necessarily if they have other relatives who can take them in they wo not need to be in a group home or a foster care system and no no child should have to sit there and cope with violence and emotional abuse ,3,relationships
RubyWooToo,if she becomes violent and that includes pushing you and breaking things call the police immediately even if your father refuses to press charges and makes you miserable afterward you will be creating a much needed paper trail that you will need to protect yourselves and your dad if when he decides he done with her let a trusted teacher or guidance counselor know about any violence toward you or your dad if you are in the united states these people are required by law to to report domestic violence to the authorities as for just dealing with a crazy person in the house you and your sister should try to limit how much time you have to be around her join activities and get a part time jobs that will keep you out of the home when you are at home just stay out of her way do whatever chores are required of you without being prompted also if possible talk to a relative ideally someone you trust and your dad respects maybe they can exert some positive influence over your dad and be your ally in this i am sorry that you are going through this ,3,relationships
RubyWooToo,what is happened here is that your friend is still directionless and pretty much the only interesting thing about her is the fact that she traveled through asia much of it on the dime of men that she was screwing that not an accomplishment and she knows it i would say to stop tiptoeing around her if she saying stupid and offensive things call her out on it you do not need a 10 page dissertation on why she wrong if she persists than change the subject if she tries to tie everything into her travels about asia change the subject and do not even try to be subtle about it or alternatively if you find that she simply too much an asshole then do not hang out with her anymore i know you still think she compassionate but truly giving and compassionate people are humble and do not make a show of how saintly they are ,1,relationships
RubyWooToo,glad you found this helpful also avoid viewing his behavior as a statement about your value as a woman or lack thereof if he wants to feed the egos of other girls online that his problem not yours ,2,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,keeping exes as facebook friends is not the worst thing in the world as deleting people and photos from way back when often requires more hassle than simply ignoring them as one does with probably 3 4s of their friend list anyway the issue here as that you have considerable differences between what you consider to be appropriate and inappropriate contact with exes if you are not ready to next him just yet then give him the opportunity to fix the situation instead of saying delete your photos and your exes tell him it makes me really uncomfortable that you are still liking and commenting on all your exes stuff and exchanging affectionate messages around these parts we call that coming to your captain with the problem not the solution that way the onus is on him to take action to make you comfortable and avoids putting you in the role of overbearing mommy and him in the role of rebellious teenager if his proposed solution is to tell you that you are being unreasonable than you are left with your original choice which is to either shut up about it if you decide this truly is not a deal breaker or break up with him and find someone whose boundaries and approach to dealing with exes is similar to yours ,10,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,it not just about the kids because he could be divorced and keep his kids he wants to stay with her because he wants her and because you are not worth the financial cost of leaving he might be one of those guys who loves the highs and lows of drama and got an ego boost out of pitting his crazy wife against his doting lover now that he has his crazy wife full attention they are probably in a hysterical bonding honeymoon phase when things start to go sour again he will rope you back in and the cycle will repeat itself he probably does not even have the self awareness to understand the dynamics at play you need to get therapy and you need a financial contingency plan that does not involve him it was colossally reckless that you put yourself in a position of being reliant on someone still married and with children to boot whatever bad judgment led you to the place you are now needs to be fixed ,6,adultery
RubyWooToo,it a common myth that cheaters cheat because they are not getting enough from their partners the reality is that the betrayed spouses like yourself are usually the ones doing most of the heavy lifting in the relationship because their partners are selfish and entitled like your husband ,1,relationships
RubyWooToo,when most people complain they are not actually looking for advice nor do they have any inclination to change their situation if they did they would not be complaining they would do something once you get over the desire to fix people change their minds or improve their situation you will much less frustrated ,5,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,no need to apologize i wish you the best of luck ,2,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,if you take her back she will never respect you ever again ,1,marriedredpill
RubyWooToo,get that divorce as quickly as you can you do not have the luxury of taking your time to make a decision or stupidly deciding to give him another chance because he potentially knocked up someone else and could end up in jail any day now you could lose money and assets to which you are legally entitled to child support and or his criminal defense also i am sorry to say this but you need to go into nun mode and fix your people picker before getting into a relationship and having kids with someone else your self esteem is in the gutter and you will be attracted to anyone who treats you with the slightest amount of kindness and tells you what you want to hear you made an egregious error in judgment when you married your husband which was understandable at 16 but now that you are a grown ass woman you cannot afford to make anymore foolish and reckless choices and personally i think that a man who is sleeping with and discussing having children with a woman who is still technically married and on the fence about whether to divorce is a bad choice ,5,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,does the idea of becoming a social pariah losing everything to pay for legal bills be restricted in where you can live and work potentially lose custody of children and or not being able to collect child support because he behind bars sound appealing to you because that what awaits you if you decide to stay married to someone who fucks teenagers ,4,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,me too i was debating even responding to that nonsense but i figured that even if it was a troll there might be lurker who could benefit from the advice ,5,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,my guess is that the people who make those posts are either trolling or coming here because they expect to get the advice that they want to hear ,6,RedPillWomen

RubyWooToo,work takes up a lot of time and energy boo hoo honey without children to raise why do you think that you are entitled to stay home and live off of someone else labor and i must join the chorus of everyone else who says that being engaged to man you have only known three months is an extremely reckless choice do not make things worse for yourself by giving up your financial independence ,4,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,why cannot you date guys your age or who are less than 5 years older than you and ever since finding this sub i have realized how receptive older men are to me i got a little bit of a chuckle at this you really need this sub to figure out that older men are attracted to 23 year olds hell everyone is physically attracted to 23 year olds ,10,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,the only circumstances under which i would say to forego college is if you are planning on pursuing training or certification in a trade like plumber electrician hair stylist cosmetologist etc otherwise you need a degree in order to get a job most people do not become high level career men or women but they still need to be able to feed themselves 15k in student loans is peanuts nowadays and even without help from your parents you will be able to make the payments on your loans even if you are just starting out ,3,RedPillWomen

RubyWooToo, love bombing https www elephantjournal com 2016 01 love bombing a seductive manipulative technique is a manipulative tactic early on in a relationship it when a guy essentially bombards you with grand gestures and romance takes up all of your time and progresses the relationship at rapid speed so that you cannot notice his flaws and vet him properly abusers also use love bombing as a way to reel their victims back in when their victims are on the verge of leaving the only reason i did not put love bombing on the auto dealbreaker list is because on occasion you might just meet a guy who is overly enthusiastic in the beginning especially if they are very young and they do not have much experience but even if a love bomber does not turn out to be a total psycho most of the time if a guy comes on that strong at the start he going to burn out pretty quickly ,5,RedPillWomen

RubyWooToo,i am of the school of thought that dread has absolutely no place in marriage whether you are a man or a woman you might get an emotional rise out of your spouse in the short term but in the long term you will erode trust and intimacy talk to him and try to find out what the problem is first before making assumptions and then making stupid decisions based on those assumptions ,18,RedPillWomen

RubyWooToo,no you should not tell hr and you should leave his family out of it too because it not your place you should cut contact with him and move on with your life yes you are in pain but your ex basically broke up with you and you refused to accept that decision his mistake was not being as direct and firm as he needed to be probably because he was trying to be mr nice guy and still cares about you just not romantically if he agrees to give your relationship a second chance it will only be because he capitulating to pressure from you and your social circle not because he genuinely wants to be with you ,9,relationships
RubyWooToo, fuck that go ape shit on that fucker tell him how you feel everything else was spot on but that op keep your dignity do not be a doormat and do not pretend that someone who dumped you is still your friend but at the same time do not lose your cool and flip out on someone who rejects you save the hysterics for your girlfriends and your journal ,5,RedPillWomen

RubyWooToo,but you cannot 100 know any public figure you do not know personally my judgement is based on her ideas how well informed she is and how she expresses herself she not just regurgitating the viewpoints of her male libertarian counterparts i have also seen her instagram account and far from being a baddie it pretty damn normal for a girl her age and not to be that guy but you never hear men being called attention whores just because lauren southern is more pleasing to the eye then alex jones does not make her ideas less genuine ,6,RedPillWomen

RubyWooToo,i think this blog and this post are extremely unfair unless you think that anyone who is a public personality in media deserves to get dressed down as an attention whore so she likes cosplay and posts cute pictures of herself on instagram so do many women also the quote from her book used to show her thirst for male attention is completely taken out of context the book though very short and directed at a millennial audience is meticulously well sourced informative and really entertaining she knows what she talking about and she not pandering at only 21 years old she got a great career going for herself and if she takes good care of herself she going to have no trouble settling down with someone ,37,RedPillWomen

RubyWooToo,i found this blog and this line of thinking to be extremely narrow minded and reductionist you might as well tell women who cannot have kids to go into a barn and blow their brains out women can have fulfilling lives and make valuable contributions to society whether or not they choose or are able to have children if the only careers available were hunting elk and plowing a field you might be right in saying that women are better off gathering and taking care of the hearth but we live in a modern world with many different trades some more optimal for a woman inherent skill set and some better suited for men also until the past century traditional house work was far more labor intensive than it is now last but not least with the exception of a brief period of unprecedented peace and prosperity in the 1950s early 1960s most women in the united states and through out the world worked outside of the home the option of being a sahm is privilege that many families simply cannot afford ,3,RedPillWomen

RubyWooToo,i do not think throwing a tantrum and then giving you the silent treatment for weeks is alpha that combined with his recklessness makes him more immature and not leadership material if someone i was dating did not talk to me for weeks hell even one week i would assume that the relationship was over ,12,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,while his history might be relevant for understanding him at the end of the day it irrelevant everyone has emotional baggage that they bring to a relationship it our responsibility to manage it not use it as an excuse to mistreat our partners ,8,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,i was not being so literal i was just making a point that an unattractive guy making a corny joke might get an eyeroll but if you like the guy the joke is suddenly funnier than it actually was ,3,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,in most cases cheating is almost as much sneaking around as it is with sleeping with other people even if you go to r polyamory there posts about people violating whatever few boundaries exist in their relationship do not fool yourself into thinking that your situation is the exception and not the rule it sounds like with this guy and your previous guy you are doing an lot of mental gymnastics oh i am not looking to settle down anyway oh as long as i am included to justify settling for subpar relationships you are having trouble transitioning into a normal relationship because it not a normal relationship you are still a dirty secret to his kids he not monogamous with you but wo not accept a non monogamous relationship on equal terms at least when you were an escort you knew exactly where you stood with the men you were sleeping with and you were getting paid the only thing you can expect from this guy is a lot of hot sex for however long that lasts and future heartache ,1,adultery
RubyWooToo,you are really foolish if you think that a man with a history of rampant lying and cheating is only fucking escorts and would never seek out another playmate in the wild ,1,adultery
RubyWooToo,first and most important question have you actually talked to your fiance about the changes that you are putting into place like canceling your big wedding and your wardrobe changes because if you have not asked for his input then you are still doing what you have done before which is taking direct control of everything minimizing his feelings and assuming that you know better than he does about what he needs second as horrible as your treatment of your so sounds he the one who signed up to date and then put a ring on the finger of an insufferable man hater so i have to assume that for whatever reason he found that appealing in some way do you know why that is ,3,RedPillWomen

RubyWooToo,show me the guy and i will tell you how funny the jokes were ,1,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,yes a premature i love you it part of it but beyond that it basically a bombardment of grand romantic gestures like sending flowers to your office every day talking about how you are soul mates etc it an insincere and manipulative tactic here an article https www psychologytoday com blog reading between the headlines 201703 love bombing are you victim about it the tactic is used either by people who are trying to escalate a relationship before you barely know each other it also used by abusers to reel their partners back in when they try to break off or pull back from the relationship ,1,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,this is wishful thinking on your part at best she sad that your friendship ended at worst your profession made her feel horribly awkward and she relieved that you are not speaking anymore ,1,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,if he were asking to stay with you or love bombing you then i would say there a red flag but in this case he just offering to visit and take you out on a date it honestly sounds like you made a great impression on him and there was a lot of chemistry between you two just because he has options at home does not mean he wants to squander a great opportunity with a woman he likes that he met on vacation manage your expectations though and beware of vacation goggles which is when someone who you thought was amazing when you were in a relaxed island setting and drinking pina coladas seems less dreamy when you are interacting in real life ,1,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,no thanks ,3,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,how the heck did his ex end up moving in with his family why is he ok with this arrangement if he serious with you how close is he with his family reality is your relationship is not going to progress and will most certainly be stifled while his ex wife is living with his family it sounds like this move was made and encouraged by his mother in an effort to reunite your boyfriend with his ex if your boyfriend is happy with the current arrangement and is not willing to demand respect for you from his ex and his mother then you need to next him you are a young woman with no baggage there no need for you to settle for someone with baby mama drama i would say oh she moving out in a year and half feel free to call me when that happens and if i am still single i will consider it ,2,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,well thank goodness those kids have nanny while their dad is off working and philandering and their mother is spending all her time texting and dating other men in between bouts of feeling sorry for herself in no doubt some upper east side penthouse it good to know they have at least one person looking out for them ,6,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,i do not really like her blase attitude toward infidelity ,2,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,to clarify when i mean miss i do not mean getting upset because your partner is not there i was thinking more a long the lines of what you said about personal space like letting him have his alone time in the man cave before i barrage him talking about my day and each of us having our own hobbies if you are constantly smothering each other there no room for that joyful anticipation you do not really have any new things to talk about either when you are on top of each other 24 7 as you said there always a balance ,3,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,i am saving this post for when i want to complain that hubby has spent too much time in the man cave i am not a huge fan of ester perel but in her book mating in captivity she touches on how a certain degree of distance is necessary in order to create and sustain desire because what is desire but a longing to close the gap either emotional or physical between you the practical advice i take from that and from your post is let yourself miss him and give him just enough room to miss you ,7,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,as i recall jesus listened to his mama during the wedding at cana https en wikipedia org wiki marriage at cana stopped an angry mob from stoning an adulteress allowed a prostitute to anoint his feet and instructed men to love to their wives as he loves his church also he never raped or pillaged so there that too ,5,The_Donald
RubyWooToo, but the betrayed spouse also needs to acknowledge what cracks in the marriage allowed the adultery to happen unfortunately cheating on a spouse is like deciding to burn your house down because there were structural issues and it seemed easier than fixing them or moving some place else yeah the plumbing was horrible the windows were broken the electricity did not work but holy shit now the whole damn thing including treasured possessions and memorabilia are now up in flames the fire needs to be put out first before you can start thinking of what to do next ,3,adultery
RubyWooToo,i do not think his signals are mixed at all he not into you he not shy and he not afraid to express what he likes when it comes to other girls he knows you are into him so if he wanted you he would have had you by now ,4,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,why did you buy a house if you are still on the fence ,1,survivinginfidelity
RubyWooToo,generally speaking dating someone with the hope of changing them into your ideal partner is risky often futile not really fair to them if they are happy as they are or resistant to change and is not the best way to spend your limited time and resources in your case however it wonderful that your captain was willing to invest so much in you and is very inspiring when love brings out the best in someone ,2,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,if you have what an rpw wants then you will find her in the mean time focus on making yourself into the type of guy that she would want and be prepared to demonstrate what you have to offer her not just what you hope to get out of the relationship keep this in mind rpws vet ,2,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,instead of feeling sorry for yourself maybe you should examine why you are drawn to co dependent relationships with toxic women for that matter you should also examine if and how you might be a toxic person yourself you owe it to your kids to be the one person who is sane and puts them first you should be asking how do i get out of this and fix the damage i have caused my family not how do i win back my cheating girlfriend ,2,survivinginfidelity
RubyWooToo,you got exactly what you signed up for if you want to stay in this relationship then just except that the love of your life might step out on you from time to time and learn to accept it ,2,survivinginfidelity
RubyWooToo,have you considered that cheating is really a deal breaker for you she not entitled to your love and forgiveness even if she done as best as she can to earn it ,4,survivinginfidelity
RubyWooToo,whatever gets you to sleep at night ,3,survivinginfidelity
RubyWooToo,good point i think she had enough spontaneity in her life ,1,relationships
RubyWooToo,do you want to be in legal and financial hot water do you want to lose family and friends do you want to have your reputation dragged through the mud because of your association with him if the answer is no then do not consider getting back together with your husband and get divorced as quickly as possible ,13,relationships
RubyWooToo, the impromptu trip to starbucks was actually because he was meeting her to get her plan b i got to this part and felt like vomiting on my screen not only did she cheat on you she so stupid and reckless that she did not even bother using a condom you need to get tested for stds and get out of this relationship before find yourself on the hook raising not one but two or more children fathered by other men she still wants me around though because i am pretty much her daughter father and she sees me as her best friend do not let her use her daughter as tool to keep you in the relationship as much as you love her kid legally she is not yours and your girlfriend can decide at any time probably when she thinks she found a better deal to leave you and you will have no recourse also it should go without saying that a best friend would not rip out your heart and piss on it as she has she still loves me and says she still loves to be around me but wants to find out if space will allow her to sort out her new feelings she wonders if given space she will just realize how much she would miss me if she does not have me let me run what she said through the bullshit translator for you get off my back please it really hard for me fuck around with my other boyfriend while you are bothering me with your hurt feelings and and desire for commitment now can you please just sit quietly and babysit my kid it 8 pm and i am already late for my date with yet another of my poor life choices ,12,relationships
RubyWooToo,the unfortunate downside to divorce is that during his time with the kids he will be able to live with whoever he wants except for perhaps a convicted sex offender and have that person hanging around his children and there very little that u throwawayboundary can do about it as an alternative i would say stay legally married let the husband move out and live with housemates and he can visit her and the kids at their house for family time maybe that arrangement can work at least until the youngest child is at an age where he or she can speak up at which point op can file for divorce in the meantime op can make steps to put herself in an advantageous financial position for when she decides to leave the marriage this is the unfortunate shit sandwich of marrying and having kids with a disordered person ,4,relationships
RubyWooToo,what single man in his right mind volunteers to be a housekeeper and babysitter for 4 children when he not a professional babysitter or even a trusted family member or close family friend ,51,relationships
RubyWooToo,i disagree if you know that a partner feels particularly passionate about a specific issue one that might determine whether or not they want to be in a relationship with you you should either disclose it or break up even if you think they are being ridiculous or stupid if it ends the relationship then it for the best for both of you ,2,relationships
RubyWooToo,unfortunately to her husband there no difference between a rapist and stoner he lumps them all in as criminals she precisely in the situation she was in because she hid something from him that she knew was a deal breaker if she had been honest with him they might have been able to work this out early in their relationship or they would have broken up before having a kid and getting married ,5,relationships
RubyWooToo,in d d terms your husband is lawful evil he has a fetishistic infatuation with using laws and rules as a way of terrorizing and exerting control over other people unfortunately you already married and had a kid with him which means that all the people who are inevitably going to tell you to divorce the bastard are going to overlook one key point if you get divorced you will have zero influence over your husband parenting style so here what you can do in the situation you are in do not be afraid to stand up for yourself or your kid try to limit disagreements over parenting to when you are in private do not let him bully you into abdicating the role of sole disciplinarian on to him because that going to create a dynamic with your kid where he terrified of his dad and has absolutely no respect for you on the other hand pick your battles if you choose to stay married to this guy the only away to avoid a constant state of conflict is to choose what circumstances are most important to stand your ground last but not least do not have any more children with him you do not need to add an additional 18 years to your current sentence ,4,relationships
RubyWooToo,the fact that you are religious and conservative will help you a great deal if you try to meet men in those types of circles either online for other christian singles or through your church you are more likely to meet men with traditional values and approaches toward relationships even if they are not necessarily alpha males ,1,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,do not sell your guns if it possible move some place safer and then keep your guns in the garage or a storage unit outside of the home if moving is not possible then keep them locked in a safe in the home if either of these options is not good enough too bad she knew you owned guns when she moved in with you and it not fair of her to ask you to sell them especially since they have sentimental value ,6,relationships
RubyWooToo,the memorial dinner was not about grieving for yourself it was also about being there for your parent who just lost his or her parent ,3,relationships
RubyWooToo,as someone who is actually married there no way in hell that i would skip out on my grandmother funeral or memorial dinner for my husband birthday party my husband would probably respect me less if i did not cancel his party too most of the time a spouse does come first but there are occasions where other people like children and other family members need to be prioritized this is a perfect example of one of those times ,9,relationships
RubyWooToo,how is the accusation completely false you chose your boyfriend birthday party over being there for your family during a time of loss this was not your wedding op three days is more than enough notice to cancel a party if there had been a funeral you would not have gotten any notice anyway if you do not like your family and do not want to prioritize them then own it but do not try to make them or yourself believe that they do not have a right to be pissed at you because they do also your boyfriend really missed out on an opportunity to try to make things right with your family the decent thing to do on his part would be insisting on rescheduling his birthday party so you could go to the memorial dinner instead this is one more nail in the coffin of his relationship with them ,6,relationships
RubyWooToo,i asked this question because the rpw way is not necessarily fitting for everyone and i think there more than one way to have a successful relationship while i would never advise you to hook up with a pushover or marry a man you are not attracted to and do not respect i will say that in the long term you are ultimately going to have the happiest and most enduring relationship with someone whose personality is a compliment to yours rather than a mirror image of it ,1,RedPillWomen

RubyWooToo,well as the preeminent scholar raylan givens once said if you see an asshole in the morning you have seen an asshole if you see assholes all day you are the asshole in other words you are the common denominator in all of your relationships that means there a few possibilities here after getting to know you and seeing past their initial infatuation the women discover you are a prick and do not like you anymore if that the case try not being a prick stop dating groupies if the women you are dating are infatuated with a fantasy your real self will never be able to match up you might not realize it but you are actually drawn to bitches try a little self examination as to why you are drawn to nasty women good luck ,3,relationships
RubyWooToo,i do not if you are based in the usa but if so society is increasingly on your side the costs of cigarettes rise all the time smoking is allowed in fewer and fewer places and there more of a stigma attached to being a smoker smokers have a harder time dating especially online getting jobs if they show up to an interview smelling like smoke and their insurance costs are astronomical if they are insurable at all the hope in all this is that eventually the momentary pleasure that your brother gets out of smoking wo not be worth the cost or inconvenience unfortunately as with any addiction there nothing that you can say or do to make him quit if his smoking is causing you considerable distress it might be worth researching support groups in person or online for people with family members or partners who are smokers ,1,relationships

RubyWooToo, you do not prefer to be dominant you just think you do because of the environment you grew up in her character might have been shaped by the environment she grew up in but it still who she is she can become more feminine and more nurturing but i do not think a complete transformation is going to be particularly successful it unlikely that she going to be a good match in the long term for the dominant men that she seeks i am not saying she should settle for a guy who a total doormat i think she should work with what she has and if she manages to land a greater beta https www reddit com r redpillwomen duplicates 5t2j5j the case for the greater beta that probably her best case scenario ,3,RedPillWomen

RubyWooToo,i do not subscribe to the idea that women who sleep around are doomed to become spinsters but that not something that from experience i can advocate to a young woman if u brooke261 wants to pat herself on the back and get high fives for fucking around she can find plenty of other places to oblige her like twox also she reacting to the fact that she felt insecure in her last relationship and could not cope with the emotional intensity of being in a relationship how does her current approach help her overcome that she claims that she does not need or want a relationship but in practice she still relying on men for her self worth she just choosing sex and instead of love ,8,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,you can still file for divorce while living under the same roof if you change your mind you can put a stop to the proceedings ,1,survivinginfidelity
RubyWooToo,marriage counseling is an absolute waste of time with an unremorseful person who is still cheating and lying it does not create a safe space to fess up it creates a safe space for the cheater to continue blameshifting and gaslighting their spouse if u busterdouglas01 wants to consider reconciliation i think the best move is to pay attention to his wife actions and efforts to reconcile and the progress she makes in individual counseling ,2,survivinginfidelity
RubyWooToo, when you seek out your own beauty and worth away from men you would be surprised how many people notice and how much your value increases sorry but you are still seeking your self worth from men you are just going it by getting a lot of validation from different men instead of one ,5,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,how is avoiding emotional intimacy and opting for casual sex because you are scared insecure and obsessive in relationships healthy or empowering becoming the best womanly version of yourself means understanding and overcoming your fears and flaws not running screaming from them embracing hook up culture in order to avoid the pain of intimacy is like someone becoming a meth addict in order to lose weight because dieting and exercising is too difficult and painful ,9,RedPillWomen

RubyWooToo,when your date if you do not mind my asking my anniversary is in may as well ,1,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,first and foremost and i have said this here many times before i was adamant that i would never move in with a guy before we were engaged and the wedding date set i made this clear to my husband when we were 6 months into the relationship and he asked me to move in with him many of my friends spent years playing house and then getting the marriage is a piece of paper speech no effing way was that happening to me second if a guy is super into you and wants marriage and children you wo not have to force anything when were dating my husband would talk hypothetically about where we might want to live what our kids might be like etc i never felt anxious about bringing up the future with him because he was thinking about it too if you are dating someone seriously who avoids those subjects like the plague or gives you some platitude such as i like to take things day by day take it as a red flag also i would never give a guy an ultimatum but i knew for damn sure how much time i was willing to spend in a relationship before cutting my losses in my case based on my age and how long we knew each other as friends before dating i thought that 2 years was reasonable he proposed on our 1 year anniversary and it was such a joyful surprise ,6,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,i wish you the best of luck you are going to pull through this believe me ,1,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,i am very sorry for your loss i think you should keep up with what you are doing and spend at least a year in nun mode not dating and just focusing on self improvement i think you should also look into support groups for family members partners of addicts you should also read the book co dependent no more you will really get a lot out of it this is not baggage if you overcome it and come out a better and wiser person also you are still so young you have time to meet the right person and achieve your dreams of starting a family i know this might come off as insensitive but if this had to happen it was best that it did before you were married had kids and had sunk your best years into this relationship ,6,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,while i am glad that you are out of your bad situation i get absolutely no satisfaction out of your suffering i really wish you the best on your journey of healing ,1,adultery
RubyWooToo,thanks for posting this u elffey i think it fair to say that by reading this article one learns way more about u electricwoman9 ms griffiths than she does about rpw it seemed like a online home for thousands of defeated women jealous of that girl at their high school with impeccably long legs who everyone brother wanted to bang they did not see themselves as the hot girl but these women had never been able to quite make it as one of the boys either the fact that they subscribe to this dichotomy tells you everything you need to know methinks the lady is projecting ,2,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,if you cannot cope with your boyfriend past cheating then you should not be with him i think a history of cheating is a perfectly reasonable deal breaker but you cannot have it both ways you cannot stay with him and then proceed to beat him over the head repeatedly about his past cheating accept his past or move on as for how you can be loving and supportive he told you stop trying to pry his feelings out of him your role is to be his partner not his therapist ,4,RedPillWomen

RubyWooToo,first of all you need to get over the fantasies of what courtship should look like while a strong man of quality will appreciate a woman who is feminine and alluring he is not going to waste a lot of time with a woman who acts like she a disney princess who wants him to fight a dragon in order to be worthy of her affection second however i have rarely been approached by the alpha male types and rarely go dates with them when i do i cannot seem to keep their interest there two things that could be at play here possibly a combination of both 1 the type of alpha men you want are precisely the types that have no interest in settling down 2 you think that you are very sweet nurturing and accommodating but you are actually very controlling in passive aggressive and subtle ways kinda like the men you criticize third to address this part of your post i also noticed that most of these guys in the past indirectly send little almost unnoticeable signals in their attempts to flirt with me sometimes so subtle i cannot even tell they are flirting they get very offended and butthurt when i ignore or tell them i am not interested and then start acting all passive aggressive angry rather than speaking directly to me about it basically i find the men who have liked me in my life unmasculine in personality and while i do not mind being friends with them i am not interested in getting involved with them romantically if a guy is making considerable effort to hang out with you a lot and try to engage with you it does not matter how subtle their flirtations are it safe to assume that they are interested in you if you are not interested in them and you cannot even muster respect for them then why do you carry on a friendship with them guys actually prefer being shutdown outright than have someone string them along cut out the beta orbiters ,6,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,i need feminism because men are not mind readers ,2,CringeAnarchy
RubyWooToo,traditionally women and men had exclusive spaces to freely talk and socialize among themselves without ridicule or judgement from the other sex the idea of that everything has to be inclusive and considerate of everyone feelings and opinions is the absurd feminist ideal i do not go into trp and rail on men who i think are assholes or fucking up because it not my place trp would also ban my ass in heartbeat if i even tried rpw deserves the same degree of respect ,21,RedPillWomen

RubyWooToo,call me old fashioned but i think a man best female friend should be his wife or girlfriend i do not think platonic friendship between men and women is impossible but if you have a friendship with someone of the opposite sex that exists in its own private bubble and have little or no emotional boundaries with one another it going to cause trouble for your romantic relationships there at least one or two posts on r relationships on any given week about drama between a woman and her boyfriend female best friend one of my closest friends is male but we definitely scaled back our hanging out when we were in relationships and actively made an effort to become good friends with each other partners and include them in our outings also since i have gotten married the only new male friends i have are part of couples that my husband i hang out with together ,16,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo, in my experience i found having sex too soon really did create a false sense of attachment to someone i might not have dated more than 4 5 times otherwise exactly this it really is amazing what you are willing to overlook or put up after having sex with someone especially when the sex is really good although i am religious when i eventually have kids my argument for abstaining from sex or at least being selective about who they sleep with it is going to be almost entirely based on this practical argument in fact it seems a lot of biblical prohibitions turn out to be based practical considerations anyway like eating meat and dairy together was probably a really bad idea in the days before refrigeration and pasteurization ,1,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,not entirely true she has a whole section about how to recognize real remorse https www chumplady com 2013 07 real remorse or genuine imitation naugahyde remorse ,5,survivinginfidelity
RubyWooToo,actually i think her approach works well with both remorseful and irredeemable cheaters if a marriage has even the slightest chance of being saved refusing to pick me dance filing for divorce immediately and refusing to accept the blame is exactly what is needed to send a swift and powerful wake up call to the cheater the few people i know who have successfully reconciled all took this approach as for those that did not they either put in years and years of suffering before ultimately getting divorced or are still enduring wreckconciliation the cheating spouse rugsweeps fence sits and generally does not have any respect for the betrayed spouse or put any effort into their healing lastly the circumstance you mentioned in your comment cheated one time and confessed immediately is about as rare as a four leaf clover more often than not cheating is just another expression of dishonest and selfishness on the part of the cheater ,7,survivinginfidelity
RubyWooToo,since you mention how you do not want to get divorced because of your son how would you feel if you saw your son and his wife get into an argument and he started calling her fat stupid bitch or cunt what if your daughter in law called you crying because she found a dating app on his phone ,42,relationships
RubyWooToo,well at least your mom always knows where he is at all times ,12,relationships
RubyWooToo,so before he transformed into aqua man what was your relationship like before what shared hobbies and interests did you have what activities did you enjoy together edit also the other issue i see here is that even though you do not financially contribute to the house you still share that home with him and she should be at least moderately interested in your comfort if he not and if his retort is constantly my house my rules then it safe to say that you really are not on the same page regarding marriage and a shared future you are lucky that you found all this out before getting yourself locked down into a mortgage with him or investing any money into a house that you have no stake in ,7,relationships
RubyWooToo,having experienced the pitfalls and benefits of waiting vs not waiting here my pros and cons list pros avoid unplanned pregnancy and stds avoid getting overly emotionally attached to a guy before he been vetted weed out guys who are only interested in casual sex if i lose interest in the guy it easier to make a clean break no anxiety about worrying whether we are exclusive or not cons might invest a lot of time dating and getting to know someone only to find out that you are not physically compatible it extremely difficult to resist sleeping with someone that you are very physically attracted to it a huge challenge to avoid situations where sex is a possibility ie any time you are alone and abstain from sex without avoiding affection or intimacy entirely ,2,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,your mom is a lioness she doing the right by you by putting you in therapy and switching schools even if the rumors make their way to your new school you will at least have family members there to support you you will get through the school year by just focusing on getting through each day in one piece before you know it june will be here as for regina she bullying you because she cannot lash out at the adults in her life once you are in a new school and not around the house she going to either cause trouble for someone else at school or for your dad and her mother at which point they will have to start taking her behavior seriously i am not telling you this so you will feel sorry for her but only so you can be assured that it not sunshine and roses for regina either right now he doting on her to impress his girlfriend but there only so long he will be able to carry on that act ,42,relationships
RubyWooToo,i know you always wanted to believe the best in him but it pretty awful of him to blame your supposed lack of guilt on the breakup he knows you well enough at this point to know how much you have struggled the real issue which he does not want to admit is that he cannot or does not want to manage two separate lives anymore he knows that you want a full relationship with him outside the shadows but he wo not give you that i know that this end is not the satisfying closure that you want but you need to go no contact with him he continuing to drag you around the heartstrings over text message and as u neverwouldveguessed said it only a matter of time before he feels lonely has an itch to scratch and ropes you back into his bed the most you were ever going to get from him was an arrangement where he got to come over to your place after tucking his kids in bed do you honestly think that the life that god had planned for you ,1,adultery
RubyWooToo,unless he turning you down for sex on a regular basis and or his porn use is interfering with his work or other responsibilities his masturbation activities with or without the use of porn are really his own business if you try to police his porn or guilt trip him with your insecurities you are going to cause yourself and him a lot of unnecessary misery masturbation is really just about getting a quick release and for men porn is just a visual aid to get there think of it this way even if you love sitting down for meals with your partner sometimes you just want to grab a bag of chips for yourself and zone out in front of the tv does the fact that you do that mean you no longer enjoy cooking for and having dinner with your partner of course not you just wanted a snack ,2,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,if you open up your relationship then you and your girlfriend need to get over the sex but no emotions expectation the reality is once you start engaging with other women romantically even if your original intent is no string attached sex only you will eventually meet a woman who you are compatible with both emotionally and physically at that point both women will have to be comfortable sharing you both emotionally and physically if that not a possibility you will probably decide that you do not want to play house with your girlfriend and want to be with someone who is a full package if that a risk you or your girlfriend are unwilling to take then your only other option besides breaking up is to have sex with prostitutes ,4,relationships
RubyWooToo,i think you just need to develop a sense of humor about these sorts of things i am a bit snarky so i would have been tempted to write back last i checked access to my vagina was not guaranteed by the 14th amendment ,1,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,if he was 21 as well then i would say not to push it just yet as it likely that a guy that age has not yet figured out his place in the world let alone where children might fit into it but he 25 and you have been together for 3 years so i think you should share your goals with him and try to get him to share his thoughts and plans if you find that you are not on the same page or if he simply refuses to engage on the subject then you have to decide how much more time you want to invest in the relationship ,1,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,instead of being upset that he called you a bigot you should be relieved that you had the good judgement not to go to his apartment can you imagine how that level of anger and entitlement would have come out if you rejected a sexual advance ,1,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,there no way to make someone happy about the fact that he being rejected let go of your fear of being on the receiving end of anger or pain it just goes with the territory if you are considered about the level of time and money guys are putting in during the vetting phase then you can suggest dates that are low key and low investment but if for example a guy you just met insists on taking you to a 5 star michelin rated restaurant for a first date because he wants to impress you that his choice do not feel guilty if you do not reciprocate his interest after the fact the only thing that you really owe a person while you are dating is kindness and respect if you are not interested politely but straight forwardly let him know sooner rather than later as an aside you are in your early 20s so if you are dating within your age group you are likely meeting a lot of guys who simply do not have a lot of dating experience and have not really developed the skill of handling rejection with dignity ,2,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,sit down with your girlfriend and have a discussion about what you both consider to be cheating and come to an agreement about your boundaries this is not about who is right or wrong or who conservative or not it a compatibility issue if you cannot come to an agreement then you are not compatible ,1,relationship_advice
RubyWooToo,why is besides the point what is more important is that now that this person leg is broken what are you going to do to help them if the answer is nothing then malice or accident of the initial act is still irrelevant ,1,DeadBedrooms
RubyWooToo,you missed the point of the metaphor whether intentional or not you still harmed someone ,2,DeadBedrooms
RubyWooToo,they all say their last girlfriend cheated on them he was probably doing all the cheating and projecting his bad behavior on to you i am sure he telling this next girlfriend you are a cheater also there is a distinction between being a good first mate and being doormat it seems like you were the latter unless you actually cheated him he had no reason to demand access to your phone and all your passwords i suggest you get a credit check done replace any credit cards you have and change all your passwords unless you are married and sharing finances you should never give anyone unrestricted access to your devices ,7,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,whether you run over someone leg by accident or on purpose the leg is still broken ,1,DeadBedrooms
RubyWooToo,i have nothing against the concept of stay at home husband it just would not work in my situation my husband makes twice what i do and his skills and expertise are in high demand at the moment the very few women i have known with stay at home husbands were top executives to the point where hypergamy at least from a financial standpoint was not quite possible but even though these husband stayed at home with the kids they were still involved in some form of work such as part time freelancing or small online businesses interestingly and much to the chagrin of modern feminists is that the increase of women as the primary wage earner and the increase of men as primary caregiver is motivating reform of family law as more women are paying out alimony and child support http time com money 4116161 alimony reform spousal support personally i think it bullshit that so many women think alimony is fair when given to a woman but unfair when men so much for equality ,2,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,the fact that the kids seem to be an after thought in all this is really disturbing ,6,polyamory

RubyWooToo,let break this down shall we he lied to you about his marital status he was sleeping with you behind his wife back it also possible he was sleeping with her at the time too he strung his wife along until she found out from facebook of all places that he was cheating on her consequently she filed for divorce not him if he was so inclined he could have kept having two lives indefinitely if he had not been busted he allowed his family to think that you were a woman of no integrity you now know what manipulation and cruelty your husband is capable of how the hell can you put your head back in the sand what is going to happen when the shine eventually wears off your marriage and he tells you he needs some time a part to clear his head ,3,relationships
RubyWooToo,no way if you have young children it would be completely reckless and irresponsible to move in and have a blended family even on a part time basis with a couple that you barely know ,7,polyamory
RubyWooToo,so your friend wanted you to jeopardize your own relationship with your boyfriend and your reputation to cover her ass ,3,relationships
RubyWooToo,how long have you been together if it been less than a year then it makes sense that he would be apprehensive about getting married however i completely agree with your reasoning about not wanting to move in with him make it clear to him that you respect his decision not to get married but that you are not giving up your home and financial independence without marriage as for your family believe me i totally understand your anxiety but as upset as they might be with the idea of you being pregnant out of wedlock they will probably be infuriated at the idea that you agreed to live in sin indefinitely instead of holding true to your desire for marriage otherwise congratulations on your upcoming baby i wish he or she a lifetime of health happiness and joy ,4,relationship_advice
RubyWooToo,personally i think you have every right to feel insecure your boyfriend had no respect for your feelings or your health how can you possibly feel secure with no foundation in the form of honest communication and agreed upon boundaries upon which trust is built also not only did he not talk to you about what happened he badmouthed you to the woman he slept with that just as much if not more of a betrayal of trust than the sex if he severely conflict avoidant and prefers to take of the approach of it easier to apologize than ask for permission then you might to re consider whether he someone you want to be in a relationship with period ,23,polyamory
RubyWooToo,i am really loving everything u phornicator brings to the party ,2,polyamory
RubyWooToo,you think you know more about what he did than the police who actually investigated the crime and threw him in jail also this man is still married since you call yourself a woman of god then you should know that having sex with this man is considered adultery i do not think any of this advice matters though because you are thoroughly besotted with him and are naive enough to believe all of his bullshit predators are very adept at selecting their victims ,8,relationship_advice

RubyWooToo,i am not being emphatic or jumping down your throat i guess it hard to convey tone in a comment i am a complete stranger no horse in this race i can assure you re read the 4th section of the post if i am misunderstanding what i read i would be happy for the op to contradict it ,7,polyamory
RubyWooToo,except overnights never happened but wife never got to sleep over even though now malefriend knows we are in an open relationship she kept wearing sexy underwear in the hopes of having a sleep over the blowjob question was hypothetical there no indication anywhere in the post that the wife even got close to getting in malefriend pants all of their interactions involved social gatherings with other people op on the otherhand seems like he had a very good shot with his femalefriend that why his wife is enraged the guy she was really hot for was rejecting her while her husband relationship with another woman was progressing ,9,polyamory
RubyWooToo,you and the people who upvoted you clearly did not bother reading the post very thoroughly which is too bad because you missed out on the lunacy of it all not only did she never fuck the guy she never even came close since malefriend did not even know she thought they were dating the extent of their relationship was playing games with groups of people at his house and stalking him at a gaming festival she bought lingerie and she talked about blowing him but the guy was not having any of it op on the other hand seems like he actually had a relationship or the strong potential for one with femalefriend but i doubt she will have any interest in him after being dumped twice ,10,polyamory
RubyWooToo,why what is up ,1,survivinginfidelity
RubyWooToo,this article is written from a pro life perspective but there a helpful map http dailysignal com 2015 05 08 the nation is about to debate late term abortions where does your state stand with the state by state upper limits of the time frame for abortion as you can see there are states that do not have any limits at all for late term abortions though some of these may have changed since the article was published ,3,Drama
RubyWooToo,they had an in utero paternity test so they knew genetically that the baby had xx chromosomes also you can know the sex of the baby at 18 20 weeks which believe it or not is within the legal limit in many states ,6,Drama
RubyWooToo,your wife was not in love she was completely infatuated with a guy who did not know what the hell was going on and was not particularly interested in her her entire relationship with him was in her head and yet she was willing to throw a 20 year marriage with young children overboard for him i would suggest marriage counseling or improving your communication but quite honestly i do not see how either of those things is productive or even possible when you have a partner who is that disconnected from reality i also think the treatment of your friend here was pretty atrocious and not just from a romantic relationship perspective i think you need to examine your definition of love as well because treating other human beings as disposal after their existence becomes inconvenient certainly does not qualify ,79,polyamory
RubyWooToo,in most places if you are married the husband is assumed to be the father her promises to not put her husband on the birth certificate or demand child support are meaningless because once the child was born if he assumed parental responsibility for that child for any length of time depending on the state he would be on the hook for that child legally as for greg it does not seem like they got a dna test confirming that he was the father only a dna test confirming that the husband was not therefore the woman would have had to get greg to get a dna test to confirm his paternity which he would have refused she probably would have taken had to take him court after the child was born and her divorce was final and who is to say that greg is the father anyway she could have cheated with others ,10,Drama
RubyWooToo,good point but even still an in utero paternity test still takes at least a week to get the result she already had the week she needed to think it through ,5,relationship_advice
RubyWooToo,what about forsaking all others ,28,relationship_advice
RubyWooToo,it takes at least a week to receive the results for an in utero paternity test you already had the week you needed plus whatever time you had from when you found out you were pregnant to consider all possible outcomes and courses of action you were not physically forced against your will and you were not threatened with violence you are 100 responsible for this abortion taking place you begging your husband to take on the legal financial and emotional responsibility for your child from an affair is the height of selfishness and entitlement and do not bullshit me about how you would not have put him on the birth certificate or asked for money because in most places when a married woman becomes pregnant the husband is considered the father by default trying it out was not an option for him you did not want to deal the financial hardship or the shame of your affair being exposed by the pregnancy you did not choose your husband over the baby you chose your own convenience and ego over the baby and what if your child decided she wanted to meet her real dad or found out later on because of medical issues or she decided to do 23 me for fun that he was not her dad what if greg decided weeks months or years later that he wanted to get involved in his kid life you are like a person who ran over someone with your car while driving recklessly and instead of being grateful that your victim did not sue you you are demanding they shell out money to the damage to your car that you caused and then years later you run over the person again because you thought you could get away with it like you did the last time edited first paragraph for facts ,57,relationship_advice
RubyWooToo,she was protecting herself because that the only person she cares about ,51,relationship_advice
RubyWooToo,that why i do not know how you can stay with him after reading that how can you be vulnerable with him how can you trust him to follow through on in sickness and in health he wished you would die because at that point in his life your very existence was inconvenient ,3,survivinginfidelity
RubyWooToo,are you married to him because if you are then he absolutely has the power of life or death over you he will have the legal authority to make medical decisions on your behalf in the event that you are ever incapacitated or whether or not you are taken off life support ,3,survivinginfidelity
RubyWooToo,i know you feel bad for your sister but this is the arrangement that she chosen for herself she also has the option of finding and paying for a babysitter that might be available on short notice considering what a hardass the brother in law is it probably better for everyone if they have a babysitter who is an employee ,30,relationships
RubyWooToo,i do not think you should reassure him that his dad loves him your son should not grow up equating love with neglect and abandonment the next time your little boy cries about his daddy just comfort him and tell him that he did nothing wrong and that his dad has problems that have nothing to do with him tell him you love him and you will always be there ,3,survivinginfidelity
RubyWooToo,it not victim blaming to say fix your picker if anything it empowering it the idea that we can assert control over our choice of partner and we are not at the mercy of our physical desires or family history cheaters say all the time it just happened and i cannot help how i feel and we all say bullshit to that because that what it is cheating does not happen in a vacuum people who are selfish and dishonest are not that way in only one aspect of their lives there are things you can watch out for that are completely not romantically related from which you can assess someone character such as do they follow through on their promises and obligations to others do they have integrity in their business and financial dealings have you ever caught them lying do they omit things in order to avoid conflict are they constantly overcompensating or seeking to impress people will they rush to aid of a stranger or acquaintance in need at the expense of people close to them alternately do they seem completely selfless and generous with people they do not know well but less so with those closest to them are they open with sharing their feelings even if it leads to conflict or uncomfortable situations generally speaking are they good at asserting boundaries are they love bombing you or pushing to take the relationship to a serious level too early in the relationship do they give off the single vibe even when in a relationship there plenty more i can think of but i think that a good start ,6,survivinginfidelity
RubyWooToo,your sister needs to stand up to her husband on her own and you should stay out of it also consider the fact that even if your boyfriend was allowed to come with you to babysit it is not really fair to him for you to drop whatever you are doing with him whenever your sister calls even if he says he he does not mind furthermore i would be nervous as hell babysitting for such a controlling guy kid he would probably turn any bump bruise or scrape on that kid into a major incident the next time she gives up an impromptu phone call to babysit and you are out with your boyfriend just respond sorry i am with my boyfriend let me know in advance next time you want me to babysit perhaps when she realizes that you are no longer on call whether or not your boyfriend is with you she will become frustrated enough with her situation to do something about it ,59,relationships
RubyWooToo,the tattoo artist who agreed to this should lose their license ,5,CringeAnarchy
RubyWooToo,as crazy as his behavior is i do not think it a mental illness issue it a severe personality and character defect the reason i believe this is because he managed to keep his demons in check right up until you moved in together once he was secure that he had you trapped he let himself off the leash fortunately he was not calculated enough to wait until you were legally married at which point you probably would have felt compelled to try to work things out ,40,relationships
RubyWooToo,i am not going to mince words with you your now ex fiance is a sick fuck give him back his ring so that he never has an excuse to have contact with you again and while you are at it change all of your passwords and put a temporary credit freeze with the credit bureaus block him from being able to call or text you and get a cease and desist letter from a lawyer or notify the police if he continues against your wishes if you think this is over the top then please re read your post again he shown himself to be vindictive and unpredictable edit add i also think you should follow u restingmurderface advice and post a public video on your page explaining that your facebook was hijacked i know it uncomfortable and cringey as hell but your ex fiance did some serious damage to your reputation that could potentially have long term consequences ,269,relationships
RubyWooToo,your friend had an abortion so you cannot say that she would not have eventually suffered a miscarriage or had a child with birth defects maybe you can get away with doing a few of those things on the list and still have a healthy pregnancy but the woman op is posting about did pretty much everything she was not supposed to except for eating deli meat ,9,CringeAnarchy
RubyWooToo,if he had been faithful to maddie for 3 years he would not be having a panic attack about children who are under 2 years old he would laugh and hang up the phone and what are the chances that two women from completely opposite sides of the world who do not know each other be conspiring to chase him down for child support he met his girlfriend in a pub popular with international students why is it incredulous to believe that how he met these women if he really wants you honest advice so you can help him tell him he could start by telling you the truth ,13,relationships
RubyWooToo,i think it would counterproductive to have a web site with a ton of men focused on how to get laid and ton of women on securing a long term relationship what i like about the rp philosophy is that if you understand it it can be applied to any medium ,1,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,do not knock the laundromat when my dad was single he swore by it if you live an urban area like new york city you will find people of all types in the laundromat as a lot of apartments even nice ones do not have washer and dryers my dad loved the laundromat because you could see whether or not someone is married or has kids if you see kids clothing or clothing of the other sex in the mix and people are just generally bored and happy to talk some of the nicer laundromats in my old neighborhood even have wifi and coffee ,3,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,there is no way in hell that you are going to cancel your wedding and keep the relationship if you had not been dating that long or if you were just out of college then your reservations would make sense but you are a grown ass 34 year old man in a relationship for 5 years so no you cannot expect her to endure the heartbreaking disappointment huge financial loss and immense embarrassment of canceling a wedding so you can string her along indefinitely ,36,relationships
RubyWooToo,i was in your situation and unfortunately it killed the friendship the couple in question simply had no respect for boundaries and viewed every social gathering as an opportunity to hook up with other people no matter if the other people present were in open relationships or not if you want to keep the friendship then you did the right thing by calling them out and hopefully it will never happen again but if you want to bow out of the friendship now simply because you do not feel comfortable with their arrangement and feel awkward around them that fine too ,5,relationships
RubyWooToo,if he would not give up the dog after only 6 months of having her do you really think he will give her up once years have passed ,4,relationships
RubyWooToo,i do not have trouble believing this was rape simply because people who are engaged in activities that they need to hide are prime targets for predators if for example your partner met up with this guy with the intent of cheating on you and changed her mind at the last minute the guy could probably rape her knowing there was a good chance he would get away with it because she would not want to out herself by reporting him to the authorities despite the horrible trauma that your partner likely endured that does not mean that you are obligated to stay in the relationship she repeatedly betrayed you and demonstrated poor judgment even though she did not deserve to be attacked if what you are looking for is absolution to walk away you got it but if you are looking for reassurance that the scenario is not too far fetched and you are not crazy for believing her then you have that too ,8,survivinginfidelity
RubyWooToo,all the people saying do not get involved are completely ignoring the fact that by agreeing to this woman as 1 op and her fiance are getting involved plus if this trashy situation blows up it could cause a lot of drama that they do not need at this time ,4,relationships
RubyWooToo,she not saying who he can and cannot date she saying that she does not want to share her wedding table with a girl she does not approve of for very valid reasons also this situation is rife for opportunities for drama can you not recognize that ,3,relationships
RubyWooToo,actually the very nature of a guest list is that you decide who is and is not allowed to attend the wedding also even if op did not give a shit about the morality of the situation does she really want to worry about some drama at her wedding what if someone recognizes this girl what if the pictures are shared on social media and it causes a fiasco what if she simply does not want to make conversation with this person who is sitting at her main table weddings are stressful enough without this bullshit ,0,relationships
RubyWooToo,i did not say he had to out the girl to her boyfriend but if op and her fiance do not want her there then she should not be invited ,2,relationships
RubyWooToo,actually their wedding is by definition their circus they do not have to invite anyone they do not want there for whatever reason if the fiance buddy wants to be the backdoor man he can do so on his own damn time ,82,relationships
RubyWooToo, your fiance is an asshole if he freaked out about you wanting to say something who the fuck cares if joe gets burned it like your fiance is not only totally okay with cheating but he actively willing to hide it alarm bells op seriously either the fiance is extremely conflict averse which is bad or his morals are messed up too which is awful ,145,relationships
RubyWooToo,i am going to go against the grain here and say that this woman is not your friend she had no problem having a hand in the destruction of your marriage and a woman in her mid late 20s is not a helpless babe in the woods what makes you think you can trust her for that matter why should she trust you i also cannot help but wonder if you want to reach out to feel magnanimous for yourself or to join forces so you can get back at your ex you got the bastard out of your life why do you want to get involved with him again also what happens if she and your ex end up reconciling if your kids want to have a relationship with their younger sibling then your husband should be the one to facilitate that relationship it not your place to interfere if your ex is not willing to do that then i think it would be best to let your kids make that decision for themselves when they are old enough ,3,relationships
RubyWooToo,it not fair to your kids to put the responsibility for this toxic relationship continuing on their shoulders read the book no more mr guy and co dependent no more you are investing so much of your time and emotional energy in this flaming dumpster of a marriage that there probably very little left to care for your children ,12,relationships
RubyWooToo,eventually his ex inlaws will be paid off the money he giving them now is a temporary nuisance if he really the enterprising fellow you say he is and still quite young then hopefully his future career growth will compensate for the loss of earnings he dealing with now and fortunately there no kids involved so cutting a check is the extent of his contact with his ex lastly as i said in my last comment he made this shitty deal in his haste to start up his relationship with you not very wise on his part but at least you know that self sacrifice is in his nature ,2,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,so basically he caved into her demands in order to get a speedy divorce so he could date you is that correct if that the case that yet another example of just really lousy decision making on his part but to be fair to him if alimony was a potential deal breaker issue for you it would have been better if you had backed out early in the relationship or waited until the ink was dry on his divorce so you could properly assess the impact it might have your future it been a year now though and you are both really emotionally invested so now the situation is complicated if you decide to stay with him you are really just going to have to stfu and try to think of the alimony as the heavy price he paid in his haste to start up his relationship with you but if the alimony issue is just going to eat away at you then save yourselves the misery and walk away now ,2,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,i did not say forever i said at least for a fixed period of time depending on the circumstances the only case where i might say that alimony would be indefinite would be if the couple had been married for decades and the non working spouse was over 50 which would make it extremely difficult to get a job with a living wage i like the idea in your second paragraph but quantifying the value of housework is not as easy or as clear cut as you make it seem i can just imagine how tedious the back and forth in court would be over the putting a price tag on every chore ,3,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,assuming the stay at home spouse did not commit adultery was not abusive and was a successful primary caregiver he or she should not be left destitute or struggling when the marriage dissolves funny enough there was a time magazine article recently about how feminists are now seeking to do away with alimony because with the rise in stay at home dads and the increase in women who are primary wage earners as u teaandtalk said you cannot have it both ways either both spouses work and you have no fault and no alimony or you give assume the risk of spousal support if one partner opts out of the workforce ,9,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,ok the relationship did not end because of a fuck up on your part if you found a good man once it safe to say that you can find a good man again also your shady past happened in your teens and early 20s and can therefore be dismissed as youthful mistakes and the fact that you have shown you have the ability to have a stable long term relationship as you did with your ex bode well for your future prospects i think you need to go into nun mode for a little longer and spend some time cultivating a strong personal identity once you are happy with yourself now the past wo not matter as much ,3,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,what were the different life goals that ended your last relationship if i may ask ,1,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,why is he paying spousal support if there no children unless she had a severe disability that prevented her from working then he has extremely bad judgement for allowing her to not work for so many years without children to care for and he picked a really shitty lawyer also be honest with yourself are your interests so bizarre and are you such a pain in the ass that you are hard pressed to find someone who could put up with your shit if the answer is yes then sure swallow this shit sandwich and be grateful that you have found this saint but if your idiosyncratic ways are harmless like a creepy doll collection or a macabre sense of humor then trust me you will find someone else with whom you are compatible edit typos and re wording,3,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,quite frankly if you are an attractive single young woman in your 20s there no reason to settle for a guy who will be spending considerable time and money for a family that is not yours also if he paying tens of thousands a year in child support spousal support and repaying his in laws then you can forget about being a sahm he obviously wo not be able to afford that or else you would not be here but even if he could he probably would not let you since he would not want to risk being the sole wager earner again if you were well into your 30s or a single mother yourself my advice might be different i would tell you to in your stage of life or situation you are going to have to accept his baggage just as he would need to accept yours also if possible you should advise him to try to renegotiate his settlement if it truly unfair or unmanageable but that not the case here if you can find a guy who you can have a clean slate with and who is able to be 100 emotionally legally and financially devoted to you and the family you build together then that what you should have ,6,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,if the parent receiving alimony has little or no work experience or has not worked in years so he or she could stay at home and take care of children then i think alimony is completely fair at least for a fixed period of time while the sah spouse has time to get an education or necessary skills to participate in the workforce ,11,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,i think you could teach r thebluepill a lesson on how satire is done ,1,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,since this is your ex girlfriend daughter it ultimately up to her how she wants to handle it while i think the sentiment of your letter is kind i do not think the wording is appropriate since she a young child she cannot have a relationship with you that separate from her mother if she starts demanding to see or speak to you against her mother or father wishes that going to create friction in her parental relationships if your ex will allow you to send her a letter you should agree on the wording together lastly i do not think sharing easter is a good idea because that sending a mixed message both to your girlfriend and her daughter also the last thing you want is this child be used even inadvertently as a way for your ex to keep you in her life or vice versa ,71,relationships
RubyWooToo, my sister also said he did not know her name but we look almost identical like we used to get mistaken as twins before she died her hair well at least you know you are his type op ,180,relationships
RubyWooToo,stealing from you seems like a small stupid problem to have that means your bar is way too damn low have some respect for yourself do you really think this is the best you can do just because you came from a rough background and just because he was there for you during tough times in the past does not mean that you have to sellout your dignity or future happiness you owe nothing to anyone in a relationship with except love respect and decency he showing you none of that besides a guy whose low on money can find plenty of free options for porn ,3,relationships
RubyWooToo,you need a divorce lawyer and a forensic accountant you need to get out now you need to secure the best deal you can for spousal support if you are entitled to any as a previous stay at home mother and child support before your husband gets busted for his crimes you do not want to lose your job with your security clearance have lousy credit and end up destitute from lawsuits and legal bills because you stayed married to a crook you need the forensic accountant to see where your money has been going discover any debts he been running up behind your back and any loans and credit cards in your name or children names that you do not know exist if he stealing from those closest to him like his mother and his friends it not a stretch to think he would be stealing from you too ,27,relationships
RubyWooToo,if you are in the united states where underage drinking and weed are illegal and he violent then you and your girlfriend could get in serious trouble if the police are ever called to your house because of one of his wild parties or if he ever physically attacks you you do not know what other illegal shit he doing in your house while you are away either also do you own your home or do you rent because if you rent then you are at risk at being evicted because of his behavior and potential damage to the property if the legal and physical risks that your gf brother poses are not enough to wake her the hell up then you need to protect yourself by moving out alternatively you can call the cops next time he lights up a joint under your roof or you come home to an underage drinking party i am sure they will be happy to take him off your hands ,8,relationships
RubyWooToo,believe it or not the absolute worst thing that you can do if you want to keep a relationship is to fight for it it gives the other person the sense that they have all the time in the world to string you along and hook up with other people if you want to save this relationship you have to be willing to end it that means you tell him to get the rest of shit out of your apartment when you are not there and you go completely no contact with him no phone calls e mails social media nada move into a new place or get a room mate in your current one if there a chance your relationship can be saved then this will be a wake up call about what he losing and he will be the one fighting for your relationship if he intent on dumping you for good then fine it will be easier for you to move on and your dignity will be intact but honestly it seems to me like he checked out of the relationship he telling you there hope and that he needs to find himself because he thinks its less cruel than telling you he is not in love with you anymore i know this is the case because i used those same lame lines and had to listen to them when i was being dumped when i was in my mid 20s people grow a lot from their teens into their 20s what you think was a sudden change or quarter life crisis has probably been happening gradually over time your boyfriend has probably been stewing on this decision for a long time even longer than the past few weeks and this other girl coming along was just to the catalyst to doing what he had been thinking about doing for a while ,4,relationships
RubyWooToo,it does not sound like it in your children best interest to have this woman in their lives from the behavior you describe she probably the reason their biodad is the cough upstanding man he is today if your children are interested in her they are free to contact her themselves when they turn 18 ,1,relationships
RubyWooToo,i do not think 2 new toys a year is a big deal for an older child depending on how stimulating the toy is but its certainly not enough for babies and toddlers whose brains are developing rapidly it easy for them to lose interest in their existing toys after several months just as they grow out of their clothes quickly too ,22,relationships
RubyWooToo,how do you know that op is not an elf very species ist of you ,2,relationships
RubyWooToo,if his behavior is unacceptable and he does not want to change then she should skip the bullshit and go straight to the divorce or annulment if possible compromising her dignity and values is not going to fix the situation ,20,relationships
RubyWooToo,or he might not throw a tantrum instead he will be happy to use her bad behavior as an excuse to do whatever he wants ,66,relationships
RubyWooToo,especially on your honeymoon ,4,relationships
RubyWooToo,if this is how he acts on your honeymoon how do you think he going to be once the shine has worn off your marriage ,3,relationships
RubyWooToo,your parents are not married for financial reasons last i checked a marriage license was 50 at most in the over 2 decades they have been together they could not scrape together that cash from between the couch cushions here the real deal your mom always wanted to get married and your dad refused for whatever reason your mom saw your wedding as an opportunity to live vicariously through you now your rejection of her wedding plans has become an extension of your dad refusal to marry her your dad is angry at you because your marriage is dredging up old arguments and resentments that he thought were buried if he does not want your mom to be upset anymore he needs to get off your case and marry her your mistake in all this was relying on your mother to be your wedding planner you delegated a lot to her and clearly did not communicate enough with her through out the process until things got really out of control and then you just pulled the plug on the whole thing as irrational as your mom is behaving right now i understand why she feels put out and blindsided i think the best way to do damage control is to plan a party for your friends and relatives yourself after you elope ,2,relationships
RubyWooToo,you say things have always been rocky in your marriage so i am going to guess that this incident is probably the tip of the iceberg please hold off on having children until you get your marriage sorted out especially since he plans on raising kids who have contempt for teachers including their own mother ,1,relationships
RubyWooToo,maybe it time for him to pick up the slack with a steady job so you have more time to write ,9,relationships
RubyWooToo,i am pretty stunned by your sister utter lack of compassion for your parents does her plan also mean that she might miss out on your funeral as well i do not think you need to reassure your sister that she should put herself first she seems like she got that covered pretty well she absolutely should be around to comfort your parents ,5,relationships
RubyWooToo,go get your kids vaccinated anyway ,9,relationships
RubyWooToo,unfortunately there are some men who would agree to this arrangement controlling and abusive men who do not want their wives having even a whiff of independence like leaving the house to go to work where they might be noticed by other men or having their own spending money these are precisely the type of men you should never surrender to ,2,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,exactly it not like housework 100 years ago which involved a lot of manual labor like washing clothes by hand making and canning preserves sewing and mending etc modern housework without babies and toddlers including cooking meals can easily be accomplished in 3 hours depending on how old op not only did the men she dating have mothers who worked outside the home their grandmothers probably worked outside the home as well as ideal as it would be to be able to know upfront whether a guy you are dating is willing to let you be a housewife before getting serious the fact of the matter is that no man in his right mind would be willing to do so to a woman who has not yet proven her value to him in that capacity and that only happens after some time ,6,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,it is different because being an architect living in virginia and planting a garden do not necessitate another person taking full responsibility for subsidizing your existence and possibly being on the hook for spousal support if you ever divorced i think it fine to talk about what your ideal situation would be i would not want to put my children in daycare i would like to care for them myself and i would like to care for my home so you do not have to have to worry about chores when you get home for work then to say i do not want to be in the work force i prefer to be a housewife like i said it her approach not her desire that wrong lastly there are a scant few men nowadays outside of old school religious and cultural communities who will agree to having their wife be unemployed if they do not yet have children even if she meets a guy who is happy to let her stay home and take care of the kids she should at least be willing to work up until the point kids enter the picture ,8,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,it does take time to get to know someone properly and understand their values so no that not incorrect here is the reality no high value men even ones with very traditional ideas about gender roles sign up to be a sole provider and all the risks and responsibilities that entails right out of the gate if they are smart they also prefer the security of having wives who are willing and able to work in event that they were laid off died or were incapacitated it might not be efficient and it might not seem fair but telling a guy i want to be a housewife on a first date automatically sounds like i need a meal ticket op does not say how old she is what she does for a living but if she a young woman who does not have much experience in the workforce she should establish herself as someone who is self sufficient and does not need to rely on a man to be her meal ticket the role of a housewife is a job that she has to earn just like any other career ,7,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,how would he have reacted if someone outbid you on the house or offered to put more money down than you could what if the house failed inspection ,3,relationships
RubyWooToo,this seems like one of those situations where couples try to have a baby in order to save their struggling marriages only in your case it a house if your marriage survives this crisis you will be better for it and there will be other homes at some point in the future if your marriage collapses as you think it will it would have been 100x worse if you were crippled by debt and locked in a mortgage ,2,relationships
RubyWooToo,your desire to be a housewife is not something you advertise to potential mates on a dating web site or upon first meeting in my opinion this is a discussion you have with a man when you have already reached the point that you are discussing a shared future and hopefully after coming to the conclusion that you have shared ideas for how marriage and parenthood are supposed to work think about it would you expect a company to give you a promotion if you have not even been interviewed or hired yet why would a man agree to you being a housewife upfront if he does not know you and you just started dating especially considering the risks he faces if you were to ever divorce if you are not part of a religious or cultural community where being a housewife would be expected of you if you lead with the fact that you want to be a housewife you are going to come off to a lot of guys like you are looking for a meal ticket or worse you will attract men who are looking for someone to puppet by the purse strings ,43,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,choking is one of the main precursors to men actually killing their partners if you do not believe me google it you need to get out of this relationship ,8,relationships
RubyWooToo, i do not want to be my best friend who lived with her fiance for five years engaged for one with no wedding date in mind at that point you are not engaged you have a shut the fuck up ring and funny how so many men who moved in with their girlfriends to get to truly know each other are the most confused about whether they want to get married how does that happen s,5,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,i chose to wait until i was engaged and our wedding date set to move in with my husband i was not going to give up my apartment and essentially take on the role of a wife unless i was sure i was going to become his wife also the idea of moving in with a guy breaking up and then moving in with someone else eventually just never sat right with me my family was a factor too i admit they did not like the idea of cohabitation before marriage at all but since we were engaged they felt better about the idea lastly i simply knew too many women who moved in with their boyfriends and after a few years of cohabitation they pressed for marriage and got the but marriage is just a piece of paper and everything is just fine as it is why do you want to change it argument he asked me to move in with him about 6 months into dating and i told him that i would not move in with him unless we were engaged he proposed on our year anniversary who knows if he would have proposed anyway at a year if i moved in but i suspect that my decision was a powerful incentive ,3,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,believe nothing of what you hear and only half of what you see ,1,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,she english not american by the way she also not beautiful she just easy ,39,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,have you actually met him in person have you spent an extended period of time with him most guys do not send prospective girlfriend copies of their paychecks or direct deposits so if he really treats gambling like a job why does he send you screen shots of his winnings does he tell you how much he loses too why cannot he leave the house people who work in the stock market which is essentially professional gambling still manage to have active social lives stay on top of the news and make money in their sleep ,1,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,it not a 40 hour a week job taking care of a toddler and managing a home if you are doing it diligently is way more than that because you cannot shut the toddler off like a computer turn off your phone and leave it at the office until the next day it the reason why many women who could afford to stay at home prefer to go back to the office instead ,14,relationships
RubyWooToo,your ex girlfriend is like the leftover food people bring to work or leave out in the office sure it gets devoured in about 2 seconds flat but that because people will eat pretty much anything if it offered for free ,6,survivinginfidelity
RubyWooToo,and i did not suggest he should not do that in fact getting out of the house and having fun would be good for both of them the point is that he treating his wife like she staff and she not she expresses her appreciation for his contributions to the family while he clearly does not recognize or appreciate hers ,23,relationships
RubyWooToo,not when he refers to his child as your daughter also there more to being a provider than making money just as there is more to be a care giver than keeping the house clean ,10,relationships
RubyWooToo,this was my thought as well if the husband talks to his employees like he talks to his wife and probably worse then he a bad manager being an asshole wo not make employees respect him it just makes them do the bare minimum to not get fired and not get yelled at one of my grandpa favorite sayings was the fish stinks from the head if his employees are uniformly under performing then its because he and his partner are ineffective at managing people the good cop bad cop routine just is not working and they are both in need of leadership courses ,140,relationships
RubyWooToo,if you do not want to be treated like an employee do not act like one a few times a week let him take care of your daughter and make meals for himself when he gets home from work while you go to gym or meet up with drinks for friends this is not punishment this is for him to realize that he part of a family and the daughter is his to parent as well not yours when he starts to lecture you or make snide comments then you calmly tell him right away that you are not going to listen to him and you walk away if he really committed to treating you more lovingly and with respect have a talk when you are not fighting about using some non verbal signal when he starting to get out of hand i know it sounds silly but my husband and i bought a celtic wedding bell google it that we ring whenever one of us goes off the deep end in argument usually me admittedly it definitely helped in terms of putting a pause in the discussion and forcing us to be thoughtful about our next word ,49,relationships
RubyWooToo,sure dogs like people can have issues even if they have a perfect upbringing but considering the context of the post i get why u brightnew1 thinks this dog was poorly socialized by the owner if op boyfriend has attachment issues regarding the dog coddles the dog as if it were an infant and projects his own anxieties on the dog then it makes sense the dog is maladjusted ,2,relationships
RubyWooToo, cause i dont see the obsessive attachment unless it involves activities with me there you go for things that are of value to him the dog is not an issue as for his reaction to you mentioning breaking up sure he gets sad no one likes to be rejected or be blamed for a relationship ending but that should not be interpreted as love for you or willingness to make the relationship work ,4,relationships
RubyWooToo,either he has an obsessive attachment to his dog or he using his dog to cock block for lack of a better term your relationship he does not want to commit to you he does not want to spend that much time with you but it easier to blame the dog than take responsibility for his own feelings ,28,relationships
RubyWooToo,it will be easier to work on your thesis when you are not dealing with this bullshit ,9,relationships
RubyWooToo,believe it or not your presence in this relationship is what makes george and jackie possible you are the hypotenuse of their triangle if you leave they fall apart you want things with jackie to end dump george without you as a source of stability and comfort for him and without you to play the villain to george hero their relationship will implode jackie will try to devour him and he will probably run screaming from her but you wo not take him back why because if you have 2 brain cells to rub together you will realize how easy life is when you are not living in a soap opera ,2,relationships
RubyWooToo,people with white knight superhero complexes do not actually care about people they are often narcissists he gets his ego inflated by the fact that he is the center of jackie world and the idea that he is the only thing standing between her and knife edge or the ledge of a building people who genuinely care about other people and want to make their lives better do not mistreat their nearest and dearest and do not use people with mental illness as an outlet for sex and as an endless supply of emotional validation ,1,relationships
RubyWooToo,but that the thing about lying how are you sure it a one time thing what about all those times you did not catch him ,2,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,lying is unacceptable if i cannot trust my husband i wo not submit myself to him ,6,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,in the short term it would probably work google hysterical bonding but in the longer term it would eventually backfire if it reaches the point where she never feels like she good enough or gets emotionally exhausted by the competition she will eventually check out of the relationship and you will be worse off then when you started ,2,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,is it just me or are other people kind of annoyed by these braggart posts by men coming here to talk about how well they game their wives is not that was married red pill is for or are we just being lectured now ,6,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,if mark finds out about the cheating and that you knew but did not tell him then he will feel triple betrayed tell mark right away do not give andrew and adriana the opportunity to cover it up or discredit you by giving them a heads up ,7,relationships
RubyWooToo,lots of children love things that are not necessarily healthy for them at least in large doses if he screaming or vocalizing non stop then he being overstimulated as others have suggested there might be a way to work him up to being at the ball game through other activities or perhaps taking him for one or two innings to start and then eventually seeing if sitting through the whole game is possible ,1,relationships
RubyWooToo,intimacy and secrecy cannot exist in the same place if your relationship with your om was really as intense as you describe your husband probably can sense that you checked out of your marriage and he does not know why even though it over you are going to remain checked out for who knows how long while you grieve the loss of the om and potentially relapse too and do not say you wo not relapse because i am sure that 2 years ago you did not think you would have ever cheated on your husband plus it not like you and this man were not on again and off again before you have been hung up on this man for a decade if you cannot tell your husband the truth if you are not willing to relinquish control of the outcome and be vulnerable to him then you never have a full relationship again also you need to be honest with yourself you are not worried about hurting your spouses nearly as much as you are worried about consequences for yourself your om does not care about your husband and you do not care about his wife all the matters at the moment is covering your own ass and protecting om how can you do that and do right by your husband you cannot lastly why do you think that you are entitled to forgive yourself when your husband has not been given the opportunity to forgive you ,7,survivinginfidelity
RubyWooToo,just because he begging to go does not necessarily mean it a good environment for him though especially if one day you happen to encounter the wrong type of person who decides to fight with your friend instead of making rude comments and leaving ,2,relationships
RubyWooToo,what kind of friend is this that you have to be afraid of telling her you want to wear your own damn clothes ,2,relationships
RubyWooToo,the mother is in the wrong here not because her son is hampering other people enjoyment of the game but because she continually exposes her son to an environment that causes him to freak out the mother should find other activities to share with her son that are less stimulating and less likely to cause him anxiety ,2,relationships
RubyWooToo,it not going to be good for your friendship either if you suck it up and go to the ball games with her son and get continually pissed off or embarrassed eventually you will either explode or stop hanging out with her entirely i think your choices are to not to go the ball games at all say you do not feel like it this year or tell her straight up that her son screaming interferes with your enjoyment of the game and you cannot handle it anymore if it helps you can point out that her son does not seem to be enjoying himself either ,0,relationships
RubyWooToo,unlike many red pillers i do not see the arbitrary wall when the clock strikes midnight and cinderella turns into a pumpkin i think the wall is more psychological then anything else it the anxiety that sets in when dating around becomes exhausting instead of fun and when the excitement of being with someone new is not nearly as appealing as the idea of building a life with a partner it not that women have few options when they reach this point it that they often end up making poor or lackluster choices out of fear ,3,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,tell your parents you do not want to share the room with a ghost either but for real i think it would actually help to call a priest or do a banishing ritual in the home even if you and your parents think this is totally bogus if you engage your brother in his belief and work with him to purge the evil presence from his room the psychological effect on him could be positive and comforting ,4,relationships
RubyWooToo,who cares whether she thinks she cheating she in love with another guy the relationship is now over ,1,relationships
RubyWooToo,ah i see well she an idiot then ,2,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,50 image management 50 custody adultery is perfectly legitimate grounds for divorce from a biblical perspective,1,adultery
RubyWooToo,in practice what does it matter that she motivated by morality and not respect respect is not even possible without a moral compass at the end of the day she not going to cheat on her husband i think an appropriate response to her comment would be if you need other people to cock block you because he that hot why bother seeing him at all that will give her something to think about ,1,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,if your current tits would impede your ability to even have kids in the first place then a boob job is a sensible decision ,3,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,lies are like cockroaches for everyone you see there are a thousand more you have not yet if you cannot trust your captain to be truthful then staying with him is like blindfolding yourself while he sails you off a cliff ,3,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,those also sound like his reasons for why he wo not walk ,1,adultery
RubyWooToo, from then to last week our relationship had been alright but there were a few lies on his end lies are like cockroaches for everyone you can see there around 1000 you do not ,2,survivinginfidelity
RubyWooToo,they are only 21 this type of behavior is very common among such young newlyweds they are not that far removed from a time when they had to ask their parents for everything and still want the approval of family and friends op there are many topics that you need to stay in the marriage only and fertility is probably the most important one it not a community decision it deeply personal it also the one that the most likely to invoke strong emotions and opinions about the best course of action you and your future husband will drive yourselves crazy if you involve your families and that not going to be good for your marriage or your future children ,98,relationships
RubyWooToo,how can you be so certain this affair was brief when he clearly cared enough about this woman to start a family with her and support her as basically a second wife have you considered the possibility that the distance that occurred after the miscarriage was because he was already tuned out and investing his emotions elsewhere how could you possibly think of staying with someone who not only betrayed your trust emotionally and sexually but also financially why do you think him cruelly manipulating you was somehow less painful than telling you the truth you need to get a shark of a lawyer along with a forensic accountant you need to see if there are any debts you are not aware of and that you may be liable for you need to know how much of your marital money he pilfered for his affair because you could potentially recoup at least some of that money in a divorce you also need to get tested for stds as someone who has gone through the pain of miscarriages i know how heartbreaking that experience is and how trying it can be on a marriage but many men endure and are supportive of their wives without cheating on them if you are still young and if you get out of this marriage you can find someone who is worthy of starting a family with the measure of a person character is not how they behave when everything is good but how they act when times are tough last but not least if you live in a state that recognizes fault divorce for adultery do not have sex with him again as this can be construed as forgiveness reconciliation resist any urge you might be feeling for hysterical bonding ,3,relationships
RubyWooToo,do not go after the ow at work at least while your parents are still married if ow was dad subordinate he could get fired and that could potentially screw over your mom in an eventual divorce settlement wait until the ink is dry on the papers before blowing up their world do not accept any calls from your dad and avoid any contact with him if he going to make you feel awful and ridicule you then there no purpose and having any communication with him as u okapifan said make sure your mom has a shark lawyer and a therapist who specializes in infidelity also get a credit report on your mom and your dad if possible and take inventory of the accounts in case there any financial shenanigans going on if your mom is destroyed you need to be the one to keep a clear head ,9,survivinginfidelity
RubyWooToo,how does your wife feel about it is your apostasy a deal breaker for her is she willing to work on improving the marriage with you and finding common ground with you in other ways is that something you are willing to try as well ,2,relationships
RubyWooToo,if they have known each other for years do they have any mutual friends or does your husband know anyone who is close to her that you can talk to and might be able to influence her to stop i realize this advice has the potential to exacerbate the situation but maybe a good dose of embarrassment plus a come to jesus talk might help if you are unable to just ignore her and you have already exhausted your legal options ,1,survivinginfidelity
RubyWooToo,this definitely calls for the advice of a lawyer to deal with the legal aspects of your situation and a therapist to deal with the emotional aspects of the situation the lawyer will be able to tell you what impact if any her adultery would have on a divorce and what you could expect in terms of child custody etc also if she was beaten so severely will she be able to work will she fully recovery or need long term care these are things that could potentially impact your settlement the above are also questions you will need to discuss with a therapist will you have it in you to care for and support physically emotionally and financially the woman who so deeply betrayed you regardless of how you choose to proceed in terms of your marriage it important not to lose sight of what is best for your sons even though her cheating and choice of an affair partner nearly robbed them of a mother and is the cause of so much grief take them to visit her force yourself to put on a brave face if only because they are probably too young to understand the situation and might be confused about why daddy does not like mommy after she got hurt ,6,relationships
RubyWooToo,they are using company equipment to have an affair their relationship is causing a hostile work environment and their relationship itself is a severe liability for the company also on the last point it actually important for you to get divorced before their relationship implodes completely destroys his career and drowns you in legal problems their affair is a ticking time bomb ,2,survivinginfidelity
RubyWooToo,that could backfire if nick sticks to his story or is so crazy that he believes its happening ,14,relationships
RubyWooToo, next time my sister wants to talk to me tell her to contact me directly i do not want to talk to you about her anymore ,17,relationships
RubyWooToo,if you put as much time into it you would spend crying and feeling bad about an asshat i imagine it possible ,2,relationships
RubyWooToo,i think it would be a great idea not to be the person she vents to anymore you can start by changing the subject or expressing disinterest non verbally any time she starts to bitch about her boyfriend or just tell her straight up that after she got pissed at you the last time you are not interested in listening if she not interested in your opinion or advice contrary to what u zazool advised whose comment is otherwise spot on i do not think you should apologize to her because you did absolutely nothing wrong she will realize that eventually when she finds herself in financial quagmire with a guy who makes her miserable ,16,relationships
RubyWooToo,please do not put your life on hold for a year you will never heal and even if he does want the relationship again how can you cope with being his back up plan think of all the things you can do in a year make friends become fluent in a language write a novel travel the world become advanced at pretty much any hobby move to another city and become settled down etc etc stay no contact with him and commit to the relationship being over it not going to completely end the pain at least right away but you will win back some self respect and begin to see the way forward ,161,relationships
RubyWooToo, she always doubted my commitment being married with 4 kids is not enough apparently just last night i went to the office to do some after hours project work and she was hounding me about who was there and if any females were present she very insecure there a word for that projection people always assume that everyone thinks like them she not fully committed to you and is always seeking out attention from other men so she thinks your the same way ,29,relationships
RubyWooToo,if cheating and lack of sex are unacceptable to you then you need to leave the marriage i am sure your current physical and mental health problems are being exacerbated by her infidelity and lack of romantic interest in you if you are not willing to leave the marriage for whatever reason then do not go near any of her devices all you are doing is causing yourself pain for which you are not willing to take any permanent action to alleviate so why bother fishing for it also for every time you catch her cheating and take her back she loses more respect for you and you lose more respect for yourself ,2,relationships
RubyWooToo,if the guy has her name knows where she lives and knows where to appear then her identity is already compromised not going to the police does not prevent her family from finding out it just makes it easier for the guy to continue to escalate his behavior but the police are only a second step the first step is to stop avoiding the guy and tell him outright that she does not want to be contacted by him anymore ,2,relationships
RubyWooToo,ooh i will have to watch those ,1,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,first of all i think it grossly irresponsible that you and your husband let a woman you do not know all that well live in your home bathe your son and scream at him if the genders were reversed your husband sister brought one of her revolving door boyfriends to live with you my guess is that you would have had far more reservations with the situation than you do now second these are the situations that are ripe for affairs starting up you barely see each other because your shifts are conflicting you have a willing and available woman and your husband has absolutely no boundaries advice talk to your bil and get his thoughts on this arrangement is he totally cool with how his gf acts toward his brother and all the time they spend together if he troubled by it too maybe you can tack the situation together also can you afford childcare i know it not ideal but it really does seem like your marriage is suffering both from the stress of parenting and the fact that you have little quality time together ,3,relationships

RubyWooToo,if my husband was as clingy and demanding as yours is i might become penis averse too ,13,relationships
RubyWooToo,if he planning on getting divorced he does not want his wife to be unemployed and risk owing her spousal support after the ink is dry then he can set the world on fire ,2,survivinginfidelity
RubyWooToo,he does not make mistakes because he drinks he drinks so he has an excuse to do things he wants to do anyway you already dealt with habitual cheating from your ex you need to figure out what attracts you to these type of men and why you are even considering putting up with this shit yet again ,1,relationships
RubyWooToo,i do not think your husband has given you much choice except divorce what if his next impulsive decision or temper tantrum causes you direct physical financial or legal harm there are times that are more challenging than others and people may often act out of character under particularly stressful circumstances but your husband behavior is so bizarre erratic and volatile that you are putting yourself at great risk by staying with him call that lawyer ,4,relationships
RubyWooToo,how does avoiding the discussion fix the underlying problem why do you think it less traumatic for her to be dumped without reason then being given a choice ,2,relationships
RubyWooToo,suzy also needs this information so she can do some much needed circumspection and figure out what repeatedly draws her to abusive men ,2,relationships
RubyWooToo,if you think that lying by omission is acceptable and that you have the right to withhold critical information about your past because she might leave you then you are still thinking like an abuser even though you are no longer physically violent a major part of becoming a safe partner is being able to accept the fact that loving someone does not mean owning them and that you cannot control how your partner thinks feels or reacts hiding your past because you are afraid she will leave you is a covert way of exerting control over her my advice tell her the truth and do not make excuses for the past apologize for hiding this information for so long tell her what you have done to change and what you have learned from your experience make all the information on your past such as police reports etc readily available to her do not make her have to hunt down the information and most importantly of all if she wants to break up with you let her go no begging pleading bargaining or raging if you truly love this woman as you say you do then the best way to express that is by respecting her desire to make a decision that she feels is healthiest and safest for her even if it breaks your heart ,1122,relationships
RubyWooToo,he does not help people because he cares about their well being he helps people because it it makes him feel good about himself that why he can simultaneously be a hero to some and a villain to those closest to him ,6,survivinginfidelity
RubyWooToo,there nothing to figure out your boyfriend does not like or respect you anymore the relationship as it now stands is toxic and untenable do not wait for him to dump you take the initiative and end the relationship yourself ,1,relationships
RubyWooToo,you are not married and you do not have children so you are not a sahw or sahm you are a woman who is unemployed get a job and get your bills paid if he gets pissed about it and ends your relationship then so be it it would be a bad decision to further legally and financially entrench yourself further to a captain who is this out of touch with reality but if you do decide to stay home then keep in mind that only boring people are ever bored if you cannot think of anything interesting or productive you can do with at least 16 hours per day of free time then you are severely lacking imagination ,20,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,thanks for the clarification even so my concern still stands you say that her ex is still carrying a flame for her by tip toeing around his feelings at the expense of your relationship and not going after what her son is owed it seems like she on some level is keeping that flame alive i know that you resolved to let her family confront her over this but i think that you are being too conflict adverse you should still address the impact that this is having on your future together ,1,relationships
RubyWooToo,you are right that why op girlfriend needs to actually get divorced and get a court ordered custody agreement in place ,3,relationships
RubyWooToo,is your girlfriend actually divorced or is she only separated for 3 years why has not she gotten divorced if money is not a issue if she refusing to pursue child support or take him to task over visitation and she does not seem to really care about the impact on your relationship is it possible that she holding out hope for reconciling with her ex in the future ,10,relationships
RubyWooToo,not visiting a child is not breaking the law but in most places not paying child support is you can get your wages garnished and your license suspended if the amount exceeds 10k or is overdue for 2 years it considered felony of course all of this is contingent on an agreement being in place and the custodial parent pursuing what the child is owed ,19,relationships
RubyWooToo,i think his reaction was over the top but instead of lying to him the first time he expressed his dislike of breast implants you should have been honest for all you know he would have been embarrassed and reevaluated his opinion but if he blew a gasket like you feared you could have broken up then and there instead of wasting each other time as for how to handle it now you are unfortunately at an impasse he feels like his trust was broken and you feel like you were unfairly shamed over a lie that was not that big of a deal to you only you can decide if you can get over it ,85,relationships
RubyWooToo,it pretty obvious you are more into 2 but just think 1 is a safer bet there no way to eliminate risk from dating so go with guy 2 ,3,relationships
RubyWooToo,how do you know that mackenzie is not being used yet again as a means for carrie to get access to you and your life the fact that she following all of your business accounts is very telling it sucks that mackenzie life is a mess and that you still care for her but that does not change the fact that she still your worst enemy underage daughter you cannot let mackenzie in without letting carrie back in ,19,relationships
RubyWooToo,if you wanted to stay friends with her then no you should not have told his girlfriend and you should have minded your own business however i see no reason why you would want to be friends or room mates with someone who is so fundamentally screwed up in the head and untrustworthy people are rarely dishonest in only one aspect of their lives therefore doing the right thing by the betrayed girlfriend and losing this person is really no great loss if she gets on your case here is the proper response i did not fuck up your life you did that when you screwed your co worker do not make choices for which you cannot handle the consequences ,6,relationships
RubyWooToo,this is not a question of wrong or right it a question of whether her values and ethics are well aligned with yours only you can answer that question ,2,relationships
RubyWooToo,i was going to mention laziness but did not want to assume one of the problems with sexwork is that it becomes such easy money that the daily grind of non sex work does not seem worth it in comparison also if she relies on her good looks and sex for promotions then she might not have developed the skills necessary to continue to advance or excel in those positions ,6,relationships
RubyWooToo, when she was single i know she used to use her sexuality to get what she wanted from men in her life like using her managers at work for good shifts to me this is in some ways more concerning than the sugar baby stuff does your girlfriend have any skills beyond sex and her good looks to get ahead in life ,12,relationships
RubyWooToo,sure we are all sharing our opinions here that goes without saying i personally do not think that the op has anything to apologize for he said what needed to be said for a long time and should leave it at that but if op cannot sleep at night because of what he said to his aunt he should leave it at i am sorry i hurt your feelings with what i said it sincere because it what he actually sorry for and it does not invite further argument i have never seen a conditional apology resolve anything in fact these type of apologies just piss people off more because they come off as insincere and are really just opportunities to tell someone off a second time that the exact opposite of what op wants ,2,relationships
RubyWooToo,i agree but if he going to apologize either to assuage his own conscience or keep peace in the family he better off leaving it to exactly what he sorry about ,3,relationships
RubyWooToo,any apology that includes the words that being said having said that but or however is absolutely meaningless he better off saying nothing at all ,2,relationships
RubyWooToo,you should not apologize to your aunt your aunt needs to apologize to society for setting loose this monster on the world ,2,relationships
RubyWooToo,kayla is doing to you what she does to her boyfriends which is using you as a constant source of validation she sounds like an emotional vampire i think if you are honest with yourself you will recognize that you probably feel extremely drained after your interactions with her and that your friendship is becoming a one way street it time for you to set some boundaries with your friend be honest with how she makes you feel and shut down conversations when they become to exasperating for you ,1,relationships
RubyWooToo,when some time has passed and you have been able to heal you can can throw him the rager he would have wanted in honor of his memory but until then no sane person is going to hold it against you if you do not want to throw a big party especially his friends and family members who are grieving his loss as well it one thing to talk hypothetically throwing a party when death seems like it half a century into the future it quite another to do it in practice when you are mourning if your friends are good people judging you is going to be the last thing on their minds they are going to want to show you love and support that what funerals ultimately are about not just showing respect for the deceased but providing comfort to those left behind ,1,relationships
RubyWooToo,by giving him more chances you give up on yourself ,1,relationships
RubyWooToo,your only friend in the area why is that ,5,relationships
RubyWooToo,this is not about you ,6,relationships
RubyWooToo,what is she doing to win back your trust and show she invested in the marriage what incentive does she have to not have an affair when you are essentially rewarding her for cheating ,20,survivinginfidelity
RubyWooToo,who the hell does he think he is michael corleone you are his wife you absolutely should know what the hell he does for a living it honestly sounds like he either cheating on you or doing something illegal why are you being so passive as a married couple you are a legal and financial entity for all you know you are on the hook for thousands of dollars in debt that you do not know exists many couples keep finances separate but when planning for a shared future they at least have a general idea of how much money is coming out and coming in and have an agreed upon amount allocated for savings and bills my advice is that you run a full credit check on yourself and him to find out if there any credit cards or debts you do not know exist also you should hire a pi and find out where he going and what he doing ,13,relationships
RubyWooToo,gently it seems like you want to rugsweep your husband cheating and your upset that your friends refuse to pretend that everything is fine as much as you hate this shit sandwich you are essentially trying to shove that same shit sandwich down their throats by forcing them to interact with someone they dislike do not trust and who caused incredible pain to someone they love it possible for them to still love and support you without having to be friends with your husband if you can accept that then you will be able to repair your friendships if you cannot then you have to respect their decision to distance themselves and prevent any further confrontations or new hurts ,3,survivinginfidelity
RubyWooToo,it sounds to me like you were on two different pages regarding the status of your relationship you thought the relationship was getting serious she thought it was still casual instead of being honest about your feelings you doused them with alcohol and then set them on fire i think the best approach is to simply ask her what she wants if she does not want a relationship then you back off and cut contact so you can get over her ,3,relationships
RubyWooToo,you successfully browbeat your husband into the type of man you neither like or respect this is the predictable outcome of emotional abuse since getting your way is what caused the problem how about you stop telling him what to do and leave him alone even if whatever he doing or not doing is annoying you maybe he will eventually feel comfortable enough to be a human being again ,6,relationships
RubyWooToo,and yet there still people on that thread calling him passive aggressive and immature why am i even surprised ,6,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,that exactly what i was thinking the husband and ron like having op so they do not have to put up with tammy when they are just trying to hang out ,304,relationships
RubyWooToo,sometimes you get more across in a single line or gesture than a long winded discussion she already tried the latter ,4,relationships
RubyWooToo,how so he will be delighted to treat her ,8,relationships
RubyWooToo,i would just slide the bill across the table to him and say thank you honey ,17,relationships
RubyWooToo,destination weddings used to be for couples who wanted to have small and intimate weddings the expectation was that few people would be able to attend and costs were kept minimal for those who could nowadays it essentially a ploy to push the costs of a wedding from the couple on to the guests depending on the number of people who show the resorts will comp their room and heavily discount other services like catering photography hair and makeup etc it such a racket ,3,relationships
RubyWooToo,you are already at the bottom rung of your profession and cannot hold down a job for long than a few months how much more terrible could it possibly be to try out something new ,57,relationships
RubyWooToo,this is not really the kind of question that works on an anonymous forum unfortunately we do not know you we do not see you interact with anyone so it impossible to give you advice that more constructive than what you are getting from a professional you confide in on a regular basis ,60,relationships
RubyWooToo,it possible to still be there for her and supportive of her without being in a relationship with her she abusing drugs again and she invited her ex back into her life she not a safe partner for you and she not emotionally available for a relationship ,3,relationships
RubyWooToo,another thing is that she did not cut off harry because of the damage it was doing to her relationship or how much pain it was causing mike it because she was not getting anything out of it anymore ,13,relationships
RubyWooToo,all relationship decisions are made when emotions are involved hopefully he will learn from this experience in the future ,6,relationships
RubyWooToo,he working in another city for 6 months so it not like he even around much for her go out on dates with and other stuff and quit her job she going to need her job if it turns out he cheating and she needs to support herself ,4,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,i agree with u vigilantredrooster he not encouraging you to improve yourself he come up with a laundry list of excuses to justify cheating on you how often do you see each other how far away is the other city if i were you i would plan a surprise visit to see him if you can manage it ,4,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,i completely agree that how she handled harry especially in the beginning was wrong she clearly was not over her ex she was stoking the fires by talking to him and she never should have started up with mike in the first place but mike not a hapless victim either he stuck around in the relationship even as his self esteem was getting battered instead of dumping op within the first few months of dating he invested years and even proposed marriage if there a lesson to be learned from this situation it that in order to save a relationship you sometimes need to be willing to end it if mike had said let break up and you can call me when you are over harry i think he would have had a lot more respect for himself and consequently op might have seen him as a prize she needed to earn not as a plan b ,25,relationships
RubyWooToo,my godmother told me this and it true a relationship without passion is like soup without salt no matter how good the other ingredients are it going to be bland and unsatisfying also learn from you past mistake and get a clean break from mike you did not do that with harry and it severely damaged the foundation of your new relationship with mike ,4,relationships
RubyWooToo,ignore him block him and have your lawyer send your ex an official letter to not contact you your ex is a chump and he knows it he threw away his wife and his respectable life for a piece of ass who does not want him anymore he pissed that you are not waiting around for him desperate to be his plan b fuck him once you are not in contact with dipshit anymore he wo not be able to upset you or your boyfriend ,9,relationships
RubyWooToo,so now you are working 24 7 then i was not referring to a work phone i was referring to prepaid burner phones ,1,survivinginfidelity
RubyWooToo,what about her office also playing the role of an nsa agent for the foreseeable future is going to take a toll on you in the long term ,1,survivinginfidelity
RubyWooToo,what about burner phones and other devices you might not know about i think it too soon for marriage counseling she needs to be individual counseling first ,1,survivinginfidelity
RubyWooToo,your sister is an adult you live several states away you do not have to socialize with beth you no longer have a digital connection with beth and you do not rely on your parents for babysitting therefore i think you need to let this go while i completely share your disgust with beth and view enablers as almost as bad as abusers themselves try to look at it from your family perspective if they are religious and if beth has done a lot of good for your family as they have struggled to cope with your sister disability they probably view cutting ties with beth as abandoning her during her time of need ,105,relationships
RubyWooToo,i read your updates whether your wife has fucked 2 or 200 guys is really besides the point now you know she lying and that she will continue to lie even if you have access to her phone and other accounts she will find ways to get around you your best bet is to file for the divorce it will either be the wake up call she needs to put dedicate herself 150 or you can start moving on sooner rather than later either way you will be out of infidelity ,1,survivinginfidelity
RubyWooToo, she already told me she would leave if i want her to but she not going to be watched your response to that should be you are absolutely right hon you should not have to spied on and i should not have to get a second job as a private detective i am filing for divorce then again if you want to drive yourself crazy for the next several years playing cat and mouse games with her that entirely your prerogative ,1,survivinginfidelity
RubyWooToo,i think you should set up fixed times for example from 2 to 4 pm on monday and wednesday when he can come over and hang out that way you can properly set boundaries without outright rejecting him if he tries to come over outside of those times then your wife is going to have to grow a spine and say no another thing to consider is that if he spending all his time with your wife then he not making friends his own age and hanging out with them perhaps you can encourage him to get involved in extracurricular activities and groups with peers ,7,relationships
RubyWooToo,it time for you to find a boyfriend someone who turns you on but is also a good romantic prospect i have a very high sex drive and mine was through the roof at your age so i completely sympathize with you unfortunately when i did indulge my desires at the expense of my better judgement i ended up hung up on guys that had nothing going for them outside the bedroom there absolutely nothing wrong with what you are thinking or feeling i think your shame over these desires is probably just adding gasoline to them ,7,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,did this conversation come up because you asked him to be captain if so that was the wrong approach to take because of course he going to balk and not want to disrupt the status quo if i told my husband i wanted him to be a captain he would have asked me if i was buying a boat the trick as detailed in the surrendered wife is to take steps to make him feel empowered and gradually take on more responsibilities ,3,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,i think you need to consider whether this action of his is really out of character because this does not sound like an impulsive act whatsoever ,4,relationships
RubyWooToo,why the heck did your husband choose that narrow scenic road to drive down if he was uncomfortable driving the truck on that road why did not you take your usual route home i am with u terwilligre that this sounds fishy as hell ,22,relationships
RubyWooToo, yes in this case it was an affair because he kissed her prior to us being separated and when we separated he said it was not to end our relationship this needs to be in the main body of your post ,14,relationships
RubyWooToo,you are taking a lot of heat here but i think demanding the records and moving out in the mean time is the right course of action but as others have said you have caught him lying about other stuff before if he lying to you about trivial things like his name and his age then you have no reason to expect he not lying about more important things and quite honestly his story sounds like bullshit he was not pulled over by a cop he was already pulled over with the girl when the cop discovered them ,1,relationships
RubyWooToo,living with someone is hell when you are married or dating the wrong person ,2,relationships
RubyWooToo,if you think these 2 complaints are separate than you have completely missed the point his fixation with karate the exclusion of everything else is symptomatic of his overall self obsession and lack of consideration for anyone except himself it just one of a million ways he makes you feel small and unimportant ,1,relationships
RubyWooToo,you have not found out yet whether you have an sti yet so just wait to hear back from the doctor but i will address this she undertook not to do it again and although she would not commit to any couple counselling would not even do any work in terms of reading working through some books together and started hutting down any serious discussions around it after the first few post affair months i did my best to work through it on my own and stuck with her basically what you did with your wife was sweep her affair under the rug she suffered no consequences for her affair and has done absolutely nothing to win back your trust other than tell you to get over it it possible for relationships to recover from infidelity but it requires a great deal of hard work on the part of the cheater none of which your wife has done ,8,relationships
RubyWooToo,i used to be friends with an alpha female and she always complained that only men who were attracted to her were these groveling weak willed and effeminate types if you tried to point out to her that strong assertive and quintessentially masculine men were more naturally attracted to soft quintessentially feminine women she would get really angry and say no i just have not found anyone strong enough for me yeah right ,2,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,does someone being there for you in the past give them a license to wipe their feet all over you for the rest of your life ,11,relationships
RubyWooToo,my question was how does he show you he sorry and how does he show you that he values the relationship not what else does he do his lord over his superiority over you have you considered the possibility that having a partner who is not loving and supportive is taking a toll on your self esteem and therefore your drive to succeed have you also considered the possibility that his instructions are wrong a person who tries to force feed someone chili does not sound like he should be giving you cooking advice ,27,relationships
RubyWooToo,it hard to tell online but are you being serious or sarcastic ,20,relationships
RubyWooToo,if op says she wants to wait for a committed relationship to have sex then you are right most men probably wo not ask about her n count but if op says she wants to wait until marriage to have sex men absolutely will ask her if she had sex before and if so with how many men ,1,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,how have his actions demonstrated that he sorry for hurting you and that he still values the relationship ,44,relationships
RubyWooToo,the impression that i got from you main post and this comment is that you want a man to rescue you from your past and take care of you and have fantasies about being the perfect suzy homemaker smart discerning and accomplished men will be able to tell very quickly if you have daddy issues come with a lot of baggage and cannot handle life responsibilities until you are in a position where you are successful in your own right and able to live independently you are not going to attract the kind of man you want if anything you are going to attract the worst kind of men men who portray themselves as providers and protectors but are really out for a weak woman they can abuse and control also as my aunt once told me a marriage without passion is like soup without salt it does not matter how great the other ingredients are it will taste bland and unsatisfying besides it really unfair to any guy that you settle down with that you chose him because he was the safe and practical choice while all the other men who came before him got to enjoy your lust and infatuation ,6,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo, he very charismatic and comes off flirty but that just how his personality is what this translates to is that he has poor personal boundaries and gives off the vibe that he available even though he married i have seen so many people male and female make this excuse about their spouse and it never been a good thing ,65,relationships
RubyWooToo, 500 taking her out to lunch and you cannot afford to do this and he completely neglecting you in the process between this and the constant texts and going out for drinks this does not sound a like a boss employee relationship or a casual friendship but a courtship him saying he doing it for you is so manipulative you have every right to be pissed off in fact i do not think you are angry enough ,17,relationships
RubyWooToo,my answer to that question when i was young and single was that i did not want to become overly emotionally attached to someone who was not sure if he wanted a relationship with me ,6,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,i think your expectations are unrealistic unless you are part of a very tight knit devoutly religious community and culture and are still a virgin your chances of finding a guy who would be willing to wait for marriage for sex and completely subsidize your existence are almost zero although rp generally has a transactional view toward sex your vagina is not a bargaining chip the purpose of holding out for a relationship before putting out is not to manipulate someone into committing to you it so you do not waste your time put yourself at risk for stds and pregnancy and get overly emotionally invested in a man with whom you have no future it also fair to the guy because if what he really wants is casual sex he can quickly move along to someone else your best course of action would be to get very thorough in your vetting process and wait to have sex once you are in a committed monogamous relationship despite what rp will have you believe few men are going to ask for your number the ones who do will be the ones who care and though you should answer honestly it ok if they do not stick around because you are probably not right for each other in the meantime make sure that you complete your education and have a job whether or not you ultimately want a career even very traditional men are not keen on marrying women who see them as a wallet and not a human being if you are fortunate enough to find a man who wants you to stay at home you will still need the ability to make your own money in the event that he leaves dies or becomes incapacitated ,9,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,your husband is shopping for your replacement right now the only reason he agreed to counseling in the past and while he will probably agree to do so again is because it will buy him time while he continues his search for a soft place to land ,25,relationships
RubyWooToo,no she never came back hope she ok ,2,adultery
RubyWooToo,the return it offers is that he going to get hours and hours of enjoyment out of it also if it a good enough computer that does not need to be upgraded often and wo not become obsolete in 2 years he will probably end up saving money in the end ,58,relationships
RubyWooToo,op said she hinted at wanting to spend that money on a vacation so no there are not any household necessities that are being skimped on because he wants this computer but even if it was something like we need a new washer and dryer then you discuss saving up for such a purchase together by both saving more and cutting down on fun money it still would not be fair to say i can spend my fun money on whatever i want but all of your money has to go to the house ,10,relationships
RubyWooToo,i always try to see a compromise where there is one but this is a case where you need to put your foot down buy your damn gaming computer make it clear that you prioritized this purchase you scrimped and saved for it you sacrificed other more immediate things you might have wanted because it was important to you if she throws a fit over it then make it clear that you feel angry and betrayed if she wants to take a vacation together tell her you are happy to plan for one in advance and save up for it together if she wants to save up her fun money for something that benefits her only then you will fully support that too if you cave in to her demand then from here on out this is what she will think what is mine is mine and what is yours is also mine ,239,relationships
RubyWooToo,first of all you did not bully monica your husband took a personal disagreement over the parenting of your child that was between you two and blew it up 100x by telling his mother about it he hurt his sister feelings by running his mouth not you if anything you are the one being bullied in this situation second the fact that they are being so defensive and disregarding your worries is troublesome it means that if anything bad happens on monica watch they will try to hide it from you if that possible or they will rally around her instead of looking out for your son safety and well being third and most importantly being able to play with children and get along with them does not mean she a good caregiver if you want to come to some kind of compromise with your husband tell him that you will reconsider allowing monica to babysit once he school age and can reliably communicate and call 911 on his own ,9,relationships
RubyWooToo,you have a right to your preferences in dating and sex the reasons for your preferences are irrelevant so do not even bother arguing with anyone about them unfortunately you have a choice between being unhappy with your choice of partner and having a close relationship with your family or having the partner you want but a distant at best relationship with your family you have to decide which choice you can actually live with i think your family ignorance and obnoxiousness is not helping their cause if anything them disparaging women of other races probably makes those women seem more interesting and attractive ,3,relationships
RubyWooToo,i think you are being absurd and your friends are making it worse ,3,relationships
RubyWooToo,11 times if someone could not get their shit together after the 2nd time i would plan for the trip without them ,4,relationships
RubyWooToo,you do not need to tell everyone in your family just the two people who need to know your dad who jason works for and your brother who is friends with jason i think this is worth a text message break up do not give jason the opportunity to grovel or beg for forgiveness especially if you think you might cave as for kayla do not ask for an explanation apologies etc just let her know that any contact you have ends when the history project gets completed do not let these fools try to convince you this was a one time thing because it was not everyone was sober and the act was so brazen that it very clear they were comfortable enough with another to take such a colossal risk ,1,relationships
RubyWooToo,it not your responsibility to protect kayla reputation if she did not want to get a bad rap she should not have fucked her best friend boyfriend and do not assume that people will less hard on jason for all you know kayla might try to claim that she was upset or drunk or taken advantage of or make a grand show of being oh so sorry and everyone will put the blame on him still if people want to gossip about it with you you can take the classy route and say you do not want to talk about it ,2,relationships
RubyWooToo,leave you already gave her an ultimatum when you demanded no contact why would she follow a second ultimatum when she knows that you will back down you do not need proof that she lying you already know she lying ,1,relationships
RubyWooToo,you have only caught the tip of the iceberg ,1,relationships
RubyWooToo,do not make dumb excuses to break up with her you are just going to confuse her and make her feel worse absolutely tell her about the cheating with her friend what if she does this with another guy in the future only this time a husband instead of a boyfriend how many other ways could she potentially stab your girlfriend in the back ,5,relationships
RubyWooToo,have you considered the possibility that maybe the reason why you had cold feet was not because of your parents but because you were having a gut feeling that this relationship was not good and your wife was not to be trusted do not you dare let her manipulate or bully you into accepting the blame anything that grounds for cheating is ground for divorce if she was miserable that option was available to her if she continues down that line of argument save yourself the aggravation and get divorced the minimum requirements for even considering to stay with her should be quitting her job she gets individual counseling she permanently cuts contact with the other man if she balks at any of the above proceed immediately to divorce as for winning back your trust that entirely up to her do not set foot in a marriage counselor office unless you have decided you want to try to reconcile also tell the other man wife and do not give your wife advanced warning the other man wife deserves to know she being betrayed lastly i agree with the others that your wife has definitely been sleeping with him and this has been going on for a while if she so comfortable hooking up in public ,7,relationships
RubyWooToo,even better not only did he have unprotected sex behind your back he did so with a woman who was also having unprotected sex with other people what a prize he is ,47,relationships
RubyWooToo,the onus should not be on you to do anything if he wants the relationship to survive then he should be the one doing all the legwork to win back your trust he should be the one carrying the emotional burden because he brought it on himself i know you are not happy to hear this and that there will be a chorus of people telling you to dump his ass but here a reason why we are right your relationship is less than 2 years old and you are already on and off this means there probably a whole lot of other problems in your relationship that you continually swept under the rug when you are simply not right for each other you were at the very least willing to discuss the possibility of opening up your relationship and yet he still went around behind your back and lied to you he has no excuse for that not only does his character sucks but he also an idiot an idiot who had unprotected sex with a 19 year old and did not think pregnancy was a possibility if the baby turns out to be his then as the mother of his child this girl will never be cut out of his life entirely he will have to provide financial support to his child and if he remotely decent he will want to at least be somewhat present to his child as well you gave up a lot to move in with him he threw that back in your face whoever they are that say infidelity can bring you closer together are idiots or are deluding themselves in order to cope with their decision to stay with cheating partners sure it possible for relationships to recover after infidelity but nobody who has been cheated on feels grateful for the experience ,17,relationships
RubyWooToo,first if i was a friend or a family member and heard that you were openly dating and sleeping with your brother fiancee a scant 14 weeks after his death i would wonder if you were hooking up or having an emotional affair behind his back before he died i know that a hurtful thing to say if it is not true but i am being honest if you have been crushing on her this whole time then you might not have been as discreet with your feelings as you thought you were especially since your friend called you out on it second the fact that you were walking around in the bliss of a new relationship with your dead brother fiancee while everyone else around you is heartbroken and trying to cope with his loss has to be deeply unsettling to all of your loved ones hence why your sisters do not want to be around you if enough time had passed before you got together everyone would probably still be weirded out but you probably would not be an object of disgust last only time will tell if your relationship is genuine or if you are just a band aid for each other grief the thing that concerns me is that because of how quickly you got together neither of you got to fully process your grief also there a six year age difference between you which is not a big deal after you hit 30 but can be problematic when you have one partner in their early 20s with some growing up to do and another partner in her 30s who might be worried about being able to settle down and have a family but i do not know you two so that part could just be speculation ,331,relationships
RubyWooToo,short answer this is something you and your partner should both discuss with your physician midwife when the time comes hopefully if you are ready to have a kid together you will be able to discuss and come to an agreement these sorts of issues long answer there very little data at this time on the safety of water birth ie immersion during labor because it occurs for the most part outside of medical settings this will probably change as water births become more widespread in general and in hospitals the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists acknowledges that immersion during the first stage of labor for healthy women with uncomplicated full term pregnancies could help mitigate pain without using drugs and shorten labor overall however there still the risk of infection and sepsis for the mother and cord rupture and secondary drowning for the infant ,4,relationships
RubyWooToo,no you are arguing semantics when people are in pain and were horribly victimized by a spouse disgusting choices and betrayal ,3,survivinginfidelity
RubyWooToo,this is not the place to play language police ,10,survivinginfidelity
RubyWooToo,i am definitely interested in learning more about who these friends are that are not allowed over if they are the types to eat you out of house and home kleptomaniacs or trash the place like motley crue in a hotel room she might have legitimate reasons for not wanting them there ,56,relationships
RubyWooToo,maybe i watch too much id channel but i really hope she not in a ditch somewhere ,3,adultery
RubyWooToo,you really think that 6 weeks of great sex 2 years ago is worth a lifetime of bullshit ,36,relationships
RubyWooToo,i was not arguing with your ability to financially provide for your child or provide a loving home i am saying that it is immoral unethical and in this day in age almost impossible to hide a child paternity from him or her and any man who would ask that of you is not deserving of that level of slavish devotion ,1,adultery
RubyWooToo,you know people say that as a platitude all the time and i am starting to disagree with it sometimes people deserve exactly what they get or alternatively they deserve exactly what they are willing to settle for ,4,adultery
RubyWooToo,can you even imagine what it like growing about without knowing who your parent is or having to keep who your parent is a secret you are basically transferring the burden of secrecy and shame from your boyfriend to your child i dated a guy who grew up never knowing his father and thinking that he and his mother were abandoned that was painful enough growing up when he found out as an adult that his mother had been his father mistress and that his father had been a very involved father to 5 other children one of whom was only a few months older he was re traumatized all over again his issues with trust and emotional intimacy are one of the reasons our relationship did not work out i also have a friend who knew who her dad was but could not tell anyone he would visit from time to time but she had to tell people he was an old family friend no kid should have to grow up feeling like a dirty secret no you really do not know everything about his history you know his blood type any recessive conditions in his family you have sat down for genetic testing together and again nowadays anyone can buy a kit online swab their cheek and find out about siblings they did not know existed lastly there no way in hell that your family is not going to lean on you and want to know who the father is maybe you can stand up to that pressure but again it going to require a lot of emotional detachment on your part how much of a gulf of secrecy already exists because you cannot even tell them you are in love if you want to martyr yourself for your boyfriend give up dreams of getting married and having a relationship that can exist in the sun that your choice but it completely immoral unethical and unrealistic to expect to another human being who has no choice in the matter to reside in the shadows with you and any man who would ask you to sacrifice your child happiness and well being in order to protect his reputation and maintain the illusion of a happy family with someone else is a despicable coward ,3,adultery
RubyWooToo,this is not the 16th century your plan b is completely unfair to your child and not realistic at all in the age of online dna testing ancestry if you have a kid he or she deserves to know who the dad is and any medical conditions in his family your child well being should be more important than protecting him from his shitty choices also such a choice to protect his identity would require you to completely alienate yourself from your family and cut you off from your support system ,2,adultery
RubyWooToo,do you want to have children at some point if so then you certainly do not want to give up this baby only to find that you are having trouble with fertility later in life if you were 21 this would not be such a concern but you are over 30 there is no way to have this kid without outing him though even if you do not take child support you owe your kid an explanation about who his or her dad is also in the era of online dna kits people find out about siblings they did not know existed all the time when you do break the news i advise you tell him in a public place or ask a friend to call within the hour i do not care how well you think you know him you do not know how someone will react when they learn they might lose everything ,12,adultery
RubyWooToo,i think you have every right to say no full stop do not pass go to giving one cent to your parents that really your relationship to manage and if you do not want to give them any money there should not be any argument there as for his parents unless they ask for his help then maybe consider doing something for them along the lines of getting help from a financial adviser or attorney or paying the deposit on an apartment without co signing a lease despite how shitty these people are i am getting the sense that the emotion that at the heart of the issue is your husband desire to be appreciated and praised by his family if they are the kind of people you say they are no amount of money is going to change them ,2,relationships
RubyWooToo,methinks the lady doth protest too much ,3,polyamory
RubyWooToo,considering the hostile way you have responded to criticism not just to me but others i do not think i am far off the mark at all if you cannot handle your ideas being challenged you should choose a different profession ,1,polyamory
RubyWooToo,since op did not mention any imminent plans to buy a house they could be years off from being able to do so hence why he made that comment ,2,relationships
RubyWooToo,i do not think it left you with more questions i think you finally got your answer he does not want to commit to marriage you do you now need to decide whether you want to sink more years into this relationship in the hopes he comes around or whether you want move on so you can find someone who on the same page ,2,relationships
RubyWooToo,another thing to consider is that it appears that op parents are divorced so that adding another layer of aggravation to this whole scenario it likely the parents are having their own quarrels about who is to blame for this happening and how they should handle the situation ,1,relationships
RubyWooToo,the measure of a person is not how they treat you when things are going good and you are getting along it how they behave and how they treat you when under stress and when conflict emerges he not loving or supportive if he cannot tolerate any contradiction and if his idea of resolving differences is for you to cave in to him and grovel for forgiveness furthermore a person who sets up manipulative tests that like this is not someone who fits the definition of honest either ,3,relationships
RubyWooToo,no problem i think it something that does not get discussed enough ,2,polyamory
RubyWooToo,to clarify there nothing wrong with exposing children to a variety of ideas and modes of thinking or challenging their existing ideas and beliefs a healthy and well rounded education should do that my issue with op is that her primary objective is to teach them about alternate relationship models and indoctrinate them into accepting her lifestyle i would feel the exact same way if she were pushing her religion her political ideology etc the role of a parent is also different from a teacher in many fundamental ways the primary one being that a parent is ultimately responsible for the child survival well being and making sure the child becomes a positive and productive member of a society a parent personal values naturally play a key role in that process ,5,polyamory
RubyWooToo,it uncommon for someone to propose without knowing with almost absolute certainty what the response will be typically the couple agreed that it what they both want in the near to immediate future by that point the proposal is simply a formality that not the case here op proposal would literally put her boyfriend on the spot i think it would be more effective for op to say i would like to be engaged before 29 like we previously discussed and i do not want to wait until we have bought a home if he agrees great we can all look forward to the update post when he proposes if he says no or waffles then op has her answer and can move on accordingly ,6,relationships
RubyWooToo,a teacher role is to teach the subject matter they specialize in how to think critically reason and articulate information encourage free thought and inquiry and create a safe learning environment that supports those objectives indoctrination is common in all levels of academia sure but that does not make it right ,5,polyamory
RubyWooToo,the problem with this approach is that if he does accept op will wonder if it out of duress also if she says i do not need a ring i will buy my own ring or i do not want a wedding i can just go to a courthouse when she actually does want those things might potentially lead to resentment ,16,relationships
RubyWooToo,if they started dating when they were 17 then yeah 4 years might not be enough since they still have some growing up to do but at their age 4 years is plenty of time ,50,relationships
RubyWooToo,i think that a great approach to take ,2,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,i think it inappropriate to use your position to imprint your personal values on your students edit i can afford to defend my rights employment etc due to my non monogamous beliefs polyamorous identification is not a protected status under america federal law considering that you are working in a high school setting not a university you are not even certified yet and you have already crossed professional lines with drunken texts to your mentor you are really in no position to stress test the system ,11,polyamory
RubyWooToo,do not give a long list of preferences that how you are getting sucked into this cycle if you have a preference for something then say it ie i want chinese food even if you might settle for a variety of other things if he comes back with a myriad of other options or starts waffling that when you shut it down with whatever you decide ,7,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,give him positive feedback and encouragement i trust you will make the right choice or alternately if he sounds likes he really leaning one way and just wants your approval then say i like your idea but if he asking you for stuff like what do you want for dinner i think stating a preference is perfectly appropriate you do not want to seem like you are unwilling to give an opinion about anything i think the key is to not get roped into making decisions about every little thing or assuming veto power over his choices ,12,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,by her own admission she fully consented to mike staying in her bed and cuddling with her even after he professed his feelings she also had enough control of her faculties to text op and ask for his heads up beforehand so she was perfectly capable of providing consent to any sexual acts that might have taken place ,3,relationships
RubyWooToo,it normal to be attracted to people outside of your relationship but people who are committed to being monogamous develop strong boundaries with others so that these feelings do not balloon into full blown crushes and or venture into infidelity ,3,relationships
RubyWooToo, platonic cuddling ie spooning with a hard on all night ,12,relationships
RubyWooToo,if i was in love with a friend partner and i had no intention of betraying my friend i would not even let myself be in the same room alone with that person let alone spending the night in the same bed if your girlfriend wanted to shut him down she would not have spent the night in his arms ,16,relationships
RubyWooToo,the thing you need to understand is that people are allowed to define cheating however they want for some people cheating is keeping in touch with exes for others cheating means not using condoms when having sex outside the relationship since you and your girlfriend have very different views on what constitutes cheating and cannot agree on proper boundaries within a relationship then you have no choice but to break up ,1,relationships
RubyWooToo,you think you are feeling resentful now how resentful do you think you will feel if on top of being struggling to be the sole breadwinner you are now the primary caregiver of a child that he wanted but has no intention of caring for how resentful do you think you will be when the years go by and you find that you did not have as much time as you wanted for your own artistic pursuits because you were the only one making sacrifices in marriage to stay afloat how resentful do you think you will be if you decide to stick it out for a few more years only to discover that this sexy rebel ie lazy fuck is now entitled to alimony and percentage of pension or 401k because you stayed with him for too long and he never had a job in his entire adult life ,10,relationships
RubyWooToo,you think you are feeling resentful now that word will take on new meaning once you are working your ass off to be the breadwinner while also serving as the primary caregiver to a child or when you find out that because you decided to stick it out for 7 years you are now on the hook for alimony because this artistic rebel ie lazy fuck has not had a job in his entire life ,14,relationships
RubyWooToo,here are the possibilities as i see it the couple knows that you do not like the gf or her friends unlike your boyfriend who always doted on her to her face at best you have been aloof with her at worst unpleasant now that the guy and your boyfriend are no longer room mates the couple does not need to be nice or cordial for the sake of keeping the peace at home your boyfriend is infatuated with the girlfriend and does not want you around when he with her he talks shit about you behind your back which know he perfectly capable of so the couple has a reason to dislike you and not want you around personally i do not know how you can possibly trust dating someone who has shown himself to be so duplicitous and two faced and does not have your back when other people are clearly disrespecting you but if that not enough to make you leave the relationship i recommend you reach out to the girlfriend personally and try to clear the air maybe there a genuine misunderstanding or offense that could be easily cleared up with a conversation if that gets you nowhere then make it clear to your boyfriend that being excluded from major events like new years eve and events involving other couples and ignored when you are all hanging out together is not something that you are willing tolerate in a relationship you cannot control who he friends with but he should make it clear that you are a team ,24,relationships
RubyWooToo,the pi is for op peace of mind if nothing else even though most states are no fault there are still some states that have adultery as grounds for divorce or take adultery into consideration for spousal support and child custody considering that op wife is working part time and has been the primary caregiver of the children he needs every advantage that he can get ,8,relationships
RubyWooToo,it depends on where you live but a pi could most certainly follow and photograph her in public places see where she goes and who she meeting with and if that lines up with what she telling you ,2,relationships
RubyWooToo,lets put aside for a moment whether something is freaky or vanilla or slutty or prim what actually gives you pleasure what turns you on and what does not whatever those things are should be your starting point for further exploration as for things that he enjoys doing with you that you might not be 100 into just yet what can you do to make these things more enjoyable for the both of you i definitely agree with you about laying off the booze while it might lower your inhibitions alcohol is also a depressant and can desensitize you so you are not as fully present in the moment and open to full physical and emotional pleasures that you could be experiencing ,2,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,she did not tell you the first time assuming it was the first time because she was overwhelmed by guilt she told you because someone was probably threatening to out her so she needed to get to you first i think you were more than patient and generous with her the first time she was busted and she threw your gift of forgiveness right back into your face if you forgive her a second chance then you are no longer an innocent victim you are volunteering to be chumped ,3,relationships
RubyWooToo,i recommend hiring a pi ,8,relationships
RubyWooToo, just a bump that like saying i just had one potato chip ,166,relationships
RubyWooToo,if he the one who reports it to the doctor himself he will have a better chance of retaining custody of his son than if his son ends up in the emergency room if the authorities found out that he knew the mother was using drugs and did nothing about it they will rightly see him as complicit and an enabler his best chance of keeping his son out of harm way is to end his relationship with the mother report what she doing to a doctor and getting him checked out and then pursuing full custody of the child op if you do not seek medical medical attention for fear of involvement by the authorities then you and your girlfriend both deserve jail ,154,relationships
RubyWooToo,you have plenty of options to work through before you get to the point of un inviting your mother from the wedding this should be your game plan stop responding to her messages do not share any of your ideas or plans for the wedding call up all of your vendors and let them know that they are not to accept any changes or requests from anyone other than you i have heard of parents calling up wedding vendors and trying to make decisions on their children behalf so this is protecting yourself if your stepfather is reasonable and has enough of a backbone to stand up to your mom then talk to him and enlist his help let him know that your mom is really making the wedding process miserable for you and that you need him to step in and bring her back to reality appoint someone ideally your stepfather but if necessary a member of the bridal party or a very trusted family member to keep an eye on your mom through out the day in case she tries to pull any shenanigans if you try all of the things and your mother either escalates her behavior or continues to make your miserable then you can take the drastic step of not inviting her to the wedding at that point you wo not want to take the risk of her ruining the days events and you are not going want to maintain a relationship with someone who would wreck the happiest day of your life anyway it sucks that this will come at the expense of your stepfather and perhaps other family members presence but it will be worth it ,4,relationships
RubyWooToo,my husband prefers when i do not wear make up and dress casually at home because he feels like he gets to see a more intimate and relaxed side of me other people do not see of course that does not mean i look like a slob at home and i do take excellent care of my skin as other comments have said if women invested half the time and money they invest in makeup products into skin care make up would not be nearly as necessary ,3,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,i think the problem here is that you received conflicting information from two different people at the same agency if you have recently come on hard times to the point that you need to apply for rental assistance your husband is probably really nerve wracked and he does not want to miss out on getting help because of some bureaucratic oversight i think the best way to handle this situation would be to either get confirmation from an expert somewhere else or have your husband speak with the woman at the agency who confirmed you did not need this non existent paperwork to give your husband the benefit of the doubt he did not simply take a stranger off the street word over yours he was relying on the expertise of someone who is supposed to be an expert ,-2,relationships
RubyWooToo,your boyfriend has no problem dating a compulsive liar lying by omission and participating in the betrayal of another person what does that say about his character you are painting your boyfriend as if he some poor victim of a femme fetale when in reality he an adult man choosing to have a relationship with and spend his money on a woman who cheating on her boyfriend instead of worrying about protecting him maybe you ought to protect yourself ,8,polyamory
RubyWooToo,that a distinct possibility as well but i was trying not to assume the worst of this guy just yet no matter what op is facing an uphill battle if she wants this girl to go and be mono again the de humanizing of the other girl is also really troubling ,1,relationships
RubyWooToo,not only should you not reconcile with your stepfather you should cut contact with your mother she has enabled his abuse and is an abuser herself ,1,relationships
RubyWooToo,you should definitely post this question to r polyamory for more experienced opinions on this subject basically op you are a unicorn hunter google it you expected this girl to always be in a secondary position relative to you and your boyfriend love both of you equally and respect you and your boyfriend coupledom more than any relationship or sexual needs and desires that she might have of her own this was a completely unreasonable expectation on your part also i do not think you should expect your boyfriend to take this lightly because it sounds like he really into her you need to be prepared for any of the following possibilities he chooses her instead of you he chooses you but is heartbroken because he misses her which means that you will be spending the next several months at least consoling him and dealing with any resentment he might have toward you he tells you he choosing you but continues to see her behind your back if he has no reaction at all to just kicking this girl to curb like she a toy that you have both grown out of playing with then damn that cold ,8,relationships
RubyWooToo, demanding or even expecting 100 parity in sexual acts is imo toxic to a sex life since it makes people feel pressured or obligated to do things they may not be completely into amen to that reddit has an almost absurdly kindergarten like sense of fairness when it comes to sex that is not nearly realistic or optimal in real life just to add to your awesome post even if the boyfriend caves into guilt and pleasures her while she on her period it still would not be full reciprocity because she enjoys getting him off while she on her period while he would not be enjoying himself at all so what is next should she be pressured to do something that she does not like to do in order to make sure that they are even ,7,relationships
RubyWooToo,if your boyfriend is squeamish about touching your genitals when you are on your period or on the tail of end of it you should respect that and take care of your needs with masturbation during this time if your sex life is otherwise satisfying one week out of the month is not going to kill you besides i doubt it would be very fulfilling to be pleasured by someone who is clearly unenthusiastic or perhaps disgusted by the act ,-1,relationships
RubyWooToo,he never done anything like this before yeah right no decent guy suddenly wakes up one morning and says i am going to send my dear friend gf a dick pic and call her a bitch if she declines your friend has always been a scumbag this is just the first time you found out as for anna she did not promise to keep this secret she probably trying to figure out the best way to tell you tell anna truthfully how you found out tell her you appreciate how she shot your friend down and then cut out marc ,16,relationships
RubyWooToo,you said it yourself i do believe we could find a nicer place with more amenities so let your husband do what he needs to do i do agree with your husband that you have the upper hand if your landlord does not want you to leave and is practically begging you to stay ,3,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,seek out men who from countries or cultures that still adhere to very old school gender norms i know quite a few women who have done this they enjoyed being courted having their meals paid for and not having any expectation of sex before marriage the problem of course is that they did not realize that once a ring was put on their finger that they would have severe restrictions on what they could say or do and were expected to be completely deferential not only to their husbands but also their in laws if that does not appeal to you then simply consider this there is no such thing as a free meal you pay for it one way or the other ,3,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,is this really someone that you can trust to have your back in sickness and in health or is that part not going to be included in the vows ,1,relationships
RubyWooToo,if you trust your husband enough to be the sole provider for your family then trusting him with the budget is not that much further of a stretch if he never been reckless or incompetent in the past i do not think handing over the checkbook will transform him into such a person i surrendered financially a few months ago and it really has done wonders in the past our paychecks would be deposited into our personal accounts and then we added money to the shared account for household bills now my paycheck goes directly to the shared account and a fixed amount per month is transferred to my personal account for my own use i know the book recommends cash but we live in a digital age when i said honey i cannot manage all the budgeting and bill paying anymore i need you to handle all the money he was at first alarmed worried that something had gone wrong but when he realized i just did not want to deal with it anymore he was more then happy to help he actually said i am happy you trust me so much generally speaking i think that the more that is expected of men the more they excel ,2,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,if this is only one night a week then let it go and start making your own plans for when he out with his buddies if you are simply worried about him then ask him to text you if he going to be later than 3 am so you know he ok if you want to have a date night with him then let him know in advance of when he makes plans with his friends ,5,relationships
RubyWooToo,spending a lot of time together is not the same thing as sharing a household sharing household responsibilities bills not having anywhere else to go if there conflict etc can often put undue strain on a young relationship i was friends with my husband for 6 years before we started dating and i moved in with him after 1 year and it was still an adjustment also generally speaking i think there something to be said for drawing out the excitement and the romance of courtship phase before settling into domestic bliss ,1,relationships
RubyWooToo,advice in a nutshell do not let fireworks distract you from red flags advice in brief even if you are dating him exclusively at this stage you should still be vetting him do not ignore your friends and obligations by sinking all your time into this new guy and whatever you do do not rush any other milestones like introducing family moving in together engagement etc longer explanation do not give yourself the false impression that you know him inside and out because you have been spending so much time together in the mere 10 days you have been dating because you really do not the more you are into a guy the more you will be inclined to sweep your concerns under the rug as an older lady with experience i can tell you that your assessment that some guys come on strong and then burn out fast is a correct one also there guys who are absolute princes early on and then turn into monsters once they feel they have you locked down that why it so important even if you are not seeing any other people to keep a level head not get too emotionally invested too quickly i know you will be tempted to ignore this advice but i really wish someone had given it to me when i was 20 because i would have been spared so much heartache but anyway i hope this guy will turn out to be just as good as he seems ,74,relationships
RubyWooToo,if your wife is such a harridan why did you stay with her for 10 years why did not you run off into the sunset with your affair partner or cut your losses after your cheating was revealed what did you and your wife do to repair the relationship after your affair was revealed ,3,relationships
RubyWooToo,i think that you should stay with your dad so you do not have to change schools which is extremely disruptive at your age and because you are going to have minimal space and privacy at your grandparents house present your decision to your mom as a rational fact based decision and not an emotional one mom i am staying here because i do not want to switch schools and make a lot of abrupt changes all at once i will be sure to come see you on weekends ,20,relationships
RubyWooToo,if that never happened to you then you have lived a charmed life i think that you are either being willfully ignorant or manipulative about what i am trying to say it true that only god knows the sincerity of someone heart and makes the ultimate judgement on their soul as humans we cannot know someone heart but it perfectly within our rights and abilities to make a judgement about them based on their actions when someone apologizes but keeps doing the same action over and over again it completely reasonable to determine that their words are insincere and that all i have to say to you ,1,adultery
RubyWooToo,for the last time i was not passing judgement on another soul i was making an assessment of remorse based on a person actions and not their words at least in my denomination being a christian is not a free pass to do whatever you want to other people as long as you say you love jesus and claim to feel bad about it ,1,adultery
RubyWooToo,according to even the most simple understanding of christianity adultery is a mortal sin and actively participating it with no effort to stop is not a sign of remorse or contrition you can do all the mental gymnastics and manipulation of language that you want to and that fact does not change and me criticizing someone keeps them paralyzed in their negative behaviors only someone who refuses to take responsibility for their own actions and prefers to shift blame on to others for their own failings will think that way ,1,adultery
RubyWooToo, big virtual hug i am glad that you found my comment helpful be prepared though that when you emotionally disconnect and cease intimacy she might have second thoughts and try hoovering http outofthefog website top 100 trait blog 2015 11 4 hoovering or love bombing https en wikipedia org wiki love bombing you this is likely to happen if she gets a taste of what it like to be on her own and realizes that there are not too many guys out there willing to be the white knight to her damsel if that happens be sure to revisit this post and go back to your dad for a reminder of how you feel right now and why you do not ever want to go back to this again ,1,survivinginfidelity
RubyWooToo,instead of asking us you should ask all the friends who have barely gotten to hang out with you since you started dating this schmuck or have had to tolerate his behavior to stay in your life i am sure they will have better insights ,1,relationships
RubyWooToo,i read your comment and your update google hysterical bonding that what your experiencing going forward there should be absolutely no physical affection if she wants the relationship to be over if she fucking around with other guys and wants to continue doing so then she does not get to have the pleasure or the comfort of sleeping beside you at night or enjoying any kind of intimacy from you the fact that she even asked for this beyond selfish she wants to keep you around for comfort and in case she has any regrets about being on her own most importantly continuing to sleep next to her provide physical affection of any sort and otherwise acting like a boyfriend when you no longer are is going to fuck up your head and delay your healing if she cheating you are continually putting yourself at risk for catching an std by having sex with her you need to get tested for stds and not lay one more finger on her if you have to live together for the next 3 weeks then live together as room mates who barely know each other no sleeping in the same bed no affection no sharing meals together picking up after one another nothing you are literally just under the same roof until you are able to part do not let her fool you into simmering on the backburner under the pretense of being friends well guess what you are not friends friends do not hurt and betray each other like this ,1,survivinginfidelity
RubyWooToo,you completely missed my point would you think someone was remorseful if they repeatedly kicked you in the face but kept saying i swear i am really sorry about it but just a few more kicks and i am done ,1,adultery
RubyWooToo,as u allysworld said you do not have to do everything at once and can start with marriage counseling i recommend calling around and making sure you find someone with a specialty in or a lot of experience with infidelity letting him move back in should be the absolute last step process once you are confident you want to reconcile since you are only one month out i recommend staying separated until at least the summer to see how serious he is about fixing this you may also want a polygraph and a postnup purely for peace of mind ,1,survivinginfidelity
RubyWooToo,what is he doing to win back your trust and be a better person as for your family while they need to respect your choice whatever it is it not reasonable to expect them to rugsweep and go on loving him and treating him the same way they did before those familial relationships will need to heal too lastly you should also seriously consider their opinions even if they do not jive with your current direction sometimes outsiders can see things that we are blind to ,2,survivinginfidelity
RubyWooToo,it honestly seems like she checked out the relationship but because you have been together so long and likely have lives intertwined she does not have the balls to pull the plug ,2,survivinginfidelity
RubyWooToo,he staying in his marriage and has continued to bring children into it because he getting something out of it what you consider a dead marriage is the heart of a family unit not that my opinion on your relationship matters and i am sure you have heard this elsewhere but you seem like a very intelligent woman from a good family with a capacity for much love and strong faith you are putting your heart soul dignity and future happiness on the chopping block for what is at the end of the day just a man i am sure at this point my love or celibacy seems like the best and perhaps even the most courageous choice but stick around and watch the years go by as everyone around you gets married and starts families and your relationships with those closest to you erode because you have to hide so much of yourself from them to keep this secret there no way resentment wo not fester and transform you in a terrible way now you might think he getting a raw deal too stuck with an awful wife for the sake of his kids but at the end of the day your end of the stick is much shorter he has his family his respectability in the eyes of his loved ones and his community and a lover on the side he has everything you are going to miss out and then some which also means that he has far more to lose when this arrangement inevitably blows up and when it does it will absolutely blow your mind how quickly he throws you under the bus in order to hold on to what he has if he was willing to deal with the fallout of discovery he would have left her by now anyway i am sure you are sick of this conversation but i hope you will keep at least a kernel of it in the back of your mind for the future and find the strength and clarity to find your way out of this situation ,2,adultery
RubyWooToo,i do not claim to know the contents of another soul but the bible which is the basis of christianity and this post is pretty explicit in its condemnation of adultery as a mortal sin but speaking purely from a human perspective there a key distinction between remorse and shame remorse means taking action to become a better person even if it painful embarrassing inconvenient and the ultimate outcome uncertain shame is little more than indulgence in self pity and concern with the preservation one own self image even at the expense of others at the end of our day our actions are the best indicator of our feelings and intentions for example if a guy claims to be sorry for abusing his wife but then gets drunk every saturday instead of going to therapy and continues to beat her up it does not take divine insight to conclude that he not genuinely remorseful ,1,adultery
RubyWooToo,i can say with near certainty that your theological arguments will be of little comfort to his heartbroken family and your very decent and loving one who i have no doubt raised you better than this if and when they find out ,1,adultery
RubyWooToo,like i said before you tell yourself whatever you need to get to sleep at night ,1,adultery
RubyWooToo,you are not overreacting you are correctly putting the pieces together and seeing an ugly picture first of all if this was genuinely a joke she would not be defensive with you she would be apologizing profusely and doing everything she could to assuage your anxiety for example my husband picked up my phone to use it when the charge on his was dead and saw that i had mentioned a medical problem of his to my mother and got really upset yeah i was annoyed he read my text messages but i was much more upset about him feeling hurt and betrayed second as u littleclever said this was not a joke with one person but with multiple unrelated people third if she stupid and reckless enough to divulge a sexual fantasy about her boss to a co worker then it not a huge jump to think she probably stupid and reckless enough to sleep with him fourth her behavior confirms what she talked about in the texts therefore it completely understandable that you cannot rely on your wife integrity or restraint your only hope is that her boss is not idiotic and unethical enough to fuck a subordinate ,5,survivinginfidelity
RubyWooToo,if that your view which is a very convenient one for you then why bother trying to be a decent person at all all you have to do is say you are a believer pray and never follow through on promises you make to yourself or to god and what is a marriage vow for a christian if not a solemn promise one makes to god if you think that feeling guilty and praying is enough and that you do not actually have to follow through on anything then you are as matthew wrote a worthless servant and since you mentioned dying a christian well none of us know when our number might be up people think that they have forever to make amends and change the error of their ways i do not claim to be perfect and i might have much to account for in the hereafter but i am going to at least do my very best to not be in the throes of breaking a commandment when i finally see him face to face ,1,adultery

RubyWooToo,i am catholic one of the things that absolutely pisses me off is the sheer multitude of jesus cheaters people who dress up their adultery in religious language god brought us together or use their spouse faith to manipulate or bully them into staying even more egregious are the pastors who to pressure betrayed spouses into reconciling with unrepentant adulterers even though adultery is one of few sins repeatedly condemned through out the bible including the 10 commandments and one of the few offenses considered legitimate grounds for divorce or annulment calling yourself a christian when you are an active adulterer is like calling yourself an athlete when your fitness efforts are limited to binging on dorritos in front of the tv while feeling bad that you are not going to the gym ,2,adultery

RubyWooToo,people who are genuinely remorseful make every effort possible to put an end to actions that they consider evil or damaging they might fail from time to time but at least they try if their efforts never go further than guilt and they even go so far as to revel in their sin like op and bellasub then they are not really sorry for what they have done they just feel sorry for themselves so many people conveniently skip over the go and sin no more part of jesus statement ,2,adultery

RubyWooToo,if his primary interest is spinning plates and he not that into her then sure but if he open to a relationship and very interested in her as a potential partner then he would be willing to be exclusive that the whole crux of the vetting process see side bar ,3,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,a high value man is not going to commit to marriage without seeing how the sex is but committing to exclusivity is a relatively low risk endeavor he can always break up with her if they are sexually incompatible ,3,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,i learned both these recipes at the knee of my nonna so i do not have any exact measurements or times for anything you pretty much just have to go by visuals homemade red sauce ingredients tomatoes salt pepper diced garlic fresh basil olive oil get a whole bunch of fresh plum tomatoes if tomatoes are not in season then you can go with the canned whole plum tomatoes i make my sauce over the summer with tomatoes from my garden and store it in mason jars if using fresh tomatoes dice them up and dispose of the woody tops and the white inside drizzle a few circles of olive oil into a heated pan or dutch oven add tomatoes sprinkle salt and simmer on medium until the tomatoes start to melt down about 30 minutes for fresh tomatoes i use a potato masher to crush them down stir occasionally add garlic salt pepper and basil if using fresh tomatoes add another swirl of olive oil this will help excess liquid to evaporate so sauce thickens if using canned plum tomatoes you can add a tablespoon of tomato paste if sauce is not thick enough for your liking continue to simmer on medium to low heat for another 30 minutes stir occasionally linguine with white clam sauce ingredients fresh clams soaked in water for an hour then drained rinsed and scrubbed to remove all dirt and sand clam juice white wine diced garlic diced shallots diced parsley olive oil two tablespoons of butter linguine boil a salted pot of water and add linguine cook for 3 minutes then drain heat olive oil in a heavy pot or dutch oven add garlic shallots clam juice and white wine and bring to a boil add clams cover the pot reduce heat to a simmer and cook for 5 to 7 minutes shaking occasionally to mix it up open the pot and remove any clams that have not opened add the pasta butter and parsley and cook for another 3 minutes if pasta is not al dente cook for another minute or two ,3,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,it useless to give advice to someone who does not recognize a problem and is not determined to fix it in fact most people want to be comforted and coddled which is why she leaning on her friends who do just that therefore unless she specifically asks for your advice on future relationships i would not waste your time besides you are new to the workplace and do not want to jeopardize your professional relationships if she does genuinely want your advice i would start with telling her to go into nun mode for at least 6 months and work on herself if she repeatedly plated then she probably just jumping from one relationship fwb to the next without any circumspection or self improvement if she receptive to that idea and actually follows through on it then i would say it safe to offer up other gems of rpw advice ,11,RedPillWomen

RubyWooToo, op i would put money on that he told you about the coffee date because someone you mutually know saw him with her and he was worried you would hear about it that was my guess as well another possibility is that he told op to test the waters and eventually erode op boundaries it the same thing with the sunset and wine picture he trying to see what he can get away with ,98,relationships
RubyWooToo,if he really was a changed man then he would not be making excuses for his past cheating making promises to op that he did not intend to keep and he would not be hanging out with tas out of the classroom since that what got him into trouble last time but whether he changed or not i agree with you that op cannot carry on with her relationship if she does not trust him and feels the need to control his actions ,64,relationships
RubyWooToo,your boyfriend has not only cheated in the past but he taken no responsibility for his past infidelities he does not keep his promises to you and keeps pushing boundaries whenever he gets the opportunity it one thing to give someone a chance when they have shown they have changed but that not the case here also your boyfriend is a lawsuit waiting to happen at some point he going to sleep with or put the moves on someone who will then blow up his career he not just a cheating asshole he also a huge idiot there no way to plan on a secure future with someone who has such poor judgement ,62,relationships
RubyWooToo,i am sorry but it unreasonable to expect a partner especially one with a high sex drive to be satisfied with guilt sex once a week while you may find his suggestion hurtful to you i think it a sign of love and respect that he mustered the courage to be honest with his feelings and seek out your approval instead of going behind your back and cheating or just flat out dumping you if you are not willing to let him sleep with other people and you do not want to break up then you need to fix this problem this means talking to your doctor about fixing your migraine medication maybe there a dosage or an alternative you can look into that not going to mess with your sex drive and seeing your ob gyn about the bleeding ,15,relationships
RubyWooToo,i did not say that the number of sexual partners is irrelevant just that it importance by itself is overemphasized when there are a myriad of other factors to consider i do not think there number of partners that transforms a person from reasonably adjusted relationship material to ho beast also a number without context is meaningless a woman could have only slept with 3 people her entire life but if one of those men was her boyfriend and the other 2 were men that she cheated on him with then she a worse option for a relationship all other factors being equal than a woman with more sexual partners but who is honest and faithful in her relationships ,5,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,i think there was some overreaction on your side and some mishandling of the situation on his side i think he wanted some time to catch up with his old friend one on one and you probably would have felt like the third wheel if you had been included in everything at the same time i think he should have made more of an effort to set expectations from the beginning make introductions and not just blow you off the way he did the whole time on your end i think you should have been a little more upfront about your feelings from the get go so you did not have a slowly building powder keg of emotions culminating in a booze fueled explosion ,7,relationships

RubyWooToo, what would be the right course of action if i decide not to divorce put your head in the sand accept the fact that your wife is going to have dalliances outside of your marriage stop looking for evidence and stop making threats that you refuse to follow through on ,3,relationships
RubyWooToo,i think the preoccupation with n count is very short sighted and can lull someone into a false sense of security i have known people who were virgins when they got married who then went off to fuck around behind their spouse backs because they felt they had not had enough fun in their 20s ,2,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,there are tons of factors that lead someone to get divorced versus not and you are looking at one piece of the puzzle furthermore not getting divorced by itself is not indicative of happiness over all a person with a lot of partners who gets divorced could just be a person who was always unstable in relationships in which case you are looking at a symptom and not the cause similarly virginity is not the cause of a marriage being happy or enduring there could be a ton of religious familial and societal pressures holding that marriage together when it might have otherwise fallen a part just take a look in r adultery or r deadbedrooms there usually quite a few posts from people who were virgins when they got married or otherwise really inexperienced who feel trapped in unhappy marriages because of these types of pressures and obligations ,0,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,i did not say that there was no connection at all just not the ones you are assuming nor did i say that only girls with mental illness and emotional problems sleep around for that matter there are plenty of people with mental illness and emotional problems that do not sleep around at all my point is that reckless sex or promiscuity however you want to call it could be one among many issues among people who are depressed or get divorced and again i do not think lots of sex by itself makes someone less attached in relationships it more likely that people who do not get attached have a lot more casual sex ,2,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,i think it ungentlemanly and unladylike to ask someone what their partner count is my husband and i never talked numbers we were both in our 30s when we got married and dated frequently in our 20s so we knew without asking that neither of us was a virgin frankly at our age i think it would be more suspicious if either of us was inexperienced because it would be indicative of having a rather low sex drive ,5,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,i think that this oft cited study mistakes causation for correlation sleeping with a lot of people does not cause depression or divorce it just that people who have chronic emotional problems or mental illness are more likely to engage in reckless sex and have unstable relationships leading to divorce as for the pair bonding thing again correlation does not equal causation there is no legitimate study showing that a lot of casual sex means you cannot emotionally connect it far more plausible that people who are able to easily compartmentalize and do not have strong feelings of emotional attachment during sex will have a lot more casual sex than people who need and value emotional intimacy ,12,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,i think your jealousy is indicative of other problems why cannot you ever do the things that they did like have children get a house etc if it because he does not want more children or does not want into a different home then that means you are not being open with him about what your needs and desires are or that you agreed to his wishes without really considering you own i think you should carefully think about what is missing from your current situation and then discuss it with him for example i know you like living here but i would love to have a house that we picked out together is this something you would consider in the future and go from there as for the calls i think anyone would be upset about constant calls from an ex especially if he gets upset and then you have to deal with it that not fair to him and it not fair to you he should be setting boundaries with communications with his ex but i recognize that with children involved he needs to tread carefully on this issue i recommend that you approach him like this it really upsets me to see how miserable and stressed ex calls are making you how can we fix this ,3,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,that bullshit if she cannot afford to cook all the food herself then the meal should be done potluck style as you suggested i wonder how much of the 20 will actually go toward the meal ,3,relationships
RubyWooToo,if you think you know him well enough to sleep with him then why do not you think you know him well enough to be in a relationship the worst thing that happens if you rush into an exclusive relationship is that you realize you are not right for each other and you break up so what but here what you risk when rush into sex without exclusivity stds unwanted pregnancy before knowing where you stand on that issue him losing interest getting prematurely emotionally attached and getting anxiety over who and how many other girls he screwing and as well as you think you know him trust me you do not i was friends with my husband for years before we started dating and we were adults when we met not high school students and we were both shocked at how much we had to learn about each other after we became a couple do not let your shared history or all the pretty things he saying so early in the relationship lull you into a false sense of security or intimacy ,3,RedPillWomen

RubyWooToo,i think a guy whose a perfect 10 would not even need to employ dread game at that peak of attractiveness it a given that there are plenty of women ready and willing to take that man off your hands ,1,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,on top of this i think op should have a talk with his mom in about as neutral non judgmental and fact based as possible about what he observed and ask her what is going in with dad it possible that dad has been gaslighting her making her feel as if she overreacting or that the signs of cheating are all in her head or there could be something else like may be they are being hounded by creditors ,1,relationships
RubyWooToo,i think that could work great in a long term relationship where there a history of miscommunication but i think suggesting a weekly vent session to someone you have only been seeing 2 months would be extremely off putting i can imagine this guy glaring at her like she has two heads and saying sorry i have better things to do besides if you can find 5 minutes worth of material to bitch about during what is essentially the honeymoon phase then maybe it a sign you are incompatible and should not be dating ,2,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,your post is spot on but just to add the dread game can easily backfire in a few ways a woman starts to think that her husband is cheating or is emotionally checked out the relationship and takes that as a cue to get her ducks in a row and get ready to jump ship so instead of drawing his wife closer to him he chased her away a woman sees her husband flirting with other women or mentioning how attractive her best friend is since she lost weight and says ok two can play that same game she starts flirting with other people or mentioning other men looks and considering how generally speaking easier it is for women to garner male attention she succeeds in dreading him now they are both miserable the man who tries to employ dread game grossly underestimates his smv and instead of impressing his woman with how attractive and charming he is to other people the reaction he gets from other women is at best amused or at worst repulsed or creeped out instead of elevating himself in her eyes he knocked himself down by several pegs ,6,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,i agree that dread game has no place in a strong healthy relationship and no woman of quality will tolerate it i think dread game is used by men who are insecure in their ability to keep women satisfied and happy in the long term or men who are so bitter and broken down by their partners indifference and disrespect that they feel like they need to light a fire under their partners asses in order to feel wanted and appreciated i will admit however that when i see women lightly flirting or demonstrating subtle body language that indicates their attraction to my husband i find it a bit exciting because it like i can live vicariously through them and see him with fresh eyes like when we first got together i do not get jealous because i have 100 trust in his character and loyalty and he never flirted back at least in front of me of course but if my husband became flirtatious mentioning how attractive other women are acting secretive or elusive i would not be turned on i would be very hurt and angry because i make a consistent effort to let him know he is loved appreciated and desired i would also never humiliate him or give him cause for anxiety and i deserve that same respect ,14,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,when this inevitably blows up in his face how do you think your future wife will feel if she finds out that you knew that your best friend was a cheater kept it a secret and had him serve as your best man might this make her question your ability to be honest and faithful also the wife deserves to know not simply because it the moral and ethical thing to do but because your friend is stupid enough to fuck a young woman who works for him this means that his affair could potentially cost him his job and rain down a mountain of legal fees if the woman ever decided to sue for sexual harassment or coercion his wife deserves to know that not only is her personal health at risk due to potential stds but herself and her child financial stability is also at risk as well ,1,relationships
RubyWooToo,questions like this always come down to can you help me change him without me acting like i am changing him sorry you cannot especially with a guy who has no incentive to change also he 29 not 22 so you really cannot expect him to grow out of it the best you can do is work at excelling and becoming the best person you can be active successful and accomplished maybe seeing those qualities in you will make him not want to be aimless and lazy by comparison ,2,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,regarding your edit the fact that you are the best lay is by no means indicative that he thinks you are relationship material and him saying he not interested in anyone else at the moment should not be construed as commitment he a medical student so it not like he has much time for multiple plate spinning i am not trying to knock you down but i am trying to give you a dose of realism before you start planning your life around this guy and get disappointed tell him that you enjoy going out and that you would like to do that more often with him and see what he says if he really serious about you hopefully he will carve out some time with you outside of the bedroom even if it to see a movie or get a drink if he does not then you have to decide if you can accept this arrangement as it is ,8,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,so basically you can live with his flaws as a couple but your marriage is unlikely to survive with children in the mix that a perfectly legitimate reason not have kids unfortunately there no nice way to spin that to someone but i think you should try hopefully he will lose interest in the idea ,45,relationships

RubyWooToo,trust me you are not missing much by skipping to the comments you pretty much nailed it most of the comments are harping on how awful jane is but op is just so deluded that i really have a hard time believing his perspective alone for all we know jane has broken up with him or is trying to break up with him but he so singularly fixated on her that he simply wo not accept it ,24,relationships
RubyWooToo,exactly this you need to talk to your wife along with a child therapist and a lawyer ,28,relationships
RubyWooToo,that exactly the age difference with my dad and his wife they are both perfectly healthy right now but as you say you never know while i have no doubt the child would be loved and cared for i still do not like the idea especially nowadays when you consider how many young people are reliant on their parents well into their mid 20s because of health care and economic reasons also as i said in another comment it can be hard if you are middle aged or even old yourself and dealing with an ill aging parent let alone if you are still a child teenager or young adult in my case i have done my best to show my love and share their excitement for this endeavor but i have also made it clear that any plan they have for this kid cannot be contingent on me since i am in the process of trying to start my own family ,4,relationships
RubyWooToo,i know the phrase work spouse is often used jokingly but it extremely inappropriate and disrespectful to the actual spouse or significant other being touchy and flirty while at work is crossing boundaries and unless you want to get a reputation at work as someone who is unprofessional and untrustworthy you should cut that shit out as for the guy there is no legitimate reason to hide the existence of a spouse unless you have shady intentions or the type of egotistical personality that needs a constant supply of adoration ,22,relationships
RubyWooToo,i like your idea of dropping in on lunch and seeing what is up if nothing going on if there is no jane then it should be a pleasant surprise for your husband if something is going on you can observe his reaction with your own eyes i think anonymous messages are such bullshit precisely because it so unfair to drop a bomb on someone life like this without owning the act and because it puts the recipient in a position of having to choose between the word of a complete stranger and his or her spouse ,13,relationships
RubyWooToo,i remember 10 years ago when boho chic was popular and there were girls walking around new york looking like bag ladies in potato sack dresses and over sized sunglasses i would always get hit on wearing clothes that emphasized my silhouette and accessories that complimented rather than overwhelmed me i almost wanted to thank those women for making it so easy to stand out since i am sure many of them had superb figures hiding underneath those ugly rags ,19,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,instead of losing to weight to look like this model when you are already quite petite he should get a personality transplant so he not such an asshole ,5,relationships
RubyWooToo, am i too trusting or not trusting enough you are neither you have an unhealthy obsession with this woman and are needy co dependent and willfully naive at the same time jane is a complete liar and manipulator i do not believe for a second that she was broken up with peter when she met you it safe to say that their relationship has continued on and off for the entirety that she been with you at best you are a comfortable place to land when they are on the outs it really hard to give advice for these kinds of posts because so much of the information is completely unreliable here the best that i can do hope to god that the child is not yours and that it peter if so you can make a clean break from jane and she can completely ensnare peter like she always wanted if the kid is yours then do junior a favor break up with jane get yourself into some intensive therapy asap and do not see or communicate with jane in anyway unless it involves your child you can still be a good father without being in this train wreck of a relationship ,117,relationships
RubyWooToo,he should leave her even if the baby is his he does not have to stay in a relationship with a cheater and a liar in order to be a good father to his child ,43,relationships
RubyWooToo,you seem to have missed the details in the post this concerns me because mom has had a number of serious health issues including three hospitalizations and two surgeries in the past five years she has continuing health concerns even if op mom was a healthy 51 year old it very unlikely that she will be perfectly healthy and energetic for all 30 years of her remaining lifespan the fact that she already sick means that her life might be shorter and aging more significantly challenging which the stress of being a single mother will only compound most people do not just die quickly and peacefully illnesses and ailments accumulate over time and eventually they just do not recover most middle aged people have a hard time watching their parents go through this yet alone a child or teenager lastly there no other siblings but op and only mention of friends not aunts uncles or cousins so not only is this kid going to be orphaned at a young age he or she wo not even have any other close family members to lean on ,19,relationships
RubyWooToo,my dad is in his 60s and currently trying to conceive with his wife who in her 40s since any attempt to criticize their decision is instantly met with resistance i took the approach of simply asking questions i think you should do the same such as what is your plan for the day to day care of the baby as you know i will be moving out of state soon what is your plan for who will take care of the baby if something happens to you oh me i am sorry mom but husband and i already agreed we are not having children how are you setting aside money for junior college and your retirement as you probably know most grads are now living at home after college for a few years since the job market is rough etc etc etc but ultimately as you say this is her decision ,17,relationships
RubyWooToo,if your dog had otherwise been a welcome member of the family loved and well treated by your husband up until this incident and he was filled with remorse and sharing in your grief i would say that maybe your marriage could come back from this but your husband never wanted the dog and completely neglected the dog the only time he took an interest was to poison the dog and set him loose outside when the dog stopped being fun he literally treated your dog like a toy that he mishandled got bored with broke and then thinks he can easily replace your husband is severely missing his empathy chip this type of behavior does not happen in a vacuum so you really need to wise up and start taking seriously the numerous other examples of his callousness and cruelty that you have probably been ignoring ,10,relationships
RubyWooToo,first i am sure there might be many that disagree with me but in nearly all arrangements such as the one you described that i have seen in real life the husband who allows his wife to hook up with other women almost always does so with the intent that he can secure a hall pass for himself in the future i have seen it happen every single time i am sure you will be adamant that you are the exception but i think you would agree with me if you were honest with yourself second do not pretend that you fell in love by accident there hundreds of deliberate steps taken and boundaries broken between when you initially meet someone and when you fall maadly in love with someone if you were interested in exploring your own relationships outside of your marriage you should have discussed modifying your arrangement with your wife long before you crossed the line if you were not satisfied with her response then you should have been honest about your resentment with her double standard instead you decided that it would be easier for you to lie and then apologize than doing the hard work of being honest and delaying gratification the only reason you are not a fan of honesty now is because you did not get your desired response advice if you are intent on fixing your marriage then you and your wife both need to cut out your extramarital pursuits and focus on each other that means that you both go no contact with your respective sidepieces at least until trust is rebuilt ,4,survivinginfidelity
RubyWooToo,well now you know why he did not have a serious relationship in 3 years before you he still emotionally involved with his ex you should not give this guy the benefit of the doubt because you already did that with two other guys and where did you end up heartbroken and with anxiety and trust issues the only benefit to staying in this relationship is to make your therapist richer you can have as many talks with him as you want but the fact of the matter is you cannot manage his relationships for him if he not willing to set any boundaries with her then you need to set your own with him break up with this guy and in the future steer clear of men who are not fully available to you edit typos,8,relationships
RubyWooToo,you are not the only one who hates reading these algebra equation posts ,219,relationships

RubyWooToo,i have read chump lady and she does not give eas a pass at all so i am not sure what post you are referring to when she says that eas turn to pas what she saying is that unless it physically impossible for 2 cheaters to meet it extremely likely for an ea to become a pa you should definitely revisit her blog i do not think you should be in marriage counseling with your husband because he not remorseful and not the slightest bit invested in your healing you should find an individual counselor ,5,survivinginfidelity
RubyWooToo,i agree that crazy ex is crazy my point is that it not like op has no reason to be suspicious it a terrible situation for op to be in ,44,relationships
RubyWooToo,i agree with you but the one concern i have is that op did catch her boyfriend messaging someone else in the past so it not like he does not have a history of shadiness ,452,relationships
RubyWooToo,if you have a low sex drive and can go without sex except for a few times a year then i implore you to not be in relationship unless you find someone with a similarly matched libido it not fair to deprive a partner of regular sex or subject them to starfishing just visit r deadbedrooms to see how miserable sex deprived spouses are ,6,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,your ex girlfriend wants someone who takes marriage and commitment seriously you are right that you are still quite young and so she was wise to cut her losses and not waste anymore of her prime years with a guy who thinks proposals are jokes and could not keep his promise when a serious proposal was expected i think you should take this as a learning experience and spend some time maturing before getting into another serious relationship leave your ex alone ,82,relationships
RubyWooToo,she did not trap him in fact she gave him the perfect opportunity to walk away ,4,relationships
RubyWooToo,you seem to mistake nastiness and aggression for dominance and strength they have nothing to do with each other his hang ups and tumultuous past relationships are not your problem just as any baggage you might be carrying from the past is not his remember he the common denominator in all his past train wrecks rpw as i understand it does not mean you are a doormat or ignore red flags actually that the way of low value women being rpw means carefully vetting and then surrendering yourself only to someone who is worthy of your respect and who you can trust to treat you with love and kindness that not this guy i know you feel like you have a lot invested because you have know him for a long time and lost your virginity to him i knew my husband for years as friends before we started dating and i too was surprised by how much i did not know about him until we were intimate i think you need to accept that this is how he really is and move on ,6,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,he pissed off that he bought himself an expensive gift and she did not say thank you ,23,relationships
RubyWooToo,according to op his wife has an extremely vengeful nature even if that only partly true then having an affair would not just be immoral it would be really fucking stupid not only would he risk losing his child in a divorce which is what he says he trying to avoid his wife will be hell bent on destroying him and whatever unfortunate woman crosses his path no matter how quiet and discreet op attempts to be he would still be risking discovery ,58,relationships
RubyWooToo,to quote hank hill on the subject of christian rock bands you are not making rock n roll better you are just making christianity worse good thing you donated the money and it did not all end up in his nose ,59,relationships
RubyWooToo,this does not offer any advice but i think it a perspective that those giving advice should absolutely keep in mind op this does not sound like this was an arranged marriage or someone you barely knew before you got married you were with her for a decade before you tied the knot you knew exactly what you were getting when you married her what made you fall in love with her in the first place what kept you together for a decade before you got married why did you choose to marry her why after almost 2 decades together is she suddenly devoid of any positive qualities if your wife is such a train wreck why did you choose to have a child with her ,85,relationships
RubyWooToo,all this means is that you went from one guy you were incompatible with to another guy you were incompatible with just in different ways ,9,relationships
RubyWooToo,he does not want to have a relationship that involves sexual intimacy and you have to decide whether you can live with that if he did want sexual intimacy or was really dedicated to your fulfillment he would be going out of his way on his own to get therapy and work on his problems you would not have to beg plead nag or demand ultimately you have might to accept that you and your boyfriend are fundamentally incompatible much like couples where one wants children the other does not one wants an open relationship the other does not etc ,1,relationships
RubyWooToo,well if you stay married to him you better hope his ex never falls on hard times and decides to pursue child support 8 years of back child support for two children will be a very pretty penny this is probably not the advice you want but you would be wise to divorce him and secure child support payments for your child before his ex decides to file there just no way that your husband is deceptive and apathetic in this one area of his life and nothing else i am willing to bet he a scumbag in other respects but you have not realized or acknowledged it yet ,8,relationships

RubyWooToo,you are not taking into account that the america does not have a state run health care system and most employees have to pay into their company medical benefits program since op is not getting any medical benefits he and his family could be financially ruined in the event of an unexpected illness or accident if he smart he will stash a decent percentage of his take home pay into an account in case of medical emergency u katzchen is exaggerating a bit on the cost of living in sf and nyc it absurdly high in both those places but assuming that the family does not have a ton of kids and a lot of debt 100k makes you solidly middle class ,3,relationships
RubyWooToo, no amount of money can satisfy you if you decide to compare your salary to the others this is a key takeaway your wife is totally wrong in this having said this there are several other aspects to consider your situation further on this point i disagree if for example op was an account manager at a local bank and the wife was complaining that he did not make as much money as an executive vp at goldman sachs that would be wrong but that not the case here the wife is comparing what the op is making to another person in the industry with the same role albeit at a larger company which is sensible everything else in your post is spot on ,4,relationships
RubyWooToo,if you are not getting paid vacation or medical benefits then you are actually making closer to 100k a year edit add i hope you are putting away money into an account in case you or your family has an unexpected medical emergency if i were your wife i would be extremely worried too if they cannot keep their promises on something as fundamental as your base salary then what else are they going to renege on how do you know that they wo not pull the rug out from under you i think you should get as much learning experience as you can from your current position while looking for another job that more stable and will pay you market value for your work ,95,relationships
RubyWooToo,my thoughts exactly the guy knew who was messaging him ,7,relationships
RubyWooToo,i am not going to give you advice one way or another to tell or not but i will say this if you tell her or she does find out on her own by some other means then you need to be able expect that it could potentially take years and a lot of hard work to regain her trust assuming she wants to work things out for you this happened 20 years ago for her it will be happening right now if your instinct is to relieve yourself of your guilt and then spend however long telling her to get over it it was the past then you will be in for a rude awakening ,41,relationships
RubyWooToo,how old are you and who are the guys that you are dating if you are still quite young or going after guys that are just starting out and not sure what their line of work will be if they plan on staying in one place or in a line of work like a medical resident that requires near 24 7 attention then it understandable if they do not want to tie the knot just yet but if the guy is saying he cannot get married until he executive vice president or lands on the moon then it more likely that he simply not interested in getting married or trying to avoid hurting your feelings when he blows you off ,2,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,how long has he been out of his ldr if he just broken up with someone then he might not be ready to settle down if that the case then just respect that and move on how long has he been seeing you if it only been a month maybe you should wait another month or two if it been three months or more and he still hemming and hawing then just politely say i understand if you are not ready to be exclusive feel free to call me if your feelings change and if i am still available i might consider it ,1,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,it not your job to trust her again it her job to regain your trust ,14,relationships
RubyWooToo,stop being so willfully naive if your wife has the will to cheat on you she will find a way even if you are willing to suck it up and ignore the fact that your wife is cheating on you what happens if the day ever comes when she decides to instigate a divorce and do not assume that wo not ever happen because i bet you never imagined she would be on dating web sites and hitting up ex boyfriends either at the very least you should consult with a lawyer and find out what your options are in the event of a divorce and what you would need to do to preemptively plan ahead in order to ensure the most favorable outcome for yourself and your children as for what to do about your wife in the mean time send her ass to work since she clearly has too much free time on her hands also if she employed you will stand a chance at not being on the hook for alimony ,11,relationships
RubyWooToo,no worries ,1,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,i was being a bit hyperbolic but my point was to widen her scope beyond what people tend to think of when they picture a wealthy and successful man ,1,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,the fact of the matter is this your mother support network crumbled as a consequence of her own decisions people who feel genuine guilt and remorse do not stab their nearest and dearest in the back repeatedly over the course of three years she gave zero fucks about the impact that her actions would have on her family and the fact that she trying to force this guy as father figure to your younger siblings indicates she as selfish and shameless as ever if you are feeling ambivalent i would talk to your dad about your dilemma and get his opinion on it if he can stomach seeing the guy there then maybe consider allowing him as your mom 1 if not then i would tell your mom straight up that she welcome but he is not i am sure your family members will be happy to support you if she insists on his attendance or threatens not to attend herself but if you do decide to allow him to attend then she and her boyfriend need to be seated at a table that is not within direct eye shot of your dad i know you have your heart set at having a head table with the parents but i do not think it feasible under these circumstances most of all it helps your mom maintain this illusion that her boyfriend is now a welcome figure in your lives when he is not ,18,relationships
RubyWooToo,you should never conflate wealth with generosity i have known extremely wealthy guys who are absolute cheapskates either because they are afraid of gold diggers or they have a scrooge mcduck hording approach to every cent they make but also regular joes who love spoiling their lady loves but generally speaking people tend to settle down with someone with a similar background and similar socio economic and educational status if you are looking for a well off guy the best way to meet one is to be well off yourself or at the very least run in circles with people who are there also a tendency for women who are seeking wealthy men to focus on high profile professions like lawyer doctor or engineer so if your plan is to hang around the harvard law library or go for drinks at a swanky country club you will probably be among hundreds of other girls doing the same exact thing much more overlooked are men who are extremely successful in blue collar professions like builders electricians plumbers garbage men etc as mike rowe said about his show dirty jobs i can t tell you how many millionaires i ve met on dirty jobs who are literally covered in shit now i am not saying that you should plan to spend your next night out at the dive bar outside your local ibew headquarters but if you happen to meet a guy who is making a steady living in a profession that does not require several hundred thousand dollars in student loan debt do not dismiss him ,3,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,you need serious individual therapy and anger management classes and if you still cannot get your temper under control then do the selfless thing and leave him if he does not have the strength to follow through on leaving you himself you have no right to treat another human being as your emotional punching bag ,1,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,i agree 100 with this the last person on earth who should be keeping firearms in the house is a person with an explosive temper she cannot restrain ,4,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,i do not believe in ultimatums because i never heard of a love story that started with and i told him if he did not pop the question by new years i was gone but i think every woman should have time period in their head of when they are willing to walk away from a relationship if their so does not want to commit to marriage another rule that i had is that i would absolutely never move in with a guy unless were engaged to be married i simply had too many friends who moved in with boyfriends and waited years and years to get hitched only to be told well what is wrong with what we have now marriage is just a piece of paper blah blah blah fortunately my husband and i confirmed we were both interested in marriage at about 6 months and then he popped the question on our 1 year anniversary i moved in with him shortly thereafter and we got married a little over one year later i think this was sensible as we were both in our 30s had known each other for a long time before we dated and generally knew what we wanted out of life by the time we got married for people who met in college and are just getting their start it might make more sense to wait it out a bit longer however i would absolutely be suspicious of any guy who seemed too eager to get married and was proposing while still in the honeymoon phase it would signal to me that he might be a fickle or reckless person who does not really take marriage as seriously as he should or maybe has some serious issues that compel him to want to lock down the relationship before i got to know him well ,3,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,oh man high five to you moving can be one of those super tedious high stress events that just brings out the worst in people awesome that you were able to pull yourself out of it ,2,RedPillWives

RubyWooToo,you are absolutely right an apology is only as good as the follow through afterward but while i cannot promise i will be an angel 100 of the time for ever after i just hope that with consistent improvement and a better attitude any lapses into bitchiness will be the exception rather than the rule ,2,RedPillWives
RubyWooToo,do not you know she the exception s,4,relationships
RubyWooToo,i do not think he transformed i think you just did not know him as well as you thought you did when you got married which was extremely early in your relationship my thinking is that when you were in europe it was the two of you living in a bubble high on new romance and all the fantasy that comes with a new relationship then when you parted ways every time you saw each other was basically a honeymoon because you were not living together regularly but now he back in the usa his natural habitat he settled in and maybe relaxed into being the dude bro that he could not really be when he was living in europe ,-2,relationships
RubyWooToo,you misread me i did not say that i do not think victims or perpetrators do not exist i said that it problematic if you only see other human beings in those terms no one on this subreddit advocates tolerating the abuse psychopath or not but being super controlling or bossy is not the best way to deal with relationships ,5,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,if you have a winner take all mindset view people as either victims or perpetrators or cannot find ways to persuade motivate or constructively communicate without giving orders then maybe you are the one who is empathy deficient ,10,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,i do not think that you are out of your toxic mindset at all quite frankly you see your boyfriend as a project to be improved upon and not an independent person with the right to live his life however he wants that not fair and that certainly not rpw as i understand it anyway also from what you have written about your relationship in the past it seems like you dealt him quite a few blows to his self confidence and worthiness as a man maybe he will feel better about himself and be able to trust you completely again if you love and accept him for how he is instead of pushing him to improve himself according to your specific standards because lets be real he wo not be taking your honesty the wrong way your encouragement is really just criticism dressed up with a bow i think you really need to be honest with yourself for both your sakes if you waffled on him early in your relationship and are still hung up on his faults then maybe you should cut him loose so he can find someone who loves him for who he is rather than his potential ,2,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,you are mistaking rude behavior for assertiveness scoffing rolling your eyes or other similar mannerisms are dismissive your ugh basically communicated to this guy that you are not even thinking through what he saying and that his thoughts and ideas are not even worth the effort of articulating a retort ,22,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,this guy sounds like a bit of a fool if he expected his reserved inexperienced girlfriend to lose her virginity in a parking lot with better planning and romance on his part you might have slept with him still i think you were right to break up because if public sex is his thing then you are not compatible however you cannot resent him for boasting about his relationship on social media when you specifically told him you did not like your relationship aired on social media and he respected that wish besides considering that he an exhibitionist that not really surprising ,3,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,the advice i have to give you probably sounds cliche and you might have even heard it from your mom but trust me when i say that i wish i had followed it to a t when i was your age put yourself your studies and your interests first and foremost now is the time to become the absolute best version of yourself maintain excellent grooming and dietary habits while you are in college this seems easy but when you are surrounded by people going to class in their pajamas and pigging out every weekend after binge drinking it very easy to succumb do not binge drink it impairs your judgement and destroys your health distance yourself from friends that put you down and draw closer to girls who share the same goals and outlook as you and who treat you well do not fall into the trap of being someone plate or friend with benefits this is really hard to do especially when your body is screaming with desire for someone but it so important not to get physically and emotionally invested in someone who wo not offer you love and commitment some girls can or think they can compartmentalize and keep things casual but most cannot especially if you are a relationship minded person ,8,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,two relationships does not mean that you are cursed with cheating boyfriends especially at age 21 unfortunately cheating is quite common in the teens and early 20s as young adults can be immature and fall in and out of love rather rapidly but in terms of vetting tips here a few things i have seen that are common about habitual cheaters they are not dishonest in just one aspect of their lives so if you meet a guy and you notice that he does not seem able to keep his promises to people who are close to him and generally employs lies and manipulation to get what he wants that a huge red flag cheaters can be very narcissistic in that they need constant validation from people about how awesome wonderful and well liked they are especially strangers so if you meet a guy who constantly needs to be the center of attention and receive a steady stream of praise and adulation from multiple sources that a red flag they are selfish and wo not endure any inconvenience no matter how minor unless of course they are trying to win the approval of someone with whom they are not yet close for example i dated a guy who lived in a very rough neighborhood it got very late and i asked if he could walk me to the subway to make sure i got on the train he refused because it was too cold outside now of course that could just mean that he did not give a shit about me or was just an asshole in general but in retrospect i should not have been surprised that a guy who could not bother putting on a coat to walk one block to the train would not go through the trouble of breaking up with me before fucking someone else ,6,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,since it hard to really get a perspective on the friendship dynamics at a play here i am going to share with you the perspective of someone whose gone through the process of getting married and been a bridesmaid many times as a bride i was constantly bombarded with questions about the wedding and helpful suggestions and ideas to the point where it was overwhelming so while you might think you are being supportive by taking an intense interest in your friend wedding you are probably coming off as really overbearing especially if you are bringing it up frequently i do not know why close friend picked toxic friend over you but i certainly do not blame her for holding off on breaking the news to you put yourself in her shoes for a second would you be relishing the thought of telling a friend who point blank told you that she would be hurt and offended if you picked someone else over her if you are honest yourself you probably would not especially if at the same time you are dealing with the other emotional landmines of planning a wedding such as should i have a cash bar so i do not have to worry about uncle wine o getting smashed and dropping drawers should i seat auntie mary at a separate table from auntie louise since they have not spoken since bush sr was elected oh great my future mother in law wants to wear white if you really do consider yourself to be the friend that has her best interests at heart here what i advise do not ask about or offer an opinion on her wedding unless she brings it up herself and asks for your ideas and keep your mouth shut about how hurt you are that she picked toxic friend i can assure you she already knows ,3,relationships
RubyWooToo,what a bunch of idiots bribery is much more of an effective means of silencing someone than intimidation ,1,relationships
RubyWooToo,you say you have not been taught the skills to be self sufficient but i disagree you have basically been raising yourself and your younger sister since you were 9 years old the only thing holding you back is your co dependent relationship relationship with your mother whose lousy choices have caused misery for you and transformed your sister into a monster your sister might have inherited some of her dad mental illnesses but the impact of those illnesses and her behavior could have been mitigated and managed if your mother had bothered to be a halfway decent parent the only solution you have is to get a job stop being your mom full time housewife get yourself in therapy and take the necessary steps emotionally and financially to be come independent before your sister is in the full throes of puberty once your sister is both physically able to overpower you and has honed her ability to manipulate to a razor sharp edge all bets will be off do not lose any sleep about leaving your mom out to dry she never taken your well being into consideration during the pursuit of her own happiness and convenience so you should not either ,15,relationships
RubyWooToo,what do you mean he mentioned pregnancy ,1,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,i do not waste my time slut shaming because how other people choose to live their lives is not my business i also do not think that the greater availability of sex makes it harder for people to get married if anything it made settling down easier if all a guy wants is sex he can go out and have it without getting into a relationship he never wanted in the first place the guys who are interested in settling down will still find women with whom to settle down when i have a daughter the argument i am going to make against engaging in casual sex is that it will impair her vetting process by making her emotionally attached to a guy that she does not know well and has not yet secured a commitment from some women can compartmentalize but most cannot it basically the emotional equivalent of getting beer goggles your brain is so drunk on the bonding hormones that you mistake an ass clown wrapped in tinfoil for a knight in shining armor ,15,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,rejection sucks no matter what no doubt but objectively what is more painful getting rejected because you do not want to have sex after date 2 or not getting called back for date 3 after he got the sex that he was after during date 2 if anything you should be grateful that these men are so easily vetting themselves so you do not have to if not getting sex after date 2 is a legitimate deal breaker for them rather than a mere disappointment that wo not preclude them from getting to know you further then these men were not good candidates for relationships ,11,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,i wish you the best of luck i know this whole situation is like a shit sandwich that you are trying to choke down but the best thing you can do for your little girl is shoulder the burden and try not to project your resentments and grievances toward your ex no matter how valid they might be ,1,relationships
RubyWooToo,you have gotten a lot of comments but here what i can offer simply in terms of navigating your relationship with your ex drop the custody fight i know it feels anathema to what you want to do but as the top comment indicated you pretty much lost the war when you allowed your daughter to move to shelbyville all you will be doing by continuing to fight is losing a ton of money and causing a lot of misery for your child by putting her in the middle of the conflict between you and jennifer when your daughter a bit older 13 or so she might decide she wants to live with you and you can take up the case then do not engage in petty arguments with her over text message or otherwise unless she asking you a direct question related to emma what time are you coming to get her today just do not engage with her be polite when you interact with her simply saying hello or goodbye would suffice you do not need to engage in idle chit chat but you should not be mean or giving her the silent treatment either when your daughter complains about your ex listen with compassion and understanding but do not encourage her to think ill of her mother either or gloat when she says she wants to live with you do not badmouth her parenting to other people and certainly not emma recognize that jennifer is emma mother not ashley while it great that ashley and emma love each other and that emma has an additional mother figure to look up to that bit of your wedding ceremony where ashley declared emma her first baby was way over the line ,4,relationships
RubyWooToo,pretty sure you are speaking for yourself but ok ,4,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,does he think your shyness is a problem because if he has not said so then do not go looking for a problem where none exists for all you know he might enjoy having a girlfriend that lets him shine and instead of competing with him for the spotlight it not necessary for you to become friends with his friends you only need to get along well with them you should force yourself to greet them warmly and say hello how are you even if it not your natural inclination because you do not want to come off as rude or aloof to get comfortable with this i recommend practicing your greeting and small talk with people you encounter in the service profession waitresses grocery store checkout cashiers coffee barristas since their entire job is working with and being nice to strangers beyond that i think it find to be quiet for the most part and only contribute to the conversation if you feel you have something interesting or worthwhile to say so many people run their mouths out of nervousness to fill up space or show off that people who are actually good listeners are very hard to come by also like u wub1234 said when in doubt ask someone a question about themselves people love when others take an interest in them and give them an opportunity to wax on about themselves ,3,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,unfortunately you are now in a position where there is not a fair or easy compromise for anyone if you cannot move then your best bet is to try to get every other weekend with emma or if you could get her during her summer break ,16,relationships
RubyWooToo,i am sure that you are a very attractive and charming young woman but i am going to be very frank with you and say that all these older guys you are dating who fall in love with you fast and talk up marriage are blowing smoke up your ass at most they are infatuated if your boyfriend was really serious about wanting to marry you and starting a family with you he would have got down on one knee when you told him you were pregnant he was probably worried that if you went back to your home country to get the abortion you might have second thoughts and not follow through with it as for his ex girlfriend i am willing to bet you 50 that he is not broken up with her you do not have to be colombo to recognize that if his apartment is full of her stuff and he texting her i promise i did not cheat on you a mere few days after he started sleeping with you then she the girlfriend and you are the side piece the answer you do not get serious with him because he not available to get serious with and for the future you should not be having unprotected sex with someone you have known only a month and with whom you are not in a committed monogamous relationship and furthermore you should not even be contemplating moving anywhere with him you are too young and you barely know the guy ,14,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,yes i highly recommend this book forever fat loss https www amazon com dp b0153un79m ref dp kindle redirect encoding utf8 btkr 1 it probably the most healthy scientifically sound and sane book on nutrition and weight loss on the market the approach he advocates is less on meticulous calorie counting and on eating whole non processed energy rich foods i also recommend reading this article http www nytimes com 2016 05 02 health biggest loser weight loss html from the new york times if you have not already on why the biggest loser contestants almost all gained back their weight and then some it basically because crash dieting just destroys the metabolism ,2,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,he has not changed one iota and he still does not respect you wanna know why because he still surrounded by people like his room mate who cruelly describe all of his romps he was single and that completely ok his friends are not slipping up they are assholes and he an asshole for associating with them furthermore you describe your relationship with him before your breakup as passionate and happy right up until the moment he ghosted you how can you possibly convince yourself that it wo not happen again when you never expected it the first time ,1,relationships
RubyWooToo,2 000 calories a day is way too much for a 5 2 woman unless she extremely athletic ,4,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,then basically you are setting yourself up for failure and that why you are binge eating at your current weight and due to your current habits your metabolism is essentially destroyed so it going to take some time and years of good habits to get it to reset itself properly the answer is to change your lifestyle and set realistic achievable weight loss goals with each success you will increasingly gain in confidence and motivation ,5,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo, one of my best friends is a girl she has another friend who really fat and short like you she has a relationship with a handsome tall guy they look in love but i do not know how they do it they are the exception the fact that everyone secretly wonder how and why the fuck the guy is staying with her means everything i can explain it to you the short fat friend was probably very happy confident and charming instead of glowering hatefully at handsome guys sitting on the subway maybe the girl you know smiled at one and lucked out because he happened to have a penchant for fat women ,5,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,so many people just saw the huge blue bar at the top of the page that showed hrc at 70 and the short red bar trump at 30 and said you see it a long shot he will win ,1,politics

RubyWooToo,i guess as a woman i was supposed to vote for the first pussy that ran for office ,1,The_Donald
RubyWooToo,no they probably did not because i am a registered democrat and voted reliably so since i first started voting also the media and the false prophet nate silver were projecting hrc wins by over 70 ,1,politics
RubyWooToo,there were tons of secret trump supporters i know because i am one of them ,4,politics
RubyWooToo,i do not think she absolutely infatuated with you if she has no desire to fuck you more than once a month out of duty and does nothing to maintain her hygiene despite knowing how unhappy you i think there a good chance that if you say this relationship is not working out and you do not want to renew the lease she might actually be relieved ,4,relationships
RubyWooToo,everyone thus far has tip toed around this so far so i am just going to cut to the chase he not clueless he manipulating the shit out of you when someone piques his interest he asks you for a break so it not technically cheating then reels you back in after he had his fun given how coy he is with his relationship status online i am sure he posted that meme knowing that both of you would think he was talking about you unless he specifically tagged you in it if it was truly a dedication he would have tagged you in it or sent a message to her to clarify so she would not be embarrassed or confused i am willing to bet 50 that she blocked you because he portrayed you as crazy ex you are not being controlling or crazy women treat your boyfriend like he single because he acts like he single ,7,relationships
RubyWooToo,this post is absolutely heartbreaking no matter what your size you are a human being and you deserve to be treated with kindness and respect a good man would never drag your heart through the mud with flagrant cheating or even entertain a relationship with a woman he not physically attracted to if i were in shoes i would dump this guy like the stinking sack of garbage that he is i think you should spend at least 6 months to a year in full nun mode and focus exclusively on getting yourself physically and emotionally healthy there is something deeply broken inside you that allowed you to accept such a sorry situation but you can fix it with time therapy full devotion to your own self improvement ,8,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,my husband and i share the same core values and world view so even though we may at times disagree on certain issues or particular points of policy our politics are pretty much in sync we are both very well read on the issues that are important to us so the few disagreements we do have are always opportunities to learn new things ,3,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,no first i trust my own judgement enough not to waste my time pining after ships that already sailed second just because someone more sexually attractive does not mean they are better relationship material as well ,12,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,it impossible to give credible proof without revealing her identity this is not a court of law ,1,relationships
RubyWooToo,now your approach makes even less sense if her husband is abusive and mistreats her then why do you give a shit furthermore you think embarrassing him by telling other people he being cuckolded is somehow the safest option again it just seems like you are not actually concerned about the people involved you just want to be in the eye of the drama hurricane ,20,relationships
RubyWooToo,agreed he did not just go out and fuck a random woman he presented himself as single and seeking a relationship probably spent some time cultivating a connection with her and then dropped the bomb about being married and having a child only after he got his dick wet that so deceptive and sleazy ,3,relationships
RubyWooToo,your relationship sounds unbelievably toxic you cheated early in the marriage and gave him the hall pass to assuage your guilt and now your husband is an asshole both for cheating on you and duping an unknowing person into sleeping with him and potentially developing feelings for him before she knew he was married and had a child this is not the sort of relationship that should be modeled to a young child ,4,relationships
RubyWooToo,even though i think the husband deserves to know the way this post is written makes me think you are more interested in stirring up shit than you are with doing the right thing why is her specific height and weight at all relevant to the story wait until your friend and her husband return from the cruise then tell the husband in private do not make an announcement at a party if the husband wants everyone to know that his wife is a hoe that should be his decision you are only heaping additional humiliation upon him if you go public before he finds out also you run the risk of everyone turning against you i know it sounds crazy but do not assume that everyone will herald you as a hero and take your side some will accuse you of lying and even the ones who believe you will think you are an asshole for interfering in another person marriage and the fact that you are about to give her best friend a heads up is even more ridiculous now your cheating friend has time to get her story straight ,31,relationships
RubyWooToo,i absolutely hate the the advice to tell anonymously whenever it comes up if given the choice between believing an anonymous person on the internet and his wife he will likely choose his wife furthermore if you are going to take the initiative to give someone information that has the potential to blow up their world you need to own it completely otherwise you are doing the emotional equivalent of leaving a flaming bag of poo on someone doorstep ringing the doorbell and running away ,5,relationships
RubyWooToo,your husband is very clearly depressed and probably overwhelmed by the fact that he is a sole breadwinner for a family of four with a child on the way that he cannot afford and what is worse the vehicle he relies on for work is falling a part i think it misleading to say that he constantly in lala land when he working his ass off all day and living with the crippling anxiety that everything will topple like a house of cards if he loses his job if he does not want to go look at cars then you can do the research look at cars and get the vehicle history if it a used car so you can be sure that you are not buying a lemon if he ends up complaining about it afterward well too bad it not like you did not give him the opportunity to have his say as for your mother i looked at your past post and it seems like she might be taking you for a ride if she disabled then she should getting social security security and medicaid she should also be completely transparent with you about the state of her finances with assistance she should be able to cover the 60 month she needs to pay for transportation services for her doctor without dipping into your pocket ,3,relationships

RubyWooToo,i think sarcasm is fine if you are being playful about something that has nothing to do with the relationship and he on the joke but sarcasm is an absolutely awful way to convey emotions good or bad not only do you run the risk of him misinterpreting what you are saying if he takes you literally you also run the risk of him never taking you seriously when you are speaking literally ,2,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,i think it really depends on how dedicated you both are to your beliefs and how much room there is for compromise if he literally thinks that non christians are going to hell and you think that his god is a delusion you are better off cutting your losses early on but if he considers his religion to be a personal matter and you are willing to understand and accept his spirituality then there a better chance it could work whatever you do do not fall into the trap of thinking you can sweep the topic of religion under the rug while you are dating because i can assure you that the bomb will go off once marriage and children enter the discussion do not wait until you get into an argument about getting married in a church or whether or not your kids will be baptized to address this ,2,RedPillWomen

RubyWooToo,but your ex actually did make the best decision for you by breaking up yeah it disingenuous to say it was not what he wanted but i think he rightly judged that short of him doing something unbelievably sadistic or criminal you were not going to initiate the break up think about everything you have rug swept up until this point you described your relationship as happy in your original post but all your follow up comments indicate otherwise you knew he was sitting on an engagement ring of over a year and never popped the question he was having inappropriate relationships with other girls when you lost your job he did not offer to help you until you asked and then threatened to dump you when he had to cover one month worth of rent on his own to get you through the initial pains of this breakup i advise you to recognize that this is probably the best thing that could have happened to you you might have found yourself stuck in a rut for who knows how many years at the cost of the remainder of your prime years for dating and having children ,50,relationships

RubyWooToo,the only reason that you are reminiscing about the past is because you had the good sense and good luck to recognize an excellent life partner when you found him at a young age if you had gone through the trials and tribulations of adult dating post college you would not be missing anything as much as rpw praises getting married young one of the common pitfalls of doing so is that many get grass is greener syndrome i have seen both men and women throw away perfectly wonderful college sweethearts because they felt like they had not lived enough and that there was more out there somewhere only to be terribly disappointed there is something to be said for waiting until you are at least emotionally mature enough to appreciate what you have i doubt that you have morphed from being a hot piece of ass to a withered hag in the past 6 years but here the facts if the only basis for your self worth is your youth and beauty you are going to be miserable and you are going to make very bad decisions like crossing the line with one of those extreme alpha types who give you the superficial gratification you are seeking here what you should be doing instead we all know that smv is important but what are you actually doing to raise your rmv what could you be doing outside of maintaining your looks to give you a sense of purpose and value is there a new skill that you could learn that would make you feel proud of yourself for example you wo not hear too many old ladies in the nursing home complain i wish i had more train wreck relationships in my 20s but there probably a few who might say things like i wish i hiked the appalachian trail or i wish i learned french poke around in r relationships on a daily basis for about a month and read the posts by people your age several weeks of reading about probable cheaters grifters abusers and men who do not do not shower or brush their teeth will make you kiss the ground that your husband walks on ,8,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,i am so glad she out campaigning again the way the media treated her was truly abysmal ,1,The_Donald
RubyWooToo,i hear you on that and chances are if you did become his tobacco monitor he would probably do it more often just for the sheer thrill of trying to get away with something behind your back like a naughty teenager my guy has a cigar or pipe on special occasions but there was just no way in hell that i was going to put my health and my future kids health at risk become a young widow or deal with the time expense and heartache of dealing with severe illnesses that come from regular cigarette smoking i think he knew on an intellectual level that it was a bad habit he would need to stop sooner rather than later so i think i just gave him the excuse to do what he needed to anyway ,1,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,my dealbreakers are alcoholism drug abuse smoking infidelity financial recklessness violence emotional abuse although i should add that my husband was a smoker when we started dating even though i knew i would never marry a smoker i did not say me or the cigarettes i just told him i did not like it and would appreciate if he did not do it in front of me and let him decided how to proceed he quit smoking completely within that first month of dating i am grateful i took the approach that i did because i think if i had given him an ultimatum his instinct would have been to rebel against a perceived attempt to control him i also think the reason he was able to permanently quit was because it was truly his decision and not something i forced upon him ,1,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,if he worrying about protecting his assets then offer to sign a prenuptial agreement before you get married if not the decision you are now facing is to wait around in the hopes he will change his mind or whether or not you are willing to remain in a relationship without the social commitment and also the legal rights and protections that come with marriage such as the right to make medical decisions on each other behalf unrestricted hospital access to one another spousal privileges in court cases etc i had a very good friend of mine who was successfully convinced by her boyfriend that marriage was just a piece of paper they were perfectly happy and everything was fine until he was killed in an accident while she was 8 months pregnant then she realized how damn important that piece of paper actually was she was not entitled to his pension and she could not even get anything on behalf of her child because without being married the unborn child was not legally recognized as his since the house was in his name and not hers like your boyfriend he wanted to protect his property ownership went to his parents since they were the next of kin sure some of this can be worked around with a will power of attorney etc but these things can be contested whereas the rights of lawful spouse are pretty much sacrosanct ,2,RedPillWomen
RubyWooToo,well since you asked here i am long time lurker first time posting i am in my 30s married well established in my career but do not have kids yet but hopefully soon fingers crossed i used to be really active in the twox subreddit a few years ago but after it went to hell in a hand basket i deleted my account i will be honest i really do not like the red pill men subreddit so you can imagine my surprise when i discovered how much the rpw outlook and approach to relationships and self improvement resonated with me i have read the surrendered wife and i am working on becoming the best first mate i can be so now that i have made an account perhaps i can share some my experiences both as a recent convert to rpw and maybe offer some advice to the younger ladies that i wish i received 10 or 15 years ago ,1,RedPillWomen
