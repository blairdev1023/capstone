moonpodrising,no disagreement from me here intra social group competition is not such a hard game but there inter group competition and all indications are there will be increasingly more of it the sudden challenge from the random alpha dude from the other side of the world will get more and more real with technology enabled globalisation dating is an area of life that less vulnerable more locally bounded i will grant but what about when virtual reality socialising really takes off ,1,TheRedPill
