faultydesign,yeah but the problem in your logic is in this situation it an anonymous comment on r conspiracy against mythbusters no matter how many people get mad at me for pointing this out there is 0 credibility behind the statement that oscillators can destroy bridges even if mythbusters are shit science they still have more credibility than random comments on reddit this is a fact and no pointing out that mythbusters were not 100 correct all the time wo not change the fact that it is still just a comment on reddit against their test an actual test ,1,conspiracy

faultydesign, tesla represents fuddy duddy old 19th century backwardness and the mythbusters represent a modern understanding of science i did not say that though besides i find it funny that a guy who equates oscillators to quantum physics is so offended by me saying that 19th century scientists did not know as much as we know today nor did they have the modern technology on their side ,2,conspiracy
faultydesign,deleted my previous comment because i saw that you edited yours anyways i know that mythbusters are not very scientific yet 1 oscillators are not complex technology and are not the same as quantum physics 2 i notice you have nothing to say about their credibility on the oscillator test which makes me feel like it just an ad hominem you do realize the massive skills gap between someone of tesla magnitude and joe the plumber right yes there is a massive skill gap between a scientist from 1900 and modern understanding of science ,1,conspiracy

faultydesign, no i think in this case seth would probably want his name to be revealed but it not up to wikileaks to make that determination it really not as simple as you seem to think why is it not as simple how would it help solve his murder i do not see how his identity as the leaker would make much difference to the investigation surely the investigators have considered it motive is pretty important in crime investigation leak cover up is a motive wikileaks whole thing is based on keeping sources anonymous and revealing their source although in this case it may be the right thing to do would totally undermine their efforts how does it undermine their efforts to show that leakers might get killed by the government i think it helps their efforts of anonymity do not you think only explanation is that seth rich was not the leaker and wikileaks only uses him to mislead their supporters from the russia thing,0,conspiracy

faultydesign, so of course your answer is to have an even bigger more unaccountable government step in and try to manage everything i am not surprised well clearly would have worked in the case that you presented so i do not see what is your argument you are confused because this is the exact incentive that the government has right now and exactly what they do they have an incentive to attract more costumers even though said costumers already pay taxes even if they never once put out a fire of a non subscriber we are exactly where we are at now you gave an example of 1 place that does not have a state provided firefighting force how is that anywhere close to worldwide situation that just an outright lie getting caught setting fires is the fastest way i can think of to ensure your firefighting company goes under people who use firefightingbuds have 30 more chance that their home wont be destroyed in a fire and then they just hire anonymous thugs to burn competitor homes my guess is that in a free market your fire insurance would be tied to your home insurance and you would get discounts for having firefighting equipment in your home and knowing how to use it and if firefightingbuds hire private goons to burn down your house you better have their insurance or else because it much cheaper to prevent a fire than put it out in the first place you would have state of the art sensors and alerts to make sure you get the fastest response time possible only if you are rich because now not only you have to pay for healthcare insurance firefighting insurance police insurance and a jail service you also need to buy a state of the art sensors and alerts of course the free market might have already solved that issue with fireproof homes because homes never have anything flammable do you sleep on fireproof plastic perchance but we will never know because homebuilders are not incentive to provide such structures as homeowners are not worried about fire services there are actually regulations ever heard of the building code https en wikipedia org wiki building code it might sound familiar because it has this tiny gem after the great fire of london in 1666 which had been able to spread so rapidly through the densely built timber housing of the city the rebuilding of london act was passed in the same year as the first significant building regulation ,1,Libertarian
faultydesign, it was a service provided by the city so that makes it not government that makes no sense it was a service provided by the city so clearly there no regulation to make sure the people who live outside of the city are equally protected by said service in a free market you are not the only fire department so you do not have the incentive to let a non customers house to burn down to teach the rest of your customers a lesson in a free market you do not have an incentive to help houses that do not have your private insurance and in fact letting those houses burn down just helps you to acquire more customers in fact you have an incentive to burn down houses that do not have your insurance ,1,Libertarian
faultydesign,it was a service that was provided by the city not by the state and i fail to see how that situation would not apply to your privatized solution ,1,Libertarian

faultydesign,national socialism german nationalsozialismus more commonly known as nazism is the ideology and practice associated with the 20th century german nazi party and nazi germany as well as other far right groups usually characterised as a form of fascism that incorporates scientific racism and antisemitism nazism developed out of the influences of pan germanism the v lkisch german nationalist movement and the anti communist freikorps paramilitary groups that emerged during the weimar republic after german defeat in world war i nazism subscribed to theories of racial hierarchy and social darwinism identifying germans as part of what nazis regarded as an aryan or nordic master race it aimed to overcome social divisions and create a homogeneous society unified on the basis of racial purity volksgemeinschaft the nazis aimed to unite all germans living in historically german territory as well as gain additional lands for german expansion under the doctrine of lebensraum while excluding those deemed either to be community aliens or belonging to an inferior race the term national socialism arose out of attempts to create a nationalist redefinition of socialism as an alternative to both international socialism and free market capitalism nazism rejected the marxist concept of class struggle opposed cosmopolitan internationalism and sought to convince all parts of a new german society to subordinate their personal interests to the common good and to accept the priority of political interests in economic organisation ,1,Libertarian

faultydesign,from the wikipedia page you linked cultural marxism conspiracy theory cultural marxism in modern political parlance refers to a conspiracy theory which sees the frankfurt school as part of an ongoing movement to take over and destroy western society originally the term cultural marxism had a niche academic usage within cultural studies where it referred to the frankfurt school critiques of the culture industry an industry they claimed was able to reify an individual self interests diverting individuals away from developing a more authentic sense of human values british theorists such as richard hoggart of the birmingham school developed a working class sense of british cultural marxism which objected to the massification and drift away from local cultures a process of commercialization hoggart saw as being enabled by tabloid newspapers advertising and the american film industry however the term remained niche and rarely used until the late 1990s when it was appropriated by paleoconservatives as part of an ongoing culture war in which it is claimed that the very same theorists who were analysing and objecting to the massification and mass control via commercialization of culture were in fact in control and staging their own attack on western society using 1960s counter culture multiculturalism progressive politics and political correctness as their methods this conspiracy theory version of the term is associated with american religious paleoconservatives such as william s lind pat buchanan and paul weyrich but also holds currency among alt right white nationalist groups and the neo reactionary movement ,6,Libertarian

faultydesign, but it is realistic to limit the scope of government so each generation has a chance at understanding what they are paying for a limited government is far easier for the public to reason about and control but to teach the next generation you need public schools and funding for roads and traffic and teachers and school books and food and laws to protect those kids and police force and fire fighters and a building and a building safety code and a phone network and proper schooling for the teachers and a school platform and you need funds for all of this and i am sure i have missed lots of other things you need in order to provide the basic requirements of adequate understanding of what the kids will pay for and you will need taxes to support all of this ,1,Libertarian

faultydesign,seems like there are only three premises 1 taxation is theft 2 non agression policy is only rule with nobody to maintain the nap because see point 1 3 free markets will solve all of life troubles honestly i never understood how libertarian society can maintain these premises without the eventual private gang wars,1,Libertarian

faultydesign, you are telling me that huge corporations with astronomically big marketing departments just managed to figure out that there is racist videos on youtube a platform where they display ads come on now why is it such a far fetched idea that companies did not know they were advertising on shit videos disney did not know pewdiepie did racist jokes as evident by their reaction and they were literally paying the guy they were the first ones to make drama about youtube looking like racist heaven on this scale this is what happens with a free speech platform you get a few bad eggs youtube is not a free speech platform https www youtube com yt policyandsafety communityguidelines html communityguidelines respect yet shows like south park and family guy get a free pass on tv of all places if pewdiepie is now considered a racist then a lot of things are racist more double standards this is why they are accusing wsj of being an evil boogeyman irrelevant false equivalence companies that advertise on south park know what they advertise on compared to random racist youtube videos it does matter do not be dumb context always matters it does not matter if you are a racist or not you cannot have racist content on your video and then be surprised companies do not like to advertise on it sure you can say i am not racist some of my friends are jews but it still does not change the fact that you had racist content edit aha it is the way you present it that is what was overblown understand the blame should be put on youtube for even having actual racist videos not ads being displayed on them i do not agree that it was overblown but i also agree that youtube should handle the content and advertisement of said content better but companies do not want to wait for youtube to fix their shit one day hence the boycott ,2,videos
faultydesign, is it not self transparent why else would firms pull advertising for every video even ones that are innocent what does an ad have to do with the content because their ads are being played over videos they disagree with i do not think companies care if it 3 or 300 shitty videos clearly they want youtube to handle it better as if wsj was the first to think of this ads have been playing over racist such and so on content for years this is not a new thing apparently wsj were the first ones to think of this so if it was not shitty he would get a pass this and humour in general is a subjective thing if those jokes were not antisemitic or racist in general then yeah probably pewdiepie obviously does not hate or have anything against jews unless you can tell me otherwise it does not matter you tell me because that is what i am missing a few genuinely hateful videos ruin it for everyone because of this over blowing out of proportions scenario it not over blowing if it actually happens but why now because now the companies are aware of this ,3,videos
faultydesign, that is oblivious firms think their ads are running over mostly racist and sexist whatever videos even when that is not really the full case are we done being coy now how is it not the full case also mostly where did you take that wording from please quote me the exact citation what is being questioned is that who convinced them to think youtube consists only of isis recruitment videos nobody wsj pointed out that ads are being played over racist videos the amount of extremist videos and propaganda makes up a quite small part of the site who says anything about extremist videos and propaganda shitty antisemitic jokes are enough see the pewdiepie case people are pointing at the wsj because they over blew this it an attack at a corporation whether they caused the actions you listed is unknown but they are the ones who started this all why do you think they over blew this the links you posted are just news about big firms leaving that does not answer anything except for it happened because it happened quote from the first paragraph of the first link pepsico walmart and starbucks on friday confirmed that they have suspended their advertising on youtube joining a growing boycott in a sign that big companies doubt google s ability to prevent marketing campaigns from appearing alongside repugnant videos it literally states the reason in the first paragraph ,4,videos
