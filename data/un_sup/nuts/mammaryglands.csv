mammaryglands,i dunno what you should do man but i am here to tell you that it not a wise financial decision to lease a car if the financial aspect is important figure out what you can afford to pay off in about four years find the right car with a four year warranty if making a good long term financial decision is not the highest priority then lease what you can afford and be happy with it ,1,cars
mammaryglands,no maintenance and oil changes are not enough to be financially relevant if warranty is an issue that can be addressed in a used car and better coverage than new can be added since said student is not a business owner there is no situation where leasing makes financial sense at all if you want to argue that having a newer car is more desirable safer better mpgs fine but none of that is financial you wo not save nearly as much in gas to offset having no equity at the end of the payments you cannot make a financial argument for leasing in that situation ,1,cars
mammaryglands,maybe if said young person is so strapped for cash why do they need a brand new car where does the income come from is it guaranteed perhaps if it was and said student found a reasonable lease with little or nothing down it would make sense maybe still likely better off purchasing a used car for the same out of pocket every month ,1,cars

mammaryglands,the only computer degree worth getting is a computer science degree even if you do not want to be a programmer you need to know what happens at that level to round out your it knowledge i agree with those below who say that you do not need a college degree if you want to specialize in networking storage security etc experience is all that matters here certs help but certs should be something you get easily because of your experience not something you study for and get before you have real world knowledge just my 02 source i run a large and successful it consulting practice ,2,networking
mammaryglands,was with you until you sadi owever not so expensive as having to pay a mileage penalty at the end of the lease most often one will pay less money in the end by getting the lowest lease and paying the overage at the end the reason for this is the cost per mile payment 12 10 000 will give you the cost per mile on a 10k mile lease for example and no matter what type of lease that cost is likely to be far higher than the 15 25 cents per mile that the overage will cost you ,1,cars

mammaryglands,based on my experience 3mbps does not sound like adequate bandwidth if they want to replicate six hosts worth of vm and use that pipe for everything else it being used for today not even close other than that this is what site recovery manager is made for it could be doable if they are only looking to replicate a handful of critical vm and not all of them ,1,vmware
mammaryglands,you definitely will get there if you have an intel desktop or laptop to spare you might try getting familiar with the install process chances are it will work on most any hardware the important step is ensuring you do not overwrite the vmfs volumes as part of the process the installer is usually good at picking up existing vmfs stores and warning you if you are going to do anything that overwrites data not sure if i misread your earlier post or whatever but there is no direct upgrade path from the old esx to the new esxi old esx was a hypervisor based on the red hat os standard red hat commands would work etc esxi is smaller footprint hypervisor that does not include legacy red hat os stuff ,1,vmware

mammaryglands,of course you cannot use the same image on desktops and servers because you use server operating systems on servers and desktop operating systems on desktops that it 101 so i still do not get that point you can use the same windows server image on all your servers and the same windows desktop image on all your desktops all your users require specialized software that needs admin rights that sucks that why things like xenapp and thinapp exist although they cost money and not every business is willing to pay the vast majority of software does not require admin rights ,3,IAmA

mammaryglands,i looked at your link and it does not say much about this specific topic this is easy enough to prove if you care 1 set up an demo esx server 2 configure ntp on esx server to point to external server 3 create new vm make a new domain controller on new domain 4 join your esx server to your new domian 5 change the time on the domain controller 6 watch esx time change 7 optional turn on ntpd logging and watch the log file you will see it periodically go out and correct the time but every time it does it esx will retake the incorrect time from the pdc emulator i learned this the very hard way working a gig for a credit card processing company it was absolutely essential their esx environments on both sides of the country were in sync down to the millisecond they were having problems with time syncs being off slightly when doing credit card processing they might have thousands of transactions a minute so down to the millisecond time stamping is essential to make everything match up by the way after re reading the article this is what you do if you are using a windows domain controller as your ntp server that not the case here this article is telling you an esx host wo not accept ntp replies from an dc because an unsynced windows server chooses a 10 second dispersion and adds to the dispersion on each poll interval that it remains in sync an esx esxi host by default dos not accept any ntp reply with a root dispersion greater than 1 5 seconds this article says nothing about using time sync other than ntp ie joining the domain ,1,vmware
mammaryglands,no as long as the new pdc is getting its time from a trusted source everything is going to sync with that if you check the box to keep the vm synced with its host in vmware tools it automatically resets the vm time every sixty seconds by default but since the host and vm are both getting time from the pdc emulator that checkbox will essentially have no effect it also a good idea to configure your esx hosts to use ntp because as a backup time source it will be useful should your pdc go down ,2,vmware
mammaryglands,it not an issue it just the way it works esx will get its time from the pdc emulator as a domain member just like every other domain member google it yourself i am not going to do it for you ,2,vmware
mammaryglands,so it sounds like what was happening was the old pdc vm was probably getting its time from the host which was getting its time from the old pdc that the nasty loop i was referring to you can do that but the vm has to get its time from an external source like your new pdc does glad you got it fixed titty sprinkles ,2,vmware
mammaryglands,if joined to a domain an esx host will automatically get its time from the pdc emulator of your domain it does not matter if you also have ntp configured the ntp time sync is the secondary time source and the primary time source will be your pdc emulator this can get messy if your pdc emulator happens to be a vm therefore if your esx hosts are joined to the domain you must figure out which domain controller is the pdc emulator from active directory users and computers set the pdc emulator to sync to a trusted time source nist gov etc this is done via windows 2008 2003 registry settings or through the control panel depending on the version if your esx host is not joined to the domain it will use ntp as the primary time sync in this scenario you should use either your pdc emulator as the time source in ntp settings or use an external trusted time source nist gov or use both if you have set the ntp to point to a non pdc emulator domain controller you are pointing it to a source that is getting its own time from the pdc emulator you should cut that other domain controller out of the loop sources my brain and 9 years of working with vmware ,2,vmware

mammaryglands,i have no idea what your first sentence means and i am sure you do not either why would you compare a government agency to private companies let try this again the usps has to pre fund all future pensions no other government agency is required to do this neither is any private company someone created this rule to create the illusion that the usps would fail probably someone who wealthy friends wanted to buy up public assets at pennies on the dollar so if you look at this government agency the same way you look at every other government agency then they are doing just fine if you use the separately created rule designed to make them look worse then they look worse ,1,AskReddit

mammaryglands,not sure where you are but if you are still facing the same problem it sounds to me like it is just taking forever to commit the changes as someone else mentioned 400 gb of snapshots will take forever to commit if you ssh to the server cd to where your snapshot files are and do an ls alh whats the timestamp on your parent vmdk if the parent timestamp is current it means it being written to by the commit process if it old it means it is not ,1,vmware
mammaryglands,cannot know for sure other than by measuring the disk activity for each logical volume then distributing those associated vmdk across your luns as equally as possible impossible for me to say if it will be sufficient or not without knowing what types of disks array luns storage attachment and i o throughput required etc best way to find out is to try ,2,vmware
mammaryglands,a new vmdk or multiple new vmdk on a separate lun s that exist on a separate array is your best bet a different lun that is carved from the same array as other lun is not going to help as much ,2,vmware
