CrimsonCape, ultimately i am not willing to trade any liberty for any amount of security i can sympathize it just not clear in my mind why extend those protections and liberties to non citizen immigrants some of which do not even want to become a citizen the muslim ban is blocked under the auspices that it was a religious test but on a general level it only would have affected non citizens the judge complainant believes that because his mother in law currently in syria might have lost her immigrant visa it would have caused him irreparable harm i do not buy that she not a refugee she will have gotten a plane ticket to and from syria if i were conspiratorial i would think this judge ruling was a line in the sand allowing us to broach the sunbject of other non citizens namely illegal immigrants ,0,PoliticalDiscussion
CrimsonCape, how do you view the muslim ban if i were to hold the view that i hate muslims they should all return to a muslim country p s it is not my view that would still be constitutionally protected free speech i would like some event legal case that gives proof that we all agree on the constitutionality of the above but frankly i am losing faith that we would agree on that not on account of the conservative side so before it ever about muslims it about us first that kinda my pretense of the muslim ban subject we can identify a group like isis that openly and freely hates americans and wants to kill americans but they happen to be combatants who do not identify as combatants they blend into the population and hide among innocent people i pitch the question to you how do you distinguish between a person who looks innocent and a person who looks innocent promptly before killing somebody in my opinion this is a specific combative strategy which is targeting a fundamental weakness in the constitution it just so happens that the weakness is actually innocence in the sense that a terrorist number one weapon is the presumption of innocence before committing the act if this was a castle defense and you acknowledge the weak part in your wall ie terrorists use innocence against us you really have two choices fix the weakness or do not fix it and face the consequences does a muslim ban fix it probably not but like i just pointed out your options are 1 remove the ability of a terrorist to use innocence as a camouflage or 2 do not try do not worry about terrorists they really are innocent and conveniently ignore judicial system concepts like mens rea modus operandi etc when was the last time a liberal or republican vocalized a way to defeat terrorism that had us all like huh that might work in my opinion they mostly stopped seeing terrorism as a problem tldr how do you distinguish between a person who looks innocent and a person who looks innocent promptly before killing somebody ,-1,PoliticalDiscussion

CrimsonCape,if you read the article there is no such metric in the judge order the test is whether the order causes irreparable harm to a defendant enough to warrant a winnable lawsuit that entirely different than religious discrimination watson agreed with the state on virtually all the points he ruled that the state had preliminarily demonstrated its universities and tourism industry would be hurt and that harm could be traced to the executive order he wrote that elshikh had alleged direct concrete injuries to both himself and his immediate family in fact even if trump said i am doing this because i do not like muslims i hate em the court cannot violate his first amendment rights surprising is not it that you can still legally say i hate muslims the court still has to prove that the order would cause irreparable harm in this case to a man named ismail elshikh the article continues with the other defendants the ban will hurt the ability of state businesses and universities to recruit top talent and damage the state s robust tourism industry these are the meat and potatoes of what conservatives want to see judgement on since in essence the same corporation that would fight h1b restriction is essentially going to jump in on this case too see the tourism and university part ,2,PoliticalDiscussion

CrimsonCape,there a difference between making a new class and a new class file but visual studio kinda does not explain that just think of a class as the public class hat text that you write in a cs file class is code cs file is a computer file and class file is kinda bad terminology you will realize that in a cs file you can put classes static classes namespaces delegates enums interfaces and more you can make a new file whenever you want although rule of thumb is one cs file per each class that you write it also important to understand the difference between class property and method you would make a hat class with a size property of type double or decimal and a returnsizeininches method the class is the object the size is some characteristic of the object and the method is some processing that you ask the computer to calculate or run because net or the c language has many classes for you to use both for working with data and displaying data in a gui you would create a class typically for your own personal program model that could be a gameworld class a vehicle class or so on eventually you will understand that your programs need a separation of concern so that your truck class does not include information like screenresolution nor does your gameworld class contain screenresolution whereas your gameworld class and truck class are model classes screenresolution is related to the gui which you will see belongs elsewhere in a class for displaying your world tl dr some specific info about creating classes and determining their concerns ,1,csharp

CrimsonCape,in every city there are dozens of unique local homebrew restaurants and food trucks etc that take all the credibility for being good food i would argue that these local restaurants can earn a price premium due to their reputation even further than that in select cities exists the hipsterish phenomenon of craft eateries and gastropubs and handmade foods all of which command an even greater reputation and price premium having said that we have not even touched the quality of both the ingredients nor the cooked meal which is a separate layer of complexity as some restaurants thrive on image that props up poor quality while some have excellent quality that suffer from problems like remote location or poor architecture and sadly for the automation destiny false prophets robots will not affect any of that implementing robots will likely turn away people in principle as they would rather support local implementing robots will likely not change the hamburger patties to suddenly be 1 2 pound grass fed beef on organic bread the automation destiny crowd like yourself has yet to address the reality that people will likely avoid the robots in principle edit to add companies that can afford to pursue automation are corporations that are so big and the food so blandly similar that they live and die by brand image that affects them nationally i would love to see the brand image they craft to encourage how good the robots are for us the customers ,1,Futurology

CrimsonCape,i do not think enough people realize the distinction that the justices control the fate of individual court cases and it the justice system that immediately interprets the application toward other cases some of which it would be a fallacy and incorrect application in this case comey said that the precedent was not there to prosecute h for gross negligence since they could only find one person in history who was brought in for that at the same time he proclaimed the exceptionally rare circumstances for this case in my opinion comey put too much weight into requiring precedence in essence now we have proof of a crime the classified docs on the server which they admitted to we need mens rea proof of the criminal mentality the only possible case being hillary wanted the convenience of a homebrew server imho convenience should equal gross negligence you could easily prove she wanted the server for her own convenience the extraordinary circumstances here are proving there is no current way to deal with convenience as a defense now it should be apparent that you could claim convenience in any manner of cases ie you incidentally committed a felony because you needed something else to be made convenient and use the same justification as hillary ,5,The_Donald
CrimsonCape,i have done both solo hunting in wma and group hunting in a club i would not suggest the wma route here are the two best ins i can suggest as a hunter hunting clubs revolve around dues to pay camp bills leases operating costs maintenance etc if you have friends in a club your best bet is to offer to be a due paying member at the very least that will show them that you are serious about your interest and they can save some money more people to share the cost of the dues and no sweat if you want to quit as dues are periodical your second in is to teach yourself some good recipes with game i took some of my neighbor rabbits and made some damn good grilled rabbit calvados and other hunters do not even need a bite they hear secondhand and they throw meat my way hunters want to eat what they kill and you would not be surprised to learn a lot of hunters are older and lazier people who can turn a hunt into a meal are highly prized cultivating this talent would possibly make you a sweet deal for a club to invite you ,1,AskReddit
CrimsonCape,do you blame hunter gatherers for not hunting gathering when they can go to mcdonalds you could call them really lazy that they choose to get easy food instead of getting difficult food but if they started hunting gathering again you would laugh at them for not getting their food like everyone else do you see what i am getting at participation in hunting gathering has simply been antiquated you could do it as a tradition or as a hobby but the activity is no longer necessary this is essentially the problem all activities face ,1,worldnews
CrimsonCape,carrying bags that resemble purses i am convinced this practice was hijacked from men by women at some point in history it is one of those things that women project they find men with big burly leather bags full of tools attractive so they start doing it and then men go ew and stop i had no idea it would be so useful to have a notebook a screwdriver crescent wrench and a place to put pocket stuff and packages and a place to put my carry anyway most men get by with messenger bag style i hated how straps and buckles are constantly hanging off of them and said fuck it ,3,AskReddit
CrimsonCape, song dongzhe a third mainland investor from the north eastern city of dalian bought his first british property a three bedroomed house in selly oak south west birmingham in 2012 for 125 000 earlier this year he bought two more pittar believes the story of ordinary middle class investors is more significant than that of china s globe trotting ferrari driving elite what we read in the newspapers is always about the very wealthy chinese who come and buy a 5m 10m 15m property but the middle class is key how big is the middle class it could be 120 million we tend to think it s probably closer to 150 million once they ve got somewhere to live in china the reality is that the domestic market is quite expensive so that s why they are looking more for international opportunities like anyone who wants to preserve their wealth diversification is important one veteran hong kong investor with a portfolio that includes properties in london manchester and liverpool explains you buy a large number of properties but lower priced ones you pay something like 200 000 or 250 000 rather than 1m for zone one in mayfair places like that this article is fairly unbiased but if you are a middle class american you should realize that there are lots of chinese investors ready to buy property that would otherwise be affordable to the middle class ,1,The_Donald

CrimsonCape, hauled all over the world to answer to world courts this is the problem globalists like obama have with this law we are giving ourselves a unfair advantage we can sue you go ahead and try and sue us it unfair but it also unfair that a saudi can come and buy real estate that you or i might have been able to buy if things were different nbsp if your fellow americans in a jury determine that saudi arabians have some involvement in the deaths of innocent americans the best most impartial legal system on earth ours has arrived at that conclusion do you not respect the legitimacy of our legal system nbsp i do not see this law suddenly bending the rights of americans to a kangaroo court third world standard if anything foreign legal systems will probably get a healthy dose of manning up to our standards if they attempt to reciprocate ,0,The_Donald
CrimsonCape,you should be prepared in the diy mindset to handle mechanical issues yourself fundamentally that should precede your decision to buy an industrial machine this would include researching available parts online understanding what the parts do and having a minimum set of tools to maintain the machine older machines you pretty much just need a variety of screwdrivers and wrenches there are two directions i would suggest taking 1 if you are going to bring production up to the facebook business level ie making items to have a product line you would best be served 1 buying a machine 5 years old if you are willing to learn everything about it or 2 buying a new machine and having a relationship with a service center 2 if you are going to stay in hobbyist quantities one item every now and then you should get a well taken care of machine made in the late 50s to mid 70s these machines were mechanically designed for self service if you buy that juki the minute you use a triple feed or needle feed machine you will kick yourself simple test lay two pieces of sil on a desk use your finger push down on both layers and drag your finger across the desk this is pretty much how a straight stitch will handle sil the feed dog will not bite both layers and they will slip wacky now pinch both layers between your fingers and pull the material across the desk this is how the walking foot above pinches against the feed dog underneath and drags the fabric sandwiched together night and day ,1,myog

CrimsonCape,this sooooo much why in the world is everybody demanding immunity in this case yet supposedly nothing illegal happened sure does seem like it and why the fcuk they can plead the 5th and have immunity is not the point of immunity allowing you to not need to plead the 5th all this makes no sense ,51,The_Donald
CrimsonCape,what exactly is colin kaepernick narrative for protesting i cannot say he makes any more sense than his naysayers the image of black people being shot by whites is really evocative and polarizing but he does not seem to have an opinion beyond the baseline emotional reaction does he have a problem with people being trigger happy does he have a problem with drug laws does he have a problem with the concept of civic patrol a problem with criminal prosecution police preponderance of evidence more training less cops what he is essentially like a child who whines that their bologna sandwich is stolen at lunchtime if we acknowledge the problem is the bully who stole the sandwich or the people who sat by while the sandwich was stolen that is sensible ,-8,AskReddit

CrimsonCape,found some juicy information from this government document https assets documentcloud org documents 2842429 esp 16 03 final pdf in march 2009 after unsuccessful efforts to supply secretary clinton with a secure government smartphone ds was informed that secretary clinton s staff had been asking to use blackberry devices inside classified areas the assistant secretary of ds then sent a classified memorandum to secretary clinton s chief of staff that described the vulnerabilities associated with the use of blackberry devices and also noted the prohibition on the use of blackberry devices in sensitive areas according to a ds official shortly after the memorandum was delivered secretary clinton approached the assistant secretary and told him she gets it remember those blackberries smashed with a hammer coincidence heres the big one in november 2010 secretary clinton and her deputy chief of staff for operations discussed the fact that secretary clinton s emails to department employees were not being received the deputy chief of staff emailed the secretary that we should talk about putting you on state email or releasing your email address to the department so you are not going to spam in response the secretary wrote let s get separate address or device but i don t want any risk of the personal being accessible so hillary was perfectly cooperative turning over the yoga emails but that contradicts what she said herself in the above quote does not it what risk was there in her personal being accessible it obvious something happened between 2010 and the day she released that made her not worry ie deleting the risky ones ,1,The_Donald
CrimsonCape, votebuilder as title sounds so devious i can picture a hypothetical explanation of what a votebuilder software does well you see you might have cast a republican vote but we apply an algorithm that applies a complex metric to determine if average income economic outlook geographic considerations or demographics might play a factor in the vote you cast if your vote deviates significantly from the metric bounds your vote is either dropped or a logic is applied that smoothes the curves and refactors the outcome writing corporate doublespeak is so fun ,2,The_Donald

CrimsonCape,i feel like you are trying to squeeze this into the frame of republican versus democrat i am squirting out of that frame and out of this thread like a wet bar of soap just remember in november that trump was supposedly a secret plant by the democratic party for months he was attacked as being a closet democrat in every debate his talking points were actually all democrat positions and he sounds awfully like bill clinton used to and by then i hope then you will finally understand what you seemingly do not get at the moment ,1,AskReddit
CrimsonCape,your writing and you belief that the republican position defunds and obstructs the government does not give one ounce of consideration to the people paying taxes which funds the government so in that regard you are making the case for trump existence and why he will win much of what used to be the democratic base if you still think this is a partisan issue that yours to think if your objective is to purposely diminish that taxpayer contribution again all yours a more accurate description of what is going on is defunding people from their paycheck and obstructing their ability to put savings in the bank just read around this thread and you will see the case in point except now people with preexisting conditions can get insurance too they will just be defunded along with the rest of the healthy people p s of course none of this mentions people who are purposely gaming the system of which low class is not a life happenstance but a badge on the sleeve the kind of people ready and blessed to cash in on that plan to cure all their maladies before the ink dried i am sure there are plenty of those out there there nothing noble about it ,0,AskReddit
CrimsonCape,op described the back pain as a moderate issue that he can no longer pay for with insurance maybe he is now paying cash out of pocket maybe he stopped treatment altogether the point is that he no longer has insurance as an option for a moderate health issue which in this case might mean he no longer has any treatment period maybe you applaud the aca rolling erosion of the ability to treat moderate issues but like alot of people are finding you still pay the exorbitant bills for something that you cannot even use ,2,AskReddit
CrimsonCape,the aca does not move in the free market direction it moves in the socialized medicine direction this discussion is about how insulin costs continue to rise under the aca the anecdotal evidence is contradicting your belief that we need more of the same to suddenly become good ,0,AskReddit
CrimsonCape,sparrower1 pays a shit ton more and he cannot get treated for his back problems you were not able to get insurance now you can and can get insulin because it helped you you seem willing to accept that someone else has suffered because of the aca now he has to live with back pain that could have been treated you claim that your family is well off yet cannot afford to pay for insulin which is it if it were life or death would not you spend whatever it takes to survive maybe the cost of insulin rises because now insulin is being offered to everyone else who joined the aca market and can get it covered point being you will not avoid the reality that price will always set by the market the elephant in the room that is raising the cost of insulin is thirty years of socialization of medicine ,11,AskReddit
