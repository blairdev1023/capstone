SpecOpsAlpha, the question as to whether or not the 21 foot rule is an applicable defense in an officer involved shooting actually depends upon the facts and evidence of every unique and rapidly evolving deadly force encounter in some circumstances shooting at similar distances with far more experienced competent and better equipped officers within an environment with physical obstructions such as a police vehicle might be inappropriate whereas with inexperienced officers wearing a difficult holster system and no obstructions within distances greater than 21 feet might be justified http lawofficer com exclusive 21footrule ,2,news
SpecOpsAlpha,so much wrong with what you wrote 1 weapons in car has nothing to do with this case why did you pull that up 2 police do not use sirens in house calls 3 people inside a house with curtains drawn probably cannot see flashing lights outside do you leave your curtains open at 11 pm 4 as a car speeds toward you do you start firing at the car or do you say hmmm let me wait a few seconds and take aim at a moving vehicle coming toward me so that i hit only the driver and not any passengers you would empty your clip into that car and so would anyone waiting for your measured response ,1,news
