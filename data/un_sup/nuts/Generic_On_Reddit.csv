Generic_On_Reddit, for starters how else should the follow statement be taken predictions of fishless oceans by 2050 because of overfishing you take the statement within the context of the discussion at hand sustainable food sources and the effects of overfishing on ocean ecosystems in which case fishless oceans can very easily mean oceans in which there are no easily perceivable fish no fish that can be reasonably seen touched felt or eaten i likened it to the word flawless or harmless in a nearby comment flawless does not mean there are no flaws anywhere put anything under a microscope and there will be flaws but to the eye or to the touch there might not be any flaws from the air you may see no fish in the ocean take a dip there will still be no fish sure if you break out the scuba gear to go to the deepest depths there may be some fish but that fish sure as hell is not relevant to our discussion because it is not a sustainable food source i mention accessibility because it an important factor of sustainability in sustainability of resources resources we cannot access are not relevant fish we cannot fish for can understandably be excluded from the scope of discussion ,6,vegan
Generic_On_Reddit,i do not think understanding context is going out of your way if you cannot understand that words are meant to be understood within the context of discussion and its relative scope then a lot of words are going to be meaningless to you can a diamond or anything be flawless of course not everything has flaws if you go down to a small enough level if you cannot see the flaws touch it if you cannot feel the flaws get out the microscope how about harmless is heroin harmless obviously not but what about apples like any acidic food eating too many of them without rinsing your mouth of the acid can wear down the enamel on your teeth faster than you want it to is that a harm yes but in the context of what most consider legitimate and immediate harms apples are still harmless or when people describe a place as lifeless most times that word is used there is almost assuredly life there in the form of microorganisms or even just insects that do not give us that warm fuzzy feeling of life bacteria is there constituting life but that does not mean the word is only reserved for space the context such as what the user of the word thinks of as life changes the word inconsequential is any action truly without consequence i doubt it every action has an effect a consequence of some kind no matter how small i could go on and on and on but i am sure we could find hundreds of words that should practically never be used if you are going to ignore context and effective scope just as the consequence of an action may be so small that it can not be touched seen felt heard etc to the point that it is imperceivable in every way and effectively inconsequential an ocean can have so few fish relative to our current bountifulness that they cannot be seen felt eaten or otherwise perceived earning the title of fishless if you wanna continue this linguistic pedantry be my guest but as i said if you have an issue with his usage of fishless you are going to have qualms with quite a lot of words you might as well just cross any word with less as a suffix from your handy pocket dictionary because they will rarely mean what you want them to mean ,7,vegan

Generic_On_Reddit,in a discussion about fishing when the fisherman nets start coming back empty do you think it they will be placated by there still fish you just cannot get to them overfishing is the issue and it discussed in relation to our dependence on a finite resource the idea that there always more fish in the sea non figuratively in response to overfishing is woefully misguided context matters the comment he replied to was about sustainability it does not matter how many fish are in a part of the ocean we cannot get to in a discussion on sustainable eating what matters is what can be put on your plate yes it egocentric but so is survival and we would not be discussing sustenance if we were not trying to survive ,7,vegan

Generic_On_Reddit,right but saying fishless oceans is not possible is missing the point it like the people that say you cannot kill the earth in response to save the earth it not the earth that fucked it the people that are fucked and that why people are concerned the technicality is noted but not relevant an ocean with fish we cannot catch and eat might as well not have any fish in it it effectively the same as fishless ,7,vegan
Generic_On_Reddit,i have not checked the estimate u ch4ws is referring to but i feel like you are taking the statement a bit too literally for starters gt 95 of the ocean is unexplored yes a ton of the ocean is unexplored mostly because it fairly inaccessible if we deplete the fish in the 5 of the ocean we do access to the life in the 95 is not just going to just fill in the fill in the gap it means our fish is gone more or less as for over fishing nets in general do not go to the ocean floor in all parts of the ocean yes and making our nets sweep the ocean floor is not feasible fish will adapt and swim at lower depths they will evolve over time to be smaller and faster you overestimate the speed and efficiency of evolution and you underestimate our ability to catch smaller faster fish we can adapt our hunting methods far faster than they can adapt their attributes habitat the people making these predictions probably do not have a mathematical background and incorrectly modeled predator prey population differentials the people making the predictions probably know that fish in the unexplored depths of the ocean are inaccessible to us they also know that the fish that we are depleting will likely have effects on other oceanic ecosystems you are making the argument that there will still be fish to in the ocean that likely true but that does not mean it fish we can get to 400 years ago i bet there was a guy saying we cannot possibly hunt the dodo bird to extinction do you see all these islands that we have not even explored of course there more out there and even if we do there will always be more birds i am not even a conservationist or vegan or anything i am just here from r all but you are trying to math away a problem that cannot be mathed and it makes you look r iamverysmart to be honest if we kill all life on earth the rest of the universe has infinite potential for enough life for food to sustain the human race but what the fuck does that do for us in all your math you have not at all taken accessibility into account ,108,vegan

Generic_On_Reddit,so you just wanted him to give a stupid answer so you could ridicule him then your comment is exactly what you were seemingly accusing him of doing there were many things people saw in trump they saw him being anti establishment they saw him as populist protecting the working class they saw him as someone that would drain the swamp of washington and take on wall street they thought he would be serious and more presidential once he became president instead of what we saw on the campaign trail they saw him as relaxed and libertarian compared to republicans on drugs and gays as well as more secular with policy they saw him as isolationist i could go on but the point is that people saw lots of qualities in trump many of these qualities appear to be outright false lean in the opposite direction now or may be less accurate than hoped factors have changed with performance and when factors change support and reasons for supporting changes the reasons for supporting obama on the campaign trail were not necessarily the reasons for supporting him in his presidency they rarely align it arrogant to assume things wo not change over time even if it simple as prioritizing the issues differently people still discuss capitalism and socialism as concepts despite them being old as dirt at this point viewpoints can change over time with evidence actions and results ,4,reactiongifs
Generic_On_Reddit, i would believe this if everytime somebody tried explaining how they felt about those issues the people who are anti trump did not shout them down and call them names what you personally see has no effect on whether u dubbuhdubbuh is genuine or not in wanting to know like the whole coal miners thing those people supported him because he said he supported them but whenever it comes up it met with those fucking idiots are so stupid coal is not coming back god fucking morons wanting to know a person reason does not mean discussion of on the validity of said reason cannot occur i am not one to ridicule personally i understand your point in what you saw when coal was often discussed but i also understand how the other side is frustrated with groups that we have tried to help that do not want to change when change is coming i can want trump to be president because i want him to place a permanent rainbow that reaches from the white house to the golden gate bridge i am perfectly entitled to that reason and no one else has any say in that but me but that does not mean my reason for supporting him is not impossible or above ridicule hard to talk when people are constantly accusing you of being this ist and that ist or saying you must be stupid sure that valid it definitely makes it harder to engage when some make engaging unpleasant but that what comes with having fringe viewpoints you get fringe responses it can be hard to put up with but removing yourself from discussion does not make things better it just means those that need to understand you the most will not hear your voice and the most enthusiastic and extreme members of your movement often the ists of some kind for every group will represent your entire ideology which you do not want more than anything at the end of the day it really hard to get reasonable opinions from trump supporters that are based on more than faith they are entitled to have whatever stance they please of course but political beliefs that boil down to faith or blind ideology do not make good discussion and they do not inspire confidence i am not a trump supporter but i am also not easily enraged or pessimistic i just want reasons to believe ie the evidence to support the idea that he might be on the right track ,11,reactiongifs
Generic_On_Reddit,maybe they want to understand what positive attributes qualities or stances they see in the president in order to have a broader perspective on how some americans may feel about certain issues and thus the current administration performance instead of relying solely on the perspective of anti trump echochambers i mean is not that why you just asked why they want to know in order to understand why people do things or did you just want him to give a stupid answer so you can ridicule them ,75,reactiongifs

Generic_On_Reddit,yo i am sure just about everything i will say has been said at this point but if you want that extra vote of confidence i also hate beans i hate the texture and do not generally like anything bean like with that texture i even avoid chili and most mexican food because it will have beans nine times out of ten lentils are definitely a recommendation i do not love them but they are as close to beans as i will willingly eat they can be seasoned easy enough and the texture is not that bad i also just made some roasted chickpeas for the first time a few minutes ago when crunchy they do not have much of the bean texture they can be used as a snack a side for a meal or i have read as a substitute for croutons in a salad i am wondering if for say soups i could blend the beans up first and add them to the soup to cook potentially but from my perspective the texture of beans are rather dominant if you are going to do this i recommend mixing it with something else that is also think so the beans are not the only thing giving the soup texture so i want to incorporate beans into my family diet for more protein and fiber if this is your aim i recommend trying quinoa different types of pasta which often have excellent protein numbers maybe supplementing other dishes with things like ground flax seed or chia seed ,3,EatCheapAndHealthy

Generic_On_Reddit, they dont have a reliable play starter yet also at u coooturtle i am using an invoker engine to start plays use trade in lightray grepher twin twisters etc to discard a metaphys to the grave normal aleister and fuse for mechaba banishing both materials it as consistent as opening with terraforming the invoker field spell or aleister for the most part and it buys time for the slow mechanic to get started also lightray grepher can start the deck solo provided you have the fodder to use the effect but the effects are still so slow that sitting on grepher is asking to die before any of those effects matter ,0,yugioh
Generic_On_Reddit,i agree firstly they are a rather unique gimmick so not much helps them out and they do not really mix well with much when they were leaked people were talking about mixing with lightrays but these cards really do not like to be in the grave they do nothing until they are banished lightrays really like monsters to sit in the grave and they do not help with banishing except for grepher since they gain advantage from banishing and going to the grave does nothing natively that makes most things they could mix with awful sync of xyz with a metaphys that sends them to the grave where they will sit forever same for fusing discarding etc i ended up using an invoker engine because that the only thing that had any synergy and came with its own form of consistency which still is not great dump metaphys monsters in the grave using costs such as trade in or lightray grepher then banish them from graveyard to fuse for invoked mechaba that gets things started reasonably well but it still rather slow powerful and sometimes devastating but incredibly slow it works best when you chain banish after banish turn after turn but that only good if you can slow the game down enough for everything to pay off if you did not have to wait until the next standby phase these might be playable but unless someone else knows a way to start their banish chain while slowing the game down i cannot imagine the cards they would have to make to make this deck good on its own even their primary searcher only happens in the next standby phase i love the theme in both mechanics and style but the mechanic is way too restricted slow to actually work ,5,yugioh

Generic_On_Reddit,i agree completely but at that point she still often overshadowed by kogami and other characters plotlines in more ways than one and while it been a while i do not think the character she grown into really had any effect on the plot at that point either while she had developed i do not think her development had really effected the plot yet beyond being a generic but good detective also she often leaned on kogami and other experience too much which she did have since she was new but that did not lend to get independence contrast this with season 2 where many of her defining features are focused on and often plotlines multiple plotlines regarding her clear hue her driving motivation to change sybil for the better her understanding and unorthodox compassion while present in season 1 have more effect with her in charge etc this is not too say she did not matter at all in season 1 as she did and she certainly had moments but she was not nearly as critical and independent when compared to the second season in season 1 she develops but in season 2 she develops and the plots are heavily invested in that development ,1,anime

Generic_On_Reddit, my argument was that the feminist groups will always be in opposition to the men rights groups why would these groups oppose each other and why and you do not need to delegitimize one groups issues in order to bring awareness to yours where do you see this happening and what do you think is the cause i think if you refuse to accept woman struggles in society or men struggles in society as both struggles of society that should both receive attention then you are part of the problem focusing on a specific problems does not mean other problems do not deserve attention honing in on specific issues is how we solve problems there a reason the organization dedicated to ending world hunger disease war poverty and injustice does not exist it too broad it tries to cover too many bases even if all bases are worth covering you will find organizations dedicated to fighting hunger or diseases or reducing poverty etc but very rarely will you find one organization to tackle every problem the world food programme existing does not mean africa against malaria is not worthy of attention my point is that this is how we as humans think about and solve our problems we break our problems up into components or departments and attack them individually you will see this form of organization absolutely everywhere the only exception to this being when the solution is broad and uniform the demands of the civil rights movement could be met by legislation requiring people of all colors be treated equal every group involved gets what they want have the exact same goal with the exact same solution the same cannot be said for most other problems most feminist groups want control over abortion while most mens rights groups want modernized alimony and child support laws these are two completely different goals with different solutions different people that understand the issue unrelated in basically every way that you have to work towards in different ways thus you really have to work towards them separately and there are dozens of issues like this on both sides ,19,changemyview

Generic_On_Reddit,if she does not check both shoe sizes that also a form of loss not unlike theft if you check a box of shoes and they have two different sizes like what does that mean well it obviously means that box has two different shoes in it but it also means at least one other box has two different shoes in it if you did not catch either mistake both shoes would be bought with incorrect sizes and both are very likely to be returned for the same reason once it realized but since they are different sizes you cannot sell them again so unless both mismatched boxes are returned at the exact same time they are likely to be damaged out instead of waiting around to see if the other comes back so someone might as well have stolen two or more pairs of shoes ,42,whatisthisthing

Generic_On_Reddit, money also is not an issue since expecially cheap devices have huge batteries those devices often are not very thin light ergonomic etc the financial issue in packing more battery into a phone is that it takes engineering to use the space efficiently without making the phone thicker compromising its form factor in other ways or running into logistical issues like heat distribution or allowing your phone to explode inside of pockets you are constructing an either or decision that actually does not margins are a real thing and there a reason every phone comes with compromises it may seem like any individual component does not cost much but they have not more costs than what is on the surface there a cost to everything and this is especially true with oneplus who is constructing a phone that competes with phones that cost 50 more if the either or did not exist every phone would have huge batteries 8 gigs of ram and all of the other bells and whistles ,12,Android

Generic_On_Reddit,greetings i have had minimal experience with pinterest but i did make an account and browse around specifically to address this question more effectively and be able to draw comparisons i did not do so to develop an authoritative knowledge base of pinterest so do not feel like i am speaking in absolute terms when referring to it and feel free to correct some of my ideas on it i did so only to draw comparisons as others have stated i we cannot argue your preferences it wholly possible pinterest is better for you but i will address each of your points from my perspective and explain why they are positives for me we might have different values so if you can see the positive i am explaining but just do not care about it feel free to say so the information i want is selected according to broad categories of interests rather than single keywords that are more decided by other users than by myself i do not have to go hunting for obscure subreddits to find things relevant or interesting to me because the content i see is more determined by a natural language algorithm than by the transient wishes of individual users expressed by upvotes this type of conduct can also be found on reddit but i hate subs like that for the same reason i dislike places like pinterest tumblr yes they are broad categories and thus easier to find and curate however in my experience that also means they are not specific enough to meet my needs for example i started cooking heavily sometime last year where do i go to get food ideas well naturally i subscribe to r food but i soon find out that r food is too broad it has food that people cooked but also food that people had at restaurants or just saw in a cooking video most of which was far above my skill level to attempt the next logical step is r cooking which is better it has cooking from several skill levels and ranges of price broad while meeting my needs sometimes in my current level but does not hit all the bases i eventually settle in r eatcheapandhealthy which is focused on simpler meals that use cheaper and healthier components and due to the culture of the sub it also tends to be quicker meals as well as well as meals you can easily cook in bulk because people looking for cheap and healthy meals tend to lack time as well conversely i am just not seeing anything on pinterest that would consistently hit all of the boxes i want the way r cooking and r eatcheapandhealthy does i did the 2 or 3 clicks at signup and selected healthy eating as one of my options to see what it would give me one of the first posts to pop up from that was this https s media cache ak0 pinimg com 564x be ed da beedda174aeb4c92f23897ee763b53be jpg which has got to be one of the worst food posts i have ever seen something so basic and effortless as here 15 different combinations of a protein carb and vegetable would never make it to reddit this is not say that pinterest does not have a board topic to fill the need i was looking for i did 10 more clicks and made it to fast recipes which is closer to what i wanted but in your post you also say this customizing my preferences for what i see and do not see is far easier than reddit on average it takes me two three clicks to build a board of things i think are interesting on reddit it takes me dozens of clicks after hunting for subreddits that are largely invisible to me unless they are popular enough to make it to the front page which is never good because what is popular on reddit is by definition that which is appealing to the human dumpster fire that is its user base i am already a couple dozen clicks in to finding something for a single need and i am unsuccessful and what is worse is that the topics are so general that i have no idea whatsoever if something is going to match what i need it for unless i browse through it extensively r eatcheapandhealthy is a specific name but it also has a sidebar that tells me if i am in the right place and reading the comments the users that frequent the sub tells me what the culture is like there and it tells me what they are looking for if i look at the comments and agree with them i am in the right place cannot say the same for pinterest feels like much more of a tossup i can see news articles and infographics that i like without having to wade through the sea of garbage that is reddit most common opinions net neutrality good feminism bad racism funny amy schumer fat we get it you really do not have to even know reddit opinions if you are just coming for news articles infographics etc r news does have more news that is relevant to reddit base but the same could be said about any website every website has it bias to some degree there is too much news on every topic in every country to see it all there will always be bias you do not have to go to the comments of news articles and i cannot imagine seeing reddit opinions like that without doing so overall reddit is becoming a microphone for genuinely horrible people i do not have to read anybody dogshit opinions editorialized article titles it really depends on where you go and what you are referring to who are the genuinely horrible people vomit inducing recurring inside jokes or whatever other trash the average reddit user thinks is funny or insightful this comes too far down on the side of personal preference to really weigh in on especially when we do not know what you are referring to specifically i subscribed to pinterest memes and find the first one in my feed to be particularly awful https s media cache ak0 pinimg com 564x 30 e0 f4 30e0f468993bed768c4ea9bda8a3ea94 jpg the average pinterest user appears to have a job and a normal social life the average reddit user is either an insanely neurotic poor person or a self righteous snarky teenager with more opinions than brains the average pinterest user does not even show up on the radar because the pinterest user does not get to interpose their opinions between me and the content i want even in the form of editorialized titles well this again depends on where you go on reddit subreddits with more direction stricter moderation and thus higher barriers to entry are going to be way better in terms of their community they are also going to provide more value and information in the comments but also if you do not enjoy the community you do not have to look at it there are places i enjoy the content of but do not particularly care about the community i check out r animedubs in case something i missed came out i will check out r hiphopheads to see if anything new got released but i wo not participate in discussions of an album even if it was my favorite i just do not value the community enough to do so and that fine i do not need to share my opinion and i do not know what the communities opinion is either the layout is infinitely more appealing visually if you are coming for content and not for comments i would agree reddit layout is not good for quickly browsing content however the mobile apps give you a lot more freedom in determining how you want your content so if you generally browse from mobile the layout will be just as good if not better than pinterest for comments or general content both reddit and pinterest have advertising but pinterest advertises individually relevant articles to me reddit advertises for whole websites on the sidebar that appear to have nothing to do with my interests ads became very obvious to me very quickly on pinterest there are several sponsored by posts in my feed once every 6 posts maybe they do not have anything to do with what i want or what i am interested in ads on reddit are so infrequent that i forget they exist from what you have written you do not seem to have a lot of value for the community based system when compared to pinterest content based system to defend the community based system and point out my bigger gripe with sites like tumblr part of the value of having a robust comment section is being able to have deep discussions that means you are able to draw from the perspective the experience and the knowledge of dozens or hundreds of people for what you want to know content is all well and fine but it has its limit in terms of usefulness i am into tech quite a bit so i will watch reviews for phones laptop even if i am not in the market seeing what d2d or mkbhd thinks about a device is cool and useful but at the end of the day it just one person opinion with pinterest focused on content one of their videos might get posted over there but if i am subscribed to tech that not all i want i want to be able to head down to r android and see people discuss the phones they have used phones they have owned i now know their experience as well when i want a recipe i do not just want a recipe i want to see the recipe and i want to see what the users liked about the recipe what they did not like about it and why for both i might see a recipe i like on r cooking but i will also read the comments and probably incorporate some of the ideas substitutions the users there might have come up with i clicked on the anime topic for pinterest it gave many images making recommendations and describing anime i disagreed with many of the suggestion reasons and descriptions in the image on reddit there would be a lot more discussion on the merits of each anime in relation to each other and this would give a much better idea with many more perspectives of what something is i could go on but this comment is exactly at the character limit so it long enough as it is if you would like me to say more feel free to ask but i have a question if you do not care for the reddit community why do you look at comments

Generic_On_Reddit, not really no 19 of us muslims say suicide bombings can somehow be justified how significant is saying that something can be justified to you there is no shortage of americans that say the atomic bombs dropped on japan can be or was justified does that mean we support killing tens of thousands of civilians and would readily push the button at the slightest provocation no that just means giving our predicament and knowledge at the time america actions and decisions followed reasonable logic or perhaps our bombing in the middle east those bombs are for fighting terrorism hopefully but they also come with plenty of civilian casualties which we also cause can we say that those casualties are justified considering our objectives many americans and american politicians believe so but if so does our justification of these casualties mean that we approve of them and want them to happen of course not i hope it just means that considering the predicament and what needs to be done casualties while we prefer them to be avoided are to be expected we give a lot of slack for historical figures having racist or sexist views even if we believe their views to be resoundingly wrong then having those views is often seen as justified and acceptable in the context of their world if we did not do this we would have very few good men of history everyone is fighting for something there is a lot of history in the relationship between the west and the middle east and they do not fight resist us for no reason at all putting yourself in their mindset does not equate to approval of their actions and saying you will do the same justification is based on the perspective reasoning and knowledge of the actor often times the information is wrong leading to condemnable acts or ideas but that does not mean it is unjustified in some manner i can see justification for bombing japan i would not push the button but i see why it was pushed i can say this for way worse atrocities in history none for which i give my approval none of which i would ever replicate ,1,AskTrumpSupporters
Generic_On_Reddit,the ideas and reasoning for minimum age requirements are usually based on different reasoning than the reasons against age discrimination that i just outlined i do not have any doubts that there are plenty of 15 17 year olds that can serve quite well in the military that would pass all the tests and go straight to the front lines in fact the argument can be made that younger teen soldiers are actually going to be better starting earlier allows you more time to develop and grow them into a better soldier younger guys are more mentally malleable and thus can be easier to indoctrinate and educate into the soldier mentality you believe is most useful to you it can be easier to pick up many of the combat skills at younger ages i could go on but not only do i believe that we could say that there are guys below the age minimum that can perform the job but there are probably many that would end up with greater outcomes considering the greater development time so if we are taking my logic into account we should let them get the job because they have the performance right well not necessarily because the reason we have age minimums are not connected to why we are against job discrimination my previous statements my previous paragraph especially was focusing on what is best for the role and its performance age minimums are often based on what is best for the applicant for example younger folk are malleable as i said they are easier to indoctrinate and they can be easier manipulated into certain decisions that why we usually limit how serious a decision they can make to later ages or milestones whether that alcohol credit cards debt driving etc the same goes for the military it can very easily be seen as signing your life away we do not want our most vulnerable population in danger of being manipulated into signing their life away army recruiters are already very involved in high school and even have high school programs to get kids in the pipeline into the armed forces which is not necessarily bad but imagine how it would be if there was no minimum age requirement and they could sign kids up on the spot it allows kids to make dramatic life changing decisions and creates a market for people to manipulate them into those decisions minimum age is very rarely for their performance it usually for their protection most minimum ages having that in common ,2,changemyview

Generic_On_Reddit, ultimately i think the biggest benefit is the simplicity of an egalitarian message equal rights for all people regardless of sex race sexual orientation gender etc well we have this idea of egalitarianism in our constitution with all men being created equal for hundreds of years citizens both read those words with joy and patriotism while also believing that some people were lesser does that strike you as odd to your overall point i think you will notice movements without defined and focused properties and goals fail ask yourself why are not there egalitarian movements well i would give two primary reasons 1 identity and passion every movement needs people to fight for it dedicated soldiers to promote the cause they need people that will continuously and passionately further the message but how do you get people that will do that sure you will have people that believe in the message but these people 1 are not necessarily large in numbers 1 are not necessarily going to be invested enough in the cause to fight diligently so how do you grow that number you connect the movement to an identity so people can identify with it you form a movement around an identity then people see themselves their own struggles as the movement let use feminism to demonstrate feminism is about progressing women rights image perception treatment etc a large number of women can see themselves and their experiences as a full and encompassing definition of the entire feminist movement any woman that has ever been catcalled objectified victimized by rape culture etc can look at the feminist movement and think this movement perfectly applies to me this movement is for me the movement evokes personal connections and is just as much about personal justice a it is about justice for all women egalitarianism does not provoke the same personal feelings there is virtually no one that could personally identify with the entirety of an egalitarian movement they can identify as a piece representing whatever class they are but they will only be a piece they will only feel like a piece and thus wo not feel as strongly they cannot say this is my movement like a woman could about feminism think about how strong and long lasting the feminism movement has been validity aside look at the strength of the blm movement which mobilized tons of people across the us and achieved most of its goals it seems look at the civil rights movement which achieved greater rights for all majority groups but was very much built on the narrative of black oppression in appearance i ask you again why are not there been egalitarian movements 2 problem solving this reason is much shorter but what you are suggesting just is not how humans solve problems we take large problems such as inequality and break them down into more manageable pieces to address you are suggesting working in the opposite direction once you make the egalitarian movement whose problems so you address first men women blacks asians mexicans gays trans whose problem gets dealt with first you cannot address them all simultaneously you do not have the manpower or the political capital scattering your efforts among the categories is slow progress for each individual group and people are not at all excited about slow progress once you have this big group how do you address the problems without breaking them back up there also the sense of branding and marketing which movements need to be great at larger unfocused groups suck ass at this that why brands are usually made specific to the product so it can be specialized if you wanted to make an elevator pitch to sell someone on the feminism movement you would probably sum it up with feminism seeks to promote women rights by closing the wage gap promoting the status and perception of women in the workplace fighting rape culture and domestic abuse how would you do this for egalitarianism egalitarianism weeks to promote equality among all by doing these 10 things for women these five things for men this for minorities overall when answering the question of what a movement actually does the more you do the harder it is to communicate that effectively at the end of the day i think there a reason egalitarianism only sees the light of day in ethics philosophy courses and as a response to other movements ,2,changemyview

Generic_On_Reddit, the ability to absolve yourself if responsibility while the child exists does not exist for anyone creating this why you would be absolving yourself from future responsibilities by getting an abortion or going along with the op men saying they do not want the responsibility of raising a child during pregnancy with abortion you are absolved because the child does not exist there is no way to cleanly absolve yourself of a child that does or will exist assuming the other parent is involved i laid out those examples to exemplify the false equivalency if the child does not exist you as a parent mother or father have no responsibilities to it if the child does exist you as a parent have responsibilities to it there plenty of situations where a single parent raised a child with no help whatsoever from the other parent i understand some feel a moral obligation to help provide for any of their children i have never had a kid but i think i would feel some obligation myself but that does not mean it needs to be law why not there are costs to both the child the mother and society as a whole associated with single parent single income households that could easily be avoided by simply holding people accountable for their actions it not only a moral obligation why are the parents not responsible for the well being of the child because they do not have enough control over their future when is control over future ever proper justification for any denial of responsibility i do not understand how the rationale over denying this responsibility exists without being applicable to a wealth of other matters you are basically always responsible for what you create or oversee whether you do it intentionally or accidentally why should this be different ,3,changemyview
Generic_On_Reddit,what is the purpose of a name in your opinion ,2,changemyview
Generic_On_Reddit, certainly we can see how that purely circular logic you are employing essentially what you are saying is your argument for changing the laws is incorrect because the current law disagrees with you please quote the parts of my comments that can be simplified to this my arguments has no connection to the rights of a fetus whatsoever i did not say a fetus does not have rights because the law says so either i am not saying the rights of the child trump the rights of the parent because the law says so i am saying it is because the parents of a born child are responsible for the well being of that child through the fact that they caused the creation of that child walk me through the circle please ,1,changemyview
Generic_On_Reddit, your whole argument seems to boil down to what is best for the kid is the overriding principle then please explain to me how right to life of the child is ignored a child gains rights upon near birth an abortable fetus does not have those rights ,2,changemyview
Generic_On_Reddit,the same reason men do not have to pay child support if they give the child up for adoption ,11,changemyview
Generic_On_Reddit, i feel like this is semantics it not semantics it nuance that reflects reality i specifically stated in my original comment that women do not have the right to deny their responsibility for the child as long as the child exists if the child is born the woman cannot retract her responsibility because the baby exists you have addressed this however if the child is not born yet but the woman says i deny responsibility for the child while still having the child let say she morally opposed passing off responsibility to the father that father can still have the mother taken to court for child support the only way to get out of responsibility of the child is if it is put up for adoption without being recovered by either parent there is no other way for a parent to completely absolve themselves of responsibility of a born child whether you are the mother or the father there is no way to do it at all if one parent mother or father opts to keep the child because one parent holds the other accountable the ability to absolve yourself if responsibility while the child exists does not exist for anyone creating this why is this important it an important distinction because women have the ability through terminating the pregnancy it is the rights and well being of the child that facilitates the need to hold the father responsibility it is their rights that trumps the right of the parent because the child is considered to be entitled to the support of both parents this right is not contingent on the decisions or wills of the parents do you disagree with any of this yes through bodily autonomy women have the perverse ability to terminate the pregnancy thus having more control over their future than men in this instance is it fair that women have more control perhaps not but they have greater control through a fundamentally different and greater burden but also the law is not interested in what is fair for either parent it is interested in what is best for the child ,7,changemyview
Generic_On_Reddit, inadequate support is a large reason why many women abort rather than attempt and fail to raise their children if a father retracts support a mother could reevaluate her financial ability and choose to abort her child if instead she continues to term it is the same as her accepting sole responsibility for her child what other instances of our legal system allow you to deny responsibility for the effects of your actions simply because you do not want them if abortion is readily available then no children should be born with inadequate support this assumes everyone has the option of abortion some are morally opposed so fathers being able to retract support is not creating unsupported children who he holds responsibility for but empowering fathers to prevent unplanned parenthood just like mothers it not just like mothers because it increases single parent households which have much more problems than two parent households question what stops fathers from retracting their support and being in the child life anyway without having to pay ,17,changemyview
Generic_On_Reddit, ops argument does not consider born children he referring to a fetus that can legally be aborted yes but the issue is that children are born it ignores the difference in outcome between what he proposing and the outcome of abortion abortion absolves the responsibility of having a child whether that is child support or actually raising a kid abortion removes the source of responsibility it different from just denying responsibility that is quite a weak argument and relies on someone being christian it was a joke op is saying we should be able to control the future of our own lives people can control their future but that does not mean the consequences of their actions do not exist ,8,changemyview
Generic_On_Reddit, whether the child is recovered or not the woman who put it there if caught dna test if unsure should be required to pay child support to the state firstly why do you just say the woman should be required to pay child support if you support this idea of paying child support to the state then both the man and the woman should pay the child support to the state should not they you seem to support parental responsibility so i do not see how you can oppose this i support the child being taken care of and believe that the parents are responsible for that if they are able to they must if they are not able to then it falls to the government to pick up the slack but ultimately it about the child being taken care of not the principle of the parent being held responsible the cost is much lower spread out among all people than to one person the same can be said about literally anything it should be largely subsidized not paid 100 by him why why should i have to subsidize his decisions if he perfectly capable of paying for it child support is based on income if he does not have the income to pay for the child i am perfectly fine with my taxes paying to support the child and or his family he will pay what he can and society can spread out the difference but if he does have the income to support the child why should not he pay ,3,changemyview
Generic_On_Reddit,but it still possible to recover a child from a safe haven why do you think the male would not be able to get support welfare state we subsidize the bad choices of women who had a chance to abort and dumped their kids at a safe haven welfare state we refuse to subsidize the same bad choices of men who had no chance to abort so you prefer everybody subsidize the costs of irresponsible father rather than the father himself fathers can use safe haven too by the way ,4,changemyview
Generic_On_Reddit,which is difficult or impossible to do depending on where you are if it is without the consent of the father if the child is recovered by the father the mother can be taken to court for child support ,7,changemyview
Generic_On_Reddit,that not equivalent because the child still exists if that happens the child is not being adequately supported with abortion there is no child to support having sex is accepting responsibility for the outcome which is the child if the woman wills or is cooperative with your will the outcome the child can be dealt with so there is nothing to be responsible for what you are advocating for is absolving yourself of responsibility but that not what abortion does abortion does not absolve anyone of responsibility it removes the source of responsibility if the fetus being aborted happens to survive through being the unborn baby jesus or something that mother is still going to be on the hook for that baby because the source of her responsibility still exists is it fair that women have unilateral control over this when pregnancy happens maybe not is it fair to mothers that do not abort that a father could reneg on supporting a child he helped create probably not is it fair to the child that they are now not getting the support they are supposed to have certainly not is it fair to be on the hook for the results of your actions it certainly is once that child is born your action has an outcome both parents are responsible ,86,changemyview
Generic_On_Reddit,the woman has bodily autonomy if the baby is inside her body she has the will to eject it the woman does not have the way out once the baby is born once the baby is born both parents have the exact same options as far as getting rid of the baby with what you are proposing a child will not have the support they need to thrive with a women getting an abortion there is no child that needs supporting these are two entirely different rights for entirely different reasons with entirely different outcomes ,141,changemyview

Generic_On_Reddit,zaheer always had the greatest impact to me because he seemed to be the most antithetical to what the avatar was the avatar in both aang and korra were meant to be leaders and authorities of the world and many of the people they looked up to were leaders of their own people in some way or another zaheer was against that sense of authority thus against the very purpose that drove our protagonists and the defining attributes and goals of practically every character we have encountered not only did he seem to oppose everything they stood for a valid opposition from his philosophical viewpoint but he did so while being everything the avatar should be smart focused spiritual etc even the gang he had was parallel to the gaang in my eyes he represented so many things and had synergy with so many characters he was everything the avatar could and should be while being diametrically opposed to the very sense of purpose that formed their identity it creates synergy i do not feel as strongly in other villains ,56,TheLastAirbender

Generic_On_Reddit, he said the schools would be overwhelmingly white and have a small amount of asians but more than other races while the opposite is true sure but this is just a small part of what he said but i am looking at the data now of the 20 least impoverished schools which includes the two you mentioned the average percentage of whites is 38 4 while the average asian percentage is 24 4 changing it to 50 least impoverished schools brings asian down to 19 9 and white down to 28 2 the less poverty there is the higher the white and asian population it seems the data suggests he is right exactly right if you took a look at the demographics of any standard local school in the city especially those that are in the outer boroughs or above 125th street the more impoverished parts of the city i would argue that most schools would be less diverse than bronx science or stuyvesant they would probably be 80 or more a single ethnicity that being whichever ethnicity primarily inhabits the neighborhood in question i do not know which schools to check like i said there are 454 high schools so i wo not bother but many of the schools i see that are within the 20 or so most impoverished are just as diverse as the ones you listed averaging at 60 hispanic and 30 black but again this is not very diverse to me go to this site and put in total nyc population and race ethnicity in 2014 the most recent year with data the poverty rate for non hispanic asians is 26 6 higher than blacks at 21 5 percent and hispanics at 24 the number of poor asians grows to around 28 if you just look at children under 18 or families with children under 18 thank you for the source i wish we had more to go on than mere poverty rates since they are not a good indicator on the other side of the spectrum while i do not doubt your source i do not think this means that asians are not still one of the wealthier demographics even of new york as i demonstrated above higher asian population seems to trend with higher wealth in the school data i have linked when isolating for above average asian percentage the poverty rate drops to 70 9 whereas below average asian percentage schools have poverty rates of 81 6 schools with above average hispanic populations have 84 4 poverty while schools with above average black percentage has 79 poverty while not conclusive i know i went through the demographics of 16 of the wealthiest neighborhoods of new york city https en wikipedia org wiki list of new york locations by per capita income most were overwhelmingly white but only one had a black population higher than the asian population hewlett neck most times the asian population would be higher than the hispanic population and anywhere from 2 to 15 times the black population despite being the smaller group between the three they have more representation in these high income neighborhoods than the others again i am not saying the data you linked is wrong but unfortunately neither of us have the full story however the data i do have suggests that asians in new york tend to find themselves in wealthier neighborhoods and the least poor schools if asians are not a wealthy demographic in new york they sure do have the qualities of one ,2,changemyview
Generic_On_Reddit, i do not believe the data supports that in 2016 73 of stuyvesant the most elite high school in the system was asian only 18 was white bronx science my alma mater is 63 asian and only 25 white i would also argue that those breakdowns above are more diverse than the average new york city high school which is more diverse than most schools in the country as they tend to be segregated by neighborhood most students in schools in flushing will be asian most students in schools in washington heights will be hispanic etc while the specialized schools draw students from all over the city to attend i do not see how what you linked disagrees with what he said he said the schools tend to be primarily white and asian the wealthier demographics if anything the links you posted proves him more right because the asian population is extremely over represented despite being a small demographic likely due to the fact that it also america richest demographic the links have a tab that gives the demographic breakdown of all students of new york city as well as the demographics of that specific school city total bronx hs stuyvesant hispanic 40 6 2 5 black 24 2 4 0 63 asian 17 63 73 white 16 25 18 i do not see how this can be considered diverse to you but perhaps we have different standards furthermore asians are one of the poorest ethnic groups in new york city in opposition to the national trend more so than blacks or hispanics in part because they tend to be more recent immigrants do you have a source for this many asian students either get free income based tutoring or their parents who are not disproportionately wealthy will pay for tutoring i disagree vehemently that you argue that the students who can get tutoring for the shsat are rich and or white and i would like to see some data to support that claim from the new york department of education on this page http schools nyc gov accountability data default htm there is a link under demographic snapshots this link leads to an excel document for the demographics of all schools in new york city i did not link it here because i have a personal habit of clicking links mindlessly and would not want someone to accidentally open an excel file without being prepared it breaks demographics down based on the bureau district and school and has data on race grade level and poverty rate bronx high school of science lists 44 in poverty and stuyvesant ranks 42 in poverty these may seem like high percentages but when you rank it from least impoverished to most impoverished out of 454 high schools stuyvesant ranks 16th and bronx ranks 19th the city as a whole averaged 76 so these schools are not only better than average but in the top 5 of all new york high schools in terms of poverty rate i am not an expert on this i have just looked at the data if you want to suggest other schools to look at i can but i think the schools you have mentioned agreed far more with coldnotion point than your own ,2,changemyview

Generic_On_Reddit, if you read the entire definition from the site i linked you will see that it also says most states provide for a party defamed by a periodical to demand a published retraction if the correction is made then there is no right to file a lawsuit so yet again i am not seeing how there could be a case wsj did not even have to demand the retraction h3h3 put it out themselves well because it not quite that simple for a number of reasons 1 the relevant state statutes do not absolve them with retractions retraction statutes in california where h3h3 is if you comply with these procedures after receiving a retraction request or the plaintiff fails to ask for a retraction as required under the statute and you are found to be liable for defamation the plaintiff ability to recover damages from you will be limited he or she will be able to recover only for his or her actual economic losses and will not be able to recover general damages eg loss of reputation generally or punitive damages link http www dmlp org legal guide retraction law california retraction statute in new york where wsj is under the n y civ rights law 78 you can use your retraction and even your offer to publish a retraction to show mitigating circumstances for the jury to consider in determining damages the jury may use the retraction to reduce punitive damages but not compensatory damages link http www dmlp org legal guide retraction law new york both of them would allow wsj to receive compensatory damage thus if they are able to prove damages they would be able to pursue this regardless of retraction 2 is the retraction frank and full link http www dmlp org legal guide correcting or retracting your work after publication responding to a retraction request will vary with the nature of your statements and the details of your state retraction statute or case law generally speaking to be effective a retraction must be a frank and full withdrawal of the defamatory accusation merely stating that the subject of the statement denies the accusation is not enough nor is a weak grudging or half hearted correction this refers to the frank aspect of the phrase retractions that double down or stand by suspicions will not do did he just retract his evidence or did he retract the claim that wsj was doing something fishy altogether if he does not outright admit that the wsj have been factual i do not believe it can be called a retraction as it is all of the above bolded terms additionally the retraction must appear in a manner comparable to that of the original publication and be disseminated to the same audience this part refers to the full part of the phrase did the retraction reach as far as the original claim how many views did the retraction get compared to the original video the original video claim also spread through forums and discussions did the retraction penetrate these forums to disseminate the message like most people posting from armchairs on reddit within the last 24 hours i am not a lawyer but i do not think the retraction absolves h3h3 of compensatory damages the question is just whether there are damages that wsj could be compensated for there almost certainly are since he challenged the reputation of a publication based on reputations but the question then becomes whether wsj considers it worth it to pursue these damages this is what i doubt personally i am not the wsj so i have no idea but i cannot imagine whatever damages there were being worth the legal fees ,9,h3h3productions

Generic_On_Reddit, so you think the economy was hunky dory after the late 1960s and 1970s was there a great depression sequel i did not hear about do you know what it looks like for a nation to collapse there is an entire chasm between the type of economy we had in the 60s and 70s and the economy of a failing empire how would any description of national cohesion be simple well it your usage of the term so how am i supposed to know if you have not provided any indication for what it supposed to mean not a single attempt simple or otherwise why do you keep assuming things are simple are you simple well you are supposedly incapable of providing evidence for or explaining any of your claims in depth as per the comment you linked and the fact that you have made claims and not backed them up by citing actual history and completely dropped explanations of your claims when provided with counter points i thought you would prefer simple explanations ,1,AskTrumpSupporters

Generic_On_Reddit, and where the heck did i say the 1960s racial tensions were simple i did not say that i am saying it should be easy to provide proof the us was about to fall apart on account of the united states racial tensions usually when an empire is about to fall apart there are signs you know the economy failing individual states failing it seceding some type of sign correct please refer to the first sentence of the comment you replied to https www reddit com r asktrumpsupporters comments 621alx nimble navigators what is the one thing you just dfjb3z9 but you cannot provide a simple definition of what national cohesion is or an example of nations that failed by not having it it should not be difficult to provide a single example just say this empire failed because of it and this entire problem is solved assuming your claim is true but fine i understand you are not actually interested in answering questions in r asktrumpsupporters i do not know what compelled me to think otherwise ,1,AskTrumpSupporters
Generic_On_Reddit, is secession really the only way you can see an empire collapsing there also economic collapse and other factors that precede secession go read about the consequences of the 1968 riots the country was on the brink of collapse why do not you provide it if it so simple it should be fairly easy to prove that the united states was literally about to fall apart yes just any evidence that suggests the lack of natural cohesion but we know what that looks like that the civil war and it did not happen when local scale conflicts trended across the united states it happened when an entire region of states felt disjointed from the other regions of states and wanted more determination over their own laws can you provide examples of a lack of national cohesion which i can only assume means a lack of homogeneity since you have seemingly refused to provide an actual definition for what it supposed to mean that has led to a nation falling apart when the separate incohesive groups of peoples do not live segregated in large scales such as by segregated themselves by state i would prefer an example of this that caused by incohesion and not general inequality which was really what our past race relations were concerning segregation that limited freedoms and access to opportunity not a conflict of cultures in the thread you are responding to https www reddit com r asktrumpsupporters comments 621alx nimble navigators what is the one thing you just dfj62v5 do you read before you comment i missed the word but i would like to know how this related to the united states we are different from europe in most ways including our stances on freedom of religion but also in our already existent muslim populations which many european countries already had noteable populations of for decades i do not believe it unreasonable to have the context of our discussion be the effects importing muslims has on america and thus america situation since this sub is about the american president are you going to answer any of the questions i have posited you have been ignoring vast swaths of my comments and questions if you are not going to fine you do not have to but i would consider it in much better faith if you actually acknowledged their existence and said why you will not or perhaps cannot answer i can only assume you just do not have answers otherwise but i much prefer actual answers ,1,AskTrumpSupporters
Generic_On_Reddit, what the heck are you talking about race riots did not affect national unity they were just local issues really to cause an empire to fall apart like states seceding from a union race issues empire failing racial issues can follow a national trend but they are on a local scale a race riot in wherevertown does not turn into a state seceding states backing out of the union and the empire failing you need disconnects and animosity between states to have that effect are you at all familiar with american immigration policies or culture during the periods we are discussing yes but i am familiar with what actually happened policy amounts to nothing if it not enforceable policy does not make pressure enforcement does the fact that these enclaves not only existed but were so commonplace suggests the policies made to promote assimilation were not effective are you going to address anything i said about these enclaves always existing do you disagree that they have always existed do you disagree that basically every wave of immigrants has used them when we were discussing muslims i was referring to the west as a whole european countries are currently experiencing large influxes of muslims when did you or anyone mention europe or the west we were talking about america importing muslim in response to a comment about freedom of religion a policy much of europe does not even have in the same sense that we do in the us the current flood of immigrants is from mexico when did you or anyone else bring up mexico i am specifically inquiring what does national cohesion mean and how does it affect our nation stability when has the us been nationally cohesive or without groups of disconnected or unassimilated peoples what affect do you believe importing muslims has on this national cohesion how does national cohesion mesh with things like states rights with the entire purpose of states rights being to have local communities dictate their lives allowing them to be disjointed from any national culture do you disagree with a states ability to do this if you believe in national cohesion ,1,AskTrumpSupporters
Generic_On_Reddit, this reinforces my point ethnic enclaves do not work segregation created black ghettos and resulted in massive riots every few years blacks in america in the jim crow era had little reason to feel american because they were not part of mainstream american culture but this happens on a local level it does not detract from or contribute to national cohesiveness in the sense of causing a nation empire to become disjointed and fall apart it affects community cohesiveness which is an entirely different thing yes we were the prior immigrants waves eg germans in the mid 1800s italians irish in the late 1800s faced much more pressure to assimilate than immigrants today our first waves of germans came by during the late 1600s though hence the strong german influence in places like pennsylvania and it made german the second most spoken language in the united states with many completely german towns it was not until ww1 that german culture started to drop from the scene for obvious reasons italians are also notorious for creating little italy enclaves in new york and chicago they did not assimilate similar for irish although theirs may have had more to do with prejudice the fact that these enclaves existed is what allowed the italian mafia and irish mob to rise up from them none of these groups assimilated into american culture immediately literally none why do you think they faced pressure to do so my point is that we have always had these enclaves every wave of immigration has used them at some point and integrated at their leisure if at all chinese americans are less than 2 of the us population i am talking about actual sizeable ethnic splits and muslims are at most 1 of the us population how does that represent a sizeable ethnic split what are you referring to ,2,AskTrumpSupporters
Generic_On_Reddit, we used to assimilate people into a melting pot where immigrants would be pressured to conform to existing norms while being allowed a few minor changes now the melting pot is considered racist and the salad bowl is the new goal but we have never really had a melting pot have we until a 60 years ago we had segregation by law and people have always segregated themselves seeking refuge with people that are like them continuing to do so to this day saying we have ever been a melting pot is a massive exaggeration of how mixed we are which is to say not very we are at best a salad bowl of mixed ingredients where some flavors mix into the dressings the salad bowl model would basically form unassimilated enclaves that not good the loss of national cohesion is what leads to empires falling this sounds rather alarmist in my opinion every major city in the united states and basically the world has immigrant pockets that rebuild their own culture instead of assimilating i have been to a chinatown in 3 different cities and they do not cause the cities to fall apart nor do they take away from national cohesion i feel like you are overestimating the national significance of these enclaves let say if you have a pocket that feels disconnected from the whole that is large enough to secede it makes it more likely we do not have that and it would be practically impossible to create such a situation what do you believe is required for national cohesion we already have a fairly weak national culture californians have one thing in common with texans that neither of them have anything in common with people from new york but that how we were founded as individual states with individual cultures forming a union the point of states rights is that we do not have to be nationally cohesive right one state does not agree with the other 49 so they can have it their way in their state ,10,AskTrumpSupporters

Generic_On_Reddit, the point is there is no similar situation when a transfer of wealth is taxed in such a way the similar situation is with gifts gifts are transfers of wealth in which wealth transferred above a certain amount gets taxed similarly inheritance is a transfer of wealth in which the wealth transferred above a certain amount gets taxed we tax transfers which includes but is not limited to transactions there is nothing inconsistent about this when compared to the rest of our tax system ,0,AskTrumpSupporters
Generic_On_Reddit,but in the case of inheritance the donor is not alive but their estate still exists so the tax falls on the donee who has their estate i do not think that is moral either it does not really matter if you agree or not you were arguing that inheritance giving something without having an exchange is not a taxable action but that not true because we tac giving things where no exchange has occurred such as gifts correct ,1,AskTrumpSupporters

Generic_On_Reddit,well based on what the tpp was i presume it was a few things to become closer with the economies of asia and the pacific to ensure that china or whoever would not be able to use the emerging market that asia is as a way to grow their economies large enough to challenge the united states another thing about the tpp which people hated was exporting our regulations such as intellectual property protections to their countries china and other asian countries are notoriously awful about protecting people ideas which is why so many knock offs come from china most american companies wo not even bother selling something in those types of countries because it will just get copied and sold for a fraction of the cost but by standardising our rules american companies will have more protections to move into their markets the tpp also set out worker rights that the countries had to meet one of the reasons it so much cheaper to produce in these countries is because the workers there do not have a lot of benefits or the wages we do by increasing these things you bring them closer to american workers making it more expensive to outsource theoretically these are just a few things globally it was meant to serve as a check on chinese growth and gain leverage over their marketplace while domestically it was supposed to increase the opportunity american businesses had to sell to these nations now it is worth remembering that while we can be pretty certain we would have received these benefits these deals often come with some unintended consequences which is why there was so much stress about protecting american workers i do not personally think there is a way for us to both remain the dominant economy while being protectionist in our current economic model so i think we should probably decide which we want i do not personally care whether the tpp passed or not but i understood its purpose and what it did the tpp put us on a path many did not like but i think rejecting the tpp entirely instead of refining it also puts us on a path that i am not super fond of one we wo not enjoy in the future edit to your edit yes these trade agreements come with extra consequences that are not always predictable but we can really only have our cake or eat it ,1,conspiracy

Generic_On_Reddit,i do not understand it completely myself however fundamentally it is not necessarily different from synchro or xyz summoning in terms of using materials for a monster but that pretty much where the similarities end what changed was that the game now revolves around these link monsters note i do not think all the details on the mechanic are out yet you tribute send two monsters to summon link monsters to the link monster zone the link monsters have arrows you can only summon a monster from the extra deck if an arrow from a link monster is pointing to it which is to say if you want to synchro summon xyz or fusion summon you have to have a linked monster zone free if you are familiar with pendulum summoning i am fairly certain the restriction includes special summoning pendulum monsters from the extra deck it a drastically different game now the change makes it way harder on extra deck based decks ,2,changemyview

Generic_On_Reddit,people are not good at making distinctions if they were stereotypes racism and the examples i highlighted would not exist it does not vilify murderers and rapists it uses murderers and rapists to vilify all immigrants if you want to vilify murderers and rapists publish a list of all of them if you want to vilify a group publishing a list of murderers and rapists paints of that group paints the group with that brush let relate it to the police again we effectively have a notification go off every time a cop wrongly shoots some but we do not get notified as much when cops use appropriate force or help someone unless it extreme do people make the distinction that only some cops are bad cops considering the tensions and movements we have had against police lots of people simply hate or think all cops are bad ,6,AskTrumpSupporters
Generic_On_Reddit, on the other hand whitewashing them and tolerating the criminal element in the illegal alien population will only serve to further anger victims who are crying out for justice but who says we tolerate it white wash them illegals that commit crimes are most definitely punished and deported all the time there should be no tolerance for criminal aliens and i am fully on board with calls for a more secure border sure i can understand and agree with calls for more border security however i do not see this voice as a means to that end setting up a new department to vilify a group is money that would be better spent actually securing the border would not you agree hearing of multiple crimes committed by criminals who had been repeatedly deported makes me slightly angry again sure but it worth noting that this still is not tolerating them as they have been jailed and deported multiple times the justice system is acting against them as it should the border is just not secure but again voice does not make it more secure either it just spends money accomplishing what and furthermore while details are not out yet it sounds like from what he said in his speech it will report all crimes from illegal immigrants not just repeat offenders that definitely should not be here and he did not mention any limitation like only violent crimes ,5,AskTrumpSupporters
Generic_On_Reddit, i think there is a kernel of truth in both arguments there are some illegal immigrants who are bad guys and there are some police who are racists right and vilifying officers is a bad thing that has only raised tensions and made life harder for good cops has not it the media hones in on bad encounters between cops and civilians this is not entirely the medias fault because conflict gets views and cop pulls a black guy over and everything goes well is a boring fucking story the fact that only bad cop news actually sells skews public perception in a way that does not represent reality people do not wait and see whether they are interacting with a good cop or bad cop they see lots of bad cops so they just hate all cops do not you see how like the incentive structure of the media has led to a vilification of all cops this could lead to the vilification of anyone who looks like an immigrant ,10,AskTrumpSupporters
Generic_On_Reddit,historically leaders would always vilify enemy nations or leaders as a manner of supporting war or imperialism it easy to lead your people to war if they hate the enemy so much that they beg for it for most wars especially modern wars where the citizens concerns actually matter you can pinpoint a time before the war began where the people in power stirred up hatred for their enemy the vilification of the west in the middle east parts of asia and africa lead to increased hostility and hatred towards western nations even nations that have not contributed to their current situation an effect we are still feeling today obviously can you think of a time where vilifying or stigmatizing a group of people has produced positive results edit thanks to u maga lady patriot comment i have been reminded that police officers have also been vilified due to how the media is structured this has led to increased tensions against the police and lower trust between them and their communities this makes life harder for bad cops and good cops alike like the shootings in houston ,8,AskTrumpSupporters

Generic_On_Reddit,but laypeople never use the terms correctly anyway to the point of making up terms that do not exist physiologically i would say there are more people misusing the terms than using them properly and she did not say it makes her bulky she started by saying bulky looking which could mean basically anything ,11,SubredditDrama

Generic_On_Reddit,but if she already found her ideal body type it is not difficult to nudge yourself in an unfavorable direction as a guy it super hard to build to a the ideal point with big defined arms chest etc for a woman if you are already fit the threshold is a lot lower think of it in terms of abs guys generally want extremely shredded abs as many packs as the anatomy allows gals generally just want a flat stomach four pack or a few lines at the most it hard to get the shredded abs it not hard to get those few lines same for any muscle group adding a little definition to your bicep is easy getting huge biceps takes months or years so could you imagine someone that does not really want any muscle definition having a hard time lifting 2 to 3 times a week without gaining the little definition that would be too much ,18,SubredditDrama
Generic_On_Reddit, i think people would definitely take issue with that especially people that lift themselves making meaningful changes to your body composition takes time building muscle takes time even for men who are beginners it takes months to see significant muscle growth women gain muscle slower due to hormonal differences she not going to wake up one morning and suddenly be all hulked out i reread a bit and it does not look like she bulks quickly necessarily just easily she said she just lifts once a week which combined with her complaint implies if she lifts much more than that she going to start looking muscular does not mean it is not taking time to do just that doing it too frequently causes results she does not like ,19,SubredditDrama

Generic_On_Reddit,yeah after it was released i remember facebook implementing friend sorting features and similar changes that made me prefer google the beta period was so long that it was still in beta by the time the features were copied ,4,Android
Generic_On_Reddit,yes that exactly what happened that exactly what makes google so dumb making people wait to be invited to use a product is not bad that not the problem but for a social network having to wait weeks to get on means that none of your friends are there for you to use the social network with while you wait and then none of their other friends and so on it basically saying here our product you cannot use it though ,26,Android
Generic_On_Reddit,my girlfriend eats slow as fuck i eat fast too but she still eats exceptionally slow and she gets upset if i finish before her and thus have her eat alone even if i am still by her side it made me begin to study how she manages to eat so slow and on top of just doing every movement as slow as possible the absolute worse part is that she will stop slow chewing if she looking at something with attention not just if it shocking or especially attention grabbing basically anything i have never felt the need to stop chewing if i want to read a reddit post while eating i do not get it and it makes me want to ban phones or other distractions during meals unless she can learn to multitask and i have tried to slow down my pace with her it means i am putting my fork down for a minute in between every bite and my food is cold by the time i am half through the meal ,13,AdviceAnimals
Generic_On_Reddit,which is why the execution was so fucking dumb on google part they had a ridiculously long beta period that purposefully but artificially restricted it ability to gain users they had tons of hype and publicity on account of being google challenging facebook and actually being a good product but by the time they opened it up the hype had already died down to the point that nobody cared your comment is the exact reason google was dumb as shit users contribute to the value of the product the fact that they could not see the beta period as counterproductive to their goal of being a social network is astounding it such a fundamental misunderstanding that i cannot believe it could come from such a valuable company but considering the post we are on google is not a stranger to misunderstanding the market ,2,Android
Generic_On_Reddit,yeah in case it was not obvious from my comment below i loved it i convinced all of my friends to get on and even helped them get their other friends on managing invites or wavers or whatever the system was if i did not have invites i would find a friend or friend of a friend that did have some left and get them to send the other person an invite i was the tech enthusiast so i was obviously the most thrilled with a new product but even my friends were excited about using it with the features it had and the lack of drama family that was plaguing facebook but eventually its the same 20 people on the feed over and over and everyone else got bored in the beginning we were there all day every day for weeks but they ended up going back to facebook when the beta period was so long that their other friends could not get on and i do not blame them the social network is fucking pointless if your friends cannot get on the network at the end of it all it felt like i did more to get google jump started than google did ,2,Android
Generic_On_Reddit,sure i can agree with that but they may have been betting that the youth would be leaving eventually regardless with their parents entering facebook and i believe they eventually did whether google could have gotten them is a different story as we do know instagram and twitter are thriving however we do know that google completely butchered the release of google destroying any hope of success if there ever was any ,3,Android
Generic_On_Reddit,i disagree i think it was a solution to a very well known and cyclical problem but one that is difficult to communicate google philosophy was very oriented through managing your social circles separately it noticed the fact that not everyone in your friend list is going to be the same type of friend and thus allowed and recommended that you create circles to categorize these people as soon as you added them to your friendlist should this person be added to family friends close friends acquaintances work etc is the question it asked you when you friended anyone this is what made me a big believer in the network at the time there was no way to do this on facebook google allowed me to post to a pre selected group of people and it allowed me to read feeds exclusively of the people i care about the problem that it addressing is the fact that everyone parents were starting to get on facebook this causes youth to exit en masse google wanted to be a place where your family life and friend life could easily coexist by easily sorting your friends it also addressed the problem that at the time in my age group everyone just added everyone else on facebook even if you did not really like them you could be coerced or guilted into accepting their friend request anyway which cascades and causes your feed to bloat with posts from people you are not interested in seeing with google you could just add them to a circle named untouchables or some shit like that and be done with it edit there also the advantages of having one account to connect a multitude of services i could go on for much longer about how i believe google failed to properly integrate google into their other sites such as youtube and google drive in the beginning that would have added much value to the network it was a fine product but it had so much potential to be more now the main problems or challenges google faced was 1 it did not have a niche instagram and twitter were able to grow because they were not really competing with the behemoth that is facebook they were just trying to be a better facebook which i would argue google was better from a design perspective but that is a hard fucking battle to fight better than your competitor is a way lower threshold than good enough to get people to switch 1 it provided a solution to a problem but the buck ultimately stopped with the user if i am too lazy to create circles and sort my friends into them as i add google is no better than facebook or if i ignore the introduction to the service and do not understand the circles at all it going to be hard to see the added value relying on the user is ultimately a bad decision i am a power user in everything so i am fine sorting my friends for the benefit of organizing and it literally only took a second a single added click but not everyone is like that that single click and thinking about what category in which to place someone can be too much to ask twitter and instagram were very interesting cases in the beginning much of their publicity came from how limited they were why would i limit myself to 140 characters when gives you more and so it like facebook but just for pictures of your food the reason for their success is a bit more abstract in my opinion and this post is already long enough so i wo not get into it ,67,Android

Generic_On_Reddit,for the record i hate both whiteboards and chalkboards i welcome the rise of smartboards i believe that there is pretty much no reason to use chalkboards over whiteboards i do not think i will be able to convince you that chalkboards are better but there are certainly some advantages that chalkboards have over whiteboards there are things chalkboards do better gloss whiteboards are usually glossy in certain lights they have a shine or glare to them that can affect viewing angles whereas blackboards are matte without glare and very easily viewed in without worrying about the light shining too bright in the wrong spot chalk has better flexibility as a style this is more applicable to someone that would want to draw with either medium but it applies to anyone using stylized or formatted writing on a chalkboard as well if you want to use a whiteboard your marker can make a thin line and a thick line and that basically all they are made to do you can play around with the pressure a bit to make it slightly darker or lighter but there is not that big of a range with chalk there are so many angles to use the tip of the chalk that you can make lines as thick or thin as you want you can press hard and make incredibly saturated lines or just barely glide along the board and leave faint marks or you can turn the chalk sideways and use that as a light shading if you so choose the possibilities are endless for chalk really only limited by your ability to manipulate the edge and apply fine pressure does this marker work this point is petty perhaps but i personally hate coming into a room walking to the whiteboard and picking up the marker on the ledge and writing my first letter only to discover the marker does not work or is running out of ink is it called ink for dry erase markers this is the most unforgivable deception imaginable i have been wronged by many a dry erase marker over the years but never a chalkboard i see a chalkboard with a piece of chalk and i know immediately whether it is chalk i can write with or not i have never been lied to by a chalkboard chalk is chalk to quote anakin skywalker it coarse it rough and it gets everywhere chalk dust that is no one likes getting a bunch of chalk on their hands and shirt but that what happens when you use chalk whiteboard markers do not have this problem on some level chalk is chalk and chalk does indeed suck however this can most certainly be an advantage for chalk as well chalk is almost exclusively used on the remaining blackboards but this also means no one will take your chalk you put a box worth of chalk in a classroom and it will be in the classroom at the end of the year chalk is messy and people are not really used to having it much anymore whereas markers are clean and common i know when i use a familiar writing utensil i am likely to habitually slip it into my pocket like i do my own utensils all the time i am not likely to do this with chalk because it feels nothing like any of my other writing tools i am very aware that it chalk and thus not mine no one will want it for their own chalk board because they probably do not have one they have a dry erase board so they might steal a dry erase marker if they need one at my university there are so many dry erase boards in and around the women dorms it cannot be used for much of anything else so it unlikely to leave the board dry erase markers can be used as regular markers as well so it possible for them to be used in more applications which adds to both my first and second point in this section just a few off the top of my head again i do not think chalkboards are superior but to say there is never a reason to choose chalk over white i think these are enough to choose some over others in some situations they do have their qualities ,3,changemyview

Generic_On_Reddit, instead the debate seems solely focused around a right to abortion or right to choose abortion because of a person right to individual liberty and bodily autonomy while everyone has a right to bodily autonomy that right only extends so far as you do not infringe on the rights of any other person for example you are free to walk around dancing in the streets but you are not allowed to walk around punching people in the face therefor if a fetus is a person your right to bodily autonomy does not allow you to kill that person assuming the fetus does have bodily autonomy he and the mother are not a single entity the fetus body is not the mother body removing a fetus is not violating its bodily autonomy anymore than removing a person from a residence or place of business i cannot think of a comparable scenario in which one person bodily autonomy grants them rights to another person body ,13,changemyview

Generic_On_Reddit,to your edit i was specifically wanting a source for this we take in the most wealthy of the poor and the most educated of the poor and remove them from those impoverished places where they as should we could actually start using that intelligence to solve the world issues i am aware of brain drain as a mechanism but it seems as though you are implying that the majority of our immigrants are not coming from poor conditions in 2014 1 3 million foreign born individuals moved to the united states an 11 percent increase from 1 2 million in 2013 india was the leading country of origin for new immigrants with 147 500 arriving in 2014 followed by china with 131 800 mexico with 130 000 canada with 41 200 and the philippines with 40 500 so it sounds like the bigger groups are coming from the 3 billion you speak of considering the bigger groups are india and china and again mexico is pretty poor now onto your point about competition i did not infer it was i said that inferring that immigration is a humanitarian choice is wrong you are removing educated citizens from where educated citizens would increase wealth poor countries not saying this is wrong as i said but it certainly is not right either but who says we are only taking in the educated citizens that what i wanted a source for ,1,changemyview

Generic_On_Reddit, are you really human if you are not sentient you are undoubtedly living but it the equivalent of someone who is braindead at that point no definition i know if human requires sentience but i will continue this point i do not know of anyone who would argue that people who are braindead have rights it certainly is not murder to take someone like that off life support this is usually one of the few allowances of taking someone off life support without their consent but it also usually comes with the territory of no hope of cure which is to say if they will be braindead forever you can pull the plug if they are more likely to pull through and re gain sentience i do not think you are as likely to be allowed to pull the plug unless you have unilateral authority on the matter i suppose this is also why we do not allow people to take their own lives unless they are in extreme pain and without hope of cure apply this logic to the fetus and we likely would not allow the death of something that would gain human sentience in the same vein that we do not kill off anyone that slips into a coma but the distinction for me as a pro choice person is that they never gained the rights to begin with the point being you could compare pulling the plug of a brain dead person but the comparison does not really include that the brain dead person is unlikely to gain sentience whereas an infant will i tend to link sentience with having rights but it seems as though you would not how are we defining sentience i link humanity with rights even if some animals are intelligent they almost never gain actual expansive and recognized rights if they feel pain we outlaw cruelty towards them but that basically as far as we go i think you are probably right that it comes down to the idea of a soul but who can say whether or not animals have souls does a soul necessarily have to do with religion or do you think atheists would argue for the idea of a soul as well i would say it would definitely depend on the religion but most not all religions i know of either 1 assign souls to humans exclusively or 2 place greater significance of human souls than other or lower tier souls i do not know how an atheist would decide this i am an atheist but i am also not spiritual so i do not believe anything has a soul i would tie this argument with religion more often than not adherants to a religion with attributes of either one or two would not be hypocrites because animals would not share the same status as humans and thus not the same rights in these arguments ,4,changemyview

Generic_On_Reddit, why is it that a server who brings me a hamburger fries and a few soft drink refills on a tab of say 12 get a tip for 2 40 3 but a server who brings me a filet mignon and a bottle of wine with a tab of 60 gets a tip of 12 besides perhaps having to dress up nicer the server themselves has exactly the same job description when it comes to what i am receiving from them because you are supposed to be getting better service from a more experienced server that knows more about the dishes it much easier to get hired somewhere with 4 dishes than it is to get hired at a place with 50 dishes remember that the tipping system is meant to fill in the wages they would be getting if they were just paid a full wage would not you agree that the higher prices restaurants would pay more to obtain the best servers the tip system is reflecting that as well as paying for a marginally more difficult or higher pressure job in my opinion whether the tipping system is right is another matter entirely ,16,changemyview

Generic_On_Reddit, but i do not believe u k could have banned the porn it did without first having banned child porn perhaps but that does not make the ban on child pornography bad the same reasoning can be made of any and all laws making one thing illegal makes it easier to make other things illegal and enforce it anarchists would argue that the very existence of government is a slippery slope that leads to an authoritative rule and this would not necessarily be wrong considering the growth in power and reach of all governments does trend in that direction but it does not remove the necessity of having a government for the time being if you subscribe to the reasoning that developments can be bad since they can lead to the development of worse states than i am afraid you must apply this to all things for all developments good and bad can lead to the development of something negative i am sure i can take nearly any law you believe is entirely beneficial or necessary to have and apply a slippery slope fallacy to determine how it can be corrupted ,1,changemyview
Generic_On_Reddit, here is my response to the same question for example if we just banned holocaust denial i believe that it reduces the need to examine the facts about the holocaust itself why it happened what happened where when etc but holocaust denial does not examine those facts it just denies them or misinterprets them as something else but banning holocaust denial may be beneficial in and of itself but it leads to a slippery slope of opening the gate to ban other ideas but this is fallacious reasoning in uk if i remember right it started with banning child porn which i agree with but led to banning of other types of porn that i think is unnecessary and wrong and yet the united states has had the ban of child pornography for a long time with practically no escalation into banning all porn not only this but we have stronger non government regulations on the portrayal of nudity in television and in movies to the point of being prudish compared to european nations despite all this we have not fallen into a slope of banning all porn banning one thing is not a slippery slope in and of itself it important to realize the underlying factors that influence trends ,2,changemyview
Generic_On_Reddit, i will disagree that government are usually amoral mainly the first world ones they seem to have a somewhat defined morality and although they do not seem to follow it when it is not convenient they try to enforce it into smaller nations exactly when it not convenient to them they likely wo not behave morally if it in their best interest they will behave morally and support moral behavior but otherwise they likely wo not even when they seemingly get nothing out of it they still likely gain something abstract from moral deeds such as influence or positive pr and i am not convinced that fucking other nations and generating conflict is good for any nation in the long run although it sure can be profitable in a short period of time and since nations should care about their future it is never a good deal this is debatable but it worth noting that many of the wealthy nations of today had a heavy hand in or first began to rise by fucking over someone else you can say this is only a viable strategy in the short term but in the last hundred years or so the nations that began on top have stayed on top those who were oppressors stayed wealthy those that were suppressed stayed poor unless otherwise assisted by an oppressor not only this but it is at least partially their suppression that leads to our wealth off the top of my head my shoes were made in vietnam and china my phone was assembled in china as was my laptop my jeans were made in vietnam afghanistan bangladesh and colombia my shirts were made in india and jordan if the history of these nations was more pleasant with less external meddling would i be able to afford these products would we be as prosperous my point was not that they are never moral just that they have no obligation to be unless it benefits them i do not think the argument that behaving ethically is the best policy has the evidence to support it at the moment it the philosophy subscribe to but more so out of faith than actual realpolitik ,3,changemyview
Generic_On_Reddit, this prohibits them from either recognizing the factors that led up to that incident and preventing them from happening again i do not understand this statement this is basically the reason the laws are in place you know what would happen if holocaust denial were to gain a foothold in public discourse people would deny the holocaust happened and learn absolutely nothing from the factors that developed the nationalism and racism that motivated it as well as the other factors that allowed it to happen a denial of history is exactly how you repeat it without realizing it also the people views that do deny that the holocaust happened would never be able to be changed because it would not be brought up and logically discussed these people would have never changed their minds anyway they seek sources that confirms their biases and ignore everything else the gas chambers are fake the records were falsified the holocaust survivors are paid actors etc etc in my experience the speculative motive in these theories is also dangerous because it typically involves some mass jewish conspiracy fostering anti semitism ironically we usually value speech as beneficial but there are certain types of speech that do not have benefits inciting a panic is speech but it involves more downsides than it does upsides so it censored lying is speech but it can also involve slandering someone reputation with can greatly negatively affect someone life so it censored in certain contexts assault is speech but it can make someone feel unsafe and threatened so it censored etc censorship is more common than people think about we have tons of it and the aforementioned laws are beneficial and arguably necessary ,2,changemyview

Generic_On_Reddit,i think just about everyone here would prefer it if your view had some form of supporting evidence of any kind preferably data if when you think about this stuff you think to yourself gee i really wish someone collected data on this stuff data that showed what i perceive to be an important measurement on whatever then my response would be someone almost always collects the information you want and that information you want and that someone is usually the bureau of labor statistics 1 unemployment rate is not really down it a misrepresented number that does not include people who are only working part time but are looking for full time work it also does not include people who have given up on looking for work which has increased quite a bit over the years this is a perfectly valid thing to think to some degree but it worth noting that this is not a misrepresentation the employment that has been reported is the employment we have been using forever if this measurement is not satisfactory the bls has alternative forms of measurement for you to look at https www bls gov lau stalt htm i am personally fond of u5 because i believe u6 to be affected by way more factors outside of anyone control but the measurement you want is u6 u6 also includes underemployed and somewhat employed which is kind of disingenuous if we are calling it an unemployment rate what you are saying is employment is less than ideal and i get that but it really is around u3 when factoring that in i believe a more accurate unemployment rate hits around 9 as opposed to the 4 that gets reported again the 4 is the number we have always reported it would be much more misleading to look at a number u6 that never gets reported when people are used to u3 but let look at the data if we look at current data u3 unemployment is 4 7 while u6 is 9 2 giving us a ratio between the two of 51 so you would be correct in the idea that employment is less than ideal but let put in some historical context rewind ten years and the u3 unemployment is 4 7 with the u6 unemployment is 7 9 giving a percentage of 59 so it looks like unemployment is less ideal than it was 10 years ago even though the u3 is the same but there are a few more things worth noting 1 we are not done recovering yet as all unemployment levels are still trending downward in 2006 they were at their lowest point before they started increasing 2 the economy is most certainly changing with the rise of the internet more efficient connectivity and software automation etc part of the effects we anticipate from these revolutionary changes to our economy and part of the changes i believe we have been seeing already is that companies need people to work less they do not need as much labor and it more beneficial to employ part time than it is full time obama has no control over this trend 2 job creation numbers are positive he created something like 9 million jobs but population in us increased by 20 million therefore employment based upon population is actually down i do not know why you would use population numbers when you really want to know how much the labor force increased by but how on earth do i figure that out fortunately our trusty bls has us covered https data bls gov timeseries lns11000000 from january 2008 to december 2016 the start of which is far outside of his jurisdiction by the way our labor force increased by a little over 5 5 million 3 admittedly he entered his first term during one of the worst financial disasters of our time however i do not agree with much of his quantitative easing policies and bailouts that he offered to so many companies who ended up giving golden parachutes to their executives well you may disagree with his policies as far as the bailout and stimulus went but a lot of economists thought it was too little here is a nice article on it to start http www nytimes com 2009 01 09 opinion 09krugman html but you can search for plenty more if you prefer most would argue he did what he was supposed to do just too little of it 4 wages are not really up when you look at median wages across the country wages are actually down a lot of this is likely explained by the widening income disparity that continues to increase this to me is not a good indicator of a strong economy i do not know where you are getting this from and i do not know what metric you want to use i am rather fond of the real earnings metric that the bls uses https www bls gov news release realer tn htm it measures the increase in earnings and then deflates them by taking the increase in the consumer price index into account which is a form of measuring inflation they make it a little more difficult to look at this measurement at a glance but here https www bls gov bls news release realer htm is the page that holds all of the monthly reports on the subject if you want to look through them i am not going to look through every single one for you but real earnings it looks like they rose every year since 2011 2016 0 8 2015 1 8 2014 1 2013 0 2 2012 0 3 2011 0 9 2010 0 4 2009 1 3 real earnings have increased 2 3 under obama despite the recession also the 2009 metric really is not his jurisdiction again because it describes the wages falling from jan 08 to jan 09 so that is not even his loss but i am being generous 2 and 4 are basically outright false 3 is your opinion but the experts think he did too little 1 is correct but also contains many more factors he cannot control or influence factors i believe will continue anything else you want to go over edit

Generic_On_Reddit, i sort of feel like my entire post reached this conclusion even if not explicitly which part do you find inconclusive your post casts doubt on certain benefits of marriage or their significance but you do not actually raise any negatives of it either in effect or philosophy yet you end by saying it counterintuitive and implying it with a victim what in your post suggests marriage is counterintuitive at all what you do say that is negative about marriage is not supported by anything it just seems like your own bitterness or bias on the topic this basically says that marriage is a good idea because it is convenient only if you ignore my opinion in saying it not a big deal i replied to your point because you said it was frivolous but it not because people still rarely do it despite a push for it in the medical profession over the past few years and also is convenience not enough of a benefit to make something worth it convenience in this aspect means saving money for the health industry the family of the patient and the government as well as smoothing the decision making process and thus maintaining familial unity in divisive times i do not have evidence of the effects on adults who see their parents divorce but that is the point people tend to care less about marriages when they stop affecting children so they are much less about matrimony then they are about providing stability for children because that when they have the greatest effect on citizens developmental stages are important and set the stage for the rest of life to suggest that divorce has a widespread observable negative effect on the adult children of the divorced that is not only large enough to impact there life but also undo all of the developmental stability and support the nuclear family brings is silly might as well not have human relations at all why have parents help and support you they will just die devastating the adult right i feel like you are just trying to pull a problem out of thin air if you have no supporting evidence about the only thing this proves is that marriage is conducive to raising children is that not a good enough benefit we already spend money to build better children in schooling and education which are often severely limited by their abilities if the student comes from an unstable household but often helped when assisted by involved parents and parents are more likely to be involved supportive and intentive if they are married which does not explain why it should be a legal institution marriage is a contract between two people it a legal agreement with many complexities nor does it defend child free marriages marriage in general has been studied for its effects the positive impact of marriage on society the case for public policy by steven l nock from university of virginia link http www law2 byu edu wfpc forum 2005 nock pdf scientific evidence suggests that children and adults benefit from satisfying and stable marriages for well over a century researchers have known that married people are generally better off than their unmarried counterparts as early as 1897 sociologist emile durkheim was theorizing about why married adults have lower suicide rates in a recent survey david ribar notes that links between marriage and better health in children and adults have been documented in hundreds of quantitative studies covering different time periods and different countries the accumulated research shows that married people are typically healthier live longer earn more have better mental health have better sex lives and are happier than their unmarried counterparts they have lower rates of suicide fatal accidents acute and chronic illness alcoholism and depression and here http homes chass utoronto ca siow 332 waite pdf is a link from a study by linda waite titled does marriage matter that provides the evidence for many of those claims ,2,changemyview
Generic_On_Reddit, what i am saying is you should not get any government breaks rewards or validation for doing so you are not helping society by getting married it a personal choice much like going to college or buying a car but you are helping society by doing so it being a personal choice is irrelevant as nearly all personal choices have effects on society the government has been in the business of incentivizing personal decisions for a long time such as going to college donating making green improvements on your house etc what those statistics do not take into account is a parallel result from unwed parents that live together which is why we have civil unions that kick in we incentivize this too but it more difficult to incentivize and track without legal paperwork involved the effects of divorce after the child has left home if you have supporting evidence of this i would love to see it it serves only to contrast single parent households that the entire point raising children in nuclear households is better than single parent households defending marriage on the grounds that we need to be able to grant someone permission to handle our care if we end up in a non responsive state is frivolous in that we could manage to allow that without marriage i do not think this is an important part of marriage but let me tell you people are absolutely shit at having arrangements for stuff like this they do not want to think about it they do not want to do it they do not do it then something happens everybody argues over who has the right to make the decisions time and money is wasted people are super shit at this only 26 of people actually have one edit one being a living will that would cover this sort of thing marriage is counter intuitive to the ambivalence of human nature and is only kept around because it is seemingly victim less and secure can you support this statement at all you did not really say anything to reach this conclusion ,2,changemyview

Generic_On_Reddit,immigration policy basically everywhere is based on what affect the immigration will have on the country the general consensus is that economically immigration is a net positive http business time com 2013 01 30 the economics of immigration who wins who loses and why the link is to a time article with a basic overview of the effects immigration has on an economy and they are mostly positive the article also has links to primary sources which i suggest following if you want to learn more here a section from the oecd with some notes on immigration and the effects https www oecd org migration oecd 20migration 20policy 20debates 20numero 202 pdf labour markets migrants accounted for 47 of the increase in the workforce in the united states and 70 in europe over the past ten years migrants fill important niches both in fast growing and declining sectors of the economy like the native born young migrants are better educated than those nearing retirement migrants contribute significantly to labour market flexibility notably in europe the public purse migrants contribute more in taxes and social contributions than they receive in benefits labour migrants have the most positive impact on the public purse employment is the single biggest determinant of migrants net fiscal contribution economic growth migration boosts the working age population migrants arrive with skills and contribute to human capital development of receiving countries migrants also contribute to technological progress understanding these impacts is important if our societies are to usefully debate the role of migration such debates in turn are essential to designing policies in areas like education and employment that maximise the benefits of migration especially by improving migrants employment situation this policy mix will of course vary from country to country but the fundamental question of how to maximise the benefits of migration both for host countries and the migrants themselves needs to be addressed by many oecd countries in coming decades especially as rapid population ageing increases demand for migrants to make up shortfalls in the workforce i am not here to convince you that immigration is always a net positive and allowing it unlimited is super dope all the time because that not the point and it not accurate but it does have benefits overall and the benefits to the host country is why many governments are pro immigration it has much less to do with helping folks as you might think it almost purely objective and logical ,15,changemyview

Generic_On_Reddit,what does it mean to win in essence i am pro choice i do not believe a fetus is something with rights or being in the legal stages at least in the initial stages however i also sympathize with anti abortion folks and realize they do believe those things so optimally abortion should not exist but i also think making it illegal is a bad decision with its own wealth of problems and ramifications with these conflicting views both options are suboptimal and arguably shitty so how do you win with two shitty options well i believe the path to victory is promoting methods of birth control methods that are accessible carefree and with few to no negatives otherwise the studies show that increased access to birth control decreases unwanted pregnancies and thus abortion and the reality is that birth control is only getting easier and easier with the rise of hormonal implant birth control such as nexplanon and similar in spirit methods are also being developed for men once men also have better methods of birth control besides condoms which are complete shit despite what sexual educational classes would lead you to believe that are low cost and carefree i do not think we will have noticeable levels of abortion why is this a win because it reduces the likelihood of actually needing an abortion the best way to make something go away is not to ban it it to make it obsolete reducing the rate of abortions to negligible levels limited only to people without access to birth control would make this a nonissue perhaps it would not make abortion or the fight against it go away but it would certainly make it die down substantially if it rarely happens this is the win scenario in my opinion and it is wholly possible and probably it only a matter of time until medicine catches up to the demand ,8,changemyview

Generic_On_Reddit, the new york times http nytlive nytimes com womenintheworld 2017 01 20 billionaire george soros has ties to more than 50 partners of the womens march on washington firstly i would like to express my contempt for the phrase has ties to for being incredibly loose and vague i feel like someone used to have actual control of another person or organization to be implicated but now this has ties to phrasing pushes the idea that anyone that has ever associated with anyone else implies complete control 25 of the organizations explicitly involved in the movement having loose associations with soros especially when many are justifiably involved such as planned parenthood is meaningless when someone like soros has grants and donations specifically for the type of social progressive organizations that would be involved this is exactly how those of us on the right feel about the supposed nefarious machinations of the diabolical koch brothers so you agree then the vast majority of the tea party protest was against perceived runaway government spending and government reaching beyond what the protestors saw as its constitutionally defined role which the government was doing for decades prior why then these were legitimate concerns that to those protesting also had a firm basis in reality you seem to have an in depth understanding of the movement can you ground it in reality debating the politics of the two groups runs the risk of getting lost in the weeds as the point of the post is not the politics of the movements but their perceived legitimacy based on outside groups helping to assemble them i am actually completely ignoring the outside groups of both i have not mentioned the beneficiaries of the tea party movement the entire point is in the weeds in both cases there were people who took to the streets to express opposition to things they objected to about those in power but obama was far from unique in expanding the government hand again he did not propose much that was actually knew the healthcare for example was something that had already been submitted and now the new administration wishes to repeal it not because the government is overstepping it bounds but to replace it with something else where is the outrage and republican protesting in that this almost sounds as if you would agree with me i have not submitted the idea that mere associations are enough my points were about the deeper legitimacy and falsifiability of the movements also you did not reply to my comments on the size of the movements being a major difference in how simple it is to fake and also the fact that groups with vested interests in the movement estimate the numbers of the tea party marches in the hundreds of thousands when organizations such as the city firefighters estimated in the upper 5 digits implies they were trying to represent the movement as larger and more common than it really was which fits the parameters of astroturfing ,5,changemyview

Generic_On_Reddit, similarly many of the groups helping organize the women march are either directly funded by or closely related to george soros firstly source regardless i have started to notice that soros allegedly gives money to everything under the sun and whenever anyone describes what he gains from it it always some abstract gain apart of some convoluted and maniacal plot it meaning increasingly less to me more importantly is not the point of astroturfing to masquerade sources or reasons of support to manipulate their perceived legitimacy for example bernie sanders had a grassroots movement with an average donation of 27 dollars giving the appearance that individuals were donating to his cause supporting him if another politician tried to use the same rhetoric claiming to be funded by many individuals but it turns out that it was actually just a few rich individuals donating extremely large amounts through shell organizations that appear to represent the average person that would be astroturfing giving the appearance that the supporters are different from what they really are the point being how do you astroturf literally millions of people not even including the related marches in other countries those people are real people that agreed with the message and chose to participate no matter who is organizing the marches you can sweep some people up in a fake movement and some of the actual supporters can play the part of something else but you cannot masquerade millions of people as anything besides millions of people a few differences can be argued firstly the perceived legitimacy of what they are protesting against as per an article that u gnosticgnome posted much of the protest was against obama as a socialist obama was never close to socialism much of what he proposed was incremental changes and plenty of it was something that was already proposed by people on both sides of the aisle is the idea that obama was a socialist the true reason for the protest or was that just the astroturf with a different underlying motive i do not personally care in arguing the point but it something to think about much of the source of the women march is due to trump perceived misogyny sexism being completely ignored and also his his vp and his party stance over abortion and other gender issues the former can be debated but the latter two are fairly certain in my opinion all fairly explicit in opposition to sum this point they were protesting against the muslim socialist non citizen commie obama that was coming to raise their taxes through the roof and take all their guns which we all know was a fictionalized version with little basis in reality what has been protested is definitely debatable in some respects but it has a solid foundation in reality the next difference is going to be in size of the movement the bigger the movement the harder it is to astroturf sweeping people up in something that is not real as u fynn the finger noted the tea party protests were significantly smaller while there seems to be a large variance of how many people were supposedly there many of the organizations without an interest in the movement reported noticeably smaller numbers as a tangent i would most definitely caution attempting to call a movement illegitimate simply because some wealthy individuals also support it it not realistic as every movement ever has had someone footing the bill whether it a protest a riot or an entire revolution someone is organizing and or funding it every time throughout history i could draw doubts about the american revolution using this logic or the independence of any nation or any coup or protest or riot it a meaningless observation in my opinion ,14,changemyview

Generic_On_Reddit, consider the situation there is a large influx of low skilled people into the country but since the majority of them are not entrepreneurs the number of jobs does not significantly increase this implies that the creation of jobs is dictated by an influx of job creators entrepreneurs but this is not true job creation is dictated by at least two relevant economic agents both of which are people in this scenario over the past few decades the mexican population has noticeably increased let name my city emigratopolis 30 years ago emigratopolis name was ironic because it had very few immigrants overall a mere 100 but a few waves of immigration came through and the city saw a large influx of low skilled workers suddenly the city has thousands upon thousands of immigrants first let ignore what jobs these immigrants get and just look at what this immigration does to the city and its economy the obvious part is that there is a bigger population now and that means it takes more to manage the city more people means more police needed more garbagemen higher water usage more public transportation usage so more buses or whatever businesses are busier with more customers so they hire more help etc more kids in the school means more schools and or more teachers and it often means more esl teachers in my experience as well more people also means more homes which means more people to service for things like cable internet other services more people to service for a plumber or an electrician it means more houses that need to be built for construction workers or more tenants to landlords there also the specialized job creation that comes from different immigrants emigratopolis now has a large spanish speaking populace they have to find people to meet that need the hospital now has spanish translators on call as does 911 as do numerous services emigratopolis also got a bunch of mexican markets and mexican restaurants operated by and catering to the new immigrant population the immigrants created a need for these thing in the general sense by being humans with basic needs and also created different jobs based on their differences in culture and language this wo not be one for one but an influx of immigrants certainly does create some jobs at least this is just on account of immigrants being consumers then there is the immigrant from another perspective labor the city had a finite number of workers before the immigrants came it still does but it did then too 100 factories competed for 15000 workers at 20 an hour 50 more factories would like to enter the market but if they did it would drive wages higher than the 20 it at and the companies there cannot afford that if a new factory opens they will just take the workers from another factory that cannot pay more than the 20 and that factory wo not be able to maintain production there simply a cap at how many factories can be in the city due to the limited work force and that cap seems to be the 100 but then emigratopolis gets its immigration wave and gets a few thousand more workers this raises the cap of factories the city can have because more labor is available 20 new factories open up and take that new labor without needing to raise wages to compete what originally capped the number of factories lack of labor is now higher so more factories can exist thus more jobs are created this is obviously extremely simplified but it just to illustrate that immigrants can lead to job creation ,9,changemyview

Generic_On_Reddit,evolution is about promoting traits that lead to successful reproduction all evolutionary progress is based on the idea that that which is able to pass on it genes social darwinism is not the natural conclusion nor is it conceptually consistent for a number of reasons 1 it in our nature to be social creatures and support each other as such this trait has led to our survival as a species 1 if someone who is a drain on society is able to gain support from those fit to survive it makes the drain also fit to survive this is in accordance with evolution edit which is to say they have a trait that leads to their survival the ability to gain the support of others similar to a parasite or symbiotic relationships 1 evolution is natural based on real dynamics between traits their survivability and their relation to reproduction instead of perceived value like with eugenics 1 evolution also allows a great variety of genetic outcomes and possibilities while artificial forms such as eugenics narrow the gene pool and reduce variety 1 evolution is about surviving wars make people die reducing war allows us to live without killing each other it would be an evolutionarily desirable trait for us to not fight each other 1 we can afford to take care of the less fit members of society evolution is again about survival and these members do not take away from our survival there are more reasons but these are the main reasons it just does not quite match up with evolution it misses the mark in concept execution and generally ignoring the mechanisms that resulted from our own evolution ,2,changemyview

Generic_On_Reddit, before i get into explaining my thoughts on sex i should state that i believe in an objective morality in other words i don t believe that humans created morality as part of our evolutionary development i believe that morality is inherently a part of the universe as much as math or physics you did not really justify this statement i have read some arguments that say that sex is moral when nobody is taken advantage of it s based on kant s categorical imperative for any philosophy fans in other words rape is wrong because the rapist is using the victim as a means to an end sexual gratification feelings of power etc as opposed to treating them as an end in and of itself i would say rape is wrong or immoral not because the rapist is using the victim as a means to an end but because the rapist is doing so against their will people can and often do use each other in a mutual sense businesses and the relationships thereof consumers employees etc use each other to each gain what they want consumer gets a product business gets money employee gets a job business gets a worker one partner gets sexual gratification the other partner gets sexual gratification a trade our society is built around these mutual benefits it treats sex as a mere biological appetite like eating or drinking that has relational connotations in other words it s a natural desire that one must be cautious to feed as it as it has the potential to be harmful to the victim all appetites have side effects of not indulged properly eating too fast can make you sick eating too much will make you gain weight of throw up eating the wrong things can cause health issues the fact that sex is an appetite with consequences is no different from other appetites i have a friend who was sexually assaulted and it produced a huge amount of trauma in her leading to feelings of worthlessness and disconnection from those around her bodily violations and violent encounters will do that to you i know people with trauma from being robbed or being in accidents or being yelled at it not particularly telling in my opinion i have also heard that sex inherently forms a relational bond between the two participants i have heard that people also love to have casual sex with no relational bond or even knowledge of the other person whatsoever it not my thing but people seem to enjoy it quite a bit studying the way humans relate to sex and the results of sex it seems to show that humans are oriented towards sex in a committed monogamous relationship that would make sense to me if we were like birds and mated for life but many of our cultures have histories of polygamy promiscuity etc i feel like the cultures and peoples that not only explicitly favored long term monogamous relationships but also stuck to them in practice are few and far between compared to the ones with polygamy free for all sex and promiscuity ,6,changemyview

Generic_On_Reddit,you are saying the indirect weight gain can easily be accounted for with lifestyle changes but that not accurate primarily in the immediate sense since the body does not tell you what your calories out actually is after changing not does it tell you your bmr no one claims that conditions directly cause fat to materialize in your deposits but unexpected drops in caloric output is effectively the same thing is it not something does not have to directly create something to be the only relevant factor indirectly causing or contributing to something is still causing nonetheless basically everything in our world is indirect causation from cause to ultimate effect whether it be smoking and cancer or metabolic fluctuations and weight gain and trying to find a meaningful difference between the two is rather pedantic in my opinion ,3,changemyview

Generic_On_Reddit, i have found no medical condition that directly causes the accumulation of adipose in the body where even without the consumption of food one would remain overweight i do not really understand why you believe it has to be a direct cause and think you are greatly oversimplifying the situation by deeming it indirect and thus instantly controllable a hypothetical person is at perfect balance with their caloric intake and output and has been doing so for several years they then contract a condition that causes their caloric output to drop for whatever reason do you think they should a gain weight or b drop their caloric input to to match their caloric output if you answered b you are either a special type of human for reasons i will elaborate on soon or you have just simplified the scenario far too much the person does not know they have contracted a condition immediately do not know that their caloric requirements have changed and do not know what they have changed to the person can only use your solution when they have had feedback that they are overeating but what is the feedback that they are overeating the body surely does not provide any notifications when your caloric requirements change the body also does not notify you when you have hit your caloric intake needs for a day the stomach will barely even notify you when it full for you to stop eating let alone if you have consumed too many calories so what is the first feedback for someone to know that the amount they were eating before is now too much the first feedback the body gives is gaining weight if they have not gained weight they likely wo not know and if they do not know they cannot really do anything about it so your solution requires them not only to gain weight but to know they have gained weight before it even possible to enact but it still not that simple in my opinion because the body does not tell you when it gains weight people are notoriously bad at noticing changes especially over long periods of time with marginal increases which people are especially awful at in all sorts of contexts day by day nothing changes but when you look back everything different so when should so one notice 5 pounds 10 pounds 20 as someone that has purposefully manipulated his own weight through weight training it can be incredibly difficult to notice that your weight has gone up or down unless you obsessively weigh yourself daily or analyze your every curvature in the mirror each day and there are several reasons some individuals may take longer to notice they have gained weight they have always been skinny and does not know what it looks and feels like to gain weight i have always been rather slim and unless i am actively trying to change my weight i do not think about it i have never gained weight without trying or normal growth so why would i pay attention to it their fat distribution is relatively evenly spread across their body this makes it even harder to notice weight gain because you are not just looking for a 10 increase in bodymass in your stomach you are looking for a 10 increase over the several feet of area that is your entire body i know i am especially shit at gauging my weight for this very reason the added weight is so thin overall that it offers no effect in any specific area and everything still looks the same size in relation to everything else the weight gain is in a place that you do not necessarily see or interact with that how you notice fat ultimately right you either see extra fat that was not there or you hit a fat roll that was not prominent a week ago well if my fat deposit was firstly in my arse i promise you would not notice for quite a while i do not look at it do not interact with it and all of my clothing is baggy and or stretchy no feedback if i gained in my stomach i would probably see it or feel an extra roll on my side when i lay down but i would not necessarily feel anything if i gained in my lower body then back arms for these reasons and more it could take a while for someone to notice they are actually gaining weight my girlfriend has gained weight recently and we did not really notice until she was 30 pounds in because it was marginal changes and evenly distributed proportional and that was more than enough to push her from normal to overweight and now you may think well once they notice their weight gain they can just adjust their eating accordingly and i would still disagree because it still not that simple the feedback of fat weight gain only tells you that you are eating too much it does not tell you what your adequate amount intake would be is cutting sugary drinks from your diet enough maybe maybe not you wo not know until you try for a week while weighing yourself perhaps you will learn it was enough and you lost did not gain weight or perhaps you will learn it was not enough and you still gained weight so you restart the process by cutting in other ways as well all while gaining weight along the way if the cuts are inadequate i have seen people have to cut several hundred calories from diets that were perfectly adequate a year ago you could just drastically undereat in order to lose the weight but that not really healthy either and does nothing to help you find the proper balance at the end of the day you are saying such things do not directly cause weight loss because they can be countered by diet control but that can only realistically happen once you have already gained the weight and even that is not an instant process

Generic_On_Reddit,but we cannot really make that assumption with differing business models we do not know how capcom profits or what they gain from tournaments especially when you factor in the intangible costs for example nintendo spent a ton of money marketing themselves as a family friendly console over the years especially since the wii which is why they have been distancing themselves from competitiveness associating with the competitive realm and the stereotypes there in such as the neckbeard is going to cost them the family social or casual market and you may think so what they should acknowledge this growing market for this reason and that reason and its important to realize that decisions like these then continue t be affected by other variables one example is that nintendo often enjoys experimenting in game design and features trying new things that could make the game more fun but the competitive scene does not necessarily enjoy change take for instance the preference of melee over brawl the small changes to smash make that market dislike the game and cling to the old one for longer catering to this market would mean they could not experiment as much in fear of upsetting that market another factor is that in my experience the competitive market has more overlap with spec junkies than the casual family market i am not sure if it true or not but it something nintendo would have to find out although i am sure they already know if true they might be inclined to up their specs to cater to this market increasing costs and or the price of the machine these are just some examples of possible ramifications of these decisions i am sure there are way more variables a few more i could list and several more we have no way of knowing we cannot really know whether it worth it for nintendo to cater to that market these decisions cannot be made lightly ,5,changemyview

Generic_On_Reddit, sure but if it not socioeconomic advantages like school or family income then what else would it be it is those things but it relative not absolutes you cannot make absolute predictions on income or schooling based on them but you can make relative inferences based on the data we have example let assume it to be true that due to discrimination blacks are promoted at a slower rate than whites in a company with 50 ranks from 1 entry level whatever to 50 a chief officer ie chief financial officer whites are promoted on average once every year with blacks promoted once every two years this fact being true is not going to allow you to predict anything about any given white because there are going to be whites in all levels you cannot pick a random white guy and say he a manager or he an officer but you can pick a random white guy and infer if you were black you probably would not have been promoted as fast as you did all other variables remaining equal the data is whites relative to blacks so we make inferences on the same grounds ,4,changemyview

Generic_On_Reddit,to have the quote in question nearby if the only thing keeping a person decent is the expectation of divine reward then brother that person is a piece of shit and i d like to get as many of them out in the open as possible this quote is basically based on an einstein quote and i am sure a few others i cannot currently recall if we are good only because we fear punishment and hope for reward then we are a sorry lot indeed i would say the spirit of the quote is just saying that if the only thing keeping you good is expectation of reward or fear of punishment in case of the einstein quote you are not good if i were to transfer it to your analogy then your i would state it as if the only reason you work is to receive a check you do not care about working and there nothing wrong with this because we do not really expect people to care about working another thing to keep in mind however is that most people do work for others when not expecting a reward there are people that volunteer there are people that go out of their way to help others for no reward whatsoever a person who only does stuff for their own reward would never help anyone else unless it benefited them we do however expect people to care about other people whether we should have this expectation or not is another matter entirely but here another quote from penn jillette that illustrates my argument in a way the question i get asked by religious people all the time is without god what s to stop me from raping all i want and my answer is i do rape all i want and the amount i want is zero and i do murder all i want and the amount i want is zero the fact that these people think that if they didn t have this person watching over them that they would go on killing raping rampages is the most self damning thing i can imagine i do not want to do that right now without any god i do not want to jump across this table and strangle you i have no desire to strangle you i have no desire to flip you over and rape you if someone did have these desires and were only stopped out of self interest whether that be greater reward or punishment would you describe them as a good person perhaps i would not describe them as a piece of shit but i certainly would not describe them as good because they do not actually care about other people thus in any encounter where punishment is not a factor they would be perfectly alright with screwing you over imagine a person where the law and its enforcement was the only factor for whether they would do the right thing or not in public with plenty of law enforcement sure they may be an upstanding citizen but there are a lot of contexts where this does not apply when no one watching there is no fear of punishment they will fuck you over that guy that steals your lunch from the fridge he did it because he does not care about you and he knew no one was watching the criminal that raped killed whoever etc did it because he does not care about others and does not fear punishment if you meet someone that only does the right thing by others in fear of punishment or expectation of reward in a context what happens when those factors are no longer in play they are very bad people ,1,changemyview

Generic_On_Reddit, when i talk about suicide for example its not that i think all men are going to kill themselves its that men are 4 times more likely than women to kill themselves so it is an issue that disproportionately affects men but it does not actually affect all men is my point and it something that people in the field have been addressing and studying to add some context a study https www cdc gov mmwr preview mmwrhtml ss6013a1 htm s cid ss6013a1 esuicidal found that women have just as many if not more suicidal thoughts and attempts than men did but what differed were the methods of suicide and rates of reaching out workplace discrimination also runs the risk of affecting all men because virtually all men are in the workplace sure but again it generally does not because the discrimination women face in the workplace is measurably worse relative to men it generally a non issue for men in almost all professions ,8,changemyview

Generic_On_Reddit,of course not 100 and i do not mean that either but you are still not really addressing my point the point being that the slights against men you have picked out are slights that the vast majority of men do not and frankly are not in the position to experience which is to say yes men die in the workplace far more frequently but most men do not choose these careers and even if you do you understand and are compensated for the risk yes men die on the battlefield more frequently but most men are not on the battlefield whereas women facing different types of workplace discrimination is something that can affect all women because virtually all are going to enter the workforce especially when you break down those statistics in their respective contexts many of them are not problems at all such as the disproportionate cancer funding as i have illustrated in another comment or are problems we are already working on fixing as every place i have ever worked at has bitched about osha trying to make the workplace safer to the worker inconvenience or statistics influenced by other variables that skew the statistics without an understanding of the context meaning a lot of these groups are going to overlap and an even smaller proportion of men are genuinely affected by these issues my point being again you are trying to present the statistics under the claim that men have problems too but these are not equivalent to women problems because most men will never encounter these problems and of the more common problems we do encounter from your list they only affect a very small part of our life instead of affecting it in the holistic sense ,6,changemyview

Generic_On_Reddit, most news about police brutality show only one side to the story and often times the victim escalated the situation unnecessarily and caused the officer to use excessive force i am of the opinion that officers should be able to both 1 handle a situation without escalating and 2 deescalate situations when needed which is to say a person being rude or hostile does not need to be shot a person being uncooperative does not need to be shot a person resisting arrest does not need to be shot whenever one of these incidents happen there always this discussion that the victim was not doing what he was supposed to be doing so it was his fault but i feel like this is such a slippery line of thinking as though talking back to officers is a executable offense sure at times the perpetrator may be escalating the situation but the officer is almost always escalating it further in pulling out a gun unless the perp pulled out a gun first escalating the situation to gun fight the officer is escalating the situation whether you believe the officer is right to do so is another matter perhaps but it is necessary to realize that they are most definitely escalators in the situation edit regarding your view i do not really think it a function of corruption i would not say these things happen because they are corrupt more so inadequate ,1,changemyview

Generic_On_Reddit,i do not quite understand it sounds like you are suggesting that one should rise among the rest perhaps by assimilating the most features but this cannot really be done to go back to evernote that basically exactly why they are not nearly as big as they once were from what i have heard they have every feature possible but there is not a way for them to have both all the features and be quick snappy and simple so the market for evernote and the market for google keep for example will never converge and i mentioned the reddit apps as an example of rather subjective differences they are all slightly different without one being obviously better for the most part they only have slight differences in lay out and design there likely wo not be a convergence on a single one because there is not really a surefire way to improve their apps so one can rise up as the best option for you or your company but there no guarantee that it will stay the best option for you i am quite satisfied with keep and slide for reddit but i test out every new note app and reddit app because the apps i use are not absolutely perfect it possible to find something better so people look there is no end game necessarily ,1,changemyview

Generic_On_Reddit,but i have not brought up any of that that irrelevant to the conversation entirely if wikileaks is about providing information to the people then they should release the information they have regardless of who it from and regardless of what they perceive the significance to be if it information we already know still release it because more sources of information is a good thing if it insignificant information release it because information is still good even if insignificant especially since small information is still required to form a holistic viewpoint this is not about the dnc or podesta or clinton they are irrelevant it about wikileaks living up to their claims if they are about freedom of information there is no reason not to release it it not even about dirt it about information good information is also important information to have so my question is why not do you have a potential answer you would like to pitch to that question or are you going to talk about the dems some more ,5,IAmA

Generic_On_Reddit, i also believe it makes everyone walk a little bit further every time they park often forces people to pay for parking when empty spaces are available but i do not agree that the rest of society should be required to make sacrifices you are not sacrificing anything you are not sacrificing the closest spots to the building because you do not own them and you are not entitled to them your parking spots are where they are and that pretty much it some space is reserved for others some space is reserved to you are you sacrificing because sidewalks are reserved for pedestrians are you sacrificing because some space is reserved for bike hubs are you sacrificing because useless shrubbery is taking up some green space in front of the building no you are not is a pedestrian also sacrificing because tons of space is allocated to car drivers my local grocery could be bigger and carry more of what i want if it did not spend 60 of the lot catering to drivers and a pedestrian would not have to cross an entire parking lot to get to an entrance none of this space is yours businesses do not have to provide parking to you it given to you as a convenience it so you do not have to park a mile away and spend half an hour walking to their store and since businesses give this to you as a convenience they also give handicapped folk a convenience because handicapped folk often have problems walking long distances whether they are unable to or it takes them longer my mother had a stroke a couple years ago where she could not walk long distances due to energy and muscular issues if there were not handicapped parking spots and she was not being driven by someone she cannot go end of discussion if she wants to go to dinner she would not be able to make it from the medium sized parking lot to the waiting area to rest if she wants to go to the grocery she would not be able to make it to the door to even get to the scooters people used you are condemning a lot of people to their homes by taking away handicap spots so businesses make these spots for the convenience of their customers and say we do not want them to walk forever but maybe they could walk for 45 seconds from their parking spot to the door they make regular spots where an able bodies person might average 45 seconds dependent on spots and they make handicap spots which could take them just as long or because parking close is the only way to make it into the building or perhaps because whatever their handicap is could make them need to get to their car fairly quickly is it favorable treatment sure we can say that but they give you the convenience at all for the outcome that you can get from your vehicle to their business in a reasonable amount of time ,11,changemyview

Generic_On_Reddit, i mean obviously we would all like less mass shootings but is it really a pressing concern of yours i think some people would like to have as little needless death as possible and anything that can lessen the death of our citizens is a pressing concern you are far more likely to die from our lack of good healthcare than you are from a mass shooting a problem many politicians have been trying to solve or from a distracted driver a problem everyone being trying to solve in policy advertising public opinion etc i have not either i also do not remember them promising to propose one that does not mean we have a gun control problem and do not have a mental health problem it just means the republicans tend to prefer tax cuts above all else i think he just wants them to address the problem if they do not think it a problem they do not have to address it but that not what they are saying according to op if they do not think it an issue they should just say mass shootings are not a problem so i suppose the options are 1 mass shootings are a gun problem liberals fix guns to fix the problem 2 mass shootings are a mental health problem fix mental health to fix the problem 3 mass shootings are not a problem do nothing he saying they are saying 2 but doing 3 either say 2 and do 2 or say 3 and do 3 ,9,changemyview

Generic_On_Reddit, since both would be identical it would not make sense to say one is more my consciousness than the other yes i have not contested this yes consciousness does not jumps as there no evidence of it being an autonomous entity so we are agreed yes but the only distinction is their location on space sure i guess the original body is destroyed but the replica has my consciousness which is what matters i would like to introduce some nuance in this statement the clone replica has a copy of your consciousness which is again identical to your original consciousness in every way i think it is very important to watch your uses of possessives in this conversation you say my consciousness but at the point you and the clone diverge into separate entities it becomes his consciousness even if it identical to yours he is he and you are you because you are separate entities albeit identical ones to connect it to your view title i would wake up in the other location still being me this is inaccurate because it depends on the perspective the reason i draw the comparison to cloning is because they are the same in that an identical copy of you is being constructed the only difference is in what happens to the source code you in cloning the source code remains in teleportation the source is deconstructed which is basically death the copy of you will feel the same regardless waking up still being you but the original is super dead no different from cloning you then killing you to simplify it further the replica wakes up being you just as a clone would the source code is dead ,1,changemyview
Generic_On_Reddit,right so they must have two separate but identical consciousnesses because the consciousness itself does not jump a new one is created so if you were cloned there would be no difference on any measurable level between you and the replicated version of you but you are still two distinct entities since teleportation is often described as reconstruction then reconstruction the original you is destroyed and a new you is created this is functionally the same as cloning someone and transporting them then taking an axe to the head of the original they are identical but one is being destroyed and another created just as you would not jump to possess your cloned body if you died you would not jump to possess your reconstructed body after yours is deconstructed the new you is a separate but identical version the fact that they are identical is completely irrelevant to anything i have said i am not disputing the fact that they are the same in every way even down to the point of the replica believing he a continuation ,1,changemyview

Generic_On_Reddit, the complaints about poor holiday time although they all get extra pay for working those days 1 other professions can be paid holidays without even working so i do not think the extra pay is really a consolation 2 it does not change the fact that these holiday times are often blackout days or otherwise non optional 3 some people value spending time with extended family over whatever extra money there is at one of my old jobs the thanksgiving shift started 5pm on thanksgiving for everyone that worked there which basically means no thanksgiving time for anyone then it went until midnight for some or 5am the next day for others those that stayed until midnight had to come back in at 5am the next day for black friday of course the store did not close in case it was not obvious in retail if a customer is mean to you you can just deal with them and then they are gone you probably never see them again but there is not always a way to deal with them because customers are not rational sometimes they are upset over something that does not even exist a non issue something out of your control something you are not allowed to do etc there is not always a just deal with them if there was it would not even be an issue and it does not really matter if you see them again because for every one you deal with two more will take it place no physical labor unless you count standing try working construction or landscaping or pulling docks out of lakes all day at the end of summer you are not going home hot cold wet sore sunburnt and dehydrated from your work in retail you work indoors i personally never had a problem with physical labor the work was always within the realm of what i was already fit for so while i might have been sore i could bounce back without issue i have always experienced way more break time from physically intensive jobs as well and becoming more fit only made it easier while i still have not figured out how to train my feet to stop hurting after a week of standing and walking for 8 hours a day when my body is sore i do not really notice unless i use the sore muscles for something so worst case i do not feel like going to the gym if my feet hurt i do not want to go anywhere that involves a lot of walking or standing which is basically everything but also and perhaps more importantly these people usually get paid way more than retail employees no risk of injury or personal danger in any labor job in any factory job in any job involving a laboratory or workshop area there s a perpetual and very real risk of injury in retail the most dangerous encounter you can have is if you re exceptionally poor at using a box cutter at the risk of repeating myself those people usually get paid way more than retail employees and have forms of compensation in case they are injured in a salaried engineering position you often work just as poor or worse hours as a retail worker i know several people in finance that are on 60 hr weeks with weekend travel during this season and during the spring i consistently work 50 hour weeks as an engineer sure but i am sure you are still paid more than 8 an hour and way more if you include all the intangible forms of compensation your job likely comes with in retail if you have a bad day or are sick or are hungover and you do not get some critical stuff done the world does not end you get yelled at or are told to stay a bit late to fix it and it no big deal or you just pass it off to the night shift to clean up your mess in other jobs if you miss deadlines you literally do not get the work and the company loses tons of money the store will likely be fine but if you cannot come into work you are not getting paid so yeah the company might be fine but you might be fucked along with the other stuff you said and also there is no way to work around it there no method of working at home if you want to get something done beforehand your deadlines can be manipulated to be on your terms for retail the shift is the shift end of story if there was a way to psychically fold shirts at home so they did not have to worry about doing it at home i am sure they would but also you get paid for the added responsibility of the deadline if you work in food you smell like grease and food for the rest of your day after work you also have to deal with the lunch dinner rush and equally poor management wages i think it worse than retail in every way there is also tons of complaints about working as a server this does not make retail complaints any less valid out of curiosity where exactly did you work in retail if it not too personal of a question or if you rather not disclose what type of store did you work at ,17,changemyview

Generic_On_Reddit, ok so for this example there is hypothesis data collection and peer review the three things you said must be present in scientific theory development or whatever did i say this i do not believe i did the hypothesis was if i eat less on one day then i will lose weight the data collection was do not eat so much one day and measure delta weight there are tons of issues with this type of experiment and this is the reason there is so much false science and misinformation around weight loss 1 the hypothesis is not if i eat less on one day then i will lose weight it if i eat less i will lose weight and they think the null is proved after too short of a collection period 1 or if the hypothesis is the former over the latter then the hypothesis is too narrow to be applicable and the results are generalized far past the scope of the experiment 1 without measuring calorie intake explicitly and objectively it cannot be known whether the participant actually ate less 1 without measuring calorie expenditure it cannot be known whether the participant had a caloric deficit 1 the sample size of 1 offers too much room for confounding variables 1 the peer review is not a peer review at all if they are not testing the same thing and replicating the experiment which is not possible to do when the previously mentioned variables are not accounted for 1 the measurement methods short time periods and poor observation of other variables means other personal factors are likely to affect the weights such as a simple error of weighing on an empty stomach at the beginning of a day vs weighing on an empty one at the end these are all reasons everyday beliefs are often worth jack shit when not validated by actual testing scientific theory and everyday belief are and are not the same thing being able to draw basic similarities which is what you have done does not make something the same you can draw structural similarities between a straw house and a brick one and you would be right on some level but the differences matter to the pigs and the wolf they are definitively and objectively not the same i am not convinced there is a difference and i do not think i could be convinced there is a fundamental difference in the two until we reverse engineer the brain so i am happy to leave it there the fundamental difference is the rigorous testing method and higher attention to details and variables that could invalidate data or conclusions ,1,changemyview

Generic_On_Reddit, these beliefs do not come out of nowhere and there always a hint of truth buried in them a hint of truth is completely different from something that is demonstrably and applicably true i will claim that there is not a single belief out there that i cannot analyze as i did with jim and bob in the factory i gave the example with common misconceptions on weight gain loss because a hypothesis was formed data was sought and peers agreeing and disagreeing reviewed it data being sought is meaningless if sufficient data is not collected the data is collected through unscientific means or inconsistent means which is what everyday beliefs are likely to do since people do not replicate their experiments germ theory of disease was initially rejected a doctor hands are not filth what a fool to suggest such a thing was i think the essence of the retort at the time yes germ theory and many other scientific theories such as evolution science on cigarettes etc were rejected because people everyday beliefs told them something different define rigorous vs non rigorous treating it like the scientific method seeking as much data as possible read a lot of data and recording it as to mitigate the possibility of bias reducing and accounting for confounding variables only drawing conclusions that can legitimately be suggested by the data refining conclusions as new data arises ,3,changemyview

Generic_On_Reddit, scientists are not perfect either there lots of resources on how scientists are human and make mistakes and are not robots that collect data and fit it to graphs using cold hard logic for 8 hours a day sure and that why we have people submit their data for review and peer evaluation consider a grunt worker in a factory who glues something together in some stage of manufacturing he might think maybe if i angle the glue spout like this the stuff sticks better then he will obviously try that method a dozen or more times then maybe he asks his friend hey jim you try doin this instead with the glue i think it works better but this is not the usual every day belief where workers doing the same thing every day can test their results in a scientific manner what about the everyday beliefs that lead to stereotypes and prejudice fueled by confirmation biases or the political beliefs that fly in the face of hard evidence there are plenty of instances where we have to force people to acknowledge the data that goes against their default mentality or everyday view many people have the view that it safe to multitask while driving even though its proven to be less safe some people have the everyday belief that modern medicine and vaccines are not good for you despite that not holding up to scientific scrutiny some people like trickle up economics even though history shows it does not work an alarmingly large number of people do not understand weight loss gain and have way too many everyday beliefs about them the number of times i have heard something along the lines of eating less alone wo not let you lose a lot of weight is staggering because people think they have data i ate less that one day and did not lose weight when their testing does not stand up to scientific scrutiny then there plenty of myths around the world around medicines charms etc that are supposed to have effects but do not actually do anything i believe a large part of the ivory trade is based on that for example there are tons of everyday beliefs people just have that go against the data and science we have some people treat their everyday beliefs like science and test it rigorously but most people do not ,4,changemyview

Generic_On_Reddit,i do not think the big 7 year old is really what his comment has issue with it the small ten year old that has to play with all the other normal sized or huge 10 year olds when i was in fourth grade i played football at a local league for the first time i was at the end of the age group i was in so if i wanted to play next year i would be bumped up to the next league but i was most definitely closer towards the beginning of the previous leagues weight range if i wanted to continue on i would have had to play in a range where the average had 30 pounds on me and there were players that were legitimately double my size this is in part because i was a rather small person but also because the age range was at least 10 15 or so mixing up pre barely pubescent with people that already got growth spurts this is especially important when your weight determined how big of a hindrance the padding was if you were too light the shoulder pads were likely too heavy for you and you could barely move but if you were big enough you could pretend like they were not there only widening the gap between weights experienced so the better you are a really big 7 year old will rarely be as good as a smaller 10 year old i do not think i agree with this statement in all instances either i agree conceptually but in some sports size matters more than others sure in basketball a small 10 year old with more experience is likely going to beat the bigger one with less experience but unless it the first day for the bigger one in football and they have never even seen a tackle the bigger one has a pretty huge advantage provided they have some basic skill since most players start around the same age and i kind of hate this too this mentality makes it way more difficult for people to start too because it gears all the competition and resources as people that have played their entire lives so if you want to jump in later good luck competing against professionals getting someone to spend the time to develop you and going through practices the coach built under the assumption that you have played for years ,3,changemyview
Generic_On_Reddit,i do not think this is the worst progression considering one thing people hated about cable was that you got hundreds of channels you never wanted just to access about 3 now you can just pay for the 3 channels more or less skip the ads and all that other bullshit and watch whenever you feel like it i feel like with this model channels are in more obvious direct competition with one another before you only had to compete in the timeslot being the best thing on air for the half hour now if you do not have a half dozen shows a customer thinks are worth following you lose they wo not pay for your streaming end of story i think it will increase focus on great shows instead of just having something to fill a timeslot i would personally prefer it if we had it all under one big netflix umbrella but i think we were naive in thinking netflix could have it all for 10 month ,7,movies

Generic_On_Reddit,i want a source that its going away on account of pc gaming they do not need an advantage other than being idiot proof ease of use and simplicity is a genuine advantage that increases the usability and enjoyability and people seem to severely underrate their importance as well which is why for years i have been seeing how this year is the year of linux because windows does not have any more advantages besides being more accessible and a bit more user friendly than most distros and for years i have been seeing how android is going to eat the iphone lunch with this new version because it much more feature rich and useful overall and has no drawbacks besides not following the it just works mantra quite as closely i say this as someone that uses linux and android but i recognize that the forces that dominate the marketplace are there at least in part because they are easier to use because they are idiotproof or how about in the opposite direction when years ago tons of people on forums thought instagram and twitter would never become popular because why would you want to only post pictures or why would you want to be limited to 140 characters when you can do what they did on facebook already because people do not understand the value of simplifying their user experience even if something else is objectively better you can look at tons of consumer industries ease of use and idiot proofing is going to take the prize the majority of the time a lot of the growth in the pc gaming market that i have noticed is a result is attributed to the growth of the indie gaming segment which is a niche in and of itself and one consoles do not compete in and developers like rockstar still think it okay to treat pc gamers like shit the majority of the time so yes i ask for a source that the consoles are being taken down by pc gaming ,12,changemyview
