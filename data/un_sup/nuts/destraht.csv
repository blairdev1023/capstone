destraht,also i really suggest dual booting linux and windows or buy a second machine for this an older thinkpad x220 or x230 is ideal for it due to price and perfect compatibility until you feel comfortable enough to use it as your main os dual booting into linux or using an entirely linux notebook will force you to deal with it if you end up using windows then you will still very likely be using linux virtual machines to do your work unless you stay 100 in the microsoft ecosystem which i recommend against and if you are using macs then the command line knowledge will transfer over very well you need a solid unix background i think that not having a solid grasp of linux is a terrible handicap now ,1,TheRedPill

destraht,one time on the northern california coast a guy blazed right by a parking turn off on a windy road with brutal cliffs and just fucking goes straight over the edge instead of turning a 75 degree hard turn to the right with rocky cliffs above and below figure like this https shiftingthebalancedotcom files wordpress com 2012 05 p1000067 jpg but probably 2x as tall my friend says oh he dead and being the cynical guy just started walking over there i quickly jogged over and i see that he landed on a really bushy firm tree like it was an angelically placed cotton ball with a really splatty boulder on one side and plummets to death nearly everywhere else so the car is sideways about 50 60 feet down the steep grade and he is climbing out of the car with an unspilled beer in his hand also amazingly the place that he went off the cliff is one of the few places that does not immediately drop off at near 90 degree angle luckiest fucker ever ,2,Whatcouldgowrong

destraht,what ,1,elderscrollslegends
destraht,man i backed off pussed out on several fights where i was alone and a guy with a group of friends wanted to fight for various reasons i just figured that if i lost then i was going to take a beating and if i was winning but locked up on the ground or whatever then the friends were going to get off some punches or kicks or a full on beating to save their friend or for immediate retaliation so either way some ass beating i had reason to believe that this was fairly likely since i had seen it before and it was part of the lack of character development of the middle class suburb kids without parents in their life enough of the time and a very undeveloped street culture of just general boredom it just seemed like the one on one fight was a cheap ruse also one time that i did not follow my own advice this particularly happened where i was blind sided with a hard punch to the temple when i was definitively winning then of course the story was that i got my ass beat but i had at least two hard witnesses of what happened since it was just dark for me for a few seconds to find the guy getting some kicks in before i could just grab his legs i was a wrestler for some seconds to take away his momentum it was like waking up to find out you are in a fight and just holding on until you come to your senses so ya that happens edit i will add that after i came to some sort of reasonable senses in 5 10 seconds i knew that someone else had gotten into the fight although i had no idea exactly what happened also two sets of kicking legs on you helps to fill in the blanks a little oh ya so thinking waay back the guy that jumped me was cornered in a bathroom by another guy who was not my friend but disliked the guy and resented what was done to me by his account he got in his face alone in a bathroom and while threatening him demanded to know why he got into the fight and his response was that his friend was wearing his very expensive shirt and he did not want it to get destroyed just how it goes also having a proper rematch was not an option unless i wanted to risk getting suspended for days and putting myself in a situation where i needed to sign a highly extremely restrictive contract with the school to be able to graduate normally also if the wrong people find out that you have signed this contract then people who you can otherwise whoop ass on can bully you high school kind of sucks really ,2,StreetFights
destraht,i had a brother ten years older than me and i would try to kick his ass and he would beat me just shy of damage and i would wince it off and then go at him again many times it taught me to be tough but it would have been nice to learn the basics of how to kick someones ass instead of just how to take a beating i am still a bit embarrassed with some of the awful punches i threw in middle and early high school ,1,StreetFights

destraht,ya i have read several times on r theredpill about guys who just started off on the wrong foot in high school and had a miserable time and then transferred to another school and quickly reinvented themselves to being super popular and getting laid maybe this kid did some dickish move early on or just clashed with the wrong popular kid but then the continued mistreatment becomes very unwarranted and takes on a life of its own ,0,StreetFights

destraht,ya man the card just seems unreasonable how many decks can play or even have access to cards that can bomb out an entire lane imo 9 mana is far too little for a card that threatens to simply end the game the next turn even if you are at 20 life and with a board ,1,elderscrollslegends
destraht,with our luck they would film the beating in portrait ,2,StreetFights
destraht,i think that atromancer is just too good because it seriously overpowers quite a number of other late game cards strategies i have tried making so many different decks lately with greedy late game and i will get blasted to hell with two back to back atromancers imo the card sets two low of a floor on powerful plays i think that it needs to have a drawback or to be priced differently i think that they only priced it at 9 so that lightning bolt cannot be used on the same turn as it but its just not enough imo perhaps not being able to play it on a shadow lane or just some kind of limitation or maybe it summons both of them in the same lane so that at least there are ways to bomb out the entire lane with future cards and a few that exist now ,1,elderscrollslegends
destraht,so i guess that you would have needed to suicide all of your minions into it ,1,elderscrollslegends
destraht,well handlock is an interesting match but the game could be more than just that and with no counter play other than simply not doing damage there could be cards that deny ruin draw and priced accordingly for that strong ability there could be cards that allow scaled benefits for being ahead on life every 10 life draw a card etc there is one endurance card that allows you to draw when the other player draws on prophecy and strength card to deal 1 damage on ruin pop another one to draw if a ruin has been popped but that is about it ok so lets say that i managed to beat you down to 19 life and i am at 43 after abusing some drain and leaf water blessings shenanigans then i think that i should be able to draw 2 cards off of that without paying through the nose for the right if that is a possibility then i think that it evens the game plans by not allowing the other player to just be a little bitch and only stall they might even need to play some threats in such a circumstance ,1,elderscrollslegends
destraht,someone that succumbs to that sort of lets be honest here very light pressure has poor character development him being put onto his ass here in such a gentle way is probably the best thing that ever happened to him ,1,StreetFights
destraht,i cannot say about brain damage but maybe it was mostly being forced to take a good hard look at your surroundings realizing that it was not all that great i spent 2 years of my 6 5 in a stupid california party university city and i would not want to go back so man i lived in ukraine for years and also central america and i really have grown to despise us college culture western spring break culture and uk stag party culture etc its just not very good imo about having fun how can you enjoy yourself when you know that you are among monsters without decency so like hahahaha this party is so much fun but you are looking for that sucker punch coming from nowhere not my kind of fun really also it depends largely on where you are i have seen english in particular throw the worst kinds of sucker punches like it was nothing and i have been informed that it happens quite a lot in that culture so not trying to just pick on english but if i am around some edgier seeming english guy and there is even a slight irritation there then i am definitely on guard because i perceive anything to be possible again not really relaxing ,1,StreetFights
destraht,i think that was a somewhat reasonable second hit since he could have simple gotten back up and continued the fight he was not necessarily over yet ,116,StreetFights
destraht,broken game in this way handlock ,1,elderscrollslegends
destraht,its frustrating because it seems like every good deck precisely is designed to lose 2 3 ruins and then stabilize or if its aggro it just uses the ruin draw as fuel to win so if the devs ever want to have the life gaining be a real strategy then they need to make some seriously big advantages once the life total gets up high typically when playing lots of life gaining to power the cards that benefit from this i find that in order to power the cards effectively you need to push too hard and then you just run out of steam so the life gaining sprigin and the new white and green mane just do not work well together ,2,elderscrollslegends

destraht,they are going to need to majorly fix how the game makes it appear as if the opponent is actually taking forever to complete his turn when it fact it is a connection issue on the user side and the game is unable to recover and wastes precious time misinforming the user about the current state totally blows and it will be much worse on mobile the base programming is not even close to good enough now ,2,elderscrollslegends

destraht,i think that the real downside that nobody seems to be talking about is just never detaching from the social proof game long enough to enjoy moments for themselves so instead of people sometimes maybe once a week or once a month having some good times and embracing the moment they are always thinking how would a third party think of me sitting here like this or seeing themselves as actors in a movie while they are sitting on a towel a the beach imo this behavior mentality diminishes the quality of life and promotes anti social vanity it encourages people to feign extra excitement and happiness in moments when it is unnecessary and they are already genuinely happy enough ,3,TheRedPill

destraht,ok but lets say that when the cancellation system which is cludgy because its tied in with cc systems removes it from the pending status the queue then the shipping system sees that the item has been billed and it reserves it by marking the item with a state then the cancellation system cannot fully cancel the order because it is being shipped even though the box has not moved then the item is active in the pool of items that need to be processed immediately so there are two ways that each system can interact with each other and that is for system a to poll system b or for system b to push to system a i am also thinking that the build to order system hooks into shipping in a different way than the pre built units with about five different examples with specific timing most of their infrastructure could be figured out ,2,thinkpad
destraht,no i am just reasoning about the process ,1,thinkpad
destraht,i am guessing that it completely pops the item off of the queue and then there is some state there that causes it to appear as a completed order when it has already been billed then if the wonky and separate shipping system reserves it from the pool of available orders before the wonky and separate cancellation system reserves it then it gets shipped off and there is no reversing the process it once that has happened even if it is just a flicked bit these are separate systems held together with duck tape and there are all sorts of race conditions and they likely do not check for the appropriate flags due to bad programming then if many people fall in love with their notebook and do not send it back then there is little reason to look into fixing the bugs check out this article about a guy who setup his own bank https www sovereignman com trends i never knew how screwed up global banking was until i started my own bank 21494 ya windows vista for reals ,4,thinkpad

destraht,i would say that in the streets there are tons of not great looking women but it appears to not be difficult to get one i will compare looks wise to ukraine but the big difference here is that women do not appear to have a suppressed sexuality and they are willing to take chances although they are on average not as naturally good looking but are more vital i think that basically if a woman here decides that she likes you then she will be trying to have sex with you that is not always the case in the world as women can become quite heady with the strategy of it i have not felt a need to plow through numbers because i found a great looking woman who is half my age its been super easy so far except that about ten days into knowing her she pulled an epic and typical colombian jealousy shit test as was trying to lay down rules i was not even looking for another woman because really for me if i am having sex four times in a day with a woman who is giving me all of the bells and whistles then i am content so i was an inch from breaking up with her and in words i actually did so but then she changed her tune completely and its been good for weeks now she is a woman and so she tries to do what she can and how specifically she does that is based on the culture and here it says to be supremely jealous and to fuck their man perfectly to keep him on the hook and then on the other side to ride his ass about other women i just let her know that i am not going to have the peace fucked with because she wants to feel extra special some moment i think that here in colombia you can be into a good relationship after being here for a few weeks or so and that its possible to be having some sort of sex within days to a week i rested up my first few days and then i went to a heavy gringa area in medellin and since i was fresh i banged a slightly fat canadian woman within a few hours to get myself in the game then i immediately decided that i did not want to spend any more time in that decadent and played out western tourist scene just get away from foreigners as much as you can once you have gathered the useful information that is not where you want to be at although due to amenities and the practicality of it you will likely be around a fair amount of them i will say that the western women around me are funny they get butt hurt easily when i do not go for them after a week or so and then they all seem to hit a point where they have trouble looking me in the eyes colombians do not seem to run that buggy os and they appear to try harder when they like a man and they also stay cordial westerners are butthurt egoists ,3,TheRedPill

destraht,thanks i was looking up zix and it did not show up i think that playing more zyx or playing more decimus are both viable strategies its just that zyx often feels pretty bad to play without support and when under pressure its too dependent on godhammer and i am not playing razorskin 1 attack and a pet ,1,duelyst
destraht,some demographics have mean fucking women i grew up in an area where if i was not exactly what a woman was looking for then there was a very strong possibility that she would reject me in the meanest way possible so i did not have any real girlfriends in school and only just some lays here and there then in junior college only five miles away in a completely different environment i started having tons of interest from extremely attractive foreign women or just women from other states foreign to northern california i still do not like the women in my high school area they really are terrible ten years after high school i managed to fuck a few of the girls from my high school era and they still are not where it is at now i am in colombia seeing an 18 year old black chick with model looks my american friend in ukraine is a bit jealous when i showed him her pics and i describe what she does and how she acts and i know exactly the kind of talent that is over there i am fairly confident that 99 of ukrainian and colombian men will never have to put up with the sort of mean spirited bitchy and entitled crap that i did growing up and for women who on a global competitive level do not measure up sure ukrainian women are in total heady and gamey but not in a way where they inflate their value to stratospheric levels also i want to add that i was the fastest sprinter at my school and strongest wrestler to prove that i was in seriously great physical shape if i looked liked that growing up in colombia i would have had tons of insanely uncontrollably horny colombian women licking my balls even if i was a bit awkward starting out so this is for some 17 20 year old guy who feel like he has enough boxes ticked but just is not getting results and possibly does not much like the women he is surrounded with results or without ,1,TheRedPill

destraht,i think that it would be better if it cost 6 and gave 2 attack ,1,duelyst
destraht,this is the list as far as i can remember it i do not think that it is very refined yet the strategy is to play lots of cards and to make them run out of hard removal i need a second decimus for the burst damage but i like having other things to do with the draw so that my board does not just get overrun also when it comes to playing godhammer i will play it 4 5 times even if the enemy can ping it 1 2 times unless its an obvious and complete waste the idea is to overwhelm their decision guess making capabilities and to have something stick for a moment at 1 mana godhammer can be a very scary for them throwaway edit i like the single zyx since it can clean up wraithlings and has good buff potential probably planar scout can be removed for much higher potential 2nd decimus 3 flash reincarnation 3 greater fortitude 1 zyx 3 blood tear 1 planar scout 3 godhammer 3 gro 3 natural selection 3 tectonic spikes 3 vindicator 3 moloki huntress 3 draw puppies 1 decimus should be 2 i think 1 spelljammer 2 lava slasher 3 makantor beast ,2,duelyst
destraht,i am at rank 4 and climbing fast with a hybrid deck and the trick is to make the godhammer not to be essential to the play strategy the card helps me to smooth out my mana curve and if it sticks around for 2 3 turns even doing nothing then its fine because it instills doubt ,1,duelyst
destraht,i am slowly climbing at rank 4 now with a similar deck that is far less spammy i am playing 3 vindicators and only a single decimus because i only have one and i think that two of them would be ideal there are six major large body threats in the deck with 3 huntress plus 3 vindicators also i am playing 3 gro because its amazing when it sticks with a huntress and a godhammer i am also playing 3 flashes 3 draw puppies and 3 of the 2 2 buff card i will always use the 2 2 immediately to protect a minion until there is a next turn makantor play since i will be drawing so damn much that i just need to throw them off balance for a single turn there is one conditionally supreme third turn kill with vindicator by flashing it out onto the mana spring as player 2 and then putting a draw puppy in front of it then just start charging forward and play tectonic plates to buff it it does the same damage as decimus and can hit twice against certain factions it can kill on turn 3 4 edit also by playing less swarm the natural selection gets a lot more value and i play three of them and no other removal by playing little swarm that cannot buffed to be higher stats i am able to get reliable tempo swings and just keep throwing down the threats my deck draws so much that the godhammer is often just a clean way to get a card out of my hand for a one mana its great to watch them scrambling trying to ping off my artifact when its not a critical part of the strategy if they leave either of the vindicator or huntress they threaten to be such a snowball that even a swarm opponent feels that they have to remove it immediately rather than to develop their board they always need to worry about a makantor cleaning up their filth and one smack with a buffed minion should seal the game i suspect that my opponents are thinking that i am running 3 decimus and so giving space is never an option for them edit also i have been experimenting with the 1 mana airdrop minion to secure better locations and to steal mana tiles it seems to be good ,3,duelyst
destraht,without much effort i am thinking about something like 3 mana to do 2 damage and cannot stack it is then vastly more useful later in the game and its also hard to combo it with arcanysts ,1,duelyst

destraht,i cannot see how anything that does not swing the game immediately at 7 9 mana having a place in the game as long as fae is super popular and comboing 1 2 mana removal spells with cards like blue and generating value to replace their spells so say that you play that dark nemesis and then fae runs away and plays blue and then aspect of the foxs or colds your nemesis and then bb you for another card now you are hugely behind ,2,duelyst
destraht,its super fun until into diamond rank and then its obvious that there are broken cards in the game its still fun but the brokenness does make me prematurely turn the game off sometimes still though you should have well past a months worth of playing before you would regularly hit the big problems in the game they are nerfing cards and while much better than games like hearthstone its still very slow ,1,duelyst

destraht,i think that its all pretty great although i would have liked to have seen kelaino tried as a 2 4 for a while to see if she was a bit less of a problem next i would love to see the egg programming completely reworked so that they are a minion tribe and then showing in some way what it turns into on the picture and having its ability be that it transforms this will allow ghoulie to be used to power lava lance and that tempo swing could push eggmar towards being viable also it will just be a lot easier to figure out what the eggs are by looking at them its probably a lot of work but the game will be a lot more polished with it also in that same way i think that wraithlings should be reworked so that they are a tribe for example there is already a wraithling lackey the 1 1 and a big beasty 5 5 one how they did the programming on that is not entirely clear they do not necessarily need to produce tons of wraithling tribe cards but over the next several expansions 1 2 more would be nice there are cards like to double a wraithlings power but that is obviously pretty weak as it is now then i would love to see mechs reworked somehow so that they are less gimmicky and all in like how quest rogue is at the moment in hearthstone it just feels very unsatisfying to lose to a mech perfect draw when i am playing a faction deck that has zero way to respond to an 8 8 untargettable range unit in the corner on turn 4 i think that the idea that mechs are building towards something was great but at the moment its just about the only perfect draw instawin left in the game against certain decks ,1,duelyst
destraht,i would estimate that 1 6 times that he is played it will kill me the next turn and i just concede i have been killed tons of times by my opponent dropping one and then smacking me for not tons of damage and then i kill it and then he drops a second one the very next turn ,3,duelyst
destraht,chyrsalis was killed atm but like they wrote it allows other egg based synergies and they could print more ways to hatch eggs at 8 9 mana it would deserve to be a powerful combo ,1,duelyst
destraht,more egg affects could make it more of a late game finisher though next but far more hard developer work i would love to see eggs be a minion type and then to have the picture and name be something about which type of minion it transforms into then of course lava lance becomes viable after a ghoulie play and that could enable the egg based decks without so many new cards ,3,duelyst

destraht,do not take this as hostile so would you be happy if 2 of the factions received more position heavy themes in the next expansion also do you think that its ok if not every faction cares about that so then one faction is working the angles flank backstab joust etc and another deck does not care about that except to not let the opponent benefit then also some games are two decks that do not care about it so much either so what if lyonar flank works with provoke well to set it up but flank bonuses are modest and vanar got position heavy themes and songhair already has backstab and that is imo plenty so not every deck needs to care like fatties vs swarm tactics text vs stats etc ,2,duelyst
destraht,i think that lava slasher should be nerfed to only being able to hit diagonals that is still a lot of power but something to play around plus its kind of cool ,1,duelyst
destraht,i think that the game is pretty close to having everything such as swarm vs fatties vs solo army positioning vs fatty plops card text vs fatty plops tempo vs value mobility vs provoke ranged although i think that the next expansion really needs to add in some more intricate tile and positioning tactics i do not think that its necessary that every deck is a position heavy deck one deck could be trying to get a position while the other deck says fuck your position and plops a fatty that forces the opponent to get an amazing position bonus to even come out fair but devs you guys really need to add some more fancy trick stuff in the next expansion to keep the hard core players happy so something more chess like in that putting a minion or general on one square vs the square next to it ends up really mattering again not every deck needs to care about this but it needs to be more present in the game edit i am happy about both nerfs and both buffs ,1,duelyst

destraht,the art is great and they made an expansion that incoming players can ignore for a while they did not just add must have cards to every deck to ensure that people need to buy the expansion asap but instead they worked to increase the diversity of the game with this expansion i hope to see several more minion icons in the deck replay lists greater diversity ,1,duelyst

destraht,what about just 1 collector in the deck at 2 mana you can mulligan aggressively for that 1 card and you would have a lot better chance of getting that 1 card on the mulligan then exactly drawing it the turn that you want to play something big for a discount then it is only 2 mana so you might even be able to squeeze it down first edit and i think that there is a very big difference between 2 mana and 3 for a collector ,1,faeria
destraht,maybe though you could add just a few mana efficient collectors it seems to me that you could play a single 2 mana card and still be able to cast stuff on turn 3 even if it was killed better yet if they spent 2 3 mana to remove it since you would be no worse off and it would just have slowed them down a tiny bit ,1,faeria
destraht,scoped css ,5,javascript
destraht,i agree that those nerfs were very nice the issue that i take with those 10 or so different lists is that i am seeing extremely similar cards across them to the point that most of the cards in the set are filler then perhaps next expansion some of those other cards will become useful again but then it will just hard push out other ones so most of the set sits idle and other lists will only be different in having about 5 10 different cards from other decks of the same class and then much of those neutral cards will be the same compared to other similar decks of other classes i am sure that there must be some relevant statistical formulas to compare the top decks to each other against the entire set i can only qualitatively give my assessment here and if someone could run this formula then i think it would give some shocking hard numbers edit so for a quick eyeshot you can look at the 3 4 units listed on the replays list and its obvious that its the same narrow strategies over and over again ,1,duelyst
destraht,i do not know anything about that but underground tunnels are kind of crazy i have been through the tunnels nearby odessa and i am tall so it kind of sucks to be bending over walking with my head sideways those things can be deep and twisty as fuck to the point that this one guy was able to just hide out down there during wwii and a farm had a tiny hole in which they supplied him with water and food they knew that he was down there but just could not find him point is that there can be a whole world down there like drow elves with camouflage spells and shit and we would not know as far as i am concerned pedophile vampires moving kids through dc is well within the realm of possibilities ,92,conspiracy
destraht,if i am correct then i understand where counterplay is coming from because who would not want the kind of cash that blizzard is making in this sense it would be like a pc maker just trying to copy the apple model but then maybe that does not fit their market as well also duelyst is a much more complex game than hearthstone and it arrived after a few generations of abused hearthstone players left that game and so i have my doubts if it will work out as well for them with a less casual user base that has already been through the wringer i am increasingly looking at the balance aspect of the game more as a business decision of theirs rather than them being unable to observe and correct it ,1,duelyst
destraht,i think that i have hit my limit for now because unless i am wrong i suspect that they will be developing the game along the hearthstone model i do not mean that it will be as random but that they wo not really be balancing much at all and instead almost entirely focusing on having the new content countering the old content so then the game just goes from one imbalance to the next so if you have not played the game in a while then it all seems so wide open but then as you get up in the rank it becomes painfully obvious that there really is not much choice beyond about 5 10 lists then there is very little opportunity for me to create an original viable deck because within each class there are certain extremely op combinations that force most of the other cards out of the meta i personally do not enjoy winning at a low percentage of say about 35 40 because i have chosen to not play one of those few tight lists then they will say that bad cards are good for arena meh it all just feels like a repeat of some intensity about something that i already found to be unsatisfactory in hearthstone ,4,duelyst
destraht,actually its a lot more effort to be posting here than it is to netdeck and grind ,0,duelyst
destraht,it was before my time but when people started complaining about things in america their detractors coined love it or leave it and they retorted with change it or lose it there are just always going to be more people who cannot imagine being able to change anything through complaints petitioning or creatively and all that they ever do is adapt to arbitrary conditions and then eventually drop out of participation ,1,duelyst
destraht,i am a software developer and a published author a real book i understand this concept called iteration and revision i realize that there are a lot of people out there who never truly create anything and so just have not internalized this concept that things can be changed because they have only ever been spoon fed content and have never self actualized the creative process is this you things can be changed and complaining can be a step before rebelling which is in this case leaving the game ,13,duelyst
destraht,is there anything in a game that you have ever thought simply should not be there ,0,duelyst
destraht,you keep assuming that if i am complaining about it that i just simply cannot beat it even though i have let you know that it is not the case for me the very existence of coin flip mech lists is to me analogous to needing to bribe the border guard 20 to pass without issues true story and although it barely dents my wallet i am noticing that it really would be better if this did not even need to happen and then you reply with learn to make more money get a job you baby you need to just accept all things because we all know that nothing has ever changed due to complaints in the history of everything that ever has been and ever will be and then my favorite learn to take the back roads yes the existence of the coin flip rush mech lists are just wrong for the game ,0,duelyst
destraht,even just a scatter shot of 1 1 to health and attack across many cards would help them to see play i honestly smile after mildly cursing when i get countered with a card that only see once every hundred games if that if i wanted to see the same few cards over and over again then i would play poker ,1,duelyst
destraht,i think that this is the reason that there needs to be larger balance patches mid cycle between releases when a meta first starts iterating then there is room for interesting offbeat cards and then they all get optimized out unfortunately for me i use linux and an ipad only and so i have limited game options i have had a lot of fun playing duelyst but i am finding myself sort of idealistically uninterested in further supporting a game development model that will just continue to do this over and over again i have had enough of that in hearthstone unfortunately i think that just about every business is going to be like this since its so easy for a board to just say do it like hearthstone apple etc ,1,duelyst
destraht,its continuously been at least that over several days ,-1,duelyst
destraht,well it looks like counterplay is now going to be focusing all efforts on these big expansions and essentially ignoring the meta for prolonged periods of time and then countering the previous meta with the new cards just like hearthstone it probably is a good business model but after getting really intense into a game like this for some weeks it quickly loses appeal because i see how flawed the card set is but then they got my money and so they are unlikely to realize just how dissatisfied that i am with the game one day there will be a game where the devs will get it right ,2,duelyst
destraht,he is not interested in the reality that you present here as it goes against his implicit insults humble bragging and just general small mindedness ,-5,duelyst
destraht, it so sad that this game has so many cool concepts that are nearly unplayable outside of gold and yet a deck whose core gameplay requires zero thought and has not changed since beta is still being used in the upper end of the ladder well said and those are my exact sentiments if you look at tehthespians comments you can see exactly the sort of sentiment that i do not agree with and that is someone who is only looking at the small picture wants to simply repeatedly reassert and humble brag about how the deck is beatable and that it is not the end all be all of a deck and so anyone who does not just beat the deck is deficient to the point that they probably should not even bother getting out of bed in the morning at this moment i am a high diamond player and that means that i can play slightly unusual decks to get to rank 5 and that i am able to beat gold players with optimized deck lists however then suddenly the meta becomes incredibly orthodox and the fun starts bleeding away as i inch closer to s rank then recently i have been watching games in s rank diamond and gold and the deck variety is really incredibly narrow as the higher ranks are achieved there are so many cool mechanics but they just do not see play as they are unviable at high levels the deck diversity seems largely false to me and that there is only really diversity across different metas on the long term ,3,duelyst
destraht,3 10 matches on my replay list are a mech deck you are fine with that or are you just too defeated to realize that counterplay could instantly make that not the case ,-8,duelyst
destraht,again with the it can be beat argument ,-3,duelyst
destraht,i have been seeing tons of mech lists on the s rank replay list i find that people always say about hated decks that they can be beat as if that was not obvious that it was not somehow unwinnable to play against its simply that the presence of this shitty boring deck clogs up space in the environment the fact that so much of the decks continue to be mech and that it is in fact viable means that many other cards will never see play then flash forward to six months from now and guess what we are still playing against the tiresome mech lists and one year from now same shit ,0,duelyst

destraht,the way that i have come to understand it after having lived in ukraine for years is that much of this stuff was originally tried in the ussr but the issue was that so many men had died that it could only go so far with a limited supply of men and the men continued to die much earlier than women the ussr women were real ball busters and as we discuss often here no women can really respect their men when they have allowed themselves to become powerless its translated differently and only rhymes but in ukraine i often felt like that i was in a bizzaro 1950 america with a futuristic element and in reverse imo there is much evidence to support the thesis that what has been implemented in the us and western europe is something that was tried in the ussr but quickly failed due to the plan being infeasible when tens of percent of the men died it was impossible to diminish their value and power beyond a certain level because of supply and demand the goal is to take away men power because they are the only ones who are ever going to do anything about it by getting up and trying to kill you when you piss them off too much women are thrown in for free once the men are conquered so it just played out differently with on one side complete and utter economic enslavement of men women are fine enough with this men cannot handle it and drink to death and on the other side its men being lessened to such a degree that they are afraid to twitch an eyebrow wrong towards a woman its the cucked men who are not even allowed to have their own political opinion against their feely hillary voting women this group is not dominating yet without opposition yet but then the ussr was not born in a day either i see it that much of the bolsheviks and power center of the ussr was under eurasian khazarian jewish rule and that the eu is today dominated by these same characters in a strange reversal where in russia they are powerful but not absolutely in control of the country but just merely disproportionately powerful putin dethroned a number of jewish oligarchs who had accumulated immense wealth after the fall of the ussr because they were already in a strong position and then these guys ran to london the original birth point of the rothschild created and controlled modern banking system in what i see as the seed of the next era of anti russian everything so ya much of the western social scientists were jews including marx and they colored the sciences with their viewpoint control hollywood global banking victimhood is the ultimate status in the hyper liberal far west now and the original super protected victim class was the jews its only natural for other groups to have emulated this since that is what the high profile and high status group was doing people emulate what is successful hollywood jews are still highly jealous and protective of their victim status and they essentially prohibit epic sad genocide and trauma movies from being created for other cultures such as armenia cambodians and heaven forbid russians and ukrainians just count the number of sad and epic movies about what happened to the jews that have been made by a jewish controlled industry and then note the glaring absence of anything else besides perhaps a bit about native americans so i am just arguing that jews are responsible for much of the profoundly negative trends but after a certain point of momentum it takes on a life of its own and is really unstoppable until it completely exhausts itself edit i tried to find a clip of the documentary defamation http www imdb com title tt1377278 ref ttfc fc tt where foxman of the adl is telling yanukovych to downplay the holodomer in comparison to the holocaust its a great clip because you can see how important it is for worldwide jewry to own genocide and immense suffering by denying it to others they can maintain this immense power in this context it makes a lot of sense to me why there is a culture where women seek to become fake victims without of course suffering the real consequences of the acts ,1,TheRedPill

destraht,i am thinking something like this t440 http www ebay com itm lenovo thinkpad t440 14 notebook i5 4300u 2 49ghz 4gb 500gb win10 warranty 1a 311744420890 hash item48956a5c1a g pciaaosw9ipx0m1 so the issue there is that the touchpad on that model is not so good and so when you have an extra 30 50 you will want to get a new one that is made for the t450 it is not very hard to do and it can be done later then i think that you should start out with an ssd something like the samsung 850 evo https www amazon com samsung 2 5 inch internal mz 75e250b am dp b00oaj412u ref sr 1 2 ie utf8 qid 1480865009 sr 8 2 keywords samsung 850 you will want to start out with a ssd because once you are into your routine you likely wo not want to start over with everything also when you have more money then you can upgrade the memory it wo not be expensive just check how many dims the model has 8gb should be plenty if you are not creating a lot of virtual machines ,3,thinkpad
destraht,maybe it would have been good if it cost like 4 mana and devolved cards for 2 mana ,2,hearthstone
destraht,do you go with a dragon package ,2,hearthstone
destraht,i think that the 1 mana play is to do an emergency 2 damage clear that same turn ,1,hearthstone
destraht,if i am playing kazakus from turns 5 12 or so then i will get a 5 mana potion but then after that the ten mana one starts looking very appealing if i am not about to die the next turn if i can pull off a bran double potion and the game is still a heated back and forth then i will often pick a 10 mana potion and a 5 mana potion if i am able to get a big reactive clear with the 10 mana then i will choose something more proactive with the 5 mana potion if its late in the game and i have a high enough life total with a double bran then i will get two 10 mana potions ,3,hearthstone

destraht,dirt rat seems to have the largest potential in priest i am real curious to see how it works out in the various matches and if there are any decks that you can know that it will come out ahead 90 of the time ,1,CompetitiveHS
destraht,i am bringing up deathwing as a 10 mana clear plus 2 doomsayers in the deck you could also run 2 loothoarders basically you can rush to draw to just keep afloat and then you do not have to worry about running out of cards also curator can draw a azure drake or deathwing and also a coldlight if you are able to play one jade idol with fendral then you will be setup in a good way later in the game maybe just 1 auctioneer to get a pump going later on ,1,CompetitiveHS
destraht,druid could have doomsayer ,1,CompetitiveHS
destraht,with deathwing i think that you need to limit the number of dead late game draws innervate in the deck so that you can do something decent with the next draw if they just do something like a hex to the deathwing then its totally fine since it is not the win condition but then the deck needs to be able to respond to the next medium sized threat that they lay out that turn a dead draw on that next turn could be game over i am pretty sure that you would feel good about using deathwing to smash a thing from below on the next turn because really you just want to buy time also then the curator is probably the thing to play to get the coldight and deathwing ,1,CompetitiveHS
destraht,ya i think that it would look more like malygos druid with just a about five different cards so the nice thing there is that you can play the arcane giants not so much to win but just to make them have to deal with them ,1,CompetitiveHS
destraht,i think that you can play super heavy draw cards and then fall back on jade idol when you get ahead so i think that the starting kit would look something like malygos druid minus spots for naturalize and other removal hey what about deathwing if you can manage to fill up your deck with several jade idols towards the end then it could be good enough to work like a vanish but with a threat to finish the game in 1 2 turns also two doomsayers ,3,CompetitiveHS
destraht,6 lbs,1,thinkpad
destraht,with one tick from emperor on this or an evolved kobold you could do 15 damage to their face also hitting a minion with 5 or less health azure drake thing with one of the missiles is not bad at all this card is kind of like a pyroblast ,1,CompetitiveHS
destraht,if velen did not exist then this card would allow enemies to be targeted as well its unfortunate that velen exists imo ,1,CompetitiveHS
destraht,they should have made this say takes 1 less damage from untargetted sources then you would not be able to ping it or missiles it down or ghoul it would be solid because if it trades into something with 2 attack then it has done a job well enough ,1,CompetitiveHS
destraht,if one third of your deck is dragons then you have a decent chance to draw 2 or even 3 cards ,4,CompetitiveHS
destraht,i got in a three small time bar fights in ukraine i won all of them in that i could have messed the other dudes up with one instance i had the guy down in a corner with my hand on his neck and i let him up before i squeezed him out another time i just knocked the dude around a bit and another time i grabbed the guys finger and i could have easily broken it but i did not well in all three cases the dudes came back at me after i showed a bit of mercy my point is that i doubt that many of the russians are capable of bowing out gracefully like a weaker male who was beaten during mating season if that is the case then you simply have to be brutal because you might not be able to dodge the next punch that is certainly coming at you it can be a vicious and brutal mentality and many of them are hardened rough tough and intelligent and you do not want to fuck around with that i figure that putin is suppressing many nasty elements in russia who would just love to trash the place ,3,conspiracy

destraht,zoo might do it if it was afraid of flametongue to take out the 1 3 taunt demon to then hit something juicier also aggro divine shield paladin would not want to lose a shield also its not inconcievable that they would need to weight against you being able to portal them for 1 damage and then smack something and then trade i think that the combination of a 1 1 on board with an 2 attack weapon and very possibly incoming 1 damage aoe is something that we have not seen before and it could really wreck their board thought it might be one of those things where they always think about it for 20 seconds before just going face ,1,CompetitiveHS
destraht,shaman can now heal 6 with a nice body plus halazeal i think that the jade claws are quite good because many aggro decks do not want to see you have a 1 1 on board and so it will heal you 1 2 damage at some point ,2,CompetitiveHS

destraht,when i go for extended travel again i will just need to carry around a small plastic pry tool it does not weight much ,1,thinkpad
destraht,also if you want something in the same category but lighter then try the t450s but stay away from the t460s since its really not the same concept i imagine that the t460p is around the same weight as the t420 and with that you would get a pretty nice performance boost ,1,thinkpad
destraht,these days there are programming languages and new versions of existing ones coming out that are made to provide multi process guarantees i will point to languages like go and rust as examples of this so there is an education issue as well as legacy software infrastructure one as well then when these new programming paradigms gain enough traction then there will again be an interest in creating chips with higher numbers of cores intel did not make many desktop and notebook cpus with many cores because there was not a large software need for it i think that your assessment about single core throughput not getting tremendously better is accurate but in ten years many of the algorithms will be divided up to use a great deal of cores for operations that now only use a single one or sort of using multi cores but inefficiently and not completely this kind of programming is super hard but modern languages themselves will guarantee the validity of certain things at compile time so when technologies like amd hsa whatever wins out has been around a while and is baked into the os and the programming languages then there will be a huge jump in cpu performance as well as battery usage in general whatever implementation of that concept wins out it will be vastly superior to what we have today certain people will continue to implement their stuff by hand using low level techniques but really what is important is that the average and typical program will be built to take advantage of this new technology so in short i think that a machine that is 4 years old now will not be doing very well 10 years from now i think that the current situation in cpu tech can be compared to ie6 and ie8 sticking around for so long and then once they were phased out then it became a several year long mad rush to innovate js frameworks to use the new technology the last 5 years has been absolutely exhausting for js developers but it looks to maturing into something that will not be changing so radically every 2 3 years so i do not think that it is accurate to extrapolate cpu growth of the last five years into the next ten even though the nano meter shrinkage will be greatly slowing down ,1,thinkpad
destraht,try a t460 the newer models are not super easy to open up because you need a tool to pry them apart however once inside you can get access to all of the stuff ,1,thinkpad

destraht,shadow word horror is going to see a lot more use with this next expansion the problem is that six months went by without there being a follow up to this card i am hoping that in 15 months that blizzard will redesign the game to include a core set that simply has a larger selection of cards in it this would allow them to include cards like gang up and likely many other priest cards which simply enable entire deck types many of these cards are not amazing on their own without support and are not usable outside of specific decks there simply are not enough cards available at once for the really themed decks to do well the new core set would not need to include all of the power creeped cards but just more of the really interesting ones crap totemic might was worthless until fairly recently because the cards had no synergy priest is going to continue to suffer this fate over and over again as cards cycle out because many of its strategies require tons of synergy so then they can still cycle out cards like lightbomb to create new types of aoe and we do not want to see each class have 8 different aoe cards at once ,1,hearthstone

destraht,we are designed to emulate the chiefs because more or less whatever they did to get there was effective hollywood is able to hijack this quite a lot and then their false top guys work to convince us to be betas i do not see myself as being particularly affected by these forces but it seems to be the way that the masses operate if you tell people not to have babies then they will have less babies and vice versa the masses get to do their own thing but they trend towards what they are being told to do and so with someone very different like trump at the top then the masses will just start acting a bit differently to some measurable extent ,3,TheRedPill
destraht,the main issue for me with the t460s is that the battery life is pretty weak and its even worse since its not swappable i would be fine with it if it got 2 3 more hours of battery life as it is now with my t450s i can get like 12 hours if i am doing some really basic things ,4,openSUSE

destraht,well without women then men will start getting desperate and selling their souls freedoms etc for just a chance at a woman that also comes into play in an area where women are getting fat obese beyond a certain point that men are not lusting for them anymore because then its effectively the same female shortage having traveled and lived in various areas i look at it fundamentally as whether a place has a pussy cartel or not in places where women have achieved a certain dominance then the female alliance seeks to really use their pussies as a weapon but once that cartel is busted up then its just a whole bunch of free pussy agents pursuing their own best strategy of trying to lure a man in with charm like many things if people do not need to work for it then they will be lazy and corrupt degenerate collusion is effective strategy for them when their are enough attractive women then things will tip over a point where forms of prostitution become legal and this will make men not act so crazy because they can afford it or just to have access to it when the realistic availability of women gets to a certain point then it seems to just snowball towards a large portion of the men being unable to get it in any form and this is really bad since men are the ones who do most of the producing and we do not want them to be disgruntled terrorists seeking virgins in the afterlife weak ass beta hipsters virtue signaling to prove that they are beat down enough to be useful tools etc in the case of the us there are all of these unattractively fat women working non stop to change the perception of what is beautiful so that they can once again fit into that definition for some reason the american women in this category would rather work on this abstract way then to get their ass out for a little exercise and then to apply charm its exacerbated by the fact that more men have physical jobs and so are overal are staying in reasonable shape for longer than women well so many of these things are better in russia but due to history and this brewing ww3 contention stuff it still is not better in russia overall they are imo actually on the right track but it will take a while to play out just like the us being on the wrong track seems to take so long to play out as well ,1,conspiracy

destraht,in a traditional the mongels are coming sort of conflict then sure but if the society is being brought down through subversion then i am not convinced that simply following the leader orders to attack whatever enemy is always going to be the right course of action a subverted society basically means a confused society that has lost the ability to differentiate friend from foe that shit is not worth dying for and as a soldier you really by nature of that arrangement do not get much say in the matter that is a problem ,1,TheRedPill
destraht,that is the pointed threat but i think that more generally they do not want people around who can be motivated to agitate the risk is that if those people were to get access to better information that they could then agitate against the new order they must first break a system in order to create a new one so i think that it is impossible for a healthy society to be broken in this way and so those who would seek to subvert a society need to work on a multi generational plan to implement long term changes when the subversive are able to realize an unwell society then it means that there is a large potential social energy well there like an earthquake ready to happen then they use useful idiots to hit the streets in large numbers to actually break the last remnant of the effective society humans only have a certain capacity for stress and especially when they do not understand the nature of the threats then they can feel quite hopeless when this happens a new order can be quickly imposed while the controllers are telling their leftist communist street disturbers to stand down then the new order takes over and people are able to relax and get used to the new normal and to figure out the new pecking order then shortly after this the most rambunctious of the agitators need to be disposed of because they are the people who could one day be capable of creating the sort of chaos that could repeat the cycle so the most loyal and motivated people are disposed of and what is left is increasingly just the cynical power hungry sociopaths so in ukraine in a very cynical turn of events i saw people that were railing against a corrupt kiev government and putting their life on the line i was not as i am foreign to ukraine go to immediately sign up to fight against the foreign russian enemy many of these people were immediately sent off to their deaths against the separatists the thing is that nobody wanted them around not kiev not moscow and not the two oblasts that broke off nobody likes these types and so nobody but their mothers miss them that is cynical life ,1,TheRedPill

destraht,i have found that if i say that a situation with women in a particular setting in many different countries is difficult that people jump on me here for not slaying enough its frustrating because it is often that i am getting enough puss but that there is a price to pay and i have been reflecting on whether it is worth the effort on my health wealth or time many then fall back on blasting people for not humble bragging about how effortlessly they got women with zero side effects for an easy example say that you can slay in a chimney smoking bar then that is affecting your health and your clothes then smell terrible many dudes here just instinctively jump on that because to them pussy success and their simple minds cannot register that for guy who have any kind of a long track record with getting girls then it is not the end all be all for me being around that kind of crap is the largest reason that i take months long breaks away from theredpill specifically about your point i think that religion and politics specifically affect the sexual dynamic but it is not always the most relevant thing in all regions think of it like einsteinian versus newtonian physics if you go at pretty slow speeds relative to the speed of light then the extra variables and terms just drop off and you are at newtonian physics that is fine when things are moving at normal everyday speeds but it breaks when you get into special situations an example of this special situation is war and war is definitely political i lived all over ukraine for 3 5 of the last 4 years and i could break down in detail the difference in dating during three different eras and in the different regions during that period its relevant and i find it likely that instability is coming to a region near you and women will start acting very differently so when you are getting historical levels of savage virile men from a different religion migrating into a country at great up front expense of the host country and weird globalist political actors then you obviously have a situation when that is relevant to the sexual dynamics of the native men you are welcome to confine your perspective to a closed system where you pretend like these factors do not influence your club and tinder game but many of the rest of us will be considering these other heavily related factors regardless of how you feel about it ,1,TheRedPill
destraht,i just spent 3 5 of the last 4 years in ukraine and i think that i see a way that the us elites can use the german far right over the last decade the us based elites like soros and friends funded parts of ukrainian society that could be counted on to go against russian interest when the right moment came they funded them in the range of 5 billion on books which is a shit ton of money in ukraine and i suspect perhaps double that off books and then doing similar things with their neighbors like moldova where the total amount is far higher it goes back to ww2 when the germans were the largest opposition to the russians and how the ussr and bolshevik movement was a jewish dominated movement the far western ukrainians l viv etc latched onto a bit of the nazi symbolism and perspective and to this day in many places it is still connected to anti russian anti jewish opposition ironically today russia is no longer utterly dominated by jews and now they only occupy a powerful position while the west has now switched to become the jewish powerhouse it is obvious that old cold warriors in far western europe and the us have done everything that they can do to galvanize support against russia and it really is a long list of attacks grievances such as trying to kick russia out of mediterranean through syria trying to push russia out of their crimean naval base lease by resetting the ukrainian constitution to 2004 like rolling back a source repository to a previous state starting the ukrainian coup revolution civil war during the russian hosted olympics appointing an anti russian polish man to lead the eu embargoing russia and convincing saudi arabia to start the first wave of game theory cheating by releasing the flood gates of hell to pump oil to set off a global downward spiral endless russia hates gays propaganda and kicking russian olympians out of the event and so many other countless small attacks that the russians are absolutely aware of so my point is that i find it likely that the globalists would try to use german far right nationalism as a weapon against russia since obviously this movement would be heavily affiliated with nazism in my experience having been around rough types in ukraine the groups that contain nazi types tend to not be outright nazi and instead in a given group there is a wide spectrum of people all of the way from just a tiny bit nazi to just being an inch away from dyed in the wool stereotypical there is a tolerance there they tend to really know what is going on around them actually and just some of the group members get into too much of the simple minded stuff and others in the group just tolerate it also not everyone is a genius now i am not sure if actually the germans at this point could be made into a weapon against russia as they seem to have been in recent times far more leniant towards russia than many other hawkish eu countries to both of west and east of them this is in my opinion the ultimate goal of the brezenski types is to create a few generations worth of russians and germans who despise each other because otherwise a unifed germany and russia would be quite a global force to reckon with nazis are then just a tool for fighting russians in a similar way to how the mujahideen founding fathers of afghanistan were simply used to fight against russians of course blow back and all of that but that is a problem for 20 years into the future rinse repeat so what better way to create nazis than to flood germany with foreign savages edit one of my favorite things about writing anything about jews is watching the progression of votes on the post typically if i have written something thoughtful then it gets a quick 1 2 and then it gets hammered again then when many people come online it will get several upvotes and then later it goes back down to around 1 the jdl https en wikipedia org wiki jewish defense league and similarly minded folks used to just blast post into the 20 to 40 territory in a matter of hours about 7 8 years ago using semi automated save the jews tools but for about 4 5 years now they are extra clever to make posts that they dislike on forums that they do not dominate to appear to receive a very depressed reception they have been found out and now their tools and strategies are much more refined for 5 years now its all about making unfavorable sentiment never appear to reach critical mass just saying this is my personal pleasure when posting about jews once in a while they mess up and i get to learn something new about their strategies russia us and china do it and israel and international jewry does it its just easy as hell to see when jews do it because it always has to do with the word jew ,1,TheRedPill

destraht,i have recently moved back to california from being in ukraine for in country a total of years over there i learned a lot about old world jews and also their relationship to the us and other western countries i lived in dnipropetrosk where the jews built the largest jewish center in all of europe and also where virtually all of the ukrainian bankers come from anyways jews are annoying a few informed people that i have met have the opinion that ukrainians learned their ultra victim mentality from the jews who dominated them basically to copy the behavior of successful people but unfortunately without many of the positive traits one thing that i have noticed about ukrainian jews is that they had a much better chance to go abroad after the ussr collapsed but then often still see themselves as the big victims of it so look at france the narrative is that persecution of jews is so high that the jews are fleeing i propose that things are going to shit in france and that simply jews have the mentality and means to leave for greener grass and then while they are improving their lives good for them they are whining about how it is because they are persecuted bad for them i say edit basically my point is that jews are the largest whiners on the planet and only an ignorant lack of knowledge person takes them seriously when bad things happen to them then it needs to be looked at in the context of what is happening to other people around them ,6,TheRedPill

destraht,i grew up in the north bay around a lot of transgendered people and one of them was quite damaged and really liked to be a victim while behaving poorly i am pretty sure that if this one guy was typically normal that the 50th guy would have knocked him out as eventually happens to poorly behaving males but actually in my area they are protected especially when its a certain fact that he would have cried the hate crime game and then made that event even further of a part of his core identity and then never let it go one day on a date as a topic came up i told an apparently bisexual woman that i was not appreciating a particular group of what we would now call lgbt and in particular this one transgender guy for his poor and flamboyant behavior and that was it the date immediately went sour and that was no big deal at all since it was a just unplanned of a meeting of convenience well then word went out that i did not worship this one group of lesbians and so i was put on the hate list and some awful things started happening they marked me for simply not caring much for their presence for example i was outside at a brewery with four male friends an obvious lgbt type woman sat down near to us and i paid her little attention then it turns out that she was just eavesdropping on me and after about twenty minutes she walked over and put her middle finger right in my face and told me some bad words and then stormed off remember we have to celebrate them at all times as was the mantra for the 2000 ,3,linux

destraht,check out the difference chisinau i can see a huge difference between there and many cities in ukraine both large and small there is far more far western mixing going on there and it affects a lot of things i can see how the next generation will be far more western sooner because on the playground the girls are already starting to non stop scream just like how california girls do it its just a very particular high pitch scream that does not exist everywhere and its a purely learned behavior they will be unruly sooner its interesting because its so similar but i can see that they are on different trajectories because of how many damn ngos and euifications are occurring unfortunately with ukraine there are far too many people who will be jumping head first into anything that can be presented as western they feel disconnected and inferior and so try to become western very quickly to one up the other incredibly jealous people it seems to me that most of the country will be only capable of looking in a single far western direction never eastwards because ussr russia etc and so they run the serious risk of gobbling up the worst of it the one buffer to slow it down is the relative isolation that will cause things to move at a slower rate in many ways the economic stagnation and image of danger is keeping many people out and its a mixed blessing because i see how fucking shitty it has been in some ways in poland where many of the lower classes there act terrible i feel much more comfortable around the poorest city ukrainians than i do poles i am sure that many ukrainians would rather be economically at the level of poles so i do not know if they would feel the same as i do ,1,TheRedPill

destraht,i am just getting into tumbleweed and i absolutely intend to ignore package updates during periods when i cannot afford any disruptions i also do that on slower moving systems as well i think that you should always ask yourself if you can afford to waste an hour or a morning fixing issues ,1,openSUSE
destraht,i just got into tumbleweed two days ago after a 15 year hiatus from suse products i also just started using virt manager for the first time and i found it to be very easy to use once i was up and running but i did have a fair bit of trouble trying to locate the correct packages to install and also turning on the correct services i know that libvirt stuff is supposed to be powerful enough for anything but perhaps there could be a way to make getting libvirt stuff going more easily than it is now ,1,openSUSE
destraht,ok so i just installed opensuse tumbleweed on my 1080p notebook and its really amazing but i do think that the fonts could be improved somehow i am using gnome and firefox are there any simple things that i could do ,1,openSUSE
destraht,it seems that the t440p can have a slightly faster cpu than the t460p but its just too large for me to ever consider imo the t460p is the first model that hit the practicality point for many people to consider the 1 0 1 5 extra pounds for all of that power i ended up going with a t450s because it is good enough and it saves me about 600 after what i would need to put into the t460p and also i could am sure about the linux support being 100 dialed in whereas the t460p sky lake is just becoming solid and then there are various lag times as the kernel gets into distributions and then likely a tiny bit more instability inefficiency until minor kernel updates go through after the increased testing also something to consider about the t460p is that it has a massive power supply that you really should consider in the total weight i was going to put the purchase of a smaller 90w power supply off for some months or before i went traveling again ,1,thinkpad
destraht,looks nice edit i just ordered this i was not aware that 2242 meant 42mm and also people were posting and agreeing that many m 2 slots could not power some 256gb m 2 drives that seems unlikely to me though ,1,thinkpad
destraht,i was recently going neurotic on the thinkpad t460p but then i went with the tigerdirect i7 t450s with touchscreen because it is only 750 i love the t460p from what i can research about it but i dislike that it does not have support for the nvme drives that can be multiple times faster for certain workloads so the tech is on the edge of that i went for something that i could setup for 500 less that is pretty good and it will make me through the next 3 years when that stuff settles down ,1,thinkpad
destraht,ok so i think that its a number of issues and that your point here is the most relevant one but i also brought that up in another thread here i do expect for all prices to be 20 higher in the eu but 80 higher is a bit crazy ,1,thinkpad
destraht,i just bought the tigerdirect t450s special for 750 850 total and it comes with 256gb and 8gb ram i will upgrade it later to 12gb for just 35 and then much later i will put a 256gb 2242 m 2 drive into it i will be using virt manager for my vm and so i will just need to move the vm image over to the m 2 drive and to run some shell commands to move it over the idea then is that i can just dump my main host os a several times as needed over the life of the product and i will have my more time costly vms safe on their own drive ,1,thinkpad
destraht,i think that its actually largely this and then there is a difference in economy of scale that adds some extra hundreds to the price then there is this other factor where the bean counters figure out if there are some buyers that will purchase at any price and if that exceeds the difference of selling it less to more sensitive buyers then it can be better bottom line for lenovo at the end i think that this implies that the eu people are not very egalitarian ,1,thinkpad
destraht,you pay for all of those fancy rights i imagine that the return rate of lenovo machines is dramatically higher due to people just not getting an opportunity to do a hands on while with apple there are so many stores for people to play around with and also there are few models so less opportunity for confusion ,3,thinkpad
destraht,well lenovo might not be charging a fair price but let me bring your attention to a few things the eu is a bureaucratic nightmare and there huge difference in the cost of doing business then look at apple eu tax arrangement just google that and tell me if you find anything interesting i will save you some trouble there or just get you started in your research by informing you that apple simply is not paying proper taxes and is about to be battling it out in a mutli way between the us eu germany ireland etc the fuckers are not paying their taxes and they soak up a huge percentage of the entire profits of the industry well why does lenovo charge so much i am not sure but maybe there are some dirty things going on behind the scenes that give apple a leg up and then penalize lenovo due to it being more so china based china has for years been stealthily creeping into any markets that they can and buying lots of land in ukraine strategic assets in greece and many other things and many markets are protected in name and also unsaid against chinese encroachment and but they still often around this though with corruption ,-3,thinkpad

destraht,hungarians seem to be known for thinking very highly of americans i did not experience any open contempt when i was there for about 5 6 days about 3 5 years ago one thing about ukrainians is that they have extremely thin skin and take comments far too literally this means that any amount of sarcasm will often have a poor effect upon them they are very passive aggressive and highly mind fuckingly paranoid and so they use small comments to imply insult and other things and then they read into it so small sarcastic comments are analyzed in this context and they make it much worse so very few things are taken at simple face value and so even small non sarcastic comments get amplified up through their paranoid passive aggressive lens to be often a bit nasty its often boring or annoying i do not think that i will be going back soon because i do not like the changes in the country with the large demographic shifts and other increasingly cynical outlooks often when i was there i would think that a situation was not working for me and then i would take a step back to observe that the entire civilization is unsuccessful and that few are thriving it just needs to play itself out over decades and generations ,1,TheRedPill

destraht,thanks this is what i am looking for fedora 25 will use kernel 4 8 so it should all be pretty good out of the box if 4 7 is where it first all came together i will look back on this thread in a few months when i make the purchase ,1,thinkpad
destraht,which debian are you using and did you need to do custom work to get the issues worked out i am considering buying one for use with fedora 25 kernel 4 8 to avoid issues and i am concerned that the nvidia chip will cause me issues does the open source driver work well enough to just automatically hide the nvidia chip away and to power it down ,1,thinkpad
destraht,that was my thought as well when i first read it ,1,thinkpad
destraht,is it possible to even open it up with just a screwdriver for the screws i can see opening it up about 3 times over its life is it just difficult and time consuming or does it border on impossible without tools ,1,thinkpad
destraht,i am considering buying a t460p when fedora 25 is released in november as to avoid any custom patches as beyond a wifi driver i have zero luck with that sort of thing i really just want the i7 cpu and second heat pipe and do not want to have issues because of the discrete chip that is not all that interesting for me i would prefer to just run nouveau graphics possible wayland support to disable and or power down the discrete chip so that i can use the intel one will this be done automatically and do you imagine that i will have immediate issues with stock fedora 25 also i may end up powering a second monitor but not more than 1 more any obvious issues there edit down the road i would like to have good nvidia support but just to minimize risks i just want to ignore the chip since it has nothing to do with my work or gaming habits ,1,thinkpad
destraht,how is the performance compared between the intel integrated and nouveau driver graphics ,1,thinkpad
destraht,i read that the i7 has more heat piping that will cool it down do you ever notice it getting noticeably hot on the keyboard when you are really working it i am not concerned about it getting hot on the bottom while i am cranking some batch processing because that is table work really but is it cool enough to place on your lap while browsing or do you need to offset it a bit from your leg ,1,thinkpad
destraht,so it has 1 2 5 drive and then an available m 2 as well does that support the new faster drive format i am asking because its difficult to make sense of the different m 2 sizes i was doing some research some days ago and it seemed like that there are not any faster drives for the m 2 sizes that are available in the new models ,1,thinkpad
destraht,yes but i do not feel like it is baked in enough ,1,vuejs
destraht,it does more but i do not know quite how much more it does some fancy dependency injection using a new es whatever annotation syntax that i do not quite understand ,1,vuejs
destraht,i recommend getting a second machine maybe a cheap x220 for running linux on full time although its not necessary i found it to be immensely helpful while learning to have only ssh remote access to the machine to set things up then if you really get stuck you can walk over to the other machine and log into its graphical desktop to unstick yourself then even if you decide to switch to linux full time it is useful to be able to run two distros at the same time and to always have a functional machine for creating boot drives emergency google searches and that sort of thing for myself i was already pretty setup with my linux skills and i just took that last hurdle of not dual booting any of my machines and suffering through some of the early days of linux issues due to the type of work that i did i would not even need windows support for a year at a time and then now i can just do that stuff through a windows vm you will need to sacrifice some of the aaa games although others are supported and certain engineering programs wine between the very affordable commercial codeweavers offering and the free playonlinux will work very well for photoshop games and many applications although it would be cruel to force all of that learning curve on a linux newbie it sounds as though you are young and i think that you can just keep growing with linux for a decade and so you should make that a full educational goal edit i will add that say you are using windows 7 on your t430s with an ubuntu vm to play with then you could get into a second cheap machine like a x220 and install fedora on it to get experience with redhat and debian environments its also a nice feeling to have a seperate machine that is running a database and web server ,2,thinkpad
destraht,i honestly do not think that women are psychologically well suited to be out roughing it solo like that for long periods of time they can do it but there is a cost to it i have also heard many peace corps women in different hostels in different countries complaining to each other they agree to meet up with each other on their little time off about how seriously crappy their lives are and how they are depressed and isolated ,1,science
destraht,aurelia seems to be really awkward to setup compared to vue also i live and die by webpack and aurelia just being an also does is not good enough for me aurelia requires a special webpack aurelia plugin to specific resources it looks scary tbh ,1,vuejs
destraht,i am getting ready to proposition a partner to switch to vue 2 0 since it seems like the js fatigue wars might be dying down a bit i looked at aurelia and i really like how the framework is once its up an running but i think that they really made a mistake by choosing jspm instead of webpack they were going for the es6 7 and perfectly standard html5 approach angular property name case sensitivity and so they chose jspm because it was marketing itself as the best way to achieve this but in practice it just slows everything down a lot as it thrashes the disk and also webpack 2 which solves many of the jspm selling points is right around the corner and is already usable if you want to deal with the pre documentation pains vue seems to be dead simple to setup and i love how it has first class webpack support with really pretty cool features that go along with it ,2,vuejs

destraht,i think that you will want to go with some trick setup to hide taskbars and menu bars ubuntu unity is the best out of the box setup for vertical space savings because it pushes the menu bars up in the top this machine is still very powerful and it has good cooling depending on what you get they have not caught up to the performance for another 2 3 generations because they went low voltage so really you are just adding about say 6lbs for the same thing and a worse screen its cheap though and has solid support ,1,thinkpad
destraht,i think that is really it right there it should have usb c and also ditch the 2 5 for pcie m 2 then it is good for years and there wo not be regret when the new shiny comes i do not see any fundamental changes coming for years after that except a bit down the road maybe some kind of programmable leds in either the touchpad or keys also if you must have touch then you can get it now ,3,thinkpad
destraht,this might as well be thinkpad linux and i like it ,2,thinkpad
destraht,do not make your own distro you will just burn resources maybe you can hire a kernel developer to make sure that everything is running fine even then you probably should not be creating all new stuff but with a part time kernel dev you could navigate the new kernel sources to make sure that everything is working and to maybe give some things a small nudge during the kernel development ,4,linux

destraht,i sir cannot fully answer that question ,1,hearthstone
destraht,you forgot power word blue moon they did not really even try with priest and the group of 11 i just made that up sat around the board room afraid to create anything interesting and since they did not play the game they were unaware of exactly what cards were leaving standard and which would be included in the new set furthermore their interactions at the coffee machine with testers testing managers and other insiders left a sinking feeling in their stomachs that nothing could remedy their waterfall development model could not be changed without a s19 a form and since the meeting fell within the two week feature freeze and the next set committee had not yet released their final cards they could only dance around the issue and although some of the sitting members knew of upcoming cards they were unable and unwilling to quote the presumed card text out of fear of betraying the entire process job security and the works in the end they hung their heads for a few moments and then in and effort to not demonstrate their failure for everyone to see they burst into congradulations for all that they had done for the other eight class of hearthstone although it was never overtly stated that they had all failed they each looked at one or two other people in the seconds after the forced congratulatory outburst and they each each felt a sinking sensation that due to company policy could not be included in the minutes ,1,hearthstone

destraht,it is an undesirable meta game which is a symptom of not enough players and it increases the skill and card collection necessary to play well i have seen legend players in hearthstone wait for 10 15 seconds to ensure that they get a new opponent but in fearia realistically it would be a minute or so before you even join the queue ,1,faeria
destraht,excuses for a beta game ,0,faeria

destraht,the bullshit card for yellow rush is zealous crusader i think that it should start with base stats 1 1 and then only get 2 1 for each time a god was damaged which is still quite economical for the faeria otherwise the game will always be about how to beat yellow ,2,faeria

destraht,i am not an expert in the low level api but once the request is sent then you pretty much need to let the internet and the server do its thing you can however choose to ignore the response or to timeout on it to then just continue on or to try again i looked into it some months ago when i realized doh fetch does not really do what i need it to do and i just did not put it all together until i had happily deleted out my new old ajax code that did not yet have fault tolerance reimplemented yet ,3,programming

destraht,its shitty yellow does not get weaker later on and just keeps getting heavier for example after rushing me my opponent plays a 5 mana 10 10 then i waste 10 mana to kill it and he summons a 5 mana 12 12 and since i was playing red i only had meteor to take it out then a 5 mana 18 18 after drawing his entire deck i will say that i am amazed at how well designed the yellow color is but its not balanced in any way oh ya clump up your guys to defend and then you get drained by a huge vampire its insane edit i think that its a problem that yellow gets 2 guys that can get really high health so the vampire is probably fine but then to guy who gets 2 2 for each time a god was attacked should probably be nerfed to like just 2 1 that way it at least evenly trades with a big green fatty or that red has a chance of killing it off with damage why does yellow get to have 2 cards that can go aggro and grow huge butts its too damn much ,-1,faeria
destraht,good luck they offer a 50 package to get all cards in the game and while this sounds good if you do not do this then you will be playing against much better than average game players who have all cards and if will really suck for you the match making is pretty terrible now because there are not many players and since its beta and not being advertised you will be playing against seasoned players who may just pop in to kick your ass and then leave again after not playing for a while the skill progression is very terrible compared to more established games where rank 23 is god awful players but in faeria they can easily beat you with a deck of every legendary see beta package for all cards they are changing cards all of the time and they have made the higher rarity cards to be essential to a good deck more than just enabling some more complicated play styles game is fun but rough around the edges ,0,faeria

destraht,they are trying to make some kind of hearthstone brawl game but the implementation is weak hearthstone was out for a long time before they started doing weird random stuff i think that it is a huge waste of developer time they should just be trying to make an arena type mode be as solid as possible in terms of the actual original game cards that is enough to keep players busy and entertained for quite a while and improve the core game play actually now i am noticing that since i have been playing for a few weeks that the game has actually regressed in stability holy shit i am also a developer and i am baffled why they thought it was a good idea to change both the game setup mode drafting picking and also the game itself random craaaaazy wonky stuff if they had only changed the deck creating part then they could limit the bugs to a much smaller region of code as there likely would not be large changes to both aspects of the game you see the game itself would not need to change and instead just the part that verifies that the deck is valid so if they would have made pandora be just a normal arena or gauntlet type of mode then their lives would have been much easier and actually players would have been happier so this was a failure it does not mean its the end of the road for them to a failure is a failure and it needs to be learned from another thing is that i do not think that rolling out something buggy and unrealized like pandora mode should be done on an open beta audience and that is much more suitable for a closed beta or for paid beta testers why alienate so many users and make their own developers lives so difficult crawl first then walk then run then a charging fly yea sorry devs you are not going to be successful creating the craaaaziness of heartstone brawl before you have nailed down your own core game mechanics hopefully this is clear ,2,faeria

destraht,its the beginning of the month season and if you are getting utterly trashed then perhaps just give the game a rest for some days until the better players move closer to their typical rank the first few days of the month has everyone bunched up so you will be going up against better players if you still cannot win by day 10 then you just have some deck making and playing skill issues ,2,duelyst

destraht,hey so my very first game at rank 25 i just went up against a deck that pulled a first turn magda and then got a second discounted magda on turn 2 and then played that to receive 2 discounted legendaries on turn 3 that is pretty fucked right edit wow its real fun going up against the same deck 3 times i beat him the third time though ,1,faeria
destraht,great thanks for the writeup and i will get back to you in some days when i have time to play the game in a meaningful way ,1,faeria
destraht,i might just be getting tilted after a bad run i was doing better when i was playing highlander pandora is a mess and i do not enjoy it even though i have a bunch of keys they dropped balance patches on me right when i was getting into the game i lost games because i was just briefly looking over and seeing the blue and then clicking on 1 mana instead of creating a lake and i probably have done that a total of about ten times which is stupid but it happens i probably just got tilted ,1,faeria
destraht,you are playing green ,1,faeria
destraht,yes i am used to winning and that is frustrating to not be even holding my own however in basically all games except perhaps driving games i am able to within 30 minutes to an hour to be beating other people or at least making them sweat now when it comes to pandora mode i think that it kind of sucks with the rng and i have been screwed there many times i have never had the 2 2 hit when i have spanned creatures but i have had it it twice back to back for 4 4 right after my enemy spawned i have never received the frog on my turn and always on the opponents turn and i have had my units reduced by half several times right into my opponents flamestrike that is pretty lame and i am not the first to notice this i suppose that a better opponent can weight out the odds of random fuck all happening but its pretty difficult to master that while learning so why was i even playing pandora instead of just ranked well they gave me 10 pandora keys with my 25 package and the waiting times for ranked can be up to 5 minutes at the time that i often play and pandora is more like 30 seconds to a minute also think that about 1 5 games is me being smurfed in a brutal way i am also being put against players as low as rank 16 17 the problem with the way that it is setup now is that i would really prefer to make my own decks and to lose against bad players while figure out which cards and strategies are better the issue is that by the matching system being off from possibly few players i pretty much need to have a very viable deck from the very beginning and experimentation as a new player is just certain death what games like hearthstone and duelyst are able to currently achieve that faeria cannot is that they allow players to smoothly transition from utter suckage to being a bit decent this is why i am naming faeria the dwarf fortress of collectible games will its various modes become polished before release absolutely i imagine that it would be significantly easier to have started the game a year ago when you could be up against people who were also experimenting as it is now its the equivalent of doctor boom on turn 7 every game at every rank ,1,faeria
destraht,oh i had to lookup smurf and yes that seems to be the case in some instances for example there was a level 3 player who was pulling out all kinds of neat tricks with a full collection i just do not see how it would be possible to be that skilled and to still be on rank 3 i would say that around that rank and even later i was still figuring out not to click 1 mana instead of creating a blue lake and also not placing a unit in front of my ranged guy right before i wanted to use him to shoot something so its brutal and the game already has a huge learning curve compared to other games there is not much room for experimentation to become good because i am just getting bitch slapped by fully loaded netdecks and trained players i got into duelyst and i would say that due to the positioning there is a much higher learning curve than hearthstone but even in that game i did not feel like i was being repeatedly bitch slapped game after game after game like in faeria i hope that they actually discontinue the 50 for the whole collection thing after release because actually i think that it makes it more difficult for new players since there is too much to absorb and then it really is setting the game at 50 to play and otherwise fuck you i think that i will eventually appreciate the complexity of the game but wtf this should not be so brutal to get into like it was dwarf fortress online yeah so i except to be able to win more or at least put up a good fight at rank 25 i am a computer scientist i was playing chess at age 4 5 and beating so so grown ups and i do real well at other games i am not a stupid person and in its current form the faeria ranked system makes me feel like i was oxygen starved by my umbilical cord during birth ,1,faeria
destraht,i can win using pure green only because that strategy is pretty simple actually however any other combination is tricky as fuck and its impossible to win because i do not have the legendaries and epics that make the cool strategies viable worst yet is that at rank 24 25 it is full of people who abso fucking lutely know exactly what they are doing and they have well polished decks and they never make obvious mistakes as someone in the worst rank of the game would be expected its completely unforgiving and fucked really ,1,faeria
destraht,oops yes i mean ranked i can win about 40 on pandora ,2,faeria
destraht,pandora sucks in its current form but the game is still fun ,1,faeria
destraht,heaven forbid that faeria releases their equivalent of goblins vs gnomes that adds crazy rng ,-1,faeria
destraht,the last three games i have been completely screwed over from the rng one game my opponent had spammed 4 small creatures and then the all creatures get 2 2 triggered twice so game over then i just started out quickly with huge tempo and a ranged unit that i was making his life difficult with and then i pull a all creatures get half attack and life and then he firestorms kind of sucks ,5,faeria
destraht,i am on a macbook 12 with only core m and so i just assume that slowdown is due to my notebook barely handling it if that is not the case then likely they need to optimize the protocol so that it can be less chatty with the server there is a saying in programming something like premature optimization is bad so really its important that they first get the end results working 100 and then they can figure out which actions do not need to be transmitted or how to do it asynchronously for example lets say that they want to make it so that you can see where your opponent is clicking or which card they are touching the best way to do that is to do that in a non blocking way and to have it just be a little extra thing that happens and only needs to be syncronized once in a while this way all of the little extras do not slow down the core gameplay ,1,faeria
destraht,my only issue with it is that it does not seem really seem like the game is progressing but that just weird random stuff is happening i think that the way that the card effects are delivered should be rethought but that the effects are fine enough they are not particularly creative effects but just ok ,5,faeria
destraht,ultimately a well polished game provides these sorts of notifications after another few thousand developer hours the game will really shine ,1,faeria
destraht,ya when the opponent is really pushing me hard or i have a lot of cards in my hand then visually i will just look over and see blue and then click it if i were to look at it for more than 100ms then i would see that it is clearly different in practice it does not work that way unless i make a deliberate effort to not click the wrong one and that is in my opinion an unnecessary cognitive burden for a game also as a side note i would make faeria mana be less blue because there is already a blue colour they could make it purple i just think that the design language needs to tweaked a little bit i am not down on the game at all but just noting that its not release quality yet edit also i think that option picker is too small and pretty much they will need to make it larger proportionally when they adapt it to the tablet i have designed a complicated web application and pretty much i had to make click targets larger or at least with a larger separation so that the heuristic can figure out which button you are more likely to have meant ,1,faeria
destraht,absolutely i am getting the hang of it and i definitely feel very stupid when i do it i am also a software developer and i know that this issue could simply be addressed and it does not need to be painful likely the guts would not need to be changed and just the little widget should be redesigned a bit ,1,faeria
destraht,i think that it was about 4th turn i am going to stop playing faeria until there is a bugfix patch it seems that they changed a whole lot and that the game is pretty unstable at the moment it worked perfectly before and i will add that it was better than hearthstone ever has been ,1,faeria
destraht,my game appears to have just crashed waiting on the opponents turn to timeout edit when i go back in it hangs on the versus screen ,1,faeria
destraht,i will pass on that if it means that they need to go through the board room and accountants for every change hearthstone for example has a miserable policy with nerfs and buffs and i suspect it largely has to do with crafting dust ,1,faeria
destraht,i was not aware that they used golang for snappy and yes that does seem a bit unfortunate well firefox is taking a bit of a beating now but i think that in about 2 5 years when they have lots of rust code deep in the engine and it is just screaming fast doing multi process with ease that people will really realize what a beast rust is for critical infrastructure edit on way deeper note just look at how badass our brain is and it is operating a super slow clock rate but it is massively parallel and so it works out pretty aight also the physics works out so that it takes far less energy to do things in parallel at lower frequency than to bump up the single core stuff i think that the concepts that rust introduces will allow for the actual goals of the rust language to be realized and i do not think that go stands a chance in that category i think that php is great for web development but i would not consider it sideways for an os critical infrastructure project edit i did not realize you were the author until i read it a second time good job there you are definitely on the right track and i think that you have made yourself far more valuable by proving your rust skills than you ever would have with golang ,2,Ubuntu
destraht,well this is the benefit of formal education it does not necessarily come up every year but i have certainly used floor ceiling and modulus divide many times over my career ,2,PHP
destraht,it would be nice to have both methods available i would use the normal ubuntu repo for stable firefox and the mozilla provided snap package for the developer edition version and possibly also to experiment with aurora channel stuff if i was looking forward to a particular feature ,1,Ubuntu
destraht,oh man it seems too early to be running it now i would wait another six weeks or so ,1,Ubuntu
destraht,ubuntu 16 04 has been working great for me in a vm however i am going to wait until 16 04 1 before i try to install in on my macbook 12 early 2015 model i will be waiting for bugfixes and possibly some wiki page maybe at slack to fill out ,1,Ubuntu
destraht,i am glad that they used rust as i do not think that using golang for everything is where we want to be at in five years ,5,Ubuntu
destraht,speaking of this what is the best chromebook in the 200 range for ubuntu 16 04 ,1,Ubuntu
destraht,priest got fucked hard this round ,2,CompetitiveHS
destraht,the macbook 12 is the only apple notebook that is fanless as of yet that is good because i have heard that there are often fan issues with macs ,1,Ubuntu
destraht,i am currently trying to figure out how the integration works for example if i restart a service with a call like etc init d mysql restart then it says that it is doing it via systemctl but when i look at the init script i cannot see any reference to it so what the hell is going on in there ,1,Ubuntu
destraht,the only thing more that i could want from this is usb c charging i have a macbook 12 and it would be amazing to be able to charge this device with the same cable ,2,Pyra
destraht,also there is an artifact that gives 2 attack each time a minion is killed so if the enemy is trying to hunt you down then you can swing back with essentially 3 damage per wraithling 1 for the wraithling and then 2 attack ,1,duelyst
destraht,possible 4gb memory version in future ,3,Pyra
destraht,that is a different feature ,3,Atom
destraht,what is really messing me up is that i cannot reorder the tabs by dragging them it just does not work anymore i am on osx ,1,Atom

destraht,its not just you and i think that once the endorsement comes that it creates some sort of tribal leader effect where people will upvote reflexively i have noticed it many times in threads with various ranked posters basically short bursts of generic trp lingo that could easily have been copy pasted out of an approved proverb is upvoted when it is coming from a ranked member come on guys surely you can upvote his last comment he is ranked after all see he used jargon in between those parenthesis there ,-1,TheRedPill
destraht,my point is that these girls are not even close to all of the girls of even a place like odessa if you have the mark and the weakness then they will find you and eat you alive but if you transform yourself then they are literally likely to give you a soviet snarl and walk the other wayrather than to try and extract money from you ,2,TheRedPill
destraht,not that i disagree in any way with what you wrote but i am convinced that people simply upvote the ranked members and familiar people here out of a clannish impulse ,1,TheRedPill
destraht,i frequently meet older expat guys in downtown odessa who have been hosed by women in the range of hundreds of dollars to a few thousand i have also been hosed but on a far smaller scale to the range of about 7 10 in really just a few minutes i ask a wandering girl on the street who is eye fucking me to some coffee and before i know it she has ordered 5 6 dollars worth of chocolate just to stick it to me as fast as possible this was enough for me to learn the rules of the game and how it was and could be with the wrong girls i realized immediately that i had been hosed but that it was a very cheap learning experience so i then adjusted myself to this strategy and although these types of girls are everywhere we simply live in different wavelengths or channels and we do not mix at all ,1,TheRedPill
destraht,i will try it after release ,2,Ubuntu
destraht,macbook 12 does not have a fan ,1,Ubuntu
destraht,no because its my primary and only notebook i have mucked around with linux on many machines and i would just need this to basically work with maybe only losing the camera and some function keys perhaps ,1,Ubuntu
destraht,it does not work for me on osx and the only reason why i thought that it worked on a restart of atom was that the tabs were all in order and a history did not exist yet so it just went to the next one ,1,Atom
destraht,tab reordering via drag and drop is broken now any idea on that one it must be totally borked ,3,Atom
destraht,for everyone else reading this i had to close atom for it to take effect although in the past i think that changing keymaps has taken effect immediately ,1,Atom
destraht, ctrl tab ctrl unset ctrl tab pane show next item ctrl shift tab ctrl unset ctrl shift tab pane show previous item thanks i gave this fix another try because i had to close atom for it to take effect ,1,Atom
destraht,ya not my top choice either i am looking up vs code now edit after reviewing vs code i am going to stick with atom not too happy though ,1,Atom
destraht,in a previous release i think 1 6 they introduced this behavior but there was a way to change it back to normal from either within the tabs package or the main settings now it appears to be gone also i am on osx and i now can no longer even reorder my tabs with click dragging this release sucks my ass i tried to look up how to disable auto update and it does not seem possible this crap right now is making me a lot more interested in gosh of all things trying visual studio code or even adobe editor ,1,Atom
destraht,i am sure that it will be an easy fix once someone chimes in here i just think that its crap for them to screw the world out of so many thousands of developer hours because they like flipping switches on little point releases ,1,Atom
destraht,agreed it just killed 25 minutes of my morning as i have been searching around for it totally lame for the to auto update me into this crap mornings like this really make me wish that i was back on ubuntu where i could get atom from a ppa and to choose when to update all of my programs its a real pain in the ass because i was just getting my head around my code and then trying to figure out why two important settings have changed ,2,Atom
destraht,ok it seems weird i would prefer to just be able to pass all of the values in via switches and to have it just output the cert for example i use the follow in each server for my wildcard cert ssl on ssl certificate etc nginx ssl server crt ssl certificate key etc nginx ssl server key so i would just create a different crt and key for each domain i really do not want to put domain names into a text file i just want to do it all in one go with switches because i already have this data in other places and that is what i would be doing in bash or php its acting too much like a wizard for me and i need a lower level api ,1,linux
destraht,i am interested in having a bash or php cli script assemble the cert stuff and to then be able to place strings into the nginx vhost file that i will be creating and not to use a wizard sort of a setup is this possible and how good is it ,2,linux
destraht,say you have a corrupted healbot on board and flashheal and an earthenring farseer in your hand that could be quite a lot of burst to the face assuming that you have an improved hero power and can get the healbot killed against a taunt that is 8 5 3 4 20 damage or lets say that you healbot on board a flash heal and a shadow word death and an upgraded hero power and you can hit face with healbot it would be 6 5 4 8 23 ,1,CompetitiveHS
destraht,also what about 1 farseer in the deck its great against aggro and can get a little extra zap in there in the late game ,1,CompetitiveHS
destraht,what do you guys think about earthen ring farseer with two of these you get your early game aggro stabilization and it can combo later on or just heal up face ,1,CompetitiveHS
destraht,well so you would be playing with lots of healing spells for say 2 soulpriests and one maybe two of embrace shadows it gains a use later on in the matchup or you can just heal face and have a body on turn 3 that is a pretty big set back against aggro shaman or face hunter since they still need to take out the body lets say that you are up against a shaman aggro and they first turn tunnel trogg and then second turn totem golem or even worse the turn 3 coin into spirit wolves you can then just blast them to hell with an embrace shadows and healing circle and then the next turn you can heal face and have a 3 3 body or in the late game you can cast embrace shadows healing circle farseer to take out everything with 4 health and then one 7 health minion plus then even healing power for something else before or after the healing circle it might not be viable but it would utterly destroy aggro i agree that the earthen does not combo well with embrace shadows in the early game but a 3 3 body is not terrible on turn 3 and rogue also just drops si 7 if nothing is better ,0,hearthstone
destraht,running this with earthen ring farseer would make a deck that was crazy anti aggro and also could be used for removal ,0,hearthstone
destraht,i loved my t totem deck it ran 27 class cards and once i got to rank 2 with it the only thing that deck is missing now is 2 creepers and 1 zombie chow i wo not be playing for a few months but it will be quite nice to pick it back up then i think that if earth shock still has uses then the deck will still be great because it runs 2 lightning bolts 2 earth shocks 2 rock biters storm ax and 1 hex so it can really remove the shit out of early game and it for example just eats tempo mage and combo druid there was one variant that would utterly trash later game decks but it was too greedy for zoo and mc and so boom needed to be removed for spiders and weak crap like that the idea of the deck was to be an ultra shaman deck and it had totem overload and windfury theme it was pretty amazing to be running on near constant overload until turn 7 and controlling the board the whole time i got a real life friend who is a hearthstone newbie up on a cheap version of the deck and with my guidance he just crushed at a 10 1 streak it felt totally op also the deck did not run lightening storm so it was basically like zoo in that way i will add that a timely totemcarver on an overloaded turn 4 was really super powerful and often swung it so hard that they could not recover now of course i would run the thing and that has the added benefit of making a forced early flametongue play much more palatable ,1,CompetitiveHS
destraht,yeah its really quite an amazing show really and it is a sleeper hit if scyfy can hang in there it should become super popular by season 3 i think of it like the wire in that really people were very tired of generic channel 2 10 cop shows that they just glossed over it hopefully this show picks up so that it can keep its super high production quality for example certain space scenes must have been performed in a set in a free falling airplane and that is not cheap also the wire work is quite good its based off of a book series that i am told is good so there is little chance of it fizzling out into crap ,2,TheRedPill
destraht,if this becomes a staple in a few decks then there is at least some case for earth shock its brutal ,2,CompetitiveHS
destraht,i think that realistically if you are building a very large program with multiple entry points common chunks css text extraction locale data etc then it will take more than a few weeks to construct your build system to your exact needs ,1,javascript
destraht,if its ultimately something that you will bundle in your app even asynchronously then you can write your own loader to have it do some really nice stuff ,1,javascript
destraht,the way wildcard building works in webpack it very much functions like a task runner you can have it bundle all files that match a pattern must include a base directory and then during runtime it will throw an exception if the specific resource that you are asking for does not exist for example locale data with po loader https www npmjs com package po loader ,2,javascript
destraht,in one of my very complicated classes i have a yaml file in its module directory and i import this into the class file it makes tweaking settings super easy and i do not have to look up the constructor or find some constant listed above the class then later if i need the versatility i can then easily move this out of the module directory to set it with a di or something like that ,1,javascript
destraht,what infection was that ,1,TheRedPill
destraht, the expanse http www imdb com title tt3230854 ref nv sr 1 is imo by far the best sci fi thing happening now and its also far more accurate of real life with the vast majority of brutal violence being performed by men some of the women in the show are powerful and crafty as a woman could be but then also some others they are depicted selling ass as you would expect ,9,TheRedPill
destraht,yes her character was actually believable for a movie because after having your guts ripped out decapitated blasted in the chest etc hundreds of times anyone would eventually become a hardened badass without fear edit after just watching this video again i had a particular issue with her being a total martial arts badass and being able to swing a foot long metal stick with one hand at man wearing space armor and to have him be all fucked up by it as she immediately uses her other hand to fire off her blaster with a perfect hit so that just is not very realistically female or fitting for her slender but curvy body type sure a woman can fuck up a man if she is using a weapon and gets a solid hit but not some casual side swing against fucking space armor ,6,TheRedPill
destraht,about halfway into watching the video a few days ago off of imdb i had to pause it and send an email to my friend describing how bullshit it is and coming right off the back of the last female heroine movie it is just extra stupid ,2,TheRedPill

destraht,also it can function sort of like a lady of the lake in that you could squeeze at a totem for just one mana then the big body protects the soft totem ,10,hearthstone
destraht,some of those are much better than my starting cards ,1,SolForge
destraht,i recently played my first night of solforge and its a good game the interface is obviously pretty rough though i am a programmer though so i can navigate around just fine but certainly it would confuse a lot of people compared to hearthstone omg also sometimes the opponent is able to play three cards and it just happens in a flash and i see my entire board of mostly starter cards get fucked to hell and i have no solid idea about what just happened ,2,SolForge
destraht,it turns out that jspm can be incredibly slow we know that http 2 does not solve the issue of overhead from accessing maybe hundreds of files i think that they really screwed the pooch on that one their framework might be super awesome but its possible that they gimped themselves by picking the new new tech that is not better than existing tech webpack 2 will make the difference even larger by being able to perform tree shaking on es6 modules to reduce bundle size libraries like lodash will have many of their functions simply dropped out of the final bundle ,1,vuejs
destraht,it will be a desperate measure pre or post collapse ,1,conspiracy
destraht,if this card becomes popular than between it and unleash a shaman deck with a constant board presence and burst damage will become nearly impossible ,1,CompetitiveHS
destraht,i am thinking that if it finds a place it will be in decks that come out with a strong opening and keep the board at all costs then if they miss a power turn or use it to clear then you could play this thing and watch them scramble it might be good for shaman or mage that could kill off another creature with hex polymorph or burn ,2,CompetitiveHS
destraht,virtual reality is likely to become reality for many people who have issues or are young and isolated and that is far too important to trust to a very closed system and company ,0,linux_gaming
destraht,i am all for the general plan of auditing the fed but understand that it would cause a complete market crash when a plethora of systemically endemic scams were revealed most people do not want to positively affect change if it means living in an unstable system for a number of years while the bugs were worked out so in many ways our shitty politicians are doing exactly what the majority wants and that is to keep the system afloat at all costs including the future that is what people want as they are not interested in sacrifice and living in what would feel like a second world country for some years while the economy recalibrated to reality we have the politicians that we deserve and we are collectively getting exactly what we want ,6,conspiracy
destraht,my current model of us fascism is best described by the qwest situation some years ago all of the telecoms did exactly what the government asked the exposed back room nsa closet before there were anti terrorism laws that probably just allow them to do that but qwest dragged its feet a lot and so the ceo was taken down on a scandal additionally how did all of those yellow dots just get on the printed paper they did not pass a public law on the matter nor was there ever an iso or international standard about it they do what the fuck they want to and the corps do what they say or important people are taken down ,1,conspiracy
destraht,they also tend to perceive the person who is planning ahead to be an idiot for not taking the cookie off of the counter also related is that very street hard ruthless and audacious people tend to view anyone else who demonstrates kindness as being an idiot so everyone who has not descended to their level of brutality is an idiot ,2,TheRedPill
destraht,i am not ready to choose a new framework and so i am just reviewing them for many months from now vue looks to be the best to me in that it has a very simply setup that plays well with webpack aurelia looks good except i am concerned that its setup is too complicated and they went the jspm bundle route with recently only webpack as an extra but it seems unnecessarily complicated the only thing that i do not 100 like about vue from what i have seen so far is that it is using old backbone style class creation and i would like to see more es6 classes like how aurelia does it its a minor issue though also i am waiting to see how well the entire platform develops and standardizes such as vuex the author recently stated that most of the recent work is going into other parts of the platform like vuex and the router and the core vue js part is mostly fixed ,2,vuejs

destraht,i am thinking of something along the lines of a vanilla minion that can be played from both full and overloaded crystals so you could play forked lightening a 1 mana minion and then on your overloaded turn play a minion from overloaded crystals i am played a lot of shaman with likely 1000 wins and a lot of deck strategies really need tempo in those early turns and lava shock does not do it lava shock is pretty good for turn 4 5 with it really shining turn 6 7 when you are getting arid of overload for two turns edit forked lightening is not good but there are other possible future cards that could make it playable in a few types of decks ,1,hearthstone

destraht,i think that your only option would be to get some type of a woof https en wikipedia org wiki wwoof hippy commune going on basically cutting to the chase younger people go to places like these to take a break from the world and to be farming while possibly believing that they are saving the world and so fulfilling their need to virtue signal at any rate hippy girls will go to places like these you probably are not a hyper lefty though so better keep your mouth shut ,3,TheRedPill
destraht, once this becomes a tend it will alter the balance of supply demand so much that the feminists will probably seek to stop wm from marry nww i think that it will take a form more like eliminating the possibility for a wide swath of men to be able to leave the country by attaching to it passport restrictions it will take many forms like sexual offenders being restricted people with outstanding private debt and child and alimony support its not uncommon for men to hit a rough patch after marriage and to be on their friends couch for a few months and to miss a payment or two as it all just stacks up i mean various aspects of the system not just the constitutional legal system are already limiting travel rights so there will just be more land mines the government already went bankrupt in 1971 when it changed the rules by fiat decree governments rarely just make a big declaration that they are bankrupt and they game their system for quite a number of years impressively so for the us after that and they increasingly squeeze their producers while implementing capital controls the us is a special case because they are acting like a world government and imposing their banking laws onto the rest of the world but really it is just against american clients and so we become less desirable due to the onerous requirements the government will simply convince women that what they are doing is protecting women interests in all of this so nothing new just more of it to come of course this is why society needs strong men because women are incapable of fighting against this type of exploitive control ,2,TheRedPill

destraht,the cops do not shake down really at all anymore since the maidan thing its now a national focus to get very normal young men into policing roles and before about four years ago in kiev they would look at me like a mad dog but not anymore the police had the tar beat out of them and they were routinely placed in the garbage bins etc renting a house is easy peasy but a city like odessa is known for being scammy because of the tourism utilities will already be setup and its nothing you are probably better just getting taxis everywhere for the first year and you will already be living in the coolest area guaranteed so you will just safely stroll around i am in poland now and i find ukraine to be far safer and receptive to foreigners far too many polish men are really pretty whack i find ukraine quite chill ,1,TheRedPill

destraht,without socialism whether it is by the state or tiny tribe she risks the possibility of being totally fucked over and raising a kid by herself and just busting her ass to survive and then only having one kid instead of the three that she wanted the lack of this type of socialism is my favorite part of ukraine and i think this is not the reason why it is fucked up there now other reasons after living there unfortunately about 85 of the world seems to me to be a giant cuck factory smart enterprising people do just fine there really since its so easy to connect to the larger world these days ,3,TheRedPill
destraht,western women are definitely not my target but in all likelihood the next time that i get lucky with one of them it will be because i was the cool guy who had solid frame and did not challenge them intellectually in any way so just pure demeanor based relationship like i am a super smart monkey boring then really at some point very soon into knowing her i will say an actual opinion and it will be so completely opposed to her viewpoint that it creates a emotional fracture that cannot be repaired the sex can be continued by simply being a confident guy that does not go against the grain and its really difficult for me to respect a person like this so its a time bomb then next next etc ,5,TheRedPill
destraht,agreed on your agreement so again to emphasize if some chick has suddenly decided to go from accidentally being there with the drugs to fuck dudes who are just there and is instead targeting boring old clean op then i would be afraid of that its much more of an intellectualized grab a beta move than anything else and again does not mean that op is actually beta she is also fully capable of having one of those nights at any time when she gets that offer women make the party and the drugs are always there ,1,TheRedPill
destraht,i think that it goes farther then just being able to beep women or not to i have found that telling a woman something serious and critical that she was not capable of seeing in herself is the best way to gain her utter contempt now i will correct the statement to say that it is very probably not an absolute feminine position because in ukraine and far eastern europe they mostly do not have a sense of entitlement of relevance and they are hungry for my position on matters and they seek it out so i end up telling eastern women much more involved opinions and they are receptive to it because they were looking for it to begin with in the west there is a very strong sense of entitlement for both men and women that seems to frame the entire thought process and its basically an assumption that one thoughts are relevant simply for existing regardless of the effort or content i suppose that its similar to the concepts of you are born in sin versus born in purity or born in ignorance versus born in enlightenment combined with bill burr sentiment about how women are constantly pandered to it creates a situation where women are not routinely challenged and so they learn to act like the spoiled emperor until their fertile beauty fades and suddenly the world becomes a lot more raw to them and they then lash out in anger how could they know any better ,15,TheRedPill

destraht,i think that in my northbay area that about 60 70 of the population are daily on pills lots of alcohol or marijuana being sober the vast majority of the time is not super popular and it seems to become more extreme with mostly only those who have strong ideological reasons refraining from it the anxiety pills also create a bit of an odd mental state the big gun shooters who do the massacres are from what i can tell are basically all on ssri depression drugs ,2,TheRedPill

destraht,in my experience these girls type cast me as the very boring and safe guy while i think that the girls that i would consider for a girlfriend tend to put me into the maybe possibly too wild to handle category i think that the drugs offer a whole hell of a lot of plausible deniability for the pre event and post event wrap up i imagine that your simple presence will function as a mirror for them and that just by standing in front of them they will see themselves and it will make them feel a bit bad about it and then they will try to put that back onto you i would be far more concerned if these girls suddenly decided that they liked you a lot because that means that they are feeling like settling for the safe guy that does not mean that you are not a cool and attractive guy its just what they are bringing to it that would turn me off basically something like an alpha widow even if you are super alpha the dude who supplies drugs is just always there and then those girls tend to fuck that guy who is simply there at that time of the night ,3,TheRedPill
