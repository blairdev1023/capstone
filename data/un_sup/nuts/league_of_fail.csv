league_of_fail, browns do not deserve the hate they get like i said they fill in the gap and are a pretty versatile switch imo you are right that they fill a gap in the cmx line they do not deserve hate but try them side by side with gateron browns which are less expensive and i think you will get the general feeling of discontent about them here keyboard makers are all about cherry mx red black blue brown and blues from various cherry mx switch clone manufacturers all the hype you see about zealio switches is just as well deserved by gateron browns which just have a less pronounced tactile bump though more noticeable than the cmx brown my cmx browns ping and feel scratchy my gateron browns are smooth ,1,MechanicalKeyboards
league_of_fail,i have boards with gbs and zealio 67s the zealio stem is not the same i agree on the gbs being a big step up from cmx browns ,1,MechanicalKeyboards
league_of_fail,the tactile bump is noticeably larger than gbs pressing deliberately slowly cmxb short scratchy tac bump gb short smooth tac bump zealio 67 feels like a round cam rolling over the leaf as you pass the bump long smooth tac bump ,2,MechanicalKeyboards
league_of_fail,fyi having also used gateron browns and cherry mx browns the gateron browns are noticeably smoother my rosewill rk 9100 has cherry mx browns and they feel scratchy like there a piece of sand stuck rubbing between the stem and keycap if you go straight from cherry mx browns to zealios you will notice a giant difference ,2,MechanicalKeyboards
league_of_fail,i enjoy the zealios more both switches feel wonderful under my fingers it just that the difference at the price i paid was not worth it to me in retrospect if i were entering a gb with zealios at an option for 60 of the price i paid i would go with the zealios the zealio has a noticeably larger tactile bump compared to the gb even as a heavy typist you will notice the bump gateron browns bottom out at 55g i think with a 45g actuation weight i do not know what force the 65g zealios actuate at but iirc 65g is the bottom out weight both switches are smooth operators will the weight and extra tactility be noticeable to you yes will it help you keep from bottoming out without o rings possibly i am working on that now and the zealio tactility and heavier spring help if that keyboard allows for switch top removal you could always swap in heavier springs or something later ,1,MechanicalKeyboards
league_of_fail,having used both gateron browns and zealios 67g the gateron browns are a fantastic buy value wise for tactile switches if i had been able to test zealio switches before buying i probably would have opted to save the 100 i spent and gone with gateron browns again or with a different zealio spring weight they are both wonderful feeling switches that said most people on the zealio train seem overjoyed at their purchases ,2,MechanicalKeyboards

league_of_fail,my favorite switches are tactile i have tried cherry mx brown gateron brown zealio 67gs after spending over 100 on zeal switches i believe that gateron brown is the best bang for your buck if you are doing your own soldering if you are buying a board the cherry mx clear is also what i would aim for compact keyboards are popular here magicforce68 with gateron browns was my second mk while it a nice little keyboard at an attractive price i discovered that layers took a lot more getting used to than i expected so i bought a cheap tkl with blues to tide me over until i can solder different switches on it i say give the 66 you are looking at a shot but do not forget about tkls as far as your typing errors i saw on another comment that you have had the board for two weeks and it has blue switches they have as much upward feedback as tactile and linear as far as i can tell i would assume you just need to get used to typing on it it took me a while to get back up to full speed after moving from a microsoft sidewinder x4 weird key spacing to my first mk standard keys except for bottom row ,1,MechanicalKeyboards
