craschnet,used to have one under the enpower name it used a full i7 690x that was a quite a while back like you said i still get a better discount with alienware i got my i7 4710hq 980m 16gb ram 4k touchscreen 128gb nvme and 1tb with a graphics amplifier for just under 1600 that was about a year ago ,1,pcgaming
craschnet,i was referring to the microarchitecture using older desktop tech and making it more power efficient and lowering the clock speeds like using maxwell instead of the pascal for the 1000m series ,1,pcgaming
craschnet,i have a 980m in my alienware 15 benchmarks show it to be around 25 faster than a 960 but slower than a 970 i cannot really complain for a mobile gaming pc i can lug to my hotel room http gpu userbenchmark com compare nvidia gtx 980m vs nvidia gtx 960 m15596vs3165 http gpu userbenchmark com compare nvidia gtx 980m vs nvidia gtx 970 m15596vs2577 from the initial leaked benchmarks the 1080m on par or slightly faster than a actual titan x or 980 ti,3,pcgaming
craschnet,i have an alienware 15 with a 980m it slightly heavier than most laptops now if you get one with full fledged 980 those things need a team of mules when going though tsa i went with the alienware only because it was way cheaper with my company discount msi asus gigabyte have thinner and lighter laptops with similar specs ,2,pcgaming
craschnet,i am waiting for the 1080m i travel for the job ,2,pcgaming
craschnet,compared to 980m in my alienware 15 that like at idle ,5,pcgaming

craschnet,if you cannot accept the fact that unjustifiable homicide is taking someone inalienable civil rights away then we are at an impasse because even case law has proven such why because gun control in its full context is a mater of law ,3,gunpolitics

craschnet,again rights have to be balanced with all other rights and other people rights we know for a fact that unjustifiable homicide violates the victim rights ,3,gunpolitics
craschnet,it considered a public safety issue it called fucking balance ,5,gunpolitics
craschnet,the 1st amendment does not allow someone to violate someone else 14th amendment rights hulk vs gawker is a perfect example of this this is the only true limit on rights balancing it with other rights and other people rights we know for a fact that unjustifiable murder violates the victim rights second rights are inalienable government only has power due to the power we as a people give it ,3,gunpolitics
craschnet,do you understand balance because you are just trying to push all or nothing mentality rights have to be balance with other rights your right to self protection does not give you the right to endanger other people rights negligently and recklessly for example the 1st amendment does not over rule one right to privacy based on the 14th amendment hulk vs gawker is evident of that we know criminal murder violates victim personal rights ,6,gunpolitics
