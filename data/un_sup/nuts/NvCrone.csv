NvCrone,in my area the city grew out to the country so now the ranches and the farms are valued at the value of the land developed into housing developments instead of their current use sometimes the only alternative it to gift the land to the city county because there actually is no money sub divide and you do not have a working farm ranch anymore so the families cannot pay the new level of taxes and have to sell this also happens with small businesses cause the inventory throws them over the top it still stealing someone life the only out is an insurance policy to pay the taxes when you die a gift to them but what goes first when there not enough and medical bills are a mile high and all the really rich people put it in trusts and charitable foundations that take care of their families trusts that will never get taxed so they can talk forever about raise my taxes because they do not pay them the whole well screw the rich thing is a farce bill and hill and buffet and gates have everything in trusts foundations ,1,The_Donald
