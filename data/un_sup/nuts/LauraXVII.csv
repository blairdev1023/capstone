LauraXVII,for me it not about money it about freedom yes as an engineer with a masters degree i could earn 35k right away but i would have to spend 5 10 hours a week commuting plus 40 hours in a sweaty stuffy office pretending to enjoy what i do and make small talk about the weather or i could sit in my pjs at home creating things that give me joy and earn about half the wage but work about a third of the time then i can spend the rest of my time renovating the house going for a walk going to the gym etc,1,Entrepreneur
LauraXVII,not sure if you would count me as successful but i am 24 on track to go full time with my business by the end of the year and having the income from the business has allowed is to buy a house in one of the most expensive cities in the uk we exchange contracts next week i have had a cushty life i am not going to turn round and say i have had any hardships because that just insulting to people who have had it hard i have got a supportive family and have always had a roof over my head and food on the table my flair which is verified by the mods says aerospace engineer on it i have got 2 degrees in it a couple of papers and a patent pending for morphing aircraft the hardest thing i have ever had to go through is the decision to leave aerospace which took about 18 months to make i was the golden child everyone knew me because there are not many small blonde girls in aerospace and i did well at my courses i was not happy i do not like engineering i like planes and i am not actually good at engineering i just work hard there was a lot of therapy sessions i dumped my current fianc in case he was the problem there was a suicide attempt and an alarming amount of tears tipping point came at my first year review of my phd my supervisors had all said i was doing fine and just keep doing what i was doing external examiner who is known to hate anything that is not exactly how he would do it predictably hated my phd because i was using neural networks and he likes radial basis functions my supervisors just totally threw me under the bus to try and save their reputations so i quit on the spot this was november 2016 got a part time work at home admin job which enabled me to work more on my online store selling crystals and minerals which i started i am making enough now to go full time with but i am saving up 6 months of expenses at which point i will go full time probably at the end of the year just for a nice round number i am launching a sister company in july which could flop or could soar no idea how it will go as there only one other person in that niche so far and their site strategy is pretty shoddy background wise i came from a pretty entrepreneurial family my grandpa used to own run a multi million pound horticulture business which was passed to mum who had to leave due to illness and the people who took over sadly ran it into the ground dad is an accountant by trade and now owns runs a brick and mortar store as i mentioned earlier i studied engineering i do not think it was for me but i am not going to discourage anyone else to do it i think if i was going to study something else it would have been accounting but then i would never have met my fianc or moved to my current home so maybe i would not change it the one thing i will say though is that i bumbled around doing research and not quite being ready and waiting for the right time etc there is no right time you just have to bite the bullet i started my store with 7 products from aliexpress that i listed on etsy and i now have hundreds if not thousands of rocks lying around my house just start small to test the water and make sure you are nice to your customers ,11,Entrepreneur

LauraXVII,life is definitely easier if you just take the day job easier does not necessarily mean better though and it does not mean worse either there pros and cons to both pros for a job are that it easier there steady income each month no liability if something goes wrong consistent and usually shorter working hours you get to socialise with other people while you are at work and you can get a mortgage loan easier pros for entrepreneurship are that you get to do what you want you do not have to sit in rush hour traffic you feel like you are building something for you not so that someone else can profit from what you are doing and you can work whenever and wherever you want it really down to a choice of what you want at that particular point in life for me i have no kids or mortgage so i am happy to take a part time job for rent etc and spend the rest of my time building my business for the boyfriend he about to sign up for a mortgage for us which i cannot be on cos i am self employed so he needs a more stable income,1,Entrepreneur
LauraXVII, because it takes time and effort to set up a business because you wo not actually be paying 5 for something that worth 100 you will have a minimum order quantity so you will have to buy 10 things for 50 because once you have bought them then you have them lying around the house until they sell which could be 2 weeks or it could be 2 years because for the period when you are starting a business it probably actually more profitable to do overtime at work because you are responsible for your taxes rather than your employer sorting it out for you because you have to deal with shipping and any returns then you do not just have a thing lying around your house you have a broken thing that is literally just for collecting dust and you cannot get hold of the wholesaler to send it back to them for a refund because they gave you a faulty thing so now you are out of pocket because you might not actually get the thing that you ordered from the wholesaler i have ordered crystals before and got a pack of 4 books instead it not as simple as just buy for x sell for 5x there a lot more behind the scenes that people do not realise edit i am ma add more because it monday and i am grumpy because you have to photograph the thing and no matter how good you are at photography there some other seller with better more exciting pictures than you because if the rrp of the thing is 100 then you can be sure there someone selling it for 10 on ebay because if you decide to sell on your own site you gotta do a whole load of marketing too because you have to deal with idiots who are like this does not work i want my money back and i want to keep the thing,2,Entrepreneur

LauraXVII,the compliment came from another compulsive liar who was dating my friend at the time he on a whole different level and he still going at the age of 23 at which point he should be old enough to know better the compulsive lying was when i was quite young from the age of about 5 14ish i had not quite clicked that there were consequences to telling lies and people could tell i was lying as i got older i realised that everyone gets found out eventually but i think what changed the most was that my life became interesting enough that i did not feel the need to lie about it any more funnily enough i would not regard myself as close with my dad he always been there but as i have no interest in cricket cycling or trains i have never really connected with him your friend might be on to something here ,2,AskReddit

LauraXVII,similar to what u runningdude said if you are set on registering as a company go for a sole trader llc for a one man work from home web developer is overkill my advice would be to go visit your local chamber of commerce and chat to someone and see if they offer discount initial sessions with an accountant mine did many years ago an accountant is really who you should be asking these questions to instead of reddit as they will be able to tell you what you can claim as expenses like electricity rent council tax etc as well as how to set up,1,Entrepreneur
LauraXVII,my approach for q1 is to let them know when their product is shipped something along the lines of hey your product has shipped it will be with you in x time any problems let me know for q3 i base it on two things how much everyone else is selling it for and how much i have to charge to break even somewhere in between those is the sweet spot if your break even price is higher than everyone else selling price it not the right product for q5 we use twitter and instagram hashtags and follow unfollow tools are your friends do not buy fake followers to begin with it very obvious and makes it look like you are not good enough for real people if you want to bulk up numbers later on by all means go for it yes for the live chat but just have it available do not make it pop up and make noises that bloody irritating,1,Entrepreneur

LauraXVII,1 so double masters is a no unless you do your meng for four years then an msc after that yes you can do your beng then do an msc but because this is a postgraduate course you would have to go through the application process again and the student finance for postgraduates is different too you can borrow up to 10k total so that has to cover your tuition and your living fees study hard and you might be able to get a scholarship for the msc then combine it with the loan and you should have enough to survive off 2 it probably will be there a ton of phds in engineering me being one of them phds are not pre defined in the way that beng meng msc courses are they are advertised when or if a certain professor has funding or you can define one yourself if you self fund but that very rare 3 i would get in touch with the school of engineering on facebook or twitter they have an entire office full of people to answer questions and they are the experts good luck in september edit stupid automatic number list ,1,UOB

LauraXVII,yayyy another engineering nerd ,6,RedPillWives
LauraXVII,congratulations ladies i am laura i am 23 and i am a phd student in aerospace engineering i am also a british rpw which are pretty thin on the ground i am currently in monk mode after a pretty traumatic on off break up that spanned over six months with the person who i genuinely thought i would spend the rest of my life with i finally plucked up the courage to leave for good at the start of march i have been here for about 4 5 months now and even though i am not in a relationship the difference that rpw made has been incredible so i just want to say thank you to everyone who helped me ,10,RedPillWives
LauraXVII,bedminster is lovely especially north street if you are a charity shop cosy coffee shop kinda person what i would say is avoid living on north street the rents are a reasonable amount more expensive than a couple streets further back if that makes sense from a renting point of view because you are coming in from another country you wo not have any credit records here so what my friends have had to do is pay 6 months rent up front on top of the deposit and estate agents fees i had to do the same and it was just over 6000 so i would just be aware of that also places to rent go sooooo quickly quite often estate agents will put something on the market on a monday evening do the viewings on tuesday and then contracts are done by wednesday if you see somewhere you like get in touch with the agents asap and welcome to bristol ,3,bristol

LauraXVII,i am not convinced having dark triad traits will probably influence several things such as social behaviour and posture but the idea that being narcissistic influences your facial features it seems pretty unlikely maybe their facial expressions but not how high their cheekbones are or the thickness of their eyebrows however i do not doubt their findings that having such traits is typically more attractive so less likely to experience dead bedrooms and hence have more children interesting to see things like this in mainstream media usually things suggesting that women like manly men are not written just in case the anti patriarchy strikes ,5,RedPillWives

LauraXVII,my personal approach is to be friends friendly with them as apparently we have different definitions of friend but keep them at arms length i meet up with my male friends probably once twice a month and we do not usually talk in between if you were looking to start dating someone who spent all their time with one girl you would likely end up getting jealous or you just would not bother because you would feel like you cannot compete it a red flag to guys to be so close with a male friend ,1,RedPillWomen

LauraXVII,everyone been there it a requirement when you start drinking it could have been a hell of a lot worse you could be posting on here about having drunk sex with him i would send him a text as well if you have not actually said the words i am sorry to him as for the touching i would try a playful dance out of the way or if his hands are wandering upwards grab them put them on your hips and then kiss him some of the more experienced women might have better ideas about this though ,3,RedPillWomen
LauraXVII,have you apologised just fire him a quick text saying i am really sorry about last night i am never drinking again lol haha laughing face if he wants to talk about it which he probably wo not then you are giving him an opportunity if he texts back saying it fine or whatever then drop it and move on only time will tell whether you can save the relationship just try not to make it weird ,5,RedPillWomen

LauraXVII,i will admit i chose my hobbies you are not wrong there but i have been in the situation where i have stopped doing hobbies or following interests because of a partner and it just led to me becoming unhappy and resenting them there a big difference between deferring to a partner letting them lead the relationship and completely losing sight of who you are because your relationship completely consumes you,3,RedPillWomen
LauraXVII,normally i would agree with you without question because you are one of the senior figures in rpw and that what we are supposed to do however when i typically see maybe one or two females a day for less than a couple of minutes what would you suggest that i do ignore everybody else around me for the other 23 hours and 56 minutes for fear of insulting offending my oh if i was a sahm and was actively seeking a male friend then i could understand but when i am around males for 60 70 hours a week am i supposed to turn round to them and say sorry i cannot talk to you i have a boyfriend ,2,RedPillWomen
LauraXVII,i think it depends on the situation with those friends i work in engineering which is male dominated and my hobbies are primarily male dominated too i volunteer at airshows and help restore old aircraft i play video games like gta and cod i go karting etc it near on impossible to do any of these regularly without having any guys taking part there only one other girl i know in my city who karts regularly so the idea of not having male friends at all seems absurd to me the friendship with these friends however is different to the friendship i have with my girlfriends i will see my girlfriends every couple of weeks talk to them a couple of times a week and tell them about basically every aspect of my life with my aerospace karting gaming friends i will see them once a month or maybe a little more frequently over airshow season but we know very little about each others personal lives i think having male friends is not the big issue here having male best friends is,3,RedPillWomen
LauraXVII,i am not sure a lot of guys are like that i have never experienced it that badly before with other exes but he did not input into anything what games we would play what we were having for dinner what we were going to do that weekend evening it got very exhausting after a while i did ask him about it once and he was like i just want to do what makes you happy which is nice but does not make it less infuriating ,1,RedPillWomen
LauraXVII,my ex was the classic beta nerdy good job good bux etc the relationship did not work because i ended up taking charge and that ruined the attraction for me and for him i know that my fault and my problem but all he would ever come out with is i do not know it up to you i could not see myself marrying him or someone like him i would prefer to go for the classic alpha style male that i am attracted to mainly cos i want kids and it pretty difficult to get pregnant if you are only having sex once every few months this is just my personal opinion though ,3,RedPillWomen

LauraXVII,i had the same issue with university i was going to go straight after school and do a 3 year degree and join the armed forces and blah blah blah i ended up taking a gap year because i was not ready and i watched everyone else go to uni while i stayed home and got an office job most of my friends dropped out and now i have two degrees and am working on my phd while telecommuting to the office job i took during my gap yah to get extra money sometimes when you are looking at things that are not working out it actually giving you the opportunity to do something even better in the future so what if you are still renting that means if you or hubs get a dream job offer elsewhere there less hassle to move there do not think of your personal life as a timeline to be checked off by x date think of it more as an open ended checklist to be ticked off whenever and make sure to look back at what was previously on your checklist and you have completed every once in a while to remind yourself how far you have come ,4,RedPillWomen

LauraXVII,so last time i posted i would got back together with the ex and we were about to go to iceland we did end up going to iceland where he spent the entire time texting another girl that he would been seeing that i had no idea about i was 100 right about him being a crappy captain ex is very much an ex again and this time no being friends afterwards so the good i went to iceland we saw the northern lights and got some lovely pictures and it was amazing when me and the ex were discussing getting back together we very openly talked about what improvements we each need to make in the relationship which means i now have the beginning of a reference sheet for what not to do in my next relationship definitely helpful i have a date friday night i know this is probably too soon with a guy who i have known for about 4 1 2 years now and who i know has been interested for the entire time laura doyle said in surrendered single to not turn down people based on you thinking that it would not work out just give it a shot so i am the bad obviously the re breakup etc but also my latest mot like a yearly test for the car then a service cost me 660 940 as a broke student living in one of the most expensive cities in the uk it cleared me out and now i might have to get a second job on top of my current job and my phd which is full time gah the ugly when he told me about the other girl there was a lot of crying some shouting some dry heaving in the toilet and i even threw my keys at him that was possibly the ugliest i would ever been and i am going to have to make damn sure that this never happens again ,1,RedPillWomen

LauraXVII,so this is not specific to your desired look but i changed my entire look a couple of years back from frizzy greasy hair hoodies and baggy jeans to the classic style think breton stripe top and trench coat so i thought i would pitch in with some things i have learnt 1 this is going to take a lot of time you are not just going to be able to put on the dress in the picture and look the same as her it will take hours of wardrobe planning a lot of analysing your best and worst features analysing what colours do and do not suit you what shape clothes make you look fat or your bum look huge which is my issue and then the most difficult part is pulling all of these things together into an item of clothing that a store might stock 2 pinterest is your friend i have a range of boards on mine general outfits that i like the look of outfits i like that i own all the pieces of and i have separated these into different coloured jeans just to make it easier to find an outfit in the morning a night out outfits board again for quick reference a wishlist board of items that i want so i find all of these outfits items by searching on a number of different things tumblr instagram pinterest blogs google images and what i will do is search a range of different things as well style outfits for me it usually preppy outfits style blogs item of clothing outfits so for example olive jeans outfits if it on instagram i would usually search preppy or olivejeans obviously as you go through you can start to follow people whose outfits keep coming up in your searches and on sites like tumblr it will recommend you similar people to follow so you are always expanding your clothes network 3 once you have got your inspiration you will need to go through your closet and separate everything into 3 piles fits with my future look half fits with my future look and can be worn temporarily until i have redone my wardrobe does not match at all the does not match at alls can either be kept as casual workout clothes or can be charity shopped 4 then you need to start making a list of the basic items that you will need ideally you should be able to make about 14 outfits from these so you have a nice little capsule wardrobe bear in mind that we are almost in between seasons so you will probably have to do this for both summer and winter outfits 5 aaand finally shop take someone with you who will be brutally honest about whether something suits you or not just because you have a jacket with shoulder pads on your essential items list does not mean that shoulder pads actually suit you well maybe not shoulder pads but you get the idea just remember that even once you have planned it all out this process takes time i am four years down the line and i am still buying things that i consider to be essential two months later also let your style evolve naturally just because none of the bloggers you follow would be seen dead in a certain item of clothing does not mean you cannot wear it if it looks good and makes you feel good i think that enough rambling for now good luck edit apologies for how reddit has formatted my numbering it was 1 5 but apparently not anymore ,2,RedPillWomen

LauraXVII,just a warning 18 year old me was also using the pull out method rather than condoms and got pregnant and subsequently miscarried even though i was on the pill you gotta at least use one method of contraception and even then it not 100 sound since then i have had the injection and i am currently using the implant i started having the injection because i was getting breakthrough bleeding on the pill and they were worried about it it was alright i had to have it once every 3 months and i had the most sadistic nurse who i swear thoroughly enjoyed stabbing my bum as hard as she possibly could i went for the implant because i only have to think about it once every three years i do not have to worry about forgetting to take it cos it sat in my arm permanently i did have to get local anaesthetic for it it bled a reasonable amount and i had the bruise for over a month afterwards so if you are squeamish i would not advise it especially because what goes in must come out my little sister has been on the same pill progesterone vs estrogen that i was on for 4 years now with no problem i think it just a case of discussing with your doctor and then trial and error to figure out what is best for you but please please please please use at least something i am lucky in that i miscarried before i knew i was pregnant so i never had to make an abortion decision but 5 years later i still cry thinking about losing a baby unexpected unplanned unwanted pregnancies are hell please learn from my mistakes ,5,RedPillWomen
LauraXVII,i think the main difference between a house and an apartment judged by my apartment vs the family home is the cleaning tidying of the outside which is normally done for you in an apartment block things like keeping the outside clear gardening window cleaning making sure that the paint is not flaking off etc also because houses are larger you will probably have more bathrooms and just rooms in general to clean and once you have children or pets the list of things to do just explodes ,3,RedPillWomen
