stabfase,no in fact i was praised from management several times for not letting them get away with name calling and arguing without proof of purchase what relationship the customers that do this are self entitled shits that do not deserve customer service at all they did not even buy the item from the store in the first place why would you give them anything if they ever acted civil and acknowledged their mistake i would have helped them so you are telling me when someone walks up to your service station you do not ask for proof of purchase then proceed to encourage their behavior by giving them discounts if anyone is wondering how there are so many entitled customers roaming around you can thank delsana ,1,funny

stabfase,nope not in college the second i graduated with my hs diploma i was already set with a job and great pay due to my family having good ties with their employer that being said with all the money i made working after high school i took a few years off from my job and attended some college courses that i had interest in ended up taking enough courses in welding that i could have gone on to get my welding certification only used that trick only once although i could scan a fake college diploma and nobody would question it i think i might do that for kicks graduate of south harmon institute of technology ,2,funny
stabfase,i remember getting really bad grades my junior year in high school i grabbed my report card scanned it and added a one b and one c just so it did not look too obvious then printed it out and it looked perfectly legitimate the smile on my face after it worked on my parents my heart was also racing when i handed it to them i was almost passing out it was very exhilarating though like hanging on the verge of death my parents were not dumb in the slightest but i managed to convince them on numerous occasions that i was innocent ,2,funny

stabfase,oh i would not be a rude like that i would simply tell them if they could understand that i am not your father and if needed help them find out who he is you have no role left after that part because once they develop you will end up as ome guy my mom cheated on or they might respect what you did and call you their father if you stick around and pay the bills or that bitch brings their real father into their lives and you are out of the picture those 4 years raising them as your own might leave a deep impact but in no way should that equate you to having to sacrifice a majority of your life to hold that lie together they are young enough to have this blow over quite easily ,-1,AdviceAnimals
stabfase,i am going to go out on a limb and say that you have never been cheated on and had your wife have some other guys children then passed that along to you as a lie saying they are yours until you find out from a doctor four years later ,3,AdviceAnimals
stabfase, the public policy behind this is to prevent someone in this situation from abandoning the child just because it not theirs yikes how is this fair the to guy who got tricked that the ultimate blow for me you get betrayed by the one you love and now you have to take care of another man child holy shit would i break if fact i would go off the grid and move to wyoming not a god damn cent would leave my pocket dick move but i find having to pay for a child that not yours is a huge insult it sure does suck for the kids but it certainly is not fair at all to the guy getting screwed over by being lied to until this day ,38,AdviceAnimals
stabfase,lied to him and had him sign the birth certificate knowing she had slept around and possibly had another mans child not sure if that holds up in court but if i was the judge i would never make someone be held accountable for being tricked or lied into taking care of some other guys children why should the actual biological dad get away free of all responsibility ,2,AdviceAnimals
stabfase,we have been given 400rp for down times on a few occasions so that potentially thousands they gave away for a minor two day inconvenience i somehow doubt they are willing to take a large fraction of their income due technical issues every large game company experiences to me it seems zero loss to them if they can just hand out rp like that i am really doubting they could lose 1 3rd of their revenue if they gave out rp because 1 the people who are currently paying for rp will continue to do so despite being given rp 2 the one who did not want to spend rp on a skin but got free rp will most likely either purchase rp after being allowed to spend some or he will continue to not buy rp i have still yet to be convinced that f2p digital currency is a loss of profit when gifted small portions they would have to gift a very large quantity of their games currency in order to dent the vast game they have created i am not sure how many skins champions there are anymore but i can tell you with 80 bucks i barley made a fucking dent ,1,leagueoflegends
stabfase,i remember when people were having severe connection problems on na a year back some people had rune pages and skins lost but then got it replaced earlier that day everyone was effected the same because nobody could actually play due to instability throughout that whole problem then 1000rp was given to my friend and a few others for something that did not effect them and people became upset calling it a lottery someone stated that if they would have given everyone free 1000 rp it would cost them money and everyone pretty much agreed i have always wondered they generate the rp so how does that cost them anything a click of a button and poof you have rp no actual physical effort outside of a button press or maybe a script command to add to this when a riot employee gives out rp to a visitor pro or gives themselves an absurd amount of rp do they have to write that down as a loss of profit ,1,leagueoflegends
stabfase,the sole reason i do not play aram just not into facing pre mades with nidalee morg cc heavy group because they purchased all the best aram champs on their smurf account then dodge until they get the perfect setup from one of their many accounts it needs to be from the entire champion pool ,1,leagueoflegends
