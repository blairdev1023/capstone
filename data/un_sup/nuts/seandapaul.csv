seandapaul,i literally said mabappe will sell for more when the time comes i do think mabappe is a better player striker but from milans pov its probably better to get belotti because hes cheaper and already proven in serie a we have no idea how mbappe would do in serie a so spending over 100 mill for him is risky im literally just saying belotti is less of a risk for milan in general though mabappe and belotti have both had 1 great season we dont know how good they will be in 2 3 years time so again im saying this argument is void because there is so much info we dont know and only have a few things to talk about atm ,1,soccer
seandapaul,why cant it never happen i believe with all the money made from the cl to just spend it on donnarumma he hasnt signed a contract yet as far as im aware hell all we really need right now is the agreement from him and 2 years of leeway if he is down to come let him run out his contract sign him for free and maybe let him stay at milan longer if buffon still wants to keep playing or we just spend big like we did on buffon and keep up that trend we did it once might as well do it again ,3,Juve
seandapaul,i dont like this at all,14,Juve
seandapaul,yeah having a three horse race would be nice like la liga has makes them perform better in europe as well definitely better than a one horse race in germany and most definitely better than a no horse race in epl where one team just wins out of nowhere for no reason other than that one team made it through all the chaos ,1,soccer
seandapaul,true thought it was top 4 and yes ligue 1 definitely deserves the praise it is getting atm though serie a is closer to epl than ligue 1 is to serie a hell ligue 1 is closer in quality to epl than it is to serie a imo ,0,soccer
seandapaul,sure serie a is still well above ligue 1 in general though thats the main point here and up until this year its been a pretty hard league to score in coming from multiple players who have played in multiple leagues ,6,soccer
seandapaul,well yeah this season serie a is still a better league i would say i am pretty sure every goal in ligue one is counted as a 1 5 value compared to the top 4 leagues where they are valued at a 2 and from milans pov belotti is already proven in the league they play in so it makes sense to spend a ton of money on belotti again we dont actually know how much they cost because they havent been sold obviously mabappe will sell for more but at the moment there is nothing to argue here ,5,soccer
seandapaul,nah i get what you are saying but there are other ways to get under a players skin prime example https www youtube com watch v dofn8dwc1 g,1,soccer
seandapaul,only argument i can think of is belotti has scored a bunch of goals in serie a compared to france ligue 1 is seen as a lesser league technically and belloti has scored almost 30 goals at a young age in a top 4 league where its arguably the hardest league to score in also we dont know how much mbappe actually costs he hasnt been sold yet for all we know he can be sold for 130 mill same with belotti belotti can be sold for 60 mill or anywhere from 50 100 we dont exactly know until it happens ,13,soccer
seandapaul,pretty interesting situation idk how the law would consider this because you did technically consent to general sex the question is does anal fit into the criteria of just the general definition of consenting to sex as a moral standpoint yes i would say this is rape however i dont know how a judge would see this if anyone knows the answer to this please tell me im curious about this one ,1,sex
seandapaul,bet365 has them at 190 and madrid at 160,1,Juve
seandapaul,what you are saying is pretty much two wrongs dont make a right but why is it that people wait until the 2nd wrong to happen before they say anything fuck that its gratifying as hell to throw it in their faces its also pretty ironic they made op life a living hell under their religious beliefs and op is going to use the eye for an eye approach its pretty genius if you ask me ,2,confession
seandapaul,yes exactly and i dont believe in the whole good luck bad luck thing its just a way to justify betting against juve its also just a pretty crazy story to tell in general cause those comebacks were pretty once in a lifetime kind of instances and i just happened to bet on them but other than that im fully aware of this ,3,Juve
seandapaul,yeah very understandable i go to the casino consistently and i have no complaints in that department casino games are a bit more in your own control opposed to sports betting but my sports betting definitely needs to get better cause it would be nice to make money on something i have quite a bit of knowledge on but cant seem to make it profitable for the record i predicted every knockout game right except juves but didnt end up betting on either game i really wish i had the monaco city game and leciester sevilla game would have been a nice little treat for me ,2,Juve
seandapaul,well see every team i bet on always lose i am do for a win but these specific games are pretty hilarious given that they both should have won but blew huge leads superstition isnt something i buy into but this shit is kinda crazy lol i also remember playing pro line in 2006 when i was in elementary school had my dad buy the ticket and bet on 6 games one being inter it was the year they went on a 17 game winning streak and only had 1 loss that year i got 5 games right and lost the inter game because they fucking lost that one game i just notice i get pretty much 85 of sports bets wrong in this scenario if i bet on madrid and juve win i wouldnt care about losing the money at all however if madrid wins i win some money i wouldnt feel good about it but money is money just wondering if other fans ever think about this and if they do do they go through with it ,2,Juve
seandapaul,if we end up winning 3 1 i think the first 2 goals will come before the first 30 min would probably be good to bet on that too ,7,Juve
seandapaul,donnarumma verratti is great but there is a way bigger need for the next buffon rather than the next pirlo ,1,Juve
seandapaul,i could be wrong but i think he means he does tip but dosent tip over the usual standard because he knows the waitress is just being overly nice to him because it is her job ,52,niceguys
seandapaul,i like mbappe more but belotti is the real deal you are right i just like mabappe cause his runs are menacing af and its so cool to watch him just hustle his way to a shot or a pass ,6,Juve
seandapaul,still wouldnt doubt it tbh lol,2,Juve
seandapaul,i wouldnt doubt that one ,4,Juve
seandapaul,that would probably mean having mandzukic starting on the bench and us going for a 4 3 1 2 formation it wouldnt be bad but mandzukic gives us that extra bit of defensive cover and that is a flair we have been riding for a while now james is too big of a name to be a rotation type pf player as is mandzukic at this point it is up to the coach and staff to decide which system will work best imo it is a good idea to switch up our tactics after this season however if it isnt broken dont fix it right ,3,Juve
seandapaul,you look like someone who would lose every single argument no matter which side you were on ,1,RoastMe
seandapaul,your opinion is wrong ,0,soccer
seandapaul,playing big games with things like that to play for can be costly i remember the day we lost to inter who broke our 49 game unbeaten streak at the time it was a huge game and we blew it there was a lot of talk about getting to 58 to tie milans streak and we bottled it when we faced inter not a big deal cause we won the league anyway but i feel with clear heads of only a win on their minds in cardiff is way better than trying to do even better because sometimes that can hinder your gameplay ,9,soccer
seandapaul,neither team has made it to the final yet weve seen time and time again that comebacks are not impossible especially with free scoring teams like monaco and a top 5 team like atletico i hate all this talk about winning something that has not been won people need to reserve the hype until either team accomplishes something because nothing has been accomplished yet juve still havent won the league and are just 7 points ahead if we were to not win the next 3 games we could easily throw it away we havent won the copa italia lazio can score a lot of goals and are really coming into their own this season madrid are only 3 points above barca too and thats just assuming they win their game in hand no way they are even close to that title so like i said reserve the hype for when something comes to fruition ,3,Juve
seandapaul,i wholeheartedly believe that if you were to put dortmund monaco psg roma napoli sevilla and atletico in the epl next season one of them would win it probably psg or atletico while all these teams would be in the top 10 most likely the only teams in the epl right now that would have a shot against these teams would be chelsea and maybe city and not to mention if you were to put barca madrid bayern into this league there is no chance any epl team would even come close to them ,6,soccer
seandapaul,his prime was in 2006 and dare i say hes just as good now he makes huge saves in big games all the fucking time the games against lyon this season barca monaco he just saves juve all the time the only thing you can argue about buffon is if he was better when he was younger and maybe so but even then hes still better than neuer and cassilas within the passed 3 years cassilas won a lot because he was part of some of the best teams of all time not to take away anything from his ability but he had a lot of help with winning what he has won individually buffon has put in more game changing saves without buffon juve loses a notch on their belts with cassilas gone they won the cl and are doing well ever since again not to take away anything from him he is a genius and is one of the greatest of all time but buffon is more significant to his team than cassilas was as for neuer he makes a ton of impossible saves but i can make the same arguments for buffon neuer did kind of revolutionize the way the position is played but it gets him into a lot of trouble now and again buffon rarely ever makes mistakes he makes mistakes maybe once or twice a season if buffon was on madrid and spain he would have won everything too as for neuer they have very similar acrobatic type saves but buffon makes less mistakes to my knowledge all 3 are very close together but its the finer details that make buffon the actual goat imo ,1,soccer
seandapaul,i still think this would make a great concept for a tv show ,1,Juve
seandapaul,i live in toronto and i have never seen any place play live juve league games however i did go to a wing place last night and they were replaying the juve torino game it was actually super cool because soccer dosent usually get played in bars unless its tfc or the champions league and even then backetball football and hockey take precedence ,1,Juve

seandapaul,to be fair sneijder won a treble and made the world cup final the year he didnt win he definitely should have he was integral in both achievements ,1,soccer
seandapaul,the problem with this tie is that monaco will probably sit back making it incredibly hard for us to break them down dosent matter how bad a team defence may be they are in the cl semi finals so they will be ready to defend no doubt about that we struggle to create chances and score when team just sit back like in serie a we beat barca 3 0 then beat pescara 2 0 pescara is a way worse team but the only reason we didnt demolish them is because their game plan was to sit back kind of what i see monaco doing in this tie this season juve have sacrificed possession to let our opponents open themselves up i do not think monaco will do this monaco have a crazy good offence too so their counter attacks will definitely hurt us i see them scoring at least 2 or 3 goals against us in 2 games we need to approach this game knowing that we have to take our chances when they come i am happy we did not get ateltico that was the only team i did not want to play against my number one pick was real because it seems like juve play better football when they face good teams but when we face less established teams we struggle if we make the final it will be because we struggled to get there this monaco side is dangerous and we cannot take this draw as a win this is the semi final anything can happen ,2,Juve
seandapaul,i automatically lose respect for anyone who says they like friends over seinfeld ,7,seinfeld
seandapaul,if cavani was able to convert like 60 of his chances hed be a god he has the best positioning for a striker in the game today but he tends to miss most of his shots from what ive seen but its incredible how many times i see him being able to get behind the defence and go one on one with the keeper pretty sure this season in the cl in one game i forgot who it was against he got the ball while running passed the defence and went 1v1 with the keeper a total of like 6 times missed pretty much all of them but still it was hella impressive ,1,Juve
seandapaul,season 1 is incredible i remember amc had a marathon of it after the show aired i literally planned a whole day to watch this show on tv and i thought it would become the best show of all time season 2 ep 1 starts it becomes noticeably shittier like soooooo bad season 3 becomes even worse i dont even remember what happens in season 4 cause nothing spectacular happens anyway then i finally quit at season 5 ep 3 literally wasted so much time on this show for nothing fear the walking dead is way better i suggest watch that first then watch season 1 of the walking dead and stop there ,0,television
seandapaul,it is a very character driven show and the story itself does intrigue a lot of people as well as push away a lot of viewers sure the story is vast and full of crazy shit some of which will not be explained by the end of the series but the show itself is more than getting an explanation imho i really enjoyed the show and i hated the ending was such a cop out ending but i dont regret watching it at all in fact it remains one of my favorite shows of all time only because the character development is phenomenal its also a crazy journey and sort of a fantasy of mine you just get really into the story and i really got into that aspect season 1 5 are amazing wouldnt have hanged anything about them but season 6 was awful but if you get through 5 seasons you need to sit through the 6th imo it dosent take away from the good experience of watching the show i definitely recommend it if you are into fantasy ,2,television
seandapaul,what i cant stand is the fact some people just assume were going to beat them this is the wrong mentality as well the fact some people on here think that we are just going to easily beat barcelona is ridiculous they have messi ffs hes literally the greatest player of all time plus they have suarez the best cf in the game atm and neymar the fucking heir to messi barca was literally the worst draw possible they are literally the best team in the entire world literally have been the best team of all time for a good 10 years now however i do believe we can win and not just by a miracle allegri was able to beat barca with a shitty milan side i remember that game barca had like 3 shots the entire game and i think only one on target we have to play an incredibly tight defensive style against barca not allow them to make a lot of passes we cant play counter attacking football because the only way of beating barca is to dominate them we need to go in with our dicks hanging out if we sit back and let them attack us we will concede and concede a lot the only way to beat them is to cut off their supply to msn we need marchisio we need mandzukic we need bbc to fuck them up i dont believe in being so confident that we already write barca off but we need the right mentality if were too confident we lose if were too scared we lose as well we need to fight until the fucking end because barca definitely will ,1,Juve

seandapaul,maybe but we cant let buffon sit on the bench for most of the season we just cant donnarumma can learn from buffon in the italy squad im sure buffon would come to training after retirement and help him out we literally need to hire buffon as a keeper coach after he retires part time with full benefits and same salary he deserves it ,1,Juve
seandapaul,donnarumma for sure we cant go from buffon to somebody else ever since buffon turned what 32 we have all been hoping to find a suitable replacement thing is buffon didnt like the idea of retirement so we got lucky with that now he is thinking about it i think the euro will be his last few games what i think we should do is buy donnarumma and let him stay at milan until buffon retires the plan should be keeping donnarumma until he retires as well verratti is a great player but its hard to find amazing keepers its not easy to find great mids but its much easier imo ,3,Juve

seandapaul,seasons 1 3 are definitely the worst seasons imo still good seasons for its time but when the show progresses you can see how much better it gets season 4 is amazing and has some classic episodes however i really think it starts to find its groove that they ride until the end in season 5 and on from season 4 9 every single episode cannot be said one is better than the other because every episode is literally perfect every episode has something iconic that happens something you can reference and something that will stand the test of time this is why i think this show is the greatest of all time ,2,television

seandapaul,barca and atletico we have no shot against especially in a 2 legged tie dosent matter what people think but most people would agree atletico are 3rd or at least 4th best in europe we can beat bayern and madrid we always best madrid and imo it would be easier facing bayern over ateltico i dont think we will be able to beat bayern but i still think it would be slightly easier than atletico but tbh we will probably be unable to beat any of these teams so id rather get first so we can at least not feel the humiliation of getting 2nd in one of the easiest groups weve had in the last couple of years ,-2,Juve
seandapaul,i will get down voted because this sub hates negative comments but i do not see us winning this game in any scenario if we are lucky we will tie the game 1 1 or 0 0 we should have beaten them and lyon and because we didnt were getting 2nd in this group when any other big team would have easily topped this group ,2,Juve
seandapaul,i never really got scared by horror movies even at a young age my mom loves horror movies and she got me into them years ago so when i was about 10 years old she was watching a movie called the others at this point in my life i loved scary movies and thought i was tough as fuck for never actually being afraid by them turns out i was wrong and the others was the movie that scared the living shit out of me i remember i was unable to sleep normally for a really long time months of not being able to sleep without being afraid thankfully this has been the only movie that affected me in this way but my god i was not ready to be affected the way i was by a horror movie i have never watched this movie again and i never will i dont even fully remember exactly what happened but i remember the characters and the tone of the movie i definitely wont be afraid of it now but i will still never watch it again just because this is the one and only movie that destroyed me when i thought it was impossible for me to feel afraid ,4,horror
seandapaul,wtf is a cast off just let me remind you of pirlo kehdira pogba barzagli and whoever else we made great after being banished from their respective teams miki is awesome scored 23 goals and assisted over 15 last season with dortmund thats literally a crazy statistic how on earth would that make you vomit if he became a juve player ,2,Juve
seandapaul,he still scores screamers he is def a poacher now but his positioning and heading is the best the game has ever seen imo ronaldo and messi are the most self aware players of their own ability ronaldo realized he was unable to use much skill as he got older so he adapted his gameplay to become a poacher this way he would score more goals and still be a huge star messi has done the same thing becoming more of a playmaker for suarez and neymar but messi is all skill its the way his body and his mind works different from ronaldo but not more important or less important both player contribute so much to their teams both players are the best because they adapted to their situations a lot of other players would just burn out and let it get to them ,2,soccer

seandapaul,i am a huge hater of this show but i do admit season 1 was absolutely spectacular zombie apocalypses are a cool concept and i just love stories about a group of people having to survive the elements i didnt watch it as it was airing but i think the year when season 2 was about to be released amc announced that they would air the entire first season as a marathon i thought to myself that can be cool because i had planned to watch it but just never had the chance might as well wait until amc airs it as a marathon now i watched all the eps in one day took like 7 hours to finish but god was i stoked about this show i thought everything about it was too fucking perfect a 10 10 and you ask when it jumps the shark my answer would be season 2 episode 1 its actually impressive how fast they fucked it up this show will be remembered as another heroes i think its just this show is going on for way too long now at least now we have ash vs evil dead i mean its not an amazing show but it dosent take itself seriously like twd tries to and is often pretty funny i would recommend this show over twd any day ,-3,television
seandapaul,it took me like a year and a half to get through this entire show i couldnt get through the first episode because it was so fucking boring it took me like 6 months to watch the first 4 eps once i got to ep 4 i said fuck this after another 3 4 months i went back to it and watched the entire 1st season by the end of the first season i thought it was pretty good some cool things happened and i was left pretty satisfied then i got to season 2 and the same thing happened after the 1st ep i just couldnt do it i thought it was so boring hated the style of the show and i am not really into cop shwos anyway it just isnt for me then a couple months later i went back to it and finished season 2 everyone says season 2 is the worst of the series but i actually enjoyed it while binging it in a day or 2 after taking another break right after season 2 i started 3 and from there i just binged it all in like 2 weeks the last 2 seasons are definitely the best seasons imo but i really have a soft spot for season 2 because it gets so much hate pretty much what i am trying to say is that it takes time to like this show i guess if you just get through the first 2 seasons you are basically in the clear but after i finished season 2 i was hooked already took me a lot of time to complete that but i did ,1,television

seandapaul,i agree with you russel got cheated out of 2 wins he dominated both games one of which was comprised of players who have already played the game before the fact that the juries and people on the subreddit couldnt respect such a dominant game is ridiculous imo i hate it when player act like dicks and all and russel definitely did that but he also played the game usually if you are a dick on survivor you are probably going to be voted out if not then you are being a dick behind everyones back so you are just seen as sneaky but with russel he was himself the entire game to everyone with a target on his back since day fucking one and still not only made the finals but swept everyone in both seasons the reason he didnt win was because he took the people who trusted him and liked him to the end he took the people who would have voted for him to the end maybe that is a mistake but the people he took to the end imo were all worthless individuals who barely played the game except for parv because she was more of a partner however russel did save her in hvv so russel gets the upper hand on this relationship imo how the fuck do you dominate a game when you go into a merge with 4 people versus 7 or 6 i cant remember how the fuck did he do that he literally had to manipulate so many people to get what he wanted its a part of survivor you have to make these big moves or else what is going to happen if you dont make a big move big move is gonna be made on you when there is a target on your back so many people have criticized me about this on this subreddit and have told me i dont understand survivor yeah sorry for having an opinion but ive been watching this since season 5 ive watched every season except for maybe a few seasons and i have never seen anyone dominate survivor as well as russel did he deserved to win at least 1 3 i hope to god he comes back he should be in s34 because he changed the fucking game spoiler ,0,survivor

seandapaul,well because he was at the bottom of that tribe anyway so even if there is backlash he wouldnt care that much also most millenials i would assume would not care and knew the power couple dynamic was dangerous everyone knew he went for figgy once before so its not like it will be a huge surprise and from a numbers pov in his current tribe if they went to 3 he would be with either of the couples and be the next one out in both scenarios from that pov he is still in the exact same position he was in now however its much easier to convince ken to vote out his partner cant remember her name than it is to convince taylor to vote out figgy i think you are putting way too much emphasis on the millenials love for figgy no nobody in survivor is loved that much also its been like 10 days on the island nobody were actually set in alliances just yet michaela was voting with the majority but is she really part of that alliance hell no shes gonna flip as soon as she can to get herself further in the game another point is also there was no better time to do it than now the millenials have like 3 extra members over gen x 3 or 2 cant remember so they can afford to lose 1 i feel like you are making this out to be adams biggest move in the game when in reality its not a big move at all its just a decision he made 7 days ago that he finally accomplished i do not think most people will care about this at all unless you are taylor or michelle maybe justin too right in the millenals it would be 3 vs 5 and adam is in the 5 he just flipped it around if anything now the ony thing that can go wrong is if i said taylor campaigns to vote off adam right after they come together again if adam just plays it cool and tells the other 4 people that he had to make the move and make them understand why it wont be a huge burden to him i predict adam to get through this easily tbh ,1,survivor
seandapaul,i am assuming only 4 will be really upset im guestamating 4 because i dont really want to go and look up all the names to prove this point could be anywhere from 3 5 people i dont think this move will come to bite him back plus he broke up the power couple and we dont even know if most of the millenials will be that mad about cant really see zeke or michaela giving a fuck about figgy being voted out same with hannah are they really going to hold that grudge until they make it to the merge i cant see this move having any consequences tbh other than taylor and michelle getting pissed it was a move that put in in the good graces of the entire gen x tribe and also alienated taylor and michelle two players that should probably be voted out from adams pov he made a pretty good move imo i cant see anything bad happening after this as long as he is able to get out taylor before any more twists in tribe swapping then literally nothing will happen only thing that could happen is taylor holds this until the merge if he gets there then campaigns for adams boot right after that is the most likely thing to happen but since taylor is an idiot i dont think he will even be successful in achieving that also he was at the bottom of the millenials so this move is literally a reaction to that worse case scenario he is in the exact same position he was in before with the millenials adam made a good move good on him ,2,survivor
seandapaul,happy loris is there too imo top 3 keepers in the world at bufon neur and lloris de gea and courtois are vastly overrated imo ,3,Juve
seandapaul,i mean im not even mad about it because locatelli scored a beauty no keeper could have saved that but juve still have no idea how to score,2,Juve
seandapaul,didnt you guys win the champions league last season because of an obvious offside goal from ramos should have been 1 0 atletico but of course on top of getting the easiest teams all the way to the final and underperforming in all of them ramos would get an offside goal in the final to rob the best team last season the team that deserved the win im not hating on madrid but this is ridiculous that you are bashing barca when madrid were literally handed the champions league last season ,-6,realmadrid
seandapaul,gigi has done it all before ,2,Juve
seandapaul,i dont get the hype around de gea if you put the current top 5 keepers against the ones in the 80s and 90s i think only gigi and neur would be able to contend against them and i think gigi would still destroy all of them in short gigi is the greatest of all time and de gea is overrated ,3,Juve

seandapaul,i can score but i have to really work at it its much harder to break down a defence it seems like you cant cut into the box from the wing anymore the defender will just steal it easily off you that goes with trying to beat a defender too from anywhere on the pitch i used to use skills to get through teams sometimes but i have not been able to do it even once in 17 defending is much easier though i can close down opposition no problem other than conceding pks and conceding because i fucked up ,1,FIFA
seandapaul,i agree with these statements however let me give my 2 cents i do like brooke and commend her for a well played game but she is still the last person other than flick that i would like to see win this game the reason for this is due to the fact that brooke has not suffered at all during her time in samoa in my view the great winner has to suffer to win earl is a good example for this he was on the losing tribe for the entire pre merge yet he excelled post merge he had to suffer to deserve the win and this is what made him a great winner imo brookes story line is not very entertaining imho she has had it pretty easy by being on the winning team and getting all the rewards ect in any other season she would have a target on her back yet for some reason she seems safe i blame this on the fact that these are ammeter players who do not seem like they know exactly what to do at times another good example for a great winner would be denise her and malcolm had an incredibly hard time pre merge but still ended up winning brooke hasnt had to go through anything to show that she is deserving sure she has created something so dominant that it is impossible to break down but how hard is it to make friends all you have to do is be social shes good looking and charming so it didnt take much for her to form this 10 man alliance even though her alliance is not following suit anymore by voting out nick i respect that she used her strengths to her advantage but i dont consider this a great form a game play i respect brooke and agree she deserves praise for a game well played so far but i would be upset to see her win i want someone to suffer for this title and for the money i will probably be down voted but w e this is what i believe makes a great player brooke is not a great player she was in the right place at the right time with the right face and kudos to her for using that to her advantage ,11,survivor
seandapaul,that marchisio so hot right now ,2,Juve
seandapaul,this cant be good for allegri he got outclassed by pep last year and this year looks pretty bad tbh we got pjanic but where is the creativity honestly chiellini has said that they are not the real madrid or ac milan with ronaldinho insinuating that they dont approach games to score a lot of goals but just to win games imo this is a terribly flawed view incredibly flawed juve is a good team but there is no way in hell we are good enough to think scoring 1 goal will win us games tbh our defence isnt as good as everyone thinks it is especially with allegri our biggest problem is creativity and we got higuain and pjanic how does this not work this is pretty scary to think is allegri the right man to be coaching juve you have the tools to get the job done but its not getting done we need to take risks and score goals we need to beat teams by 3 or 4 goals madrid barca and bayern do this on a weekly basis and if people say we are easily top 4 in europe then why cant we do it we need to learn how to score goals this is what the sport is plain and simple the team with the most goals at the end wins the game why not try and score more than 1 we concede goals its not like our defence is impossible to get through our defence is hardly the best in europe we concede so many set pieces and headers its shameful but it wouldnt matter as much if we just used our attacking force we need to use our attack because our defence can only do so much dybala and higuain need to score goals or else this will be another one of those seasons where we get 2nd in our cl group and win serie a even though its not a big deal anymore we need to score goals i hate this mindset that 1 or 2 is enough we have to defend first and foremost thats bs fuck that score goals that is what the game is about if not enjoy losing and tying in big games fuck defending its literally boring just score goals we have the players to do it so why is it not happening i will probably get downvoted but seriously is anyone else concerned over the lack of goals this team has been producing over the years higuain cost us 90 mill if he dosent help us win in europe then what was the point of that why hasnt dybala been scoring what is wrong with this team seriously wtf is going on we need to fix this problem fast allegri has the players to turn this around but if he cant then this season is gonna be hard to get through maybe we should be switching up the formation 3 5 2 is such an uncreative formation i hate this formation but maybe it would work with this team 4 2 3 1 buffon alves chiellini bonnucci sandro pjanic khedira cuadrado dybala pjaca higuain this can be very interesting we would force way more attacking plays with pjanic and khedira holding up the midfield pjanic can work his creative magic from the back drifting upwards while khedira stays back as a dm i know khedira has really liked to come up this season but for the sake of the team he should just stay back and play to his strengths then we have that trident of attacking players with pjaca cuadrado and dybala i am a firm believer dybala can operate as the number 10 behind higuain dybala is really good at creating attacking plays and with cuadrado pjaca and pjanic with him this can be a deadly combination to feed higuain the opposition would become so flustered with all these attackers and these players are good enough to score a lot in one game we need an attacking mindset going into any game we saw last year even going 2 0 up against bayern wasnt enough but allegri thought it was so he took off morata that was what costed us the game defence is important defence is what wins you championships but goals is what wins you games and you cant win the games to get to the championship if you dont score goals we need to start scoring goals plain and simple i understand that most teams just defend against us but barca bayern and madrid dont seem to be having any problems scoring goals we need to prove we are a top 4 team and the only way to do this is to score enough goals to win you games 0 0 draws cant be tolerated scoring 1 goal a game is a terrible mindset to have even though you think it will be enough for a win you never know what is going to happen inter equalized instantly after we scored and then scored again we need to go into games wanting to score goals a lack of goals means a lack of wins we need to start scoring goals asap,8,Juve
seandapaul,fellaini has been your best player so far this season,0,soccer
seandapaul,one of the worst things i have ever seen in football happened in this game complete miscommunication from de gea and smalling in the box ends up half assing a clearance because of this the ball drops perfectly for a watford player infront of goal has a huge open net and misses it literally the saddest moment in football for me everything just went wrong lol ,2,Juve

seandapaul,at this point its all up to juve napoli roma and fiorentina do not look like they even want to win any of their european games you cant force a team to perform well if they dont want to do it then fine juve got serie a to come in 2nd 2 years ago from points accumulated in that one year juve did that by themselves as long as the other italian team racks up lets say 5 points together then juve can make up for it truth is though juve really need to step it up juve are not doing their part either imho we could have easily made the semis or finals last year if only we won the group it was easy all we needed was to tie sevilla 0 0 and we would have won the group going on through facing fairly easy teams a lot of you say there is hope but when have we seen this hope its not enough for 1 italian team to make the final once in 6 years and then lose it granted barca was probably the greatest team of all time at that point in time but we could have still won all in all everyone needs to step it up in a significant way i dont blame individual teams i blame everyone epl are doing their utmost to give us their 4th spot away but serie a keeps pushing it away this year if we dont claim it then there is really no hope especially with tottenham leicester and arsenal representing england i hope to eat my words at the end of this season nothing would make me happier but i have not seen anything from serie a in the last 6 years for me to think we can beat the best i believe juve should take it upon themselves to represent italy single handedly which they have after this summer its make it for break it this season if we cant do well this year we have literally done all we can to become european champions if it dosnt happen this year then there is nothing more to do then just hope we get lucky like chelsea did ,2,Juve
seandapaul,milan vs barca 2 0 when allegri was there that game was awesome barca had all the possession but literally could not break down the defence i think they had like 3 shots on target if that no clear cut chances literally couldnt get it passed the defence it was magical to watch then milan score 2 goals and i was so hyped thought they would literally win the cl given that ibra had just left and every time he left a team they would win the cl milan got thrashed 4 0 in the return leg so that ruined everything pretty much lol i also really enjoyed the chelsea bayern final that was something else levrkusen vs roma was pretty special when they tied 4 4 dortmund vs real was crazy with lewys 4 goals oh and lets not forget cletic vs barca when barca had something like 89 possession give or take and ended 2 1 to celtic man city vs qpr was pretty awesome seeing balo actually do something in his career was pretty nice for that one moment also the germany vs italy game in 2012 and obviously the italy game vs germany in 06 dortmund vs liverpool last season was amazing to watch too i was watching that one with my friend who is a dortmund fan he just started to get into the game and became a fan of dortmund we were watching the game together and when dortmund went 3 1 up i told him in the 2nd half that liverpool is going to make a comeback he told me i was crazy but i just knew seeing how liverpool were taking it to them after scoring their first goal they went down 2 0 scored a goal before half then conceded again after the break but i still believed liverpool would pull it off and they did usa vs belgium was frustrating but i enjoyed it i think it was in 2010 or 2014 dont exactly remember but i do remember howard making like 100 saves against the most frustrating belgium side i have ever seen usa deserved the win after that game i have no respect for belgium a star team who is ranked 2nd and they cant do anything spectacular there are definitely others but i cant think of them now those games i stated are definitely in my top 20 of all time my favorite game of all time though and this is a juve game was when juve beat ac milan 3 2 in like 2008 where camoranesi got all 3 assists to this day he is still my favorite all time player and one of the most underrated players of all time oh and the win over inter in 2007 when we beat them 2 1 coming from serie b ,6,Juve
seandapaul,he looks like a good replacement for pogba at times but most of the time he is underwhelming he needs to step up and then and only then will he reach that potential ,1,Juve
seandapaul,they would probably still win dont forget we went undefeated with a much worse team than this one and we were facing good milan and napoli sides now there is literally no competition so we can definitely have our b side just power through the season with our a team in the important league games and champions league ,1,Juve
seandapaul,hopefully he definitely showed signs of this against lazio but based on pre season he really needs to work on finishing if he can score goals consistently he could be a huge star ,5,Juve
seandapaul,i really want to see pjaca play he may be our next huge star ,1,Juve
seandapaul,well that just ruined my day,10,Juve
seandapaul,after seeing him play against lazio he reminded me of cr7 tbh idk if he can excel at the number 10 position but i honestly think he can definitely play as a striker he seems able to beat defenders 1v1 playing him in a 4 3 3 as a winger is something id like to see as well or even 4 5 1 i just want to see what hes made of honestly and i want to see him get a fair chance ,7,Juve
seandapaul,peryera is the argentinian messi ,2,Juve

seandapaul,i really wanted dortmund tottenham monaco this is good too though i dont get that people dont see this as one of the harder groups group a really only has psg to be honest its obvious arsenal will get 2nd but they will absolutely make it hard on themselves group b looks pretty even benfica will most likely top the group with with kiev in 2nd napoli should be aiming for 3rd but lets be real they probably wont even get that group c is definitely the group of death but by the standards of passed groups of death its not that bad it perfectly represents every single group this season every group looks pretty balanced where upsets seem a lot more likely now group d however only have 2 real teams that will go through its just a matter of who gets top spot group e is most defiantly the most balanced group its hard to predict who will make it through but i would say leverkusen and tottenham group f is obviously dortmund and madrid the other two teams dont seem like they have a shot group g seems like the most unpredictable group this year i am confident that porto will top it but the other three are all good enough to reach 2nd leicester will probably make it through but tbh english teams dont do well to beigin with in europe and leicester isnt really a top team so we will see what happens will be interesting no doubt and then there is group h there is a lot to say about this but all i will say is that juve better top it we really need to top it because there is not more we could do with our team other than sign ronaldo and messi juve need to push for top spot but we need to show europe that we can blow out teams i really would like to see some 3 4 5 0 games i want them to score goals this group is tough though sevilla is the 4 time in a row europa champs ad lyon have lacazette one of the best strikers in the world imo all in all i think the biggest losers in this are atletico and dortmund they could have made a push for 1st place but madrid and bayern will have them on their toes the entire time juve need to emulate the top 3 teams and get at least 5 wins in this group i do not want to see us lose any game i see us tying against sevilla away but other than that we need to win every other game to prove not only to the doubters but also to ourselves that we belong in europes elite ,1,Juve
seandapaul,i really wanted dortmund tottenham monaco but i guess this is alright not a entirely strong group but not weak by any means ,2,Juve
seandapaul,i can see pjanic playing in the number 10 role if matuidi comes in marchisio khedira matuidi then pjanic in front with higuain and dybala up front that is a huge threat defensively as well with matuidi and khedira in midfield khedira likes to get in the box too as does marchisio its a very versatile team at the moment we have a lot of options for formations as well we can stick the the 3 5 2 then go to a 4 3 1 2 we can also work in the 4 3 3 and possibly even a 4 4 2 diamond or straight line in midfield honestly we have a lot we can do its just a matter of us getting matuidi fuck isco anyway he dosent want to leave he should but he wont plus he hasnt done anything worthwhile in his entire career hes worth like 20 mill del bosque didnt even call him up to the national team there is a reason for that ,2,Juve
seandapaul,yup it would be really nice this season has been obvious that were making a legit run for the cl the midfield atm is our weakest link im not saying marchisio khedira pjanic are weak cause in fact this is a star stubbed midfield but compared to our attack and defence matuidi would just push our midfield to that level so i would say blaise would balance out our team quite well also it adds so much depth to our team we would literally have a 2 stars in every position i have never seen this in my life we can become top 2 this season ,10,Juve

seandapaul,sandra complains bout everything constantly is completely dreadful in every single challenge and only survived the entire game because she was seen as the easiest possible win at the end because everyone thought she sucked too how is me saying shes a terrible player wonky logic cause everything stated is true granted i would not have played like russel but brining sandra to the end is something i would have done as well how about the season where tony won tony played a pretty similar game to russels and won that season that jury had no problem handing him a milllion dollars he was a huge dick to people but he was aggressive nd was able to manipulate woo into taking him russel literally dragged himself and 3 other people to the final 5 with him before he had to vote off one of his own that was impressive and for people who watch survivor do not give him credit for something like that that is crazy as fuck he literally did the impossible he did what he had to do to keep himself and his alliance strong they were totally going against the odds but they all survived because of russel ,0,survivor
seandapaul,yeah i feel yeah dude i am full of unpopular opinions on this sub another one is i think aubry was such a lame player glad she didnt win not saying i think michelle should have won but aubry wasnt as good as people make her out to be on this sub tai should have won it imo i just think the best player who is in control of the game and makes big moves deserves the win i understand that survivor has many aspects in deciding a winner that is why its such an incredibly hard game i respect that concept but like fuuuuuuck its just bs sandra hvv win is like scoring an offside goal in soccer and winning the fucking world cup because of it ,-1,survivor
seandapaul,yeah i agree loan him out for like 2 more years and if he still cant break into the team just sell him to utd for 110 mill ,3,Juve
seandapaul,true i didnt know about that thats a shame ,1,Juve
seandapaul,i think russel is a great player imo he deserved the win in both of his seasons i am sure i would have voted for him if i was on the jury sandra on the other hand is one of the worst players i have ever seen and tbh most people i talk about this with completely agree with this statement i actually cant believe 90 of the people on here think sandra is a great player she sucks her role was to bring to the end because she would be easy to beat but because its russel people get butt hurt so they hand it to sandra because she didnt do anything that pissed anyone off but she only did that because she literally didnt do anything this is most definitely an unpopular opinion so i am ready for the down votes ,1,survivor
seandapaul,maybe so but you never know leicester won the epl you literally never know in football ,1,Juve
seandapaul,tbh i really like sassuolo and i think zaza should go back if he ends up leaving in all honesty it looks like juve and sassuolo will be the only stand out teams in serie a so for that reason i am glad berardi is still there juve dont have room for him tbh we dont use wingers i am starting to feel like berardi will not have a chance to break into this team at all i am not too saddened by this fact though because i believe sassuolo can become a serie a contender in a couple of years napoli wasted their chance roma is currently fucking it up and juve really need to solidify their inclusion in the top 4 in europe sassuolo is right behind roma imo and are making huge strides in actually using their opportunities i think they will be a huge team in europa this season hopefully they can make at least the quarter finals that would be a significant step towards their goal berardi needs to stay to see it all through he is very young and can become a legend but for now he is at a great team a team he seems to enjoy playing for juve should have kept half his contract because in a couple of years he will be so expensive i honestly think juve fucked up with his contract so i dont see him as a possible player for us but it is not a big deal because sassuolo need him a lot more than we do and i am happy he is there instead of a team like inter roma or napoli ,8,Juve
seandapaul,my question is how the fuck couldnt they catch a tiny dog the dog literally bamboozled them for the entire video any competent person could have grabbed that dog within 2 seconds of it being free god damn ,1,pussypassdenied
seandapaul,thats probably why they call it a sitcom ,2,television
seandapaul,i still think we should keep peryera and start lemina pjanic and marchisio behind him lemina can become our next big star in midfield and peryera has shown us he deserves to be given a chance at being our starting attacking mid ,4,Juve
seandapaul,i think we definitely need a star midfielder to replace paul the only players that i would be fine with replacing paul would be either veratti or kroos obviously this wont happen so i think we should be talking about isco again we already have pjanic to play in pauls role so that still leaves us needing a cam marchisio pjanic khedira and then isco in front of them with dybala and higuain up top pretty good line up i still think we should go for calhanoglu from leverkusen he would play behind he strikers he has a great free kick as well so we would have 2 of arguably the best free kick takers in europe ,0,Juve
seandapaul,yeah man i feel ya but it has gotten out of hand you cant deny that madrid has won 2 cl titles because of the ref the last one was so bad it literally makes my heart hurt this dosent just go for madrid though it goes for every single team including juve i just hate seeing bad calls dictate a game living in a world so hell bent on technology you would think the biggest sport in the entire world especially in europe would have such things to help referees with important calls ,2,Juve
seandapaul,yeah and madrid did it again against atletico this year man this is why i always think i should just stop watching this awful game if this shit happens constantly and its not like its getting any better its getting worse and worse every year refs make awful calls all the time at least once a week hell at least once a game you cant have that in a professional game its ridiculous we need video replays i dont care about any of the arguments against it it needs to be implemented right now nothing is fair in this sport and something needs to change quickly ,2,Juve
seandapaul,i think we can win the scudetto without a starting player in our lineup and possibly even make it out of the group stages of the cl with this line up,2,Juve
seandapaul,eh screw it everyone already thinks that anyway ,1,Juve
seandapaul,dont even care about the titles everyone knows who those belong to its not a big deal to have another trophy in the cabinet i want all that money so we can become even stronger ,4,Juve

seandapaul,honestly the only team i truly hate is inter i want them to fail at everything at all times as for any other team including ac milan fiorentina napoli etc i want to see them get stronger and do well in europe i want juve to win everything but if these teams are not against us in a match you better believe i am rooting for any of these teams against any other european team as for serie a i am a juve fan first and foremost but since my family is from rome i always want them to do well 2nd is good every year for them as long as juve are first ,3,Juve
seandapaul,my family is from rome but i am a juve fan so yeah i always want roma to do well ,2,Juve
seandapaul,the run up wasnt the best decision it takes him off balance if he did a normal run up he would have been in a better position to place the ball in the top corner the direction of the shot was off because of the run up most likely i do agree if he did score it it would not have been an issue but the fact he did miss it makes some of us think that if he chose not to do a run up such as that he could have been in a better position to finish the chance i dont see a positive in the run up it does not give any sort of advantage maybe the argument can be made that neur had no idea what to do so it could be used to distract or confuse the keeper but in that situation it looked as if it took zaza completely off balance to make a decent shot thats just my opinion though i still think pelles was the worst one today fucking asshole taunts neur then he passes the ball to the side of the net and it wasnt even a good pass such a shame we could have easily won that shootout ,7,Juve
seandapaul,definitely one of the best games they have ever played since 2006 the 2012 germany game might have been better but thats just an opinion this was incredible to witness we should have been 3 0 up within the first 10 min ,6,Juve
seandapaul,there is no room for him at the moment he wont be played as a striker because he a winger i am unsure of his versatility but at the moment it does not seem like he will be wearing the black and white shirt any time soon juve should sign him though because like you said he is the best young italian player there is i dont want to see berardi sitting on the bench after being a star player for another team berardi has already proven himself that he can start he would most likely regress if he came to juve europa league is good enough for some european experience juve should sign him permanently and send him back on loan to sass for 1 season more when he comes back mandzukic and zaza might not be as important as they are now we will probably need to re evaluate our offence with dybala and morata i believe he is staying i wish we still had coman because at the moment we need another winger to play on the other side of berardi right now we dont have any use for berardi but we can soon enough if we dont end up ever using him we can always sell him for a profit 25 mill now and if we must sell him best case scenario he lives up to even half his potential and we sell him for 30 40 mill to the epl ,1,Juve
seandapaul,i dont want to get a big head or anything but we beat belgium 2nd in the fifa world ranking although that means nothing belgium have amazing players and all in all are probably top 5 at the euro on paper italy played really well against them and this is a huge win all i will say is this that is the type of defence that wins championships ,8,Juve
seandapaul,i want juve to sign him permanently but keep him at sassuolo for one more season to help sassuolo in europe ,3,Juve
seandapaul,hakan alhano lu would probably cost us quite a bit but hes 22 versatile and is exactly what we need in an attacking mid position i would say close to 50 mill n golo kant has been great this season and knows what it means to win he works so hard for the team which is an attribute the juve board will look for and would probably fit in seamlessly with our system he can provide cover in midfield when defending he would probably cost around 30 35 mill his contract says he can go for 20 25 but i assume a bidding war will ensue and given that i think the only teams who will fight us for his signature will be chelsea man city and psg i think both epl teams dont really have a shot because i feel as though kante would not want to join them because we have a better chance of winning in europe psg is close though they have money and power aurier this is an incredibly intriguing rumour that i hope is true it is said we can get him at a cut price too because of the problems he causes in the dressing room his physicality is pretty similar to litchstieners he can run all game long and is the right back we really need he would probably cost us around 20 30 mill we will probably have to sell some players in order to fund these transfers i think we have made 80 mill just off the cl this season which is nice by selling asamoah pereyra and possibly one more player we can get the necessary funding to acquire these players or players of these calibre this is just a fantasy transfer list btw it may not be realistic but i like these players and i think we can possibly make these a reality if the transfer board are willing to invest heavily on the future of this team ,1,Juve
seandapaul,actually from what i saw torres should not have been given the pk cause it looked like the foul was committed outside the box and as for griezmanns goal at first glance it looked offside but i havent re watched it so i cant really say honestly the ref did kind of fuck bayern but the exact same thing happened to us and way worse than that this is so fucking stupid that calls like these are allowed to be taken seriously in fucking 2016 i dont want to lose because of bad ref decisions and i also dont want to win because of it either something has to change quickly because these botched ref calls are getting worse and worse every season its ruining the game this happens way too often i am happy that athletico are through because i do think they deserved it but fuck that we deserve to be there over bayern fucking refs are ruining this game ,1,Juve
seandapaul,i really like calhanoglu he has good stats hes young and hes versatile in midfield positions we have been doing well without an attacking mid but a player such as himself can give us an option while he also has the ability to play anywhere we need him if we need to change up the tactics,4,Juve
seandapaul,well its definitely not juve napoli roma vs europe now is it if they are not doing their part its up to juve to do it for them and for the passed 5 seasons id say juve has done alright given the state of serie a my point is we cant rely on any other italian team because for the passed couple of seasons they have been greatly disappointing in europe ,1,Juve
seandapaul,at this point who cares about serie a the coefficent points are pretty much meaningless as long as juve do well that is all that matters after this season we cannot rely on any other italian team to do well anymore honestly every other italian team sucks juve are the only good team and its a wonder how we are so good when we play in a league where the standard is so painfully low as juve fans we cannot give a fuck about any other team other than juve we can realistically keep winning the league for years to come and make the cl first seed pretty much every season so at this point it is up to juve to perform in the cl we cant look at what any other team in the world is doing we are juve it is us vs them ,2,Juve
seandapaul,i mean we got pirlo at the same age and we all know how that turned out ,1,Juve
seandapaul,honestly if everything works out then why not could get 2 good years out of him do exactly what we did with tevez and having ibra on the team pretty much guarantees us league titles as for the cl i honestly think we could win it with him sure he has that ego however he is a great team player and would add so much to our team in attack him starting with dybala or morata would devastate any defence in europe however hes like 34 and it would definitely get in the way of developing morata yes i believe he will be a juve player next season and dybala but then again if we have mandzukic for his experience might as well get ibra and offload mandzukic because its a huge upgrade in that department ibra would help us attain the cl i believe he is a great player and playing at juve would make him even better i am not against it but i also dont care if he does not come our attack is good atm so its not a huge deal i would like isco or mikitarian and gundogan though that would be nice ,7,Juve
seandapaul,i think their offence is better because they have established strikers who are able to get 30 a season even cavani having bad seasons still manages to get himself at least 25 a season but everything else is in juves favour imo,3,Juve

seandapaul,http lasthl com bayern munich vs juventus highlights full match ,2,Juve
seandapaul,i would say were a top tier team after this display it was up in the air after the final but after this game i think its official we have more or less the same technical ability that psg has but we have way more team cohesion and heart we beat city twice this season and if you guys dont think were better than athletico and dortmund then thats just due to the fact we got eliminated and emotions are playing with you on the other end we beat madrid we went toe to toe with arguably the greatest team to ever play this game and lost and as for bayern we all know how that played out the only difference was that they had momentum in et and we didnt so i would say we are the lowest top tier team but we are still there ,1,Juve
seandapaul,hell nah i want a rematch lol but yeah i really would like to see juve face barca and bayern next season although only in the semis and final because i do agree this was not your normal r16 tie this was way bigger hell this may have been the greatest ever champions league 2 legged tie i would have to say both teams played pretty evenly throughout the entire tie it was just bayern had so much momentum after the 90 min that there was little for juve to do after the subs and getting tired also the mental anguish from conceding with 3 min left is heartbreaking sure you can say you need to play like champions but we have seen every single top team succumb to defeat in this same manner its just football there are regrets but we cant let it negatively affect us what i take from this game is juve are a top tier team and we can win this if we stay on the right path ,2,Juve
seandapaul,nice words but tbh this loss hurts way too much in my view we are eliminated but we were not beaten i think we deserved it a whole lot more considering what happened in any case that is football and we have to accept it i think juve have officially established themselves as a top 4 team in europe though in less than a year we beat real madrid went toe to toe with barca and lost and were hard done by bayern munich juve have been a 2nd tier team along with psg man city athletico and dortmund for a long time but i think this has put us above all those teams top 4 is barca bayern juve and madrid imo next season will be different we have made a huge statement and were here to win this is the end for us but we have just started see you next year ,5,Juve

seandapaul,i really hope all the gundogan rumours are true would love to get him and have khedira sit on the bench for us pogba gundogan and marchisio in midfield would bring this team to a new level and if dybala and morata can keep up the goal scoring exploits we could become a first tier team like bayerm barca and madrid ,-1,Juve

seandapaul,i like mata i would love it if he came however i would love it more if we got calhanoglu from leverkusen also peryera is still injured hopefully he comes back and is able to play at a level as high as the two players mentioned peryera is a good player and maybe we dont need to sign anyone else i would love to have gundogan though i love this player and i think he would compliment this team incredibly well ,3,Juve

seandapaul,morata for isco would be something i would be down for but then we would really need another tevez dybala and mandzukic play well together but its not like either of them wont get injured what we need is another midfielder gundogon an attacking mid isco and a star striker cant even name one cause like this is basically impossible ,1,Juve

seandapaul,other than that backpass marchisio was the motor in this team he reminded me a lot of pirlo today i was happy to see this his long shots leave a lot to be desired though he always takes them and they are always on target and hard enough but they never actually come close to being a goal sure he will score the odd 2 3 goals a season with his long shots but if he just worked on placement he would add so much to his game i love marchisio and i always will the prince of juve has become our king as for pogba wow he was merciless today all the attacking plays went through him he recovered well and defended well the last couple of games we have seen the real pogba if he keeps this up and even somehow gets better it would be devastating to everyone we face our defence was solid chiellini was of course incredible with his commanding and leadership skills he will surely be a great captain once buffon decides to hang up those magical gloves of his barzagli lived up to his nickname the wall and bonnucci really had good awareness today to close down the gaps sandro is the brazillian spark we need in that 3 5 2 formation his assist was pivotal and he has done that twice in 2 games sandro has proven he is up to the task of replacing evra litch was litch not more i can say about him he defended sufficiently and also had a good run for a goal on the wing but hart did well to close him out as for our offence we really need to be a lot better dybala did well to run at the defence and impose himself in the opposing half but he really needs to make better decisions he is amazing but with better decision making skills he could be unstoppable morata missed so much and it was really frustrating he has good decision making skills though however he should have passed the ball to dybala for an easy tap in dybala gets in good positions so morata should be aware of who is around him morata needs to concentrate better manzdzukic was a beast today and he really did well to position himself and hold off the horrible otemendi for the goal today all in all juve did really well we need to work on a lot but if we gain more momentum throughout the season we can go far i think its time to realize the champions league is more important than the league now and that should be our main target with some key signings its very possible i think if we get a proven midfielder a creative number 10 and another striker who is proven we will reach a new level city is one of the best teams in the world and we just beat them twice in 2 months we are not that far away from success in europe we just need a few more key players the fighting spirit and little bit of luck to help us achieve what we are destined for ,15,Juve

seandapaul,im pretty sure the clause is only valid for 2 years we already had a summer transfer market where morata had a chance of leaving for 30 mill now the summer that we are currently approaching will be the last summer madrid will have to exercise the right to buy him back for 35 mill although i am not certain of anything lol,1,Juve
seandapaul,i have only ever heard of the clause being valid for 2 years so as far as i can tell as long as we can convince morata to say no to madrid for this summer then madrid have 0 say on acquiring his rights via the clause in his contract morata is staying with us madrid cant do anything about even with that clause i am more than confident morata will be a juve player for at least the next 3 4 years ,1,Juve
seandapaul,i think its ultimately up to the player madrid cant just come and say we want him back heres the 30 mill and fuck you morata needs to agree to the deal first then madrid are forced to pay out the amount which the clause states and then they get him back in that situation juve is powerless madrid have until the next summer transfer window to exercise the right to use the clause in his contract but after this summer the clause is nullified honestly though morata dosent seem like he wants to go back and madrid dont seem like they really want him anyway now with this new renewal it seems like morata is staying with juve for good madrid will have no say on the player once he signs a new contract there will be no clause that madrid is a part of if madrid really want him theyd have to pay w e juve asks what i am trying to say is morata is a juve player and madrid wont be able to get him sure there is a clause but that counts for nothing if the player chooses to disregard any advances ,8,Juve
seandapaul,international breaks are the cancer of this sport ,10,Juve
seandapaul,i think juve are playing more attractive football this year for the last 4 seasons juve were a more compact group with players who knew their role who knew how to grind out results now this seems like an experiment with a new young team which is producing a much more lively style of playing i have to say i like it but the most important thing is being compact and having a sense of solidarity within the league which is what we are lacking at the moment i think the inclusion of khedira brought that in the midfield today which was really nice to see we just need time to gel i think after december as long as we are within the top 5 in the league we can aim for the title ,2,Juve

seandapaul,pretty sure if morata does not want to go back then the clause is void rm have no say in it from that point as of june 30th 2016 or whenever the contract states is the final day for madrid to buy him back madrid probably wont even want him back morata is not a goal machine although he is capable of scoring 20 a season all of them being significant game winning goals of course lol but yeah benzema is still 28 29 and he still has some years left in him after benzema rm will just go for the next big striker out there morata is not that type of flashy player i do not want morata to leave because he has been one of if not the most important player for us since he joined morata wont want to leave im pretty sure anyway ,7,Juve
seandapaul,terribly disappointed allegri does not trust dybala hopefully he sees at least 30 min on the field ,3,Juve
seandapaul,i just recently bought the 3rd kit from the juve store from canada i went with dybala on the back based on his recent performances i really like this player is what i am trying to say i had already purchased the home kit at my local sports wear store and i am planning on putting either bonnucci chiellini or marchisio ,2,Juve
seandapaul,i think mnadzukic was the wrong buy although i could be wrong if we needed a replacement for tevez we should have gotten bacca or someone else who is a proven goal scorer i want to see dybala and morata upfront this is a good idea because it will form a partnership at the early stages of both their careers so we could have this partnership for a while it could be another del piero trez situation best case scenario of course mandzukic could be good in a 3 5 2 however in the 3 5 2 we put in a lot of crosses into the box since mandzukic is tall af he could prove to be a wild card i want to see draxler or gotze in a juve shirt next season as well both can play behind the strikers and can also play as wingers dybala and draxler gotze on the wing with morata in the middle can be a deadly trio llorente needs to leave because we have 3 cfs when berardi comes in next season hopefully then we will be set for attack midfield is troubling atm though vidal leaving is a huge loss unless we get verratti i dont really see us having that great of a midfield in the future verratti should be our prime target for next season with marchisio and pogba verratti can shine ,2,Juve

seandapaul,comedy seinfeld drama black mirror scifi fantasy lost reality survivor,1,television
seandapaul,this means berardi needs to come back this summer and become one of the focal points of the team idk if mandzukic was the right buy seeing as how we already have morata and dybala who can play in the middle if a 4 3 3 is what allegri wants to do then we need to get berardi back for sure and attempt to reinvent dybala as a winger not too sure if he can already play as a winger but if not then these payers we are buying do not fit the system allegri wants to do mandzukic seems like a good buy only is llorente leaves for around the same price i would love to see griezman come to juve but of ourse that will probably never happen salah may be a good player to invest in as well ,2,Juve
seandapaul,i think it is risky to put all our cards on our young players berardi should be bought outright because he has an incredible future maybe she should be loaned out to a la liga team so he can get a feel for facing the best teams but the worst thing we could do is start our young players cavani is our best bet he is already proven and we know he will be a huge success cavani up front with morata and possibly dybala behind them would be perfect zaza is a player i would like to see leave our team because i dont see much promise in him berardi should be loaned to a team like sevilla or valencia and morata should stay with us ,0,Juve
seandapaul,the lord,1,Juve
seandapaul,i think juve should let zaza go but signing berardi is a must i think berardi should stay out on loan until tevez leaves next season after that we will have dybala morata berardi coman as our striking force if none of these players can replicate what tevez has done with us for the last 2 seasons then we need to buy a world class striker next season ,1,Juve
seandapaul,yeah and i also forgot the simpsons that was probably the most consistent show i watched with the sopranos i just used to watch it with my parents when i was about 6 or 7 i wasnt allowed to watch it but i would always watch it out of sight next to my room my room wasnt far away from the family room so i had a perfect view of the tv then eventually they just let me watch it after like season 4 i re watched it a couple of years ago and was surprised at how little i forgot everything stuck when i was a kid might explain why i am the way i am now lol,2,television

seandapaul,the only thing i can see being a problem is if we need t switch to a back 3 barzagli is a perfect replacement for the bak four but if by chance we are ahead after the 60 70 min mark then alegri will most likely want to employ a 3 5 2 this is a problem now but i am not too worried this is the kind of game where even our worst players will surely perform if they are absolutely needed if we have any more injury until tomorrow then yeah i will be terrified but as of right now its not entirely a huge deal the fact that chiellini wont be there simply for his presence is not great because he is our vice captain and hes been with us through thick and thin so the fact he cant play in the biggest game arguably in the clubs history deeply saddens me as i finish writing this it is not 2 45pm literally 24 hours to go jesus christ ,1,Juve

seandapaul,this,1,television
seandapaul,idk about this statement there are so many good shows out there like for example breaking bad is the best drama i have ever watched this was like the 2nd show i had ever watched in my life lol i dont think tv has gone downhill for me at all i just finished the new season of arrow and the flash these shows are no where near as good as bb six feet under or the shield but atm all i want to watch are superhero vigilante shows because its the new flavour of the month for me sort of speak you go through a lot of genres while watching different shows so i dont think you will ever actually run out of anything good to watch if you want to see a show with an incredible finale thats six feet under and the shield both for me have the best endings of all time but if you are afraid of running out of shit dont be there is always something out there like for example there are 2 uk dramas in which i think are close to being the best shows of all time they are called utopia and black mirror what i am trying to say is that america isnt the only country that produces good tv if you really need to find something start hunting these shows down go all over the world if you have to ,1,television

seandapaul,i disagree lets say verratti costs 50 mill the season after the next one would be the perfect time to make enquiries for verratti we should be looking at darmian right now we have gotten dybala so our striker situation is pretty good atm pirlo will most likely leave which will leave us with asamoah padoin stuaro for cover i think dybala should play behind tevez and morata with vidal marchisio and pogba behind them the team will be tighter but we might lose our edge that pirlo provided us dybala may be able to bring that edge back though darmian should be bought because litch is very inconsistent and we always have asamoah for an evra back up so in light of this verratti should be bought the season after only if we need another pirlo like player i dont think we need him but if we are missing something we should wait for a season to pass or at leas until january ,1,Juve
seandapaul,i dont think cavani is a good choice since we have morata and now dybala both will become stars only way i see cavani coming in is is tevez leaves and id rather have tevez then morata and dybala form a partnership for the season after that ,2,Juve
seandapaul,yeah i learned about morata after but marchisio too well we still have cover for both llorente coman sturaro padoin,1,Juve
seandapaul,thats true so i guess id say barzagli and ognonna also i just found out morata will be suspended for the copa final so i guess tevez and llorente is the striking partnership we will see ,2,Juve
seandapaul,i think playing at full capacity is risky lazio have been second best this season but we already beat them 3 0 and 2 0 they have the 2nd best attack in italy yet they havent scored against us this season i think we should give chiellini and evra a rest we should play buffon because its not like he will get tired and its highly unlikely he will get injured bonnucci barzagli padoin litchstiener in defence we should play pirlo along with marchisio and stuararo peryera should be behind morata and tevez tevez should come off in the 2nd half if we are ahead if we are still ahead by the 65th 70th min we should take off marchisio for pogba and pirlo for chiellini then for verona we literally need to rest everyone it dosent matter if we lose that game all that matters is that we have a full strength squad for barca ,1,Juve
seandapaul,i agree with you but i honestly hate inter and its not because its some stupid irrational rivalry its because inter stole two scudettis away from us and is one of the reasons why serie a is the way it is right now however thank you for the support and i would be lying in saying i was upset to see inter win it in 2010 i do believe in the greater good of serie a having said that fuck inter ,2,Juve
seandapaul,and as a juve supporter i am delighted to face the greatest team on earth in the final i was hoping for this final from the beginning of the tournament and i got it these teams have not met each other in quite some time so this final is a really special one finals are always 50 50 imo so may the best team win ,2,soccer

seandapaul,i did shed some tears today seeing morata score might have been the greatest thing i have ever witnessed while watching soccer and now were going to berlin i want this now that we are in the final we have to win the title every final is 50 50 idc care about this so called msn idc about the word barcelona nobody is unbeatable this is our destiny in berlin nobody deserves this more than buffon no player in history has ever deserved this title more than buffon i want to see juve win it for him this is buffons time we can do this ,4,Juve
seandapaul,let that sink in everyone ,4,Juve
seandapaul,what is all this hype around neto he flopped hard against sevilla idk he dosent seem like the best solution for buffons heir also i dont want to see dybala at juve if we have to pay 40 50 mill to be a substitute i thin our best solution would be to get either cavani or lacazette for that kind of money buffon litchstiener bonucci barzagli chiellini rugani evra caceres vidal marchisio sturaro pogba pirlo peryera tevez cavani lacazette morata ,2,Juve

seandapaul,sturaro pogba rugani berardi thats the future id put buffon there too but idk if it would count cause of his age but at the same time he will out play last everyone lol ,5,Juve
seandapaul,we need to take it to them using our counter attacking qualities we need to pull them forward and hit them on the counter as their defence are pressed up morata needs to work on eyeing out whos around him and that will be the key i really like vidals pressure and his aggressiveness he needs to play like he did i think it will ultimately come down to litch and evra to stop the attacks we will most likely have barzagli bonnucci and chiellini just in case the crosses come but litch and evra need to shut down their attacking players thus not to let crosses in super defensive is not the way to go but we need to be smart and this means its gonna be an ugly game we need to score most likely counter attacking madrid should be effective though i am confident but our defence will make or break this team on wednesday ,2,Juve

seandapaul,i agree with you and sorry i guess im not making myself clear an all out attack barca style is not what im saying im saying more counter attacking style where we can score goals against a fragile madrid defence i do however believe some risks should be taken to score more goals though juve should play to their strength but we need to do anything we can for a win and then next game we need to sit back and defend with a counter attacking style of play ,1,Juve
seandapaul,i would agree with you if it was a group game or even the round of 16 but this is the semi finals theoretically this was our goal this season anything else is a bonus so considering this fact i think juve should just go for it and give us a good game to witness if we lose we lose we shouldnt be expecting much imo but if juve can score some goals and give us a show it could help us in qualifying or worst case scenario give us respect to all of europe we cant have a repeat of the munich game or even get ripped apart like a lot of teams do at this stage we need to give the fans a show which could help us we need the lead in the first game no matter how many goals we concede as long as we win then play a boring chelsea mode defensive game to keep our lead ,1,Juve
seandapaul,i understand that and for most games i would agree with you but this is madrd vs juve juve do not have a great chance of getting through to the final attacking at home means we need to sacrifice our defence and as you said madrid have the best counter attack in the game we need to attack and score a couple of goals at home it dosent matter how much we score as long as we win it would be nice to win by a score line of 4 1 but that most likely wont happen as long as we get a win at home it wont matter how many goals they score the game in spain needs to be tied juve must play for the tie juve have nothing to lose so attacking at full force in torino is what should be done at madrid though there is very little chance we can take anything from them there so getting a tie is the best solution if we have a lead realistically speaking juve can manage a 2 1 at home and a 2 2 away even if we bring it to extra time were gonna have to bring it to extra time in spain which i dont want to see happening ,1,Juve
seandapaul,yes i meant marchisio vidal and pogba in the 4 3 1 2 formation so yes i did think of peryera in the attacking mid position infront of those 3 ,1,Juve
seandapaul,true but pirlo has become a bit of a liability i dont think playing pogba vidal and marchisio would be bad to pka a defensive game i feel like we will need pirlo in the first game cause well its gonna happen regardless so he can rip open the defence where tevez and morata could try their luck in madrid we have to stay back which is not pirlos strength he dosent really defend so we will need marchisio to take his place so he can track back so we can protect the lead if we have one that is this is all hypothetical though i think this discussion is better suited for after the first game ,2,Juve
seandapaul,well considering we dont have anyone else because pogba is injured and we absolutely need to attack madrid at home then pirlo needs to play we need to win at home and if we dont win we need to draw 0 0 if we win at home then we need to sit back and keep a clean sheet pirlo is needed for the first game but he is not needed for the 2nd marchisio vidal and pogba should be started in the second with marchisio in pirlos position it dosent matter how may away goals madrid scores as long as we win we have a good chance of going through we need to play for the win and fo the tie we absolutely need to get to berlin cause we can win it all if we just get passed madrid ,5,Juve
seandapaul,i wonder how you will react when serious shit happens,32,confession
seandapaul,started watching in 2005 when i was like 11 years old and camoranesi was my all time favorite player,1,Juve
seandapaul,didnt realize it said season finale and assumed it said series but i guess i would say season 5 finale of the shield was pretty crazy both series finales were 10 10 ,1,television
seandapaul,the shield and six feet under ,9,television
seandapaul,well lets all not be too overconfident here the fact is it was a favorable draw but we are still pretty far behind the top 3 in the world this is not saying we cant beat any of these teams though its just unlikely that we would i say for madrid atm our chances are pretty good considering i would say 60 40 in madrids favour now given this i think our best bet would to play a 4 3 1 2 just how we have been playing for most of this season we need to attack at home and we need to win away goals are not going to matter as long as we win when we go back to madrid we need to play with a 5 3 2 formation and push everyone back we need players man marking certain individuals like ronaldo bale and james we need to go full on chelsea mode as much as some people hate them that was an incredible thing to witness and they did it playing ultra defensively which was the smart thing to do we need to keep tevez in midfield helping with the defensive contribution and if there is a clear he needs to run his ass off for it at the bernabau if we can win at home and keep a 0 0 draw at madrid we can progress to the final where we can go on and become champions cause in the final anything can happen ,1,Juve
seandapaul,over lacazette i guess thats your opinion but the fact that he has scored 22 goals last season and is going to reach 30 and beyond this season speaks volumes sure dybala is still really young but lacazette is young and has the ability already also id much rather pay 40 mill for an established striker who is 24 and scoring goals than an unestablished overpriced overhyped player idk i think dybala is bad business let someone else take him for that ridiculous amount dybala is not worth it ,1,Juve
seandapaul,worst thing we can do is sell pogba and make another team infinitely stronger we are in the semis we are currently top 4 in the world atm if we sell one of our best players to these teams what does that say about us there is no way in hell that we should even be considering selling pogba when we dont need the money we are getting enough money from the cl so we can easily re invest it into the squad dybala is not a target we should be considering either why he has scored 13 goals this season thats not even that impressive when berardi has been doing that for like 2 seasons straight and hes younger and half owned by us we should be looking at lacazette who is on towards 30 this season hes french strong and only 23 years old rodriguez is another player im willing to see play for us from wolfsburg we need a quality left and right back as for an attacking mid we should really make the peryera deal permanent so this summer we need to keep everyone sell llorente and ogbonna and buy rodriguez and lacazette we must bring back berardi and also buy out peryera contract ,3,Juve
seandapaul,honestly the chiellini handball was justified if he didnt do it they would have scored most likely the fact that he didnt get a red card just shows that the ref didnt want to be douch and keep the game level at the beginning the ref let those physical challenges go too and it was all right imo its a physical sport and fucking calling every foul ruins the flow of the game the challenge in the box where our defenders sandwiched kondogobia was in no way a pk as well he ran into a wall and no one fouled him chiellini literally got the ball as for juves performance offensively speaking they were terrible they couldnt string the spasses together in the final 3rd which was incredibly frustrating to watch the counter with morata and tevez was also pathetic imo anyone in that position needs to pass the ball like wtf was going on through his mind only way juve can make it to the finals imo is if they get madrid and play like they did against dortmund bayern and barca are too strong especially over 2 legs so these teams need to be avoided madrid id say is 60 40 in their favour which isnt bad i really want juve to make it to the final its a berlin final and we all know what happened last time buffon and pirlo were there ,9,Juve
seandapaul,i thought pirlo and bonnucci were our best players tonight as well as buffon with that last min interception on berbatov all in all it was a horrible display offensively speaking did they eve have a shot on target ,3,Juve

seandapaul,only players id like to see if we sell pogba would be verratti lacazette and quality left and right backs ,2,Juve
seandapaul,yeah porto may be our best bet as is anyones best bet realistically but if they play like that every game then i would rather have athletico or real tbh lol athletico are realy tight defensively i think we can beat them in a shootout with buffon real we can beat in general as they can us barca and bayern is a no go id like to avoid them no way we can beat barca over 2 legs but we can in one game so other than bayern or barca idc who we get if we make the semis ,0,Juve
seandapaul,wasnt even boring both teams had quite a few chances if both teams took their chances it could have been like a 3 2 game for juve good thing that didnt happen cause 2 away goals would be brutal ,2,Juve
seandapaul,that most definitely was a pk and there was no way the foul came outside of the box that was very much inside of the box barely inside but nonetheless inside morata was denied a clear goalscoring opportunity i think the yellow and pk was the perfect decision the ref could have made red would have been too harsh but he literally dived on moratas back to stop him clipped his legs too that was 100 a pk we have all seen fouls like this be awarded a pk even fouls that wernt as bad be given a pk so to me this was 100 a pk ,1,Juve
seandapaul,if we let monaco have possession and counter attack then we will win if we play our possession game we will either tie or lose counter attacking is the style of play we look the best with and we are way more effective with it it all comes down to allegris tactics ,2,Juve
seandapaul,what i love about this team atm is the fact they dont let many chances go through them they are so good at stopping the opposition from creating anything dortmund had like 5 shots on target including the dumbest goal of all time i think with teams like barca madrid and espeially psg we could dominate the opposition with a counter attacking tactic the only way i see monaco beating us is if juve play their usual possession game they usually play in serie a they played the counter attacking style against dortmund and that was probably the best game we have played since a really long time remember celtic we let them have possession and scored 3 away goals on counter attacks this should be our game plan for everyone we let the opposition have the ball cut them off at midfield defend with everyone then when we get the ball back we break with vidal and marchisio have tevez morata up front use peryera as our link man and let morata and tevez do the rest remember our game vs athletico sure we were able to dominate possession but we let them have a couple f good chances and let a goal pass by we seem to be ineffective while we have possession where as we seem to be more effective on the break even 3 4 years ago when milan made barca look so incompetent at the san siro when they won 2 0 allegir knows how to stop the opposition from creating chances now he has a group a players who are actually good now so the goals will come counter attacking is the way to go i think other than bayern who happen to know exactly what to do in every situation no matter who you are then i think we can succeed its not beyond our reach were just further away compared to others but in the end its not always the ones who are closer its the one who are never willing to stop no matter how far they may appear to be i believe in this team this team has been through so much and no body deserves it more than juve ,3,Juve
seandapaul,nahh when he said that to the kids mom that was fucking hilarious see the way i see it he said that because he himself was feeling awkward it didnt seem like he meant for it to come out like that he was just feeling out of place and attempted to make a joke that obviously failed miserably and as soon as he realized he just walked away i dont think he was being an asshole he was just being awkward which is what this show is in fact that was my favorite part of the episode i was dying when i heard that,2,louie
seandapaul,interesting in light of this new information i now say fuck napoli juve will most likely win imo unless napoli decides to turn it on like they do most of the time with us then i see juve winning with a comfortable 3 0 against either napoli or lazio,3,Juve
seandapaul,am i the only person on here who hopes napoli stays in 6th and wins the coppa italia this would mean that napoli gets a europa league spot along with sampdoria and fiorentina hopefully they get 3rd and lazio make europa instead unless we make the champions league final and have a shot of winning the treble i think it would be much better for serie a if napoli win it i know this may not be a popular opinion but i would rather see serie a grow in europe than juve winning a coppa italia ,1,Juve

seandapaul,players are usually money hungry especially true for the epl players as well as many good players that want that pay raise so they will go anywhere they can get it pogba is not however a money hungry player he also happens to be one of the best midfielders in the world how could juve even think of selling when they lucked out big time this is a once in a lifetime not even messi fits in this category cause he makes a shit ton of money pogba dosent seem to care i do however would like to see him get a pay raise at juve cause he does deserve it ,1,Juve

seandapaul,i would like to avoid barca and bayern on a skill level they would most likely beat us i also would like to avoid athletico its not the end of the world if we get them but id rather not face them because they already beat us this season and they are agressive would like to avoid injuries the rest of the season on a personal level id like to avoid psg this is because i want to see psg vs juve in the semis i dont mind facing madrid but id rather avoid it madrid is still the best team with the best players maybe not the best team but undoubtably better than juve on a technical level id like to see us drawing monaco that would be ideal porto would be alright but that will be another dortmund style game but this time they mean business porto and monaco are obviously the dream draw but i wouldnt mind facing madrid ,5,Juve
seandapaul,well i guess its always sunny would be what you are looking for but tbh there is nothing like seinfeld instead of trying to find a comedy as good as seinfeld try looking for other comedys party down is a really good show i just started watching frasier and i love it brooklyn 99 is really good too ,2,television
seandapaul,in all honesty it is important to see juve beat dortmund by a significant margin i want to see a 3 0 or 4 0 win this will show the world just how much of a factor juve is if juve scrape by with another narrow win or even a draw then it wont look good if we happen to get barca or bayern in the next round what juve needs to do is dominate dortmund score some goals and show europe we are to be feared now this would be ideal but for the sake of qualification we should approach the game exactly how we did in the first leg we need to let dortmund see the ball because their creativity is abysmal we need to hit them on the counter and take our chances if things went perfectly last game it should have been a 4 0 game for juve chiellini should not have slipped up and tevez and morata should have doubled their tally by finishing their easy chances that were given to them before thinking about the qf we need to get through dormtund first if we have the same approach from the first leg i think we an win but i want to see a big win it will all com down to our attack and our defensive prowess if we avoid mistakes then we should win the game ,-1,Juve
seandapaul,to be fair those shows arnt that great,0,television
seandapaul,if juve do progress to the quarter finals we really need to face monaco any other team will have us struggling not to say monaco isnt a good team but compared to every other team they seem like the easiest team to face porto game would be 50 50 but i would honestly tip that to porto i think it would be better facing madrid or psg than facing porto so i am fine with facing monaco in the qf then possibly getting either psg or madrid in the semis if somehow we make the final then it would most likely be against barca i think they will win it all or bayern if barca fuck up dortmund monaco psg barca is the only way i can see us winning this year if we face bayern its over i believe barca can destroy us but allegri has a respectable record against them given the milan teams he had at his disposal while facing them ,1,Juve

seandapaul,dont listen to what people are saying about calling it soccer we are amaerican football is completely different to us but if you really want to get into it the way i did was following a team that came from europe only continent that is really relevant cause of the champions league the country i am from is italy so i chose to support juventus now i am lucky because the italian league is in the top 4 best leagues in the world atm id say pick a team either in spain england germany or italy you will probably end up picking a team in the top 3 leagues which are spain england and germany for spain there is real madrid and bareclona who are among the worlds greatest teams another team who is pretty good but not as good but still has a fighting chance against these teams is athletico madrid in england you have your choice between manchester united chelsea manchester city liverpool or arsenal imo chelsea is the best but manchester united is the classic english team for germany there are only 2 teams which is bayern munich only team to win the league the league is often called bayernliga and borussia dortmund for italy atm there is juventus milan inter roma napoli fiorentina lazio italy have a lot of teams but they are no where near the level of the other teams in spain england and germany oh and psg in france is a really hype team atm they got ibrahimovich ,0,IWantToLearn

seandapaul,if tevez leaves we absolutely need another star striker berardi zaza morata etc are not star strikers imo we need someone like lacazette or cavani ,2,Juve
seandapaul,1 1 1 realistically juve wont score that much and dortmund will end up getting a goal i think dortmund will score somewhere between the 30 mim mark and half time juve will equalize with pogba or litchstiener 2 buffon lirtchstiener bonnucci chiellini caceres pirlo pogba vidal peryera llorente tevez 4 3 1 2 3 if pogba is playing well the team will play well as well for pirlo 4 i think if juve are able to keep dortmund frm scoring it will be mainly because of litchstiner attacking isnt a concern in the home game hopefully we can win 1 or 2 0 at home unlikely but we need to avoid conceding at all costs we can attack in dortmund because an away goal will prove to be imperitve in a game like this 5 i think the obvious choice of player would be rues an attacking mid would be really helpful for this squad 6 aubyemeng and reus counter attacking will cause of havoc 7 bonnucci,1,Juve
seandapaul,you guys are fucked dude get over it lol but seriously its not like madrid fans could be confident in winning the cl again it dosent usually work like that teams never win it 2 years in a row if madrid face athletico barca or juve they will have troubles madrid is definitely the best team in the sport but that literally almost means nothing in this sport because anything can happen i say depending on who the face of course they will be knocked out before the final ,-7,realmadrid
seandapaul,if we do end up getting back zaza and berardi i think a young prospering winger is needed next season tevez can be played on the wing as can berardi zaza in the middle and morata as back up llorente must go matri must go as well so in 2 years i would like to see juves attack to consist of zaza berardi morata and 2 young prosperous wingers pogba vidal and marchisio will be in midfield and defence is what it is we need time but we will get there i say if we can keep pogba we can win the cl in 6 years time ,1,Juve

seandapaul,only time i ever wanted him at juve was when he was heading to milan he was really young and crazy but conte would have grounded him and made him a better player this would have given him a chance to play with most of the azzurri squad and would have helped italy in the world cup now i would say no because it seems to me that if a player does not break into the first team at a very young age and performs well then he will only ever be just a normal player pogba hazard neymar oscar isco etc are prime examples of this trait balotelli is 23 24 now hes heading into his mid twenties and has never done anything special other than the game vs germany in the euro i am afraid his time is up and all he will ever be is a cassano type of player the best i can see him do is be a 20 goal a season player for 2 3 seasons in his mid to late 20s so yes i would not want balo on the team he should have came after city would have been a whole different player i believe if he did that ,1,Juve

seandapaul,there is a rumour that cavani and verratti are being linked to juve and pogba the other way i think that would be a good transfer for both parties verratti would go home to italy and work under pirlo which would probably help the italian national team and cavani would go back to italy where he was a star pogba of course would be really missed but we would get more out of it i think verrati is the best possible replacement and plus cavani to partner tevez would be deadly buffon litchsteiner bonnucci cheillini montanya hopefully vidal verratti marchisio mata hopefully cavani tevez if we could secure that deal and buy montanya this january and mata in the summer it would look really good it does look sad that pogba is out of this lineup but i think it would be for the best mata and montanya together would probably cost 40 50 mill which can be saved from champions league winnings from progressing hopefully we make it passed dortmund this may be just day dreaming and fantasy but it could be realistic if the juventus board are serious about making this team an elite team again ,1,Juve

seandapaul,i understand that and i guess my comment is purely based on emotion rather than rationality although i do have a problem with your last comment gone girl is very overhyped and i would hope flynn and fincher would stray away from that style of story telling i was very disappointed in the movie especially the ending i honestly dont know if fincher is the right man for the job i think they should at the very least bring on dennis kelly as the main show runner his vision for this series is why people loved it so much i feel like the hbo series will not use what dennis kelly uses to make this show so great i have repsect for hbo but it seems to me that unless they make thisthe best show in hbo history it will just be the biggest flop there is a lot riding on this and i honestly dont think hbo has what it takes to re make such a perfect show best they can do is make it as good as the uk version which is the ideal for me no way they can make it better and even more likely they will just make it worse ,1,television
seandapaul,idk if thats a good idea tbh if hbo really wants to make this show they should just start it at season 3 and continue it with everyone involved with the uk version the show is a 10 10 so unless hbo can make it just as good then it wont be a good remake cant even make it better cause its perfect just the way it is imo ,1,television

seandapaul,first 4 seasons of dexter could potentially be the greatest tv experience of my life the seasons after that 5 8 get really bad and when i say really bad i mean really fucking bad as for entourage its not that great of a show imo i watched it when i was 16 and thought it was incredible cause i guess i liked the fantasy of that life style the show is really dull at times very formulaic as is dexter and just becomes cringe worthy at times although the first 3 seasons are great just 4 guys hanging out in la doing some crazy shit it was fun to watch season 4 and 5 were not that good imo and season 6 was just flat out the funniest season of tv history for me so yeah hope that helps i hope none of this discourages you from watching these shows entourage kinda has to be watched in full but dexter can be stopped at s4 easily ,3,television

seandapaul,its about a group of people who survived a plane crash on an island its basically explores the individuals lives from real life and how they compare on the island after the first season some next level shit ensues with the island having a vast history and supernatural occurrences its all a mystery and an adventure imo it has the best character development of any show ive ever watched i say its worth a watch i really enjoyed it im sure you have heard a lot of negative reviews about it which are fair but i still really enjoyed the show ,2,television
seandapaul,napoli lost to bilbao at the start of the season in the cl as far as i am concerned their time is over they should have at least made the semi finals one year in the cl they never had the team but that dosent mean they couldnt pull off a dortmund athletico type of season when they lost cavani it all went downhill from there as for the loss in the supercoppa in the end its still a derby italian derbys are always 50 50 napoli just got lucky its as simple as that ,1,Juve
seandapaul,del piero was a phenomenon in the 90s after his serious injury things took a turn for the worse although he took advantage of the injury i believe i remember watching him play from 2002 2012 and he was always a very slow player that being said he would always get through players with his technique he was slow but that didnt stop him from literally deeking out good defenders he had an incredible free kick and his shots were always the scariest shots for keepers he had amazing killer instinct not to mention he was loyal and as humble as anyone could be he is a legend in every regard and a reference point on how to pla the game when things dont look good he is a role model amoung everything else which i feel is the most important for the sport itself good vibes all i can say as for baggio i really cant say because i never saw him play as for totti i still say del piero because he contributed more on an international level and has won more than totti at club level you can say totti never had the service adp had but in the end adp has more cant deny that fact and as for cassano i never liked his playing style only time i actually noticed his talent was when he was on sampdoria and that wasnt for very long hes a balotelli type of a player had so much promise but never lived up to it because of their attitude ,5,Juve

seandapaul,in all honesty im guessing a 1 1 draw in torino and 3 1 win for dortmund in germany if juve play how they have been playing for the last couple of years i say go for the win in italy in an all out attack and defend with 11 menin germany with giovinco pereyra and tevez for a counter attack tactic ,1,Juve

seandapaul,i feel like everyone just dick rides the wire no matter what the context i love the show but god damn lol ,0,television
seandapaul,i think the only team that can completely outplay us is bayern but every single other team will have juve struggling even a team like porto is 50 50 remember last season against benfica juve dont have desire to win they think what they do is enough they always play it safe which in the end is the reason they fail winning serie a is not such an amazing feat to accomplish given how bad the league has become juve should be putting away low teams but they struggle against pretty much any team who isnt italian they realistically have no chance against bayern or madrid they can fight madrid but they will never come out on top the only reason chelsea dortmund and athletico were able to reach the final was because they were hungry to win they played perfectly and didnt let anything get to them they didnt let things discourage them juve are stuck in a rut and cant seem to get out they make chances but they are never clear cut and when they do have chances they will more than likely miss i dont think im pessimistic i have been witnessing this for quite sometime ,5,Juve
seandapaul,tbh the only team i can see juve realistically beating in the round of 16 is monaco everyone else will defiantly be a huge struggle where juve will play well but never score then get scored on late then tie the home game and get knocked out because they could not finish their chances i know i will get downvoted but im sure us juve fans who are not naive know that this is true ,5,Juve
seandapaul,yeah for me prison break is amazing for the first 2 seasons the 3rd season is actually poo and then the last half of the 4th is great ,1,television

seandapaul,im speaking in more of realistic sense the show is definitely not realistic a 50 year old guy with terminal lung cancer can in no way become a drug king pin in that span of time with such a serious illness and be successful not to mention the events that took place im not bad mouthing the show its actually my favourite drama of all time but idk if i would agree it is realistic authentic its just a badass story told in the perfect way with incredible acting and writing ,2,television
seandapaul,no idea how it actually is in prison but i think oz portrayed it perfectly it really felt like the writers knew what they were talking about and the acting was just as authentic as the acting seen in the wire imo,2,television

seandapaul,4 of my friends and i went to see a primus concert in down town toronto maybe 2 years ago on the highway we decided to light up a joint while driving to get the initial buzz going one of my friends had made weed edibles in the form of peanut butter sandwiches and when we got to yorkdale we each had one edible before getting out of the car after that we again smoked another joint before getting on the subway we had a lot of pre made joints lol as we got off the subway we had about 2 4 km to walk so we decided to smoke another joint in public as we walked there we probably sparked up 2 before getting to the venue when we finally got to the venue the edibles had kicked in primus got on stage and started playing as they played their first song we again sparked up another joint during the concert we probably shared a total of 6 joints passing them around and just grooving to the music after the concert we had another 2 joints that we smoked at the yorkdale parking lot and that was the end of the night i got so stoned that during the concert i had to get a drink to get hydrated cause i thought i was gonna pass out and tbh that was not even the highest i have ever been lol ,1,AskReddit
seandapaul,depends if you can handle formulaic shows i am watching the show for the first time now and i would say it is worth watching until the end season 4 was a bit of a turn but after that it gets a whole lot better even better than before house is very wittty which i like and the supporting characters are good ,1,television
seandapaul,utopia fargo prison break six feet under seinfeld dexter legit louie key and peele brooklyn nine nine ,3,television
seandapaul,the dialogue and characters need a step up they cant keep dealing with the same old bs its too dramatic at times and by dramatic i just mean cheesy as hell they need to introduce a character who is a badass who actually enjoys the circumstances and can provide much needed comedic relief a badass cowboy like character would be cool kind of like rock with shanes morals who does not have a family not because he lost them just cause he never had anyone he needs to be funny and needs to seem like hes enjoying everything about whats happening enough with the soap opera and make it more awesome zombies are awesome but this show is lame if this is too much to handle then make the rest of the seasons like season 1 give us some mysteries to think about the soap opera got old when they aired the first episode of season 2 ,1,television

seandapaul,this isnt a show all about the ending it isnt a show to criticize because some things were not explained in its entirety its more on the basis of the lessons you learn and what you take from the show to better devlop yourself in your own life binge watching the show makes it way better than watching it week to week the whole thing with the ending did not bother me because i was figuratively taken on a journey where i was living the lives of these characters and that was enough for me i watch a shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit ton of tv i literally watch everything and no show is like lost not my favourite show but still it has something that no other show has definitely finish the entire series best character development any show has ever produced imho ,1,lost
seandapaul,seinfeld my all time favorite show the wire the sopranos the shield best series finale i have ever watched six feet under which has michael c hall and oz these shows i would say are above every other show on the planet but there are other shows which i did enjoy either just as much or even more based on preference such as lost prison break freaks and geeks house of cards becoming one of the greats its always sunny in philly archer really good cartoon suits very consistent sons of anarchy really good show but it falls off then picks up strongly again entourage the l word californication hannibal the league the killing workaholics arrow ray donovan malcolm in the middle wilfred im sure im missing a lot more that i have watched but alas i cannot remember atm but these shows are all amazing in their own right my fav out of all of these other than seinfeld that you probably havent watched would probably be the shield ,0,Dexter
seandapaul,maybe they could do a mini series of a 20 30 something year old harrison who is now a police detective who finds out his dad dexter was the bay harbor butcher he never truly believed his dad died in the circumstance of which were explained to him so now he is on the hunt not only to find his long lost father but to track down the bay harbor butcher maybe for this idea if they want to keep it going harrison works on this case completely alone thus not to give up dexters true identity and his main motive would just to find him maybe harrison can be a serial killer as well being a police detective and finding dexter would be useful to him in learning from his own father idk though i have heard of potential spin offs i just hope its as good as the first 4 seasons of dexter there are so many possibilities but i would be disappointed if the spin off did not revolve around harrison with some inclusion of dexter michael c hall a good actor for harrison potential psychopathic killer would be ezra miller i think ,1,Dexter
