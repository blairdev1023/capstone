get_it_together1,the premise that r politics is in any way against net neutrality the only possibilities i see here are that some mod has a personal vendetta against you or you are misrepresenting your actions to pretend that you are not violating rules r politics is full of pro net neutrality posts the post of yours that got deleted is at the top of r netflix ,1,conspiracy
get_it_together1,i very clearly pointed out that recent events go against the msm russian narrative ,3,conspiracy
get_it_together1,i do not mention the likelihood of russian hacking instead i point out that recent events support the counternarratives against the msm conclusion that it was russia in the context of internet anonymity my slide is 6 comments deep you do not understand the concept of forum sliding and any way you look at it the russian conspiracy is one of the largest and most impactful conspiracies going on at the moment some part of the executive branch is compromised either the ic has fabricated a narrative to take down the president or the president colluded with foreign powers why are you so triggered ,4,conspiracy
get_it_together1,i am in a conspiracy sub discussing thoughts i have with regards to internet anonymity after somebody brought it up talking about my thoughts about internet anonymity and the fact that recent events do not support the idea that russia compromised our election infrastructure i am not sure that reading comprehension is one of your strengths ,4,conspiracy
get_it_together1,i was responding to the concept of internet anonymity which itself is an aside from netflix or net neutrality it relates directly to the topic at the forefront of my mind and the american public did you actually read what i wrote i thought maybe i would get actual discussion here instead of in the more explicitly partisan threads but apparently even here it just omg you mentioned russia well done sir well done ,1,conspiracy
get_it_together1,i disagree entirely with that description of the telecom industry there was a monopoly it was broken up by the government the monopoly has slowly put itself back together there are only a handful of key players across cable internet and phone services net neutrality does not raise barriers to entry and it has nothing to do with the ability of large telecoms to buy small telecoms everything about this description is wrong with regards to telecom ,8,conspiracy
get_it_together1,i was certain that the russian election hacking and propaganda campaigns were going to be used as a pretext to reduce or remove entirely internet anonymity at least from government eyes this would enable the ic to protect us from enemy disinformation instead despite there apparently being a lot of evidence of tampering with our election system by somebody there has been very little discussion of the problem it lends credence to some of the counternarratives now my money is on the idea that the same weaknesses in our election infrastructure that were seemingly abused by russia are also being abused by american government and corporations although it also possible that they are trying to walk a fine line in releasing just enough info to claim it was russia without subjecting their claims to so much scrutiny that the entire operation gets exposed as a fraud i suppose a more normal explanation is that the ic does not want our enemies to know to what extent we are monitoring their activity and or they do not want to alarm the american public even as they work to fix problems in the background but the problem pretty much requires public legislation from the states to fix so i do not see how that works ,3,conspiracy
get_it_together1,i was not complaining i was just pointing out that the premise seems wrong perhaps i should have been more clear the post is bullshit for example this post discusses netflix leaving the fight https np reddit com r politics comments 6emzkp netflix leaving battle for net neutrality shows r politics has many posts about net neutrality including some discussing netflix https np reddit com r politics search q net neutrality sort new restrict sr on the comments are filled with donate to the eff to help nn and gop sucks for trying to get rid of nn as you would expect from a left wing sub when the premise is so blatantly false i have to wonder just how skewed the bias of the poster is ,19,conspiracy
get_it_together1,i have seen more pushback against nn on this sub than anywhere in r politics here you will find people arguing that nn is all about censorship or a secret government attempt to control the internet ,81,conspiracy

get_it_together1,there only so many confirmed hillary pulled the trigger posts that get completely debunked before people start thinking that it all just bullshit i mean if i were the dnc i would probably be spamming the shit out of easily debunked facts related to the conspiracy so maybe that what is going on ,6,conspiracy
get_it_together1,that because you misrepresented my statement and commit the very same act you hold up as detestable by your own standards you are highly compromised you are a shill for russia and the gop it really obvious ,5,conspiracy
get_it_together1,i never said they were working together but i did say both parties are pushing the conspiracy it is a simple fact that at least one gop congressman fox news breitbart and infowars are all heavily promoting the seth rich conspiracy we uncovered a scripting ring here in r conspiracy that was simultaneously pushing the rich assassination macron emails and targeting the paris agreement wikileaks seemingly coordinated dumps during the election to counteract negative news against trump the only real evidence for the rich assassination conspiracy is assange suggestion that seth rich was the dnc leaker we have a tape of senior gop leadership discussing the idea that putin is paying trump and rohrabacher confirmed by another republican who was present and yet here you are in r conspiracy completely denying the possibility that there is any connection at all exhibit a folks ,45,conspiracy
get_it_together1,actually many of us think that the conspiracy with seth rich is not that the dnc had him assassinated and covered it up but that the gop russia and fox news have worked to push the aforementioned conspiracy based on no evidence and there is also a concerted effort to push this conspiracy both on this sub and in the msm via fox when damaging information comes to light both are conspiracies both conspiracies have support from the msm either fox breitbart infowars or cnn msnbc vox interesting times ,33,conspiracy

get_it_together1,you seem to use neoliberal as a catch all term for anything you want to denigrate i have never espoused any neoliberal policies so it not clear how you decided on the term to describe me ,3,conspiracy
get_it_together1,it was telling that the uncovered scripting ring was also targeting macron emails and the paris accord and after the ring was outed they deleted everything and then suddenly the number of actual users pushing a pro russian narrative seemingly multiplied or maybe i am just paranoid i also assume that the government does not want to talk about any of this openly because they do the same shit and so they do not want the voting infrastructure or our civil discourse hardened against outside attack because it would reduce their own influence ,9,conspiracy
get_it_together1,oh look it psyderr on hand to push a pro russian narrative imagine my surprise to see an ardent progressive such as yourself decrying a leak that makes russia look bad as fake news i know it coincidence but i seem to always run into you in these situations ,6,conspiracy

get_it_together1,you are right that this document does not prove collusion it does dispel a common talking point no evidence of a russian influence ,9,conspiracy
get_it_together1,we are discussing a document from the nsa discussing russian attempts to hack us election officials and you ask me to show who did the hacking the document also states that the hacking targeted us local government officials what is your point are you doubting the veracity of the document ,9,conspiracy
get_it_together1,yes this is most likely true it is also possible that the other leaks were done by an individual or set of individuals that are better at covering their tracks ,2,conspiracy
get_it_together1,it has nothing to do with trump it talking about russian attempts to actually hack into the infrastructure associated with us elections of course there have been a lot of people in here claiming that there was no evidence that russia tried to hack the election ,14,conspiracy
get_it_together1,it is no surprise that you are offended by a simple statement of the truth no doubt i will see you again as you continue to abuse the memory of seth rich against the express wishes of his family to push your own partisan political agenda ,1,conspiracy
get_it_together1,yes i get it you are gaslighting so clever there no evidence that rich was the whistleblower and at this point the family wishes you would stop abusing his memory to push your bullshit the only thing this demonstrates is that you have no respect for seth rich his family nor the laws of this country ,1,conspiracy

get_it_together1, quite a doozy even around here you are kidding right chemtrails atlantis random 4chan posts all get discussed here or held up as solid evidence but the idea that there is a financial quid pro quo based on trump financial ties to russia and trump actions to get rid of sanctions and otherwise please the russians is too much for you what sort of financial gain would trump get maybe a russian oligarch would buy a trump property at an inflated value http money cnn com 2016 07 27 news donald trump russian deal mansion index html it is funny that that you claim that these widely sourced facts trump working to benefit russia trump having strong financial ties to russia and questionable real estate deals involving russians that benefit trump get dismissed by you as vague allegations the two dots to connect trump working on behalf of russia and trump receiving financial gain from russia have a lot of supporting evidence ,3,conspiracy
get_it_together1,you changed the youtube video link you might not even be aware of it given how many people are taking advantage of the situation by reposting the video to take advantage of the situation after the parents posted their video they sent a cease and desist letter to fox news and they asked the conspiracy theorists to stop abusing the situation for their own purposes i am not the one here that has to worry about karma ,1,conspiracy

get_it_together1,the msm was constantly talking about hillary emails and her corruption scandals only in fox breitbart circles is the msm a media arm of the dnc of course since fox was explicitly run as the media channel for the gop it easy to see how they would assume that he rest of the msm is just the political inverse of fox news ,2,conspiracy
get_it_together1,that actually an interesting comparison there one key difference in my mind which is that there was significant dissent from the bush administration narrative and this dissent was public this resulted in the outing of valerie plame and the administration lies also tanked the career of colon powell there is nothing similar going on with the trump russia story so far as the public is aware the ic seems pretty united in blaming russia and suggesting trump russia collusion i have a hard time believing that the entire russian narrative is a fabrication of the deep state but that the operation is so completely airtight that not a blip has come out about it being falsified ,3,conspiracy

get_it_together1,the msm wants ratings trump fulfilled that demand during the primaries trump got massive amounts of airtime which helped him win the gop nomination even fox news gave him lots of airtime so the idea that trump was being elevated to hurt the gop seems suspect ,4,conspiracy
get_it_together1,the only claims your link supports are about pac collusion obama alleged votes stuffing in caucuses which incidentally is not voter fraud and wishing the bernardino shooter was white again i am not trying to argue that the dnc is clean but you are making a bunch of claims that are not supported this is similar to how the rich conspiracy is being pushed around here lots of misleading headlines and outright disinformation that nevertheless passes into common knowledge ,31,conspiracy
get_it_together1,i would argue the opposite that nobody that intellectually honest can conclude that the media treatment of trump and sanders was remotely similar the mainstream media elevated trump in the first place sanders got completely ignored while trump got hundreds of hours of free coverage during the primaries ,20,conspiracy
get_it_together1,no they do not that just what right wingers say about the emails you cannot actually find emails discussing anything more than general support for clinton no shit the dnc supports a democrat over an independent i am sure the dnc is corrupt in a general manner and i support efforts by progressives to try to take over from the corporate whores but that not what we are talking about ,40,conspiracy

get_it_together1, i was referring to the various assassination theories i have also read all the emails from the leak and the only thing i got from it was that the dnc supported hillary sanders camp said they also received questions from brazille so do you have any links to emails showing all of this massive corruption ,50,conspiracy
get_it_together1,assuming it actually indicated a shift in policy the repercussions would be enormous it would signal that germany considered the american ic as an enemy which would lead to a huge rift in our alliance even if it were just random mouthing off like trump does on nato even as his underlings try to reassure our allies it would still have an impact just look at the fallout from trump words on europe ,37,conspiracy
get_it_together1,yeah there one set of standards for hillary dnc a second set of standards for run of the mill conspiracies like chemtrails and then there russian level standards where trump personally admitting that he gave the russians intelligence and trump personally admitting he fired comey because of the investigation still counts as no evidence because those actions were totally legal because he the president ,78,conspiracy

get_it_together1,no my position is that the fda regulates all pharmaceutical clinical trials in fact here another trial http www nejm org doi full 10 1056 nejmoa061741 where they show that the vaccine prevents high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia this study was cut short because the review board determined that the vaccine was so effective that it should immediately be made available to everyone the mechanistic studies specifically detail how hpv causes cancer you seem to be the typical laymen redditor that assumes that correlation vs causation is some magical incantation that immediately invalidates any study you do not like in reality the causal link between hpv and cancer has been well studied we can focus on your claim that the fda or some other institution is preventing the drug companies from conducting further research that your straw man again back in reality drug companies have already conducted research showing that the vaccine prevents precancerous lesions i will leave it as an exercise for the student to go out and find studies where high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia are shown to develop into cancer ,1,conspiracy
get_it_together1,i am well aware of what comorbid means i chose it specifically because you are so hung up on correlation and so i wanted to be clear and accurate it not from my sources you also got the correlation precisely backwards when they find a cancer 90 of the time they find hpv technically you are right there could be some other factor causing the correlation between hpv and cervical cancer you are welcome to hypothesize so far you have only stated basic concepts presented to undergraduates and made gross factual errors you are teaching nothing how quickly your story changes above you were saying these were unethical i am not responsible for your lack of reading comprehension what i actually said was at some point the medical field considers it unethical to do prospective randomized studies when sufficient evidence exists that the treatment works as an extreme example consider a prospective randomized trial comparing insulin injections with just about anything else for the treatment of type i diabetes it is obviously unethical the fda does not plan studies but it does regulate all of them the regulatory infrastructure in the us requires irb approval for all human clinical trials you specifically said that pharmaceutical companies do unregulated research in reality all new pharmaceutical human research requires both fda approval and approval by an irb some people feel this is far to stringent and so there is talk of trying to roll back some of these regulations feel free to further educate yourself so as not to make an ass of yourself why is it that when people get backed into a corner and see that they are losing an argument that they resort to insults i am not losing an argument you completely failed to address the mechanistic studies underlying the causal relationship between hpv and cervical cancer you incorrectly inverted the correlation that you did point out and you falsely asserted that unregulated human research involving pharmaceuticals is a regular occurrence in the developed world the insult was in response to your own insulting condescension why do the ignorant always resort to such condescension ,1,conspiracy
get_it_together1, if this was true then what you quoted above about there being cervical cancer without hpv would not be true you are treating a correlation ie risk factor the way a cause is treated no that asinine coming back to smoking the existence of non smoking lung cancer does not impact the correlation of smoking and lung cancer nor does it say anything about the many mechanistic studies that have been done showing precisely how smoking causes lung cancer with hpv it even more extreme though while there is significant incidence of non smoking lung cancer hpv infection is comorbid with more than 90 of cervical cancers https academic oup com jnci article abstract 87 11 796 1141620 prevalence of human papillomavirus in cervical now this does not mean that every cervical cancer is caused by hpv nor does it mean that every case of hpv infection will cause cervical cancer or mouth and throat cancer if it an oral infection of course the mechanisms by which hpv cause cancer have been well studied http jvi asm org content 78 21 11451 short simply put persistent expression of hpv genes e6 and e7 leads to immortalization of epithelial cells enabling accumulation of oncogenic mutations until cancer eventually develops your statement about correlation and causation stems from your deep ignorance with regards to current knowledge about hpv and how it causes cancer you also seem unaware about the extent to which hpv and cervical cancer are correlated but that something else i am well aware about the difference between correlation versus causation it one of the key reasons that prospective randomized trials are so important they are one of the few things that can help establish causal factors and that why i linked to such a study that demonstrated that the hpv vaccine prevents cytological abnormalities that not how it works at all drug companies do lots of unregulated research all the time all of those studies are regulated by the fda if you are in the states it is illegal to conduct human pharmaceutical trials without informing the fda if you are aware of some place where unregulated human trials are taking place i would be interested in a link or a picture or anything because these facilities should be shut down however i doubt you are actually aware of what is taking place my mind has been blown i have never heard of the term regulatory capture s i will acknowledge that the pharmaceutical industry has done some horribly shitty things especially pushing opioids and hiding some clinical data that does not invalidate the entire medical research industry and i doubt that you would reject modern medicine being anti vax is just plain stupid smallpox is eradicated polio is no longer a threat measles mumps whooping cough all of these things have been dramatically reduced in incidence i have intimate knowledge of the development of medical devices while you are welcome to disregard clinical research if you get a stroke i would highly recommend you go to a stroke center and use ask for the state of the art clot retriever devices if you value brain function it not clear that you do ,3,conspiracy
get_it_together1,the study i linked explicitly looked for cytological abnormalities these are a precursor to cancer also there is no doubt about the correlation between hpv and cancer nor is there any real confusion about the mechanism you do not understand how research is conducted there is a regulatory body in every country that determines how studies get done if treatment is shown to be particularly effective the regulatory body will require the study be shut down and the treatment rolled out conversely poor treatments get shut down as well i have been involved with patient trials you are welcome to push anti vax or anti modern medicine views if you want and certainly medicine has made some severe mistakes most notably in treating pain shrug ,3,conspiracy
get_it_together1,the vaccine is relatively new the study i linked went on for 27 months and they did show that the vaccine presented cytological abnormalities associated with hpv longer term studies will be ongoing to continue to demonstrate efficacy but at some point the medical field considers it unethical to do prospective randomized studies when sufficient evidence exists that the treatment works the researcher linked to by the op sounds like a crank ,3,conspiracy

get_it_together1,clearly elements in the intelligence community are actively working to take trump out what is interesting is that they appear to be united in their efforts when bush and co were lying us into war on iraq there was dissent most notably plame and so outside observers could discern the outlines of a power struggle between competing ic factions trump might be complicit or he might just be a useful dupe there seem to be too many connections among his aides for it all to be nothing so what does that tell you you seem awfully interested in my perspective on that ,1,conspiracy

get_it_together1,i did not just say that obscenity laws are applied to the internet obscenity laws do not require intent to annoy abuse harass or threaten since your brain seems incapable of holding two separate clauses together at the same time you can just come away with this understanding that i do not agree with your claim that title ii applies obscenity laws to the internet that you have not proven this to be the case and that your entire argument hinged on ignoring the second and crucial clause which specifically requires intent to harass reading comprehension is clearly not your strong suit that explains why you keep making these fallacious claims and get downvoted in top level threads when you do so ,1,conspiracy
get_it_together1,that was not your original claim at all and yes obscene or lewd content that is sent with the intent to annoy abuse harass or threaten is criminalized you cannot just cut out half a sentence clause in a law and then base your understanding on that given your previous mistakes you will have to excuse me if i do not think your interpretation of the law is worth much consider i find your comments here to be intended to annoy that does not mean they violate title ii ,1,conspiracy
get_it_together1,i saw you originally posted the full language of the section of the law but you probably deleted it when you realized it was a federal law targeting interstate harassment and abuse and that it does not support your argument the prosecution has to prove intent to annoy abuse harass or threaten clinton was let off because they could not prove intent according to comey recommendation intent is crucial in determining which murder charges apply so this entire thread is based on your misunderstanding of the law first you completely ignored the intent clause then you separated the two to suggest that annoying content itself could be criminalized you still act like any random forum post or website can be prosecuted when the law is clearly designed to stop targeted harassment there is no way a reasonable person can read that entire section and conclude that it generally restricts lewd or obscene content ,0,conspiracy
get_it_together1,you are the one insisting that this is going to force broad censorship on the web which is patently false and now you are again demonstrating your ignorance of how the law works you just flipped intended to annoy abuse threaten or harass and changed it into this can be construed as annoying the law does not work like that you are clearly twisting words around and your original post does not even acknowledge the annoy harass part of the law and instead you insisted that this criminalized all lewd or obscene language only one of us is having reading comprehension problems you are still insisting that this goes far beyond harassment without any evidence or proof that anything of that nature has occurred you also say it also says annoying speech is illegal this is such an absurd reading of the law it specifically calls out lewd or obscene content intended to annoy or harass not any annoying speech i can see why you are so upset you look at all these individual words and think this criminalizes lewd content this criminalizes annoying content ,2,conspiracy

get_it_together1, with intent to annoy abuse threaten or harass another person you just completely gloss over the second half of that sentence to suggest that this criminalizes all obscene content so far as i can tell your reading of the law is completely wrong since it would criminalize porn and nobody is suggesting that the case it not just offensive language or content it language or content transmitted with the explicit intent to harass somebody maybe the law should have been a little more explicit but since you do not have any actual examples of this being used to restrict speech and neither of us are lawyers i guess we will have to wait for someone with actual legal experience or examples of title ii being used in a court of law to resolve the issue i do think that if this was as worrying as you say it is there would be examples of lawsuits ,5,conspiracy
get_it_together1,that is specifically about harassment it not about 1st amendment at all this sort of speech is already criminalized if i go start yelling obscenities at someone in public i could also be arrested maybe you are against all such laws but this is not anything special and you have not provided any evidence that this has been used to silence free speech there are still openly white nationalist and neo nazi sites online so what sort of speech do you think this regulation has curtailed ,1,conspiracy

get_it_together1, why do you think dems continually say they will act on things like civil rights and illegal immigration and then do not are you kidding dems have done a lot for civil rights our entire modern political landscape is based on the upheaval from the democratic party passing the civil rights act more recently you have one party trying to fight for equality for gay people and one party who is trying to explicitly disenfranchise black people dems also tried to push for bipartisan immigration reform with moderate republicans like rubio ha but the republicans all ran away as soon as they realized their base wanted to deport all the brown people same with the war on drugs it the blue and libertarian states that are trying to end marijuana prohibition while conservatives are trying to ramp up the old war on drugs most recently with sessions pushing for harsher sentences and trump policy proposals specifically cutting addiction recovery programs the war on terror was always bullshit we fund the saudis who fund the terrorists and most the hijackers were saudis and somehow we end up in afghanistan and iraq while continuing to fund the saudis without any public awareness of just how shitty our me policies have been ,10,politics

get_it_together1,ninja edit mkultra was shut down in the 50 so this would have to he referencing something later maybe the successor project fascinating this sounds like mkultra but an aspect of it who uncovered it that i have not seen much attention given to i know my university library had senate committee hearings you can go read when i first learned about this in the early 2000s the documentation online was sketch so i verified it there now it a mainstream and confirmed theory supposedly shut down i always figured they realized the mind control stuff was difficult and unnecessary compared to more mainstream mass population manipulation techniques i could be wrong though the documentation that i have read was heavily redacted and incomplete ,2,conspiracy
get_it_together1,yeah and all these individuals repeatedly spread the same misinformation in these conspiracy threads if you ever wonder why a lot of people are convinced that the whole seth rich conspiracy is mostly bullshit being pushed by political operatives it the share quantity of these easily falsified claims in just about every single seth rich thread ,2,conspiracy
get_it_together1, and considering it was a member of the dnc murdered with a gun you would think they would at least use it to promote gun control that lie again it was mentioned almost immediately afterwards by clinton in the context of gun control https www washingtonpost com news true crime wp 2016 07 12 hillary clinton invokes name of slain dnc aide seth rich in calling for gun control the murder was almost immediately politicized by conspiracy theorists at which point it would not make much sense for clinton to keep bringing it up ,2,conspiracy
get_it_together1,based on what gets passed around as evidence here i would be surprised if that was substantiated there were some anonymously sourced claims about the laptop from fox news but everyone knows that anonymous sources used by the msm is verboten around here so i am not including them especially since fox has had to retract some of their reporting and the agencies involved denied the claims ,1,conspiracy

get_it_together1,sorry if i came off hostile i have just seen a lot of this going on in the sub recently lot of misinformation and sometimes outright lies that just keep getting propagated you are one of the few people who actually edits their original post ,5,conspiracy
get_it_together1,by that standard which i think is a good one there is almost no circumstantial evidence whatsoever that supports the conspiracy all we know is that assange hinted that rich was the dnc leaker that it everything else is not substantiated ,2,conspiracy
get_it_together1,you do realize the irony of that in the context of your claims that you check everything your memory is just so bad that you accidentally remember connections that do not exist ,5,conspiracy
get_it_together1,yeah but this guy checks all his sources it all confirmed ,5,conspiracy
get_it_together1,everything that does not fit the narrative just becomes part of the conspiracy the conspiracy the dnc had rich murdered the family says there no proof please stop doing this it causes us pain if you have any evidence please contact us or the police conspiracy theorists respond ha that proof that the family is coerced corrupted in on the conspiracy i love it ,6,conspiracy
get_it_together1,your claim that seth recommended the man who downloaded voter data was a lie by checked the sources you mean you just make shit up and do not verify anything until people call you out for spreading misinformation ,14,conspiracy
get_it_together1,you know who investigates murders homicide departments like holy shit in what fantasy world do you live in that we should all be hiring private investigators to handle homicide investigations to show that we care ,13,conspiracy
get_it_together1,wikileaks immediately hinted at the conspiracy it was not an unbiased attempt at solving the murder you honestly wonder why the dnc is not thanking people for turning rich death and murder investigation into a partisan conspiracy theory that gotten so bad that the family is begging people to stop ,11,conspiracy
get_it_together1,the last time i brought that up someone literally responded with yeah but that was just one time not a whole campaign to politicize rich death like you would suspect it still fishy you just cannot win with these people every time there no evidence it just becomes evidence of a larger conspiratorial web one that has already grown to engulf the dnc the dc police and the fbi all to kill a low level staffer to send a message but without sending a message because they made it look like a random mugging turned violent sigh ,5,conspiracy
get_it_together1,nothing at all was happening on this until a couple of false reports put out by fox last week followed up by a lot of hype and then nothing from dotcom and now people are suggesting that fbi agents were in on the assassination bringing the total number of people involved to 3 or 4 just for the assassination itself ,22,conspiracy
get_it_together1,the only reason seth rich became national news for more than a minute is because of the conspiracy theories moreover why would you expect democrats to turn every murder of any dnc staff member into a major political operation for gun control in an election where gun control was not a major issue and it usually a losing one for dems anyhow ,0,conspiracy

get_it_together1,except they did clinton brought it up right afterwards jesus the number of lies around here is too damned high ,8,conspiracy
get_it_together1,so the idea is that they would shoot him a couple of times but not kill him and then have a doctor on call to kill him in a highly controlled environment without anyone noticing or being detected by an autopsy ,1,conspiracy
get_it_together1,the entire idea that the assassins would plan to shoot rich but then not have him die and instead have a doctor on call in the er where rich would be taken to kill him in the hospital is just ridiculously stupid ,2,conspiracy
get_it_together1,the evidence 1 assange hinted that rich might be the leaker 2 the mugger did not take anything after the mugging went south and rich got shit this means it was not actually a mugging since we all know that violent criminals always stick around to rob their still living victims after they shoot them 3 podesta brother wife friend is supposedly a doctor at the hospital where rich was taken still alive an emt told rich brother that he was surprised that seth died therefore this two pronged assassination required both the original assailant and had a back up plan whereby there was a doctor standing by to kill rich in the hospital if the original hit failed this is as stupid as the idea that the pizzagate shooter was actually a plant intended to shoot a harddrive through the wall to destroy evidence i was going to start getting into the twitter and reddit accounts but after writing about the theory with the supposed plan behind both having an initial gunshot and a doctor standing by to kill seth in the hospital i think i had a stupidity induced aneurysm the best part is that all of these conspiracists are too dumb to keep their email private because they have horrible it security and they have been compromised multiple times in multiple ways but they have managed to keep all information about this assassination locked up tight despite supposedly murdering a man in a hospital after shooting him but allowing him to live ,2,conspiracy
get_it_together1,they are trying to take over r conspiracy but they get a lot of pushback there it fascinating watching their alt reality as it develops so many completely bald faced lies in the comments about what is been proven plus the constant repetition that its all about to explode and take down the dnc then they outright say that the family wishes are not important and that we deserve access to all of the police data on the investigation or it a coverup all while claiming that rich proves the entire russia collusion conspiracy is a fraud perpetrated by the deep state these people scare me ,7,politics

get_it_together1,that might be because the sum of evidence with regards to seth rich is that assange hinted that rich was the leaker nothing else people have uncovered gets at the core of whether rich leaked to wikileaks everything brought up such as the laptop have been discounted by the organizations involved it possible that this conspiracy is so deep that the entire federal apparatus is trying to suppress it but that does not make much sense given that trump was given a lot of support from select elements within the fbi if you buy into the conspiracy you have to wonder if trump is in on it as well ,14,conspiracy

get_it_together1,i think i was clear that the situations are different and call for different responses i also never said i support war against russia also the sanctions are in response to aggression against a sovereign nation i thought you just said that russia is a world power now it just a poor little country we also fought the chinese in an actual war around the time they annexed tibet you also never answered the question instead preferring to shift the debate to historical comparisons because russia actions in ukraine and undermining fair elections are indefensible ,1,conspiracy

get_it_together1,you honestly think that expanding nato is the same as attacking a foreign country and annexing territory you are starting off from an absurd position russia today is not iraq in 1990 nor is it china of 1970 unless you are arguing that russia is so corrupt that it will starve to own citizens in response to sanctions what do you think the west should have done in response to crimea what should the west do now in response to election meddling by russia also sanctions are diplomatic they worked well with iran to enable the nuclear deal ,1,conspiracy
get_it_together1,i did not realize that you consider the former soviet block to still be part of russia that explains a lot when was the pact broken you just linked to a map and even the you think that the expansion of nato justifies russia attacking and annexing part of ukraine anyhow you simultaneously profess to lack awareness about what putin could hope to get out of electing a friendly us president while having deep knowledge of the history of russia and nato and hoping for relaxing of sanctions your assumed persona is incoherent ,1,conspiracy
get_it_together1,it is the motivated that control history the idea that the victors write history is a historical fallacy that gets discussed regularly over in r history by actually historians it is the educated and the writers of history that control the narrative in the us there was a concerted effort to rewrite the history of the civil war by the daughters of the confederacy to deprecate the importance of slavery as the fundamental cause of the war and it partially worked anyhow i think t d is deluded and using this as an excuse as if they would have cracked the case if only this had not happened ,0,conspiracy
get_it_together1,unless you live in eastern europe and russia is shitting all over you the sanctions were a direct result of hostile actions undertaken by russia against its neighbors both covert and overt i also am a fan of peace but russia is not peaceful in fact they are the aggressors sanctions seem like a reasonable compromise for punishing aggression without going to war ,1,conspiracy

get_it_together1,russia is suffering from sanctions imposed by the western world after the crimea annexation putin would love to have these removed more generally putin is trying to weaken western democracy since it stands opposed to his ambitions in eastern europe there are claims he was involved in brexit support for le pen he supported trump and probably jill stein with trump the collusion seems to have been through flynn to get sanctions removed that also explains tillerson who was ceo of a company that stands to make billions if sanctions are lifted there are also suggestions that it was personal that putin really hated clinton but i do not know about that the realpolitik of it is a far more obvious reason not that putin has not done some crazy shit for personal reasons before polonium tea did you honestly not understand the sanctions and putin desires to expand a russia as he did in crimea ,1,conspiracy

get_it_together1,the difference is in real world impact so let assume that pizzagate is real there have been no prosecutions no serious investigations that i am aware of either at the local state or federal level nobody resigned the only real world impact that i can see stemming from pizzagate is the guy who went in and shot up the restaurant this led to a hilarious bit of insanity which was the claim that the shooter was actually a plant used to shoot the hard drive of a computer through the wall in a restaurant that was not under investigation when they could have simply wiped the hard drive or thrown it away so if pizzagate is true it requires massive collusion across multiple levels of government without a single leak getting out moreover clearly there are agencies investigating arresting and prosecuting large sex trafficking and pedophilia rings so the conspiracy theory becomes that all of these agencies going after pedophilia rings are somehow complicit in pizzagate and the conspiracy is so well run that the only evidence we have is podesta emails where they were so meticulous in their use of codewords that even with access to a large collection of personal emails we have nothing beyond conjecture when it comes to trump russia even if we ignore everything else michael flynn alone is enough to form the basis of a conspiracy theory he was fired for his craziness he was known to associate with putin he was a paid contributor to russia times the trump administration was warned multiple times by multiple people that flynn was a foreign agent and under investigation yet trump still hired him and then lied about the circumstances of his firing ,2,conspiracy

get_it_together1,it interesting to consider the completely inverse nature of the pizzagate and the trump russia conspiracies with pizzagate we have a set of facts a picture of a handkerchief the location of a restaurant wikileaks emails with nonsense emails seemingly consisting of codewords these facts are woven into a narrative with trump russia we mostly have journalist claims but journalists are not often in the habit of releasing primary sources and the primary sources they discuss are not always readily available take this http www chicagotribune com news nationworld politics ct paul manafort russia ukraine 20170321 story html discussing manafort connections with ukraine i see that these documents were released somewhere but 60 seconds of googling did not turn them up nevertheless i believe they exist because this story is so obscure that there was no need for manafort to resign if there was no truth behind it who cares if some random ukrainian claims that manafort received money based on a documents unless there truth behind it so you are asserting the possibility that all of these connections are in fact based on false allegations with similarities to the prior red scare but that requires another large conspiracy which would require its own supporting evidence even trump after firing the fbi director over the russian investigation has now shifted to saying at least i know that i did not collude that is not the line of a man convinced that the russian allegations are baseless ,1,conspiracy

get_it_together1,so you do not know much about flynn the former nsa and key figure in the russian investigation and you think that sanctions on russia for their invasion of crimea itself an act of war are bad and you do not understand that all of these meetings between are documented and recorded including clinton meetings and that the problem with trump is that they did not disclose their meetings not that the meetings existed in the first place you are wildly speculating that clinton had a bunch of undisclosed meetings without any sources you are all for holding both sides accountable but do not think that there anything to account for in the russian investigation and yes the russia influence was largely legal except perhaps the dnc hack which is still unclear that does not change that if trump team coordinated with russia it would be collusion ,1,conspiracy
get_it_together1,the iraq war was the formative experience of my political awakening i am a few years older than you given that the entire nation was clamoring for war congress voted on the wishes of their constituents the people who tried to fight the narrative plame and the progressive wing of the democratic party lost i still support progressives and progressive policies in part due to that experience and i voted sanders then clinton i understand why you could not vote for clinton but surely you can also see why some of us would have chosen her over a republican president even a supposed outsider like trump as a side note trump bullshit and russia ties were also quite obvious almost nothing he promised was remotely reasonable and his central economic policies were an undisclosed plan to bring back coal and manufacturing jobs and a massive tax cut for the wealthy it felt like bush all over again ,2,conspiracy

get_it_together1,yes it could be argued that the acha is largely repealing the aca which is why conservative gop members in the house support it of course before the aca there were some 40 million people without health insurance and tens of thousands of people dying every year due to lacking healthcare access the gop argues that poor people do not deserve access to healthcare this is in line with the overarching conservative ideology that views poverty and illness as a moral failure on the part of the impoverished http www independent co uk news world americas republcan congressman mo brooks poor people no healthcare good lives subsidised alabama a7713371 html and sick http nymag com daily intelligencer 2017 05 republican sick people dont deserve affordable care html something does need to be done to improve healthcare and the simplest thing to do would be to expand the investment income tax to fully cover medicaid expansion so that states do not have to worry about paying for it there was some hope that long term access to healthcare would reduce expensive emergency room visits and thus reduce the overall cost of providing healthcare to poor people the expansion will pay for itself but it remains to be seen whether this will pan out the article you link cites a 2011 virginia study without linking to it that i have not seen and an oregon study that i have in fact read i know that the oregon study http www nejm org doi pdf 10 1056 nejmsa1212321 found positive but statistically insignificant improvements in all the physical parameters they were measuring reduced incidence of depression and it also demonstrated less financial stress for the people gaining access to medicaid the lack of statistical significance was partially attributed to the lower power of the study not many people enrolled had the measured disease states since the oregon study has an associated free access paper the lack of a link is suspicious the third study opens by claiming that the medicaid expansion wo not significantly impact the uninsured rate but even this highly critical article https www forbes com sites robertlaszewski2 2015 08 17 has obamacare really reduced the uninsured by 16 million and continued to show strong growth 40295d3633c6 of obamacare points out that the medicaid expansion accounts for a third of of the reduction in the uninsured rate i would also point out that one of the key improvements of the aca was eliminating life time limits and outlawing rescission where health insurers used to have departments dedicated to combing through medical histories to find excuses to kick people off of healthcare after they got seriously ill so simply pointing out that the majority of improvement in the uninsured rate came from increased employment does not capture the total impact of the law ,1,politics

get_it_together1, the examples that sandra gave to support her argument was of couples who wanted to have unprotected sex but could not due to lack of financial access to non barrier contraception although maybe you are saying that sandra was arguing a stupidly male centric position sandra gave three examples a married couple a girl with a disease treated by the pill and a girl who was raped this was not part of fluke argument to support her position moreover following this logic we should all be on prep right now in case we get raped and get aids from it that just wrong and the risk of getting pregnant is orders of magnitude higher than the risk of getting aids for obvious reasons moreover even there women are an order of magnitude more likely to contract aids from men than vice versa because of the biology of aids transmission what where did you get that from did you reply to the wrong comment i said that fluke was arguing that people have an entitlement to unprotected sex such that it needs to be fulfilled by society if there are barriers to access women are people according to simone de beauvoir when i say people i do not mean men unless i explicitely note otherwise pregnancy is very obviously a gender specific health issue i realize your argument is if you do not want to get pregnant do not have sex but this is a situation where the medical burden falls exclusively on women this is not meant to ignore that men could be forced to pay child support but that a separate issue if health insurance is going to pay for prenatal care and birth it is just common sense that it would also pay for the medicine that enables one to avoid getting pregnant most of the arguments people have put forward against this position are explicitly religious in nature and the rest are some variations of rush limbaugh sluts position yours included although it is a little odd that now the aca directly encodes birth control as the responsibility solely of women by only covering contraceptive healthcare for women the only two choices for male birth control right now are condoms and variants and vasectomies i agree that these should have been covered in the aca but surely you can imagine that the backlash to free or subsidized condoms would have been even more severe than the backlash against the pill ,1,politics
get_it_together1,you just pulled numbers out of your ass you have no idea to what extent gender and sex are synonymous in the literature and moreover you just admitted that it does not even matter if academics are now studying gender as a social construct since you have decided that all such study is political and thus moot ,-2,ImGoingToHellForThis

get_it_together1,for one equating an entitlement for birth control with an entitlement for unprotected sex is a stupidly male centric way of looking at it since many women use birth control as a means to control pms second condoms do not work all the time and they do not protect against rape third are you really going to start arguing that all gender specific health issues should not be covered by health insurance and finally subsidized birth control just plain makes monetary sense since it helps poor women avoid having children that would otherwise cost additional government resources it a win win as women have more control over their lives and we do not have to subsidize children in poverty ,13,politics

get_it_together1,no it not every time somebody tries to use the hard problem of consciousness to reject physicalism they end up with either weird dualist propositions eg that consciousness is not physical but it is caused by the physical and it itself has no causative powers over the physical or they end up proposing something like what is in this article a panpsychism whereby all matter is conscious but then without bothering to explain how this conscious matter is anything more than a semantics game as it adds nothing new to physical theories ,9,philosophy

get_it_together1,some people are insisting that the sale of a single stock is completely irrelevant and has no impact and others insisting that the market cap does in fact change during the instant of the sale and that this is somehow interesting the difference is whether the price is based on current ask bid or whether price is based on the last sale the only thing you have to go on is your insistence on a definition of price that is not available online and is only found in some textbook whose name you forget to mention the fact that you have to resort to ad hominem as an excuse not to back up your assertion says enough ,0,investing

get_it_together1,the market is more complicated than that since there are standing orders at different prices https en wikipedia org wiki market depth media file market depth jpg while a quote might be the last transaction the price is determined by the current orders on the market people are getting confused thinking that the quote and the price are the same when the price is forward looking while the quote is historical ,1,investing
get_it_together1,your definition is obviously asinine and you wo not find anything to back up the idea that the bid ask spread is determined by the last sale a bid ask spread is two numbers and their difference not the single price of the last transaction there are standing orders for just about any stock and it is the difference between standing sell and buy orders that determines the bid ask spread since the sale of a single stock wo not move the bid ask of any decently large corporation the sale of a single stock wo not change the market capitalization even for a moment similarly you wo not find anything to back up your supposition that the price is the last transaction as opposed to the current bid ask ,-1,investing
get_it_together1,everywhere i look i see that the price is the current price at which a share can be bought or sold nowhere do i see the definition you are attempting to use here which is that the price of a stock is the price of the last transaction in other words the price is determined by the bid ask spread it just so happens that in normally functioning markets the last transaction and the bid ask are essentially the same and so the last transaction is used as an easy single number that can be used to monitor trends over time ,1,investing

get_it_together1,if at any point we reject the idea that consciousness can be fully described as an emergent property of complex physical systems we are left with the difficult proposition of describing the non physical entity mind and its ability to influence the physical world all attempts to do so have been unsatisfactory this is why the mind body problem is hard there are a lot of people who say my subjective experience is not reductive who are yet incapable of pointing out an alternative leaving us in stalemate chalmers insistence that consciousness cannot be reduced is belied by the extreme correlation of consciousness with physical events dualists are left trying to figure out where along the development of an embryo consciousness pops into existence and why a particular physical structure should suddenly create or call into being or attract this mental substance and what the mental substance even is panpsychists and monists who insist that consciousness is not reductive are left with trying to describe what exactly they mean by the property of consciousness reductionists are left trying to explain how subjective experience arises from neuronal firing or other complex systems the idea that once we have a perfectly functional understanding of the relationship between neuronal events and conscious experience that there will still be something left unexplained qualia feels unsatisfactory to me but then i find the entire concept of p zombies ridiculous it essentially boils down to imagining two identical systems and then insisting that although identical one system has something extra that cannot be defined and has no practical effect it is simply another name for a soul as for science breaking down i was simply pointing out that our current understanding holds pretty solid for subatomic particles through to general chemistry but at the level of cell biology we encounter gaps in our understanding and find that there is still much work to be done these gaps only grow as we attempt to analyze more complex systems and it is in such a gap in the science of consciousness that most non reductive theories of consciousness play i did not mean that functionalism breaks down at cell biology just as i do not think it breaks down at consciousness the idea that functionalism breaks as soon as a neuronal mass grows sufficiently complex always struck me as absurd ,2,philosophy
get_it_together1,you are aware that chalmers attempts to explain p zombies tends towards ascribing a hitherto unknown property of consciousness to all physical matter yes it possible that the mind body problem is so difficult because we have not yet found this unknown property but it also possible that it complex because brains are exceedingly complex and our science starts to break down somewhere in cell biology ,3,philosophy

get_it_together1,1 yes the united states also has regular beef and ground beef in the supermarket that only lasts for a few days even ground beef that contains pink slime will only last for a day or two and does not contain preservatives or additives 2 pink slime is literally just residual beef trimmings processed to remove fat and treated with ammonia to kill bacteria it ends up in cheap hot dogs and as filler in other cheap products including some cheap fast food these companies are still required to post nutritional values for their products 3 pink slime is as food related as it gets in the past people would not have the luxury of throwing away the fatty parts they would have eaten all of it now not only do we not eat fatty parts we can process the fatty parts to extract residual lean protein components it makes sense to require this to be labeled but in terms of health risks cured meats are likely to be far more dangerous than pink slime ,2,news

get_it_together1,no i am not particularly surprised that r conspiracy has become a haven for the right wing it more of an amusing observation at this point many right wing pro trump people are pro russian since it damned near impossible to be pro trump and anti russian as a side note i am not sure you understand the concept of forum sliding since it not clear what political operation is trying to slide r politics and what they are trying to distract from with this post ,1,politics
get_it_together1,sorry i should have specified that the posts pointing out the obvious connections with russia get downvoted now that flynn just resigned there plenty of people hypothesizing that it because of the deep state because the sanctions are bullshit etc the top upvoted page is simply a link to an article describing the resignation and the top comment points out that he thought the whole thing was nonsense until flynn actually resigned the second comment is pointing to additional news stories and the third comment is pointing out that all the posts in r conspiracy trying to talk about flynn and the russian connection got buried i do not know why r conspiracy is so explicitly right wing but at this point the russian connection is so readily apparent paul manafort carter page now flynn that one has to conclude that r conspiracy has been infiltrated by pro russian operatives ,1,politics

get_it_together1,the common gop rhetoric is to cut the quote in half and then criticize her for it which is exactly what you did and yes if you cut the quote in half it looks like irrational bullshit which is why the gop did it so frequently i guess you feel proud for your contributions to the conversation ,1,politics
get_it_together1,your original response only mentioned the half of the response that gets commonly thrown around by republicans then you had to double back and explain that you did not find any meaning in the second half of the quote that you originally ignored despite the fact that the meaning was obvious in the context of the debate around the aca could she have worded her original statement more clearly sure did she actually say that nobody understood the bill no you are welcome to continue using standard gop rhetoric to attack pelosi for something she said 6 years ago though if that what does it for you ,1,politics
get_it_together1,it is no way doublespeak since every part of that clause has a clear meaning it a pretty clear quote which is why everyone always cuts the quote off mid sentence to create a false impression of what she was trying to say ,4,politics
get_it_together1,you literally just ignored the second half of her quote cutting it off mid sentence to create a false implication that is entirely not what she said which was pointed out in a post that you replied to at this point it safe to say that you are being intentionally disingenuous ,5,politics
get_it_together1,i already pointed out that this rhetoric was used because it honestly pointed out that the other side was lying shamelessly about basic facts if you are saying that the gop will dishonestly use the same rhetoric and so the democrats should not have used the rhetoric then you may as well say that democrats should stop doing anything because the gop will lie about it ,5,politics
get_it_together1,so in my example i pointed out that the gop lied shamelessly and repeatedly about basic facts making it impossible to have a reasonable debate if there was a bill being debated in which democrats repeatedly lied about basic facts to derail the public discourse i would expect the gop to use the same rhetoric it is far more likely though that the gop will lie about basic facts and then use their own lies to justify passing bills trump is already doing this with his executive orders ,13,politics

get_it_together1,iran does not have spare capacity they can drill more to increase their production capacity since their investment has been low due to sanctions but it not like a few decades ago when saudi arabia and opec was intentionally pumping less oil to control the market right now every oil producer in the world is producing just about at capacity and many countries cannot even drill enough to keep up with declines in their existing wells in other words it will take years for them to bring online additional capacity to impact the market ,2,politics
