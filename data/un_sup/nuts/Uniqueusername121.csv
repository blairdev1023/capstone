Uniqueusername121,it essential that people who are unaware of their hypocrisy regarding trump and tacit approval of obama be faced with it until americans look squarely at their own complicity in this behavior it will continue i made it clear that trump is terrible but nowhere did you make it clear that obama was too and that allows neo liberals to continue to believe they are progressive when they are not that was the whole point of my original comment and the whole reason why it got so many downvotes because americans refuse to face what they really are because there are innocent people dying the poorest most defenseless and most subjugated people on earth while we argue over whether it wrong if the guy doing it has a d or an r after his name and for you to say that because obama is no longer in office his actions are irrelevant is the height of that dismissal of complicity americans need to be held to the mirror hard so that we can see what our imperialist deep state warmongers will do in the service of their lavish lifestyles ,1,facepalm
Uniqueusername121,ok let get real bush bombed 4 countries obama expanded that to 7 http www politifact com punditfact statements 2014 sep 25 ryan lizza lizza says obama has bombed more nations bush and while congress did rubber stamp all the bombing the president is the commander of the military presidents drone bomb people but only congress can declare war so they just never declare war and still kill whoever they want obama had a democratic congress for two years and made no effort to end the droning he expanded it i do not understand why the truth makes people angry it just truth ,1,facepalm
Uniqueusername121,so to be clear you debate the point but then say it irrelevant those two things cancel each other out so which is it and when you brag about the healthcare that your country has that supports my point about obama you know the point that you said was irrelevant and do excuse my confusion when you defend obama for doing the exact same things for which you are criticizing trump that confusing for the reader the clear inference being that you do have love for obama that what defending somebody bad behavior is saddest of all is that you ignore everything about the dying innocent people all over the world because they only matter if trump is killing them apparently i am bowing out of this conversation it really hard to debate with someone who says something and then uses condescension and gaslighting i never said that as their primary methods particularly when it right there in writing for everyone to see exactly what was said like trump does edit a phrase,1,facepalm
Uniqueusername121,what is that actually your defense to the fact that our government has been killing innocent people for ever so does that mean we just pretend like obamacare never existed because his policies are no longer relevant since he no longer president i mean if we are going to ignore the things he did wrong certainly we should ignore the things he did right to be fair obamacare was a handout to the pharma and insurance industries just like obama handed money over to billionaires his entire two terms but people like you believe obamacare is good and it is something it just not enough whataboutery to help you come face to face with your own hypocrisy is absolutely essential for you to see that the entire government is engaging in murder of some of the poorest and weakest civilians on earth as horrible as trump is he the only one who trying to evade world war the cia and deep state gets richer and richer off of manufacturing bombs to kill people who are defenseless fact is if something is wrong it wrong it does not matter if your pet politician did it or somebody that you have been told is the devil himself killing innocent people is wrong edit and i am talking about obama so saying that nobody is talking about him is not accurate i am right here talking about him edit 2 changed your to the ,1,facepalm

Uniqueusername121,i am curious how do you expect school systems to pay for quality teachers if their local governments have poverty stricken families as their tax base moreover lots of people struggle with averages 60 k per student is an average take the total budget and divide by number of students that where that number comes from it meaningless as to which children are getting what resources and failing we wo not even approach the discussion as to whether the test of failure is valid in the first place but here a hint it not i am also not saying that 60 k is or is not a bloated number what i am saying is you cannot give the same amount to the ghetto and beverly hills the ghetto has greater needs you took my fire dept point far too literally what do you say to the fact that when the poorest children inundate the high performing schools with resources it drags those schools down the point was if you fund according to need you do not have to drive the children all over the county to these performing schools for that matter why not move all the teachers at these high performing schools to the low performing schools and vice versa then if it that simple why move the children all over the district of course their parents will choose the high performing schools so then it not really a choice anyway edit show me the data you are citing so i can be certain it was funded by an unbiased source brookings institution showing voucher students did worse https www brookings edu research on negative effects of vouchers ,1,conspiracy
Uniqueusername121,respectfully you are 100 wrong and here why schools are in general funded by localities states and federal gov do not fund public schools local taxes do that why schools are so much better in rich communities than poor ones because the resources are just generally more plentiful for the rich they can afford it let recall that it not evil or wrong to be poor now if you allow for school choice then all these poor children will ultimately bring themselves to these rich schools that are performing well remember due to all those resources then the rich schools are stretched for resources and begin to perform as the poor schools did in the first place because the performance is not due to anything other than a lack of resources in general in the entire community kids who do not eat breakfast do not perform as well on tests and poor kids are less likely to have breakfast than rich ones that pervades the entire learning experience every day instead federal and state taxes need to be diverted into these poor community schools it simply taxing the rich to help the poor school choice just brings down everybody as opposed to bringing up everybody by simply fairly allocating the resources if you were to replace the words public schools with fire department you would see why school choice is silly why would you give vouchers to people to choose their fire department when if you just simply funded all the fire departments correctly according to their need it would not be necessary for one well funded fire department to drive all over the place putting out fires ,1,conspiracy

Uniqueusername121,i am not sure if you are being sarcastic but i am pointing out that if they are sharing a meal how upset really can ellison be at perez perhaps this is all a fiction for us to pick a side and invest our time and attention into while the true fight for power takes place at the nsa and white house it the wp for gods sake edit plus they had a meal together knowing full well they would be seen what was the point of that i am seriously asking because none of what is reported in wp or nyt is accidental ,2,WayOfTheBern

Uniqueusername121,politely also i believe you must have not understood my points then so to clarify my main point is that while you may be correct that trump ignited the base the base is a small minority of total americans the next point is that while you may be correct that he blew his primary opponents out of the water his opponents were likely chosen by the establishment just to make trump look better you admit that election fraud played a role in the presidential election i simply pointed out that fraud was used widely by democrats eg electronic rigging the popular vote but smartly by repubs eg electronic and other rigging the electoral college my points about sanders are relevant because you mentioned the fraud which is why he was not the candidate in the first place you will notice i placed your statement in each paragraph above then stated my point if you are still confused can you demonstrate how these are not applicable ,2,WayOfTheBern
Uniqueusername121,only 25 of americans identify as republican so you are talking about a favorite of 1 in 4 who excited his base trump blew out his primary opponents because they were horrible non centrist options cruz really the guy the entire congress hates why would they choose him republicans only represent 1 4 of the population yet they dominate the positions of power this most certainly is due to election rigging including smarter rigging in nov 2016 when you say the country was not interested in a kasich you are wrong sanders just got a following more quickly and most certainly had trump beat as it was awful hillary almost beat trump so it not correct to say that trump ignited anything in a majority of americans unfortunately for repubs the mood of the country is headed left people are tired of a gov that figured out how to feed itself and fuck everyone else if election rigging were corrected our gov would be filled with social dems and would have been a long time ago the moment is here and trump is not the big story he just louis xiv at la bastille ,1,WayOfTheBern

Uniqueusername121,omg this will be my last response because you are being dense on purpose of course congress has the right to revoke a law that was not my question my question was should they revoke those laws simply because there are too many laws because that is the premise you are defending you wrote an article and posted it for people to read and give their opinions either take the feedback and be grateful for it or do not if you want to grow as a writer and be worth listening to as a commentator then you will take the free feedback you are being given and learn something from it if you do not you will end up with plenty of influential and intelligent people who could not care less what you have to say and would never recommend your blog i know you have come dangerously close to losing this one and if you do not care about that then your future as a writer is already decided ,2,WayOfTheBern
Uniqueusername121,the judiciary was created to discuss the merit of policies that what checks and balances is i think you have completely misunderstood my point about minimum wage if a democratically elected body made a law a later elected body cannot arbitrarily revoke that law just because there are too many of them that makes no sense change minimum wage in for rape and it a lot easier to understand should rape laws simply be revoked because there are too many laws and they want to make more of course not which is why repeal two for every one is asinine it a poor blog article you need to do a lot more research before you can make the claims you do in order to present a point that is defensible simply make an attempt to present both sides to the argument and even then i could give it more credit until then i cannot recommend reading it ,2,WayOfTheBern

Uniqueusername121,sorry but i do not agree first there are plenty of americans that agree with the order in fact some very smart people agree that the powerful want us to fight to allow immigration so that we continue to have greater job competition benefiting the corporations looking for people to settle for less and less compensation other than to point out that it ridiculous to be angry about refusal to allow immigrants into the us without being angry that our government bombs foreign countries creating refugees in the first place i wo not go into my own opinion in the order itself because that is to me the entire point get us as angry as possible over these id politics issues so that the powerful read rich do not have to deal with the fact that americans are waking up to their own enslavement this is why i used the words shocking twist of the knife because that is exactly what the muslim order is while i think it comes from a genuine lack of knowledge from trump i think the powerful have used it as a distraction and excuse for outrage and will continue to do so i say this respectfully i promise your words not to be nit picky are the entire point it exactly what they want us to do it just repackaged literally hitler from the clinton campaign meant to suck in more of us to the argument they want us to be having and i will leave it to the neo libs who voted for her to object to the ban because they are loudly and vehemently no matter what extremely important information they have to ignore and the people who like the ban and voted for trump because they believed it would fix their lives will be angry with those neo libs and the powerful get exactly what they want the argument over the id politics they have been stoking forever to continue forever and the poor get poorer and more of us get poor while the powerful get richer i would like us progressives to rise above that fray and it is a distinction that is extremely difficult to parse because the elites want us to keep having the same debate in the same parameters they have set for us i want us to stop doing that and i believe spud original post is the best way to keep our eyes on what matters lest we end up spinning our wheels some more just like they want us to the economic argument is the one it the one they want us to ignore so badly they will put anything in front of us to very upset about that is precisely why i lumped it in there because i believe that is exactly the point of it while you of course do not have to agree i do hope you understand why i put that sentence in the post i believe it is only the most shocking act so far but it wo not be the last ,7,WayOfTheBern
Uniqueusername121,i respectfully disagree the point in the video is that if the government can determine that if someone can be compelled by law to bake a cake even if it goes against their personal beliefs then the same can be done to me so an example would be a homosexual person would be forced to bake a cake for a homophobe or that news organizations must by law broadcast the views of nazis neither should be compelled by law there are plenty of cake bakers but that does not preclude one from stating the facts opinion that so and so indeed refused to bake a cake and is a homophobe or the converse and encourage boycotts the issue is when the state involves itself and is an example of why it not always ideal for it to do so it is regressive to compel through legislation behavior which is better left to humans to sort on their own especially when said behavior is tied up in religious freedom it really is easy to see when flipped this way that just because we believe we are on the right moral side so do the people whose religion says homosexuality is wrong and equally so with no less of a right to think it and behave accordingly that what freedom is it just does not necessitate involving the state and law will never take the place of educating people ,2,WayOfTheBern

Uniqueusername121,i hope it not coming across that i agree with rejecting refugees it mostly that i feel like some of us progressives are allowing ourselves to get caught up in these media fueled issues that are meant to distract us from the economic ones and decisions like this were optically beneficial to all the parties involved except of course the immigrants ,1,WayOfTheBern
Uniqueusername121,it a total joke to choose this pick to object to of all the horrible choices please give up now warren before your credibility is complete gone ,7,WayOfTheBern

Uniqueusername121,i am a woman so i have plenty of female friends my point was that he not wrong that women do want a man to act like a man or a better way of putting it is act like person with ideas and opinions who can engage and not treating women like a vending machine that you ply with nice guy tokens and compliments in order to extract sex ,2,niceguys

Uniqueusername121,i am genuinely interested to hear what you did last summer when the popular vote was stolen from sanders voters let look at it another way if clinton had won the electoral college and trump the popular vote would you have posted this because if not you are not advocating for voters rights you are advocating for your candidate which by all means is your prerogative but call it what it is because it not election fraud it disingenuous to say that clinton was robbed of her rightful position but not sanders to whom the exact same thing happened or more the point their voters as for fptp sure it not ideal but it a worthless fight when you have proprietary software running the voting machines software written by a company that donated to the clinton campaign and people like scott fovel hired to bus homeless people into districts to vote for the preferred candidate which he admitted to on video with blatant fraud like this happening and i have not even mentioned greg palast voter purges fptp is little more than a distraction as for the duopoly that was created by the parties themselves specifically in order to limit our choices that said i am not looking to argue with you in your fight because it a worthwhile one progressives like me and neo liberals like you are going to have to come to the uncomfortable understanding that we need each other to create a majority if we want to prevent trump and a republican congress from turning back time on 40 years of social progress but we also can no longer as a party ignore the lack of economic progress our chosen candidates have made because it the poor who are paying the price for our social progress and that not great either and while we are splintered they swooped in in hopes of draining the swamp it too bad that was a false promise ,1,TopMindsOfReddit
Uniqueusername121,be gentle with me for this question because i do not know much about this issue i have been taking a break from the unfettered nausea since trump took office anyway so is this just one of those social issues that does not really cost the people who refused to vote against it immigration after all simply helps the rich capitalists by increasing competition for jobs that puts this whole thing on its head those who voted with trump can be seen as heroes to the uneducated masses at minimal cost to the rich corporate types who own everyone while those who do refuse to vote with trump and want to allow the immigrants into the country also get to look like heroes to us progressives while maintaining the inflow of workers which ultimately helps corporate bosses this is a win win for everybody in washington and wall street if you congresspeople vote right down partisan lines you keep your constituents who chose you happy while the corporations still have their employment competition etc insights welcome ,1,WayOfTheBern
Uniqueusername121,so those of us who had to work that day and could not be there cannot become president misogynist ,11,CringeAnarchy
Uniqueusername121,op was rude first but he lost his mind ,4,CringeAnarchy
Uniqueusername121,so then to be clear you did act when this exact thing happened to sanders and you advocated for his disenfranchised voters in the midst of the primary with no malice i would be very interested to hear what you did last summer in detail to advocate for sanders voters for example when clinton received the same number of delegates in nh where sanders won the popular vote looking forward to hearing more about what you did as i am interested in getting more involved and could use some ideas because advocating for your own candidate but not the candidate preferred by the people is not fighting to fix the broken system it fighting to get one way and that a very different animal ,1,TopMindsOfReddit
Uniqueusername121,it great and i am reading thank you your efforts are not going unnoticed ,2,WayOfTheBern
Uniqueusername121,he not exactly wrong though ,-36,niceguys
Uniqueusername121,this will probably be a controversial post but in 2012 propaganda was legalized i think whatever the powerful want us to believe is where we should be unflinchingly scrupulous about its sources my point is this enough scientists have cried about the future of earth that i know our species is in jeopardy so i am not saying i doubt climate change i also know it legal to tell us anything our capitalist oligarchs want us to believe i also know that plenty of university research is funded by corporations and that tells me that there may be some research that is biased or misleading it seems like these issues are always a game of inches bernie lost by a bit of dnc cheating trump won by a few votes in the right states it only takes a little bit of misinfo to take hold to create massive movements of people my ultimate point is this we need to be very carefully analyzing the sources of our information including our research universities and think tanks because if they are funded by corporations there is the opportunity for fraudulent information to take hold and then people get so magnetized to these ideas that it becomes ludicrous to suggest the opposite a la vaccines which i am not arguing but is it not ludicrous to suggest it among most people i am encouraging critical thinking so i hope that is clear i do not doubt the official truth that the earth is in trouble at all i just think we need to analyze each of the sources specifically when most of us myself included have come to our climate change beliefs through msm to at least some degree ,2,WayOfTheBern
Uniqueusername121,yeah everybody interacts with other people all the time for lots of reasons but afterwards do you post about it in social media because that how this is different and the downvotes are not because every guy who talks to a woman wants sex but if you post about it on facebook then you wanted something you do not write about it on social media if she was an ugly troll you were never interested in that why the downvotes you are just not right this time ,2,niceguys
Uniqueusername121,but if you are so concerned about the people voice being heard then you would care whether it a law or not right i mean that what laws are for after all and they come from people who fight for them to be changed based on what the people will is unless it really that you just care because it now happened to you and not because you care what the people really wanted sanders almost won with 45 of the vote and that was with the not illlegal cheating ,1,TopMindsOfReddit
Uniqueusername121,we already have ,2,WayOfTheBern
Uniqueusername121,i have been away from the sub for a few days and by away i mean checking 2 times instead of all damn day because i have reached mass saturation from this exact thing while i feel there are reasons to be be dejected and i am i think the more bs trump ignites the quicker we get the liberals on board my newest mantra when reading about progressive protesters they are not f ing progressives what i mean is i have been so disappointed in the americans who have suggested we fight trump at every turn but this is a good thing they are liberal at heart after all if they are watching and seeing what the establishment dems are really doing they will get on board with us in a hurry right ,1,WayOfTheBern
Uniqueusername121,u sebastiandoyle answered your question below fyi have a great evening ,6,WayOfTheBern
Uniqueusername121,wow this is excellent news as it is a switch up for her keep it up tulsi ,2,WayOfTheBern
Uniqueusername121,it really is what i do not get is why there are all these attempts at censorship ideas do not go away just because people object to the ideas what that means is if a person is behaving poorly because they know that there will be no consequences due to being a woman then there will be victims and bystanders who have opinions about it this is the outlet for those opinions to suggest that those opinions should not be aired in any forum this one included is the antithesis of free speech the airing of the issues is the only way to deal with them trying to shut them up will still never make them go away this is what i do not understand about the bigger issues like sexism or racism sexist and racist ideas exist and they always will discussion and debate are the only way to actually do anything about them not censorship ,4,pussypassdenied
Uniqueusername121,sure that happened and it probably been said but she should have said yes i am on food stamps i am poor i have applied for work for 18 months now and cannot find any how is that my fault ,1,thatHappened
Uniqueusername121,i think it too funny you say that guy is the one with psychic powers ,2,RealGirls
Uniqueusername121,so glad you are so concerned about this we should look at the primaries first right since the actual favored candidates should be determined before we worry about trump ,-10,TopMindsOfReddit
Uniqueusername121,again perhaps but these assumptions cannot be made to put our human stamp on animals is something we do but it does not mean it accurate the discussion is moot because we cannot know and using well it more likely than not logic is equally effective either way humans have a really hard time understanding this but it simply the way it is ,1,funny
Uniqueusername121,somebody needs to send this dude a picture of themselves in an extremely unflattering look and ask him out are these guys capable of learning ,1,niceguys
Uniqueusername121,i read it but it makes no sense at all that a man would whine about this on facebook if he was not interested in her simply saying it a sensitive subject reveals his insecurity because it not sensitive at all nobody cares that he an uber driver but him she proves that by grabbing his hand because she sees his insecurity he could have walked away from the conversation at any time what was she strongwoman your version of the story is easily revealed to be silly guy sees random group of ugly girls posing for picture guy gets crazy in front of women he has no interest in and jumps in front of the camera he had no interest in pursuing anything further obviously because who at a bar to meet people she grabbed his hand which he hated thats why he mentioned it on fb as he walked away and initiated conversation he being polite replied to her and conversationally danced with her for a while because guys converse at length with girls they are not into you are right about the last part he was not looking to spend more time with her but it was because his ego was hurt by a girl he was into so he put her down on facebook last if he was not into her he a turd to post on fb about how he rejected her ,3,niceguys
Uniqueusername121,while that true since there is no way to study animal experience it means it equally likely an animal may not experience emotional intensity at all ,1,funny
Uniqueusername121,if he did not want the conversation why was it a sensitive subject why was he photobombing her how did he come to find out what she does for a living they were in a conversation clearly and he got insecure because she was a professional and he is not which is not a big deal clearly she liked him his insecurity about his professional life got in the way if he did not care at all about this woman and she was forcing him to converse why would he go post about it on facebook sometimes you can flip the genders to prove your point but this is not one of those times ,3,niceguys
