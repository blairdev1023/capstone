Wargala,universal health care coverage insurance companies completely eliminated from the equation everyone pays x of their income regardless of where it comes from job investments retirement accounts etc i mean everyone poor people rich people people on welfare etc only people eligible are us citizens and legal residents legal immigrants for example universal health care coverage agency forces renegotiation with drug manufacturers hospitals etc to get the lowest price possible complete medical malpractice lawsuit revamping no more 10 million judgements for honest mistakes by doctors however you can sue if there malice or gross incompetence program must be self sustaining no adding to our national debt while we are at it welfare reform require people to work towards a job and if none found work for the government until you find one government buildings need cleaning offices moved etc this was just 5 minutes off the top of my head it not that difficult it just getting rid of the corruption within congress to actually get shit done ,5,QuotesPorn

Wargala,because why should they get free healthcare not pay a single penny in premiums or higher taxes stiff the hospital for the bill this is fairly common according to nurses and doctors i talked to when my wife was hospitalized waiting for our son to be born and skip out if you want healthcare you have to pay for it hospitals doctors nurses equipment drugs everything costs money if you do not want to get health insurance you cannot bitch about a massive hospital bill if you want to game the system you get no sympathy from people like me who play by the rules case in point if you talk to legal immigrants you will find they hate illegal immigration more than trump supporters they followed the rules they paid the massive fees waited their turn in line only to see someone else come on in enjoy what america has to offer and cheated their way in same thing here ,1,QuotesPorn

Wargala,because everyone needs to pay into it and not everyone does you are equating healthcare with health insurance not the same thing if you want everyone else to be healthy then you better start with strictly enforcing everyone paying into the system but let ask a better question why is is ok to involve insurance companies at all they add cost and complexity between the hospital and their patients why is it ok to charge middle class people like me significantly more money and stunt our financial growth to help people who clearly do not want to help themselves ,4,QuotesPorn

Wargala,and now we are playing clean up on the mess he left you do not think that the implosion of the economy and no one went to jail while bonuses were still handed out to executives while we bailed them out is at all a bit suspicious it not just debt rising under him it debt doubling that is completely unacceptable if he had a problem he just threw money at it now you and i are on the hook for it it should infuriate you ,1,MarchAgainstTrump
Wargala,not until you respond to mine ,1,MarchAgainstTrump

Wargala,if obama can blame the bush administration for longer than a year after he took office then my points stand ,0,MarchAgainstTrump
Wargala,oh sure my family is starting to pour in as well so i will be afk for a bit i think my frustration is compounded because i also hold republicans equally responsible for their fuck ups 20 million emails magically gone during bush administration i hold all my fellow americans especially leadership to a higher standard and when i see partisan bullshit i call it out no need to thank me for the service though the thanks though is appreciated i went for my own selfish reasons after 9 11 wanted blood revenge etc but it always nice to hear to be fair though i live by the motto of if you do not like the way things are being done then do something about it or shut the fuck up so i am actually going to run for office in 2020 i imagine i will lose the election but never know until you try besides i am quite sure i will either be one of the most popular politicians in my district or one of the most hated i call bullshit tell people to their face and stand by my principles so it will be interesting ,1,MarchAgainstTrump
Wargala,not sure if you noticed but your boy obama doubled our debt in 8 years so you cannot complain about trump spending without looking like a hypocrite for not also pointing out obama let assume you are right with 600 million obama spent 10 trillion trillion let that sink in ,0,MarchAgainstTrump
Wargala,funny how you glossed over all my other points ,0,MarchAgainstTrump
Wargala,true but i will tell you this i work for a construction company and typically construction companies are at the forefront of the economy things go bad things tend to dry up and we know it first things go well and we are slammed with requests for new buildings i am hiring 9 people in the next 6 weeks and will likely hire another 35 50 between now and the end of the year for us business is booming ,1,MarchAgainstTrump
Wargala,anyone who been on reddit for any amount of time knows that if someone criticized obama especially in the beginning of his term was wildly called a racist hell jimmy carter called a congressman a racist for pointing out that obama was lying during a speech on obamacare which turned out to be something obama was lying about ,1,MarchAgainstTrump
Wargala,500k jobs added since trump took office manufacturing levels up stock market at record highs tpp killed illegal immigration dropping dramatically supreme court justice that will respect my gun rights frozen federal hiring cut spending by 60 billion while obama doubled our debt cutting funding to sanctuary cities tell me how obama did a good job ,1,MarchAgainstTrump
Wargala,clearly you do not understand context did i say in this thread someone called me racist ,1,MarchAgainstTrump
Wargala,across the board actually here in person and on reddit in general specifically i called obama out for his present vote on the flying imam case i called into question his ability to make tough decisions as president when it was clear he only wanted to be president for power and play big boy fyi the flying imam case was a case in which 4 islamic clerics went onto a flight asked for seat belt extensions which are normally used for fat people asked to rearrange their seats after they have been seated and just happen to want the same seating arrangement that the 9 11 hijackers were on so passengers and the flight crew got nervous and reported them to the police the fbi comes in finds there no threat they were just looking to sue an airline it looked like and let them go so the clerics sued the passengers congress put forth a bill that would make reporting suspicious behavior immune from lawsuits if done with honest intent obama voted present not yay or nay which requires actual backbone and tough decision making skills he showed in that moment that he did not want to piss off any particular group of people and hung the american public out to dry because of political aspirations he lied about the irs he lied about transparency he lied about obamacare and yet the media was largely silent on this redditors were silent on this as well aside from conservatives now we are seeing a whitewash of obama administration even with you saying were there issues there was outright corruption and no one calls bullshit on that trump is equally to blame here i voted for gary johnson because i like responsible people who are honest he tells outlandish lies and if there a bit of truth to them he never follows up and says i meant x case in point obama wiretapped me there is a bit of truth to that in that there was wiretaps but on a tenant in one of his buildings stupid shit like that costs him credibility as for liberal hypocrisy let me point this out personally i absolutely hated hillary we have all known she was dirty for 25 years and her email server proved it had i pulled that shit while i was in the marines i would still be in jail the fact that you have 100 proof of a crime and nothing comes of it shows that obama the justice department and the fbi are all corrupt obama could easily ask for the resignation of people ,-3,MarchAgainstTrump
Wargala,oh you would like to talk about the president lying and affecting your life great how about the numerous lies that obama told about obamacare that has raised everyone rates significantly how about the lies told about the irs corruption how about the lies told about not knowing about hillary email server when he was corresponding with her directly on them how about the lies of jobs are just going to go away and we need to adjust but companies are now saying trump promise of lesser regulations are allowing them to invest and expand obama just got good at telling lies that were difficult to bring to light the media clearly had a bias for him and happily kisses his ass unless it was absolutely obvious he was lying that why you had to look for his lies because of that notice that the media is way up trump ass more than obama that because of their hatred towards trump and they are actually doing their investigative jobs had media outlets actually done this hard of work during obama term you would have found out a lot more during the time he was lying instead of way after the fact ,-2,MarchAgainstTrump
Wargala,i complained when trump lied i got upvotes i complained when obama lied i got called a racist see the difference ,-7,MarchAgainstTrump

Wargala,the problem is that he set precedent had he not done that it would be reasonable to assume that with seeing the back end code that he did not and that there was a chain of command of the evidence because he did that now everything is suspect any attorney worth his salt will bring this up and have any reddit related posts evidence thrown out this was not just a guy doing something stupid this was a colossal fuck up on u spez part as well as internal reddit it staff first rule of it you never give access to anyone who does not specifically need it for their respective jobs because of that the entire operation can be considered tainted ,2,announcements

Wargala,oh sure all excellent points i think the fake news bit has been taken too far i do see bias in the media heavily especially from typically liberal outlets the biggest event for me was when wikileaks reported that 65 reporters were caught colluding with hillary and getting her approval on news stories to me that along with her email server really smelled bad to be fair though i am in it for the better part of 25 years and have set up dozens of email servers and as soon as she started explaining her email server i knew it was bullshit also to be fair i joined the marines after 9 11 and they hammer it into your head about classified information and i would not have dreamed of pulling what she pulled honestly i think trump could do a lot better in terms of cleaning house in washington i think he lets too much little shit get under his skin and pushes out lies that makes him look like a moron the problem is that he has such fertile ground to work with in terms of rooting out corruption such as firing corrupt government workers allowing incompetent government workers to be fired easier and loudly proclaiming term limits for congress however he trips over his dick to make sure that everyone loves him and that not a trait of a leader when i was in afghanistan i made sure my guys knew i would never ask them to do something i would not lead by example and always told them the truth regardless of their feelings it made my guys willing to walk through fire for me trump does not have that he has a rabid base who got fucked by nafta and the last 8 years being told they were shitty because of white privilege or racist for opposing obama policies that why they came out in droves to vote for him but you knew that already ,1,BannedFromThe_Donald

Wargala,oh i do not know i am a 275lb power lifter so i am sure i could become a pro athlete like a bowler or something ha sure times have changed a bit and things have gotten more expensive the problem is also that people do not want to sacrifice for example people in my generation when they got out on their own they had to have tons of room mates now from what i have seen that extraordinarily rare sure there people that have them but it not as common as it used to be now we could argue the single vs dual income option here as a choice in regards to children myself i waited until i was in my 40 to have children why because i wanted to make absolutely sure that i was financially stable enough and had the cash necessary to raise a child properly kids are expensive in case you did not know ha to give you an idea between hospital bill health insurance and day to day expenses my 1 year old costs me about 2 000 a month that not a typo regardless though if i were to have to live off of minimum wage i would simply have to make sacrifices i do not see a lot of people making these days sure in places like san francisco people are complaining about high rent rightfully so but those same people want to live closer to the city i work in portland oregon and i live in vancouver wa why it cheaper significantly cheaper i make the commute longer between 1 2 hours one way because i want to have a nicer house if i did not have a job i would have to bring in a room mate or something else taking my investments out of the equation the point i am making is is that we are both not seeing the same level of sacrifice to get ahead in life and those same people bitching about wanting more yes cell phones and internet are a necessary these days especially if you are trying to find a job however a smartphone is not blazing fast 1gb internet is not you cannot complain about wages when you have a 700 phone in your pocket ,1,explainlikeimfive
