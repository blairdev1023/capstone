mcdehuevo,sweet the second a1 ,2,GamerGateDebates
mcdehuevo,the problem with discussing questions like this is that as with racism and homophobia and every other ism and phobia out there the accusation is impossible to defend against so what is going to happen in this thread is that every anti gg comment will be some variation of bobmuffins a1 lots of the people gg criticizes are women therefore gg is sexist qed and lots of ggers will come back and say gg1 well given that the main attack on gamers comes from feminists if you disagree with feminists and criticize them then of course you will be criticizing a lot of women and then an anti will come back and say a2 well angry disagreement probably indicates misogyny anyway so the point stands and then a gg will say gg2 that lazy question begging show me evidence and then an anti will link some video by a feminist calling ggers sexist and so on ad infinitum i understand op intent is to clarify stances but i do not believe any question framed this way has the remotest possibility of yielding anything but a flame war or a bunch of carefully worded fluff that provides no clarification at all instead the question should be something like setting aside the issue of misogyny do you believe there is any merit to gg criticisms of the gaming press which points do you agree with and which do you disagree with ,4,GamerGateDebates
mcdehuevo,i am not part of the core of gamergate as i said in the article i did see everything happening at the beginning but then i did not pay attention for several months and only came back to it in january as far as i can tell the false flag accusation is a lot less true than i would like it to be most ggers are not interested are almost hostile really whenever i bring up anything outside the scope of gaming either way our small scale goals are in line stop the sjw advance into gaming and reverse the gains they have made in recent years achieving that moves things in the direction i want to see them move even if gamers stop short of pursuing any efforts in the broader culture war ,1,MensRights

mcdehuevo,perhaps by synthesizing the opposing views into a combined narrative rather than only expressing one side of it you want to claim harassment is a part of what is happening go ahead but do not leave out the fact that people have legitimate complaints about the coziness of journalists with the devs they are reporting on and with wanting game reviews to be about the quality of gameplay rather than the politics of the reviewer ,-4,SubredditDrama

mcdehuevo,oh i see you are a troll later ,2,KotakuInAction
mcdehuevo,i honestly do not know what your argument is other than that you do not like the use of the ussr as an example of the failure of socialism which seems odd since it a pretty common reference in any case if as i assume you are pro gg i think we are best off just ending the argument here and agreeing to disagree on our respective reasons for supporting the cause we need to stay focused on the main enemy which is sjws once they have been dealt with i would be happy to discuss the relative merits of soviet socialism ,3,KotakuInAction
mcdehuevo,i do think gaming is different it neutralizes the usual physical advantages men have so there less of a need for total segregation i would also expect that there would be some groups of gamers or at least events where there would be only men some mixed and some only women that said my point is less about the composition of the participants than about the content content should be dictated by consumer demand not the ideologies or sensibilities of external parties in other words if men want to see boobs in games and are willing to pay for games containing boobs and someone is willing and able to make those games then that the end of the story no one else gets any say in the matter this applies to any content that it is not against the law to include that must be an absolute regardless of who plays the game where they play it or what the opinion is of some self important academic ideologue ,0,MensRights
mcdehuevo,it not that gaming is male territory per se it that there have to be entertainment leisure environments which are specifically masculine since most of the rest of the media and so forth have been made inclusive read forced to accommodate feminine sensibilities it even more imperative for men to protect gaming women are welcome as long as they do not expect accommodation ,1,KotakuInAction
mcdehuevo,i agree that everyone will benefit but my argument is that men specifically need masculine environments in which to develop sometimes it just about blowing off steam other times it about toughening up and so forth regardless games are important in this context because there are so few such spaces left ,1,KotakuInAction
mcdehuevo,i am sorry i am not clear are you saying the ussr failed for some reason other than socialism being untenable regardless that was one example that i thought would be widely recognized and easily verified i am happy to provide more if you would like if you are looking for a detailed history of the ussr development though this article was hardly the appropriate forum bottom line you think i am wrong fine you think i am an idiot fine but your arguments are pretty weak and i would say more indicative of your odd emotional affinity for the ussr than your political expertise ,3,KotakuInAction
mcdehuevo,my point was not at all that female gamers are not being affected nor that gaming is under attack by women as a whole it that male oriented spaces are essential and one of the few available to those who are not athletic or socially adept is gaming women are welcome to enter those spaces as long as a the men in them are ok with it and b it understood that they cannot demand that accommodations be made to feminine sensibilities this is what feminists demand and i believe convince many women who would otherwise be fine with leaving men their spaces to demand as well there are many such women in gamergate who are starting to speak up but men are primarily responsible for asserting their right to masculine style entertainment and environments ,2,MensRights
mcdehuevo,who are you talking to whoever it is you are making no sense at all i am not saying i disagree with you though i probably do i mean your entire middle paragraph is internally incoherent and your third appears to have nothing whatsoever to do with the second i get that you want to bash trp but i do not know what about it you are bashing ,3,thelastpsychiatrist
mcdehuevo,fair enough i think if we surrender to appearances though then the terrorists have already won ,1,KotakuInAction
mcdehuevo,that great as a glib retort but a i am on your side b i am now no closer to understanding the problem i see a natural alliance between gamergate and rp against the tyranny of the pc sjw mob honestly i have to repeat there are anita sarkeesians all over the place setting curricula limiting speech creating draconian rape rules that remove the right to due process from the accused and lots of other things that have no direct impact on gamers per se but lots of effect on the world in which gamers live so if all gamergate does is push them back to the boundaries of gaming then within a short time they will be back at the gates trying to come in from a different side they are relentless well funded entitled and absolutely unshakable in their belief that the only thing keeping them from perfect happiness is male oppression ,2,KotakuInAction
mcdehuevo,i do not get it why is everyone so against roosh even if you do not agree with him the enemy of my enemy and all that and if you really think that games is the only context in which sjws want to impose their ridiculous canon of hypersensitivity political correctness and anti masculinity then you are really missing the big picture the only difference between gamergate and roosh trp is that trp saw this happening throughout society a long time ago but gamers never paid attention to it until started to affect them directly or tl dr imagine a world in which anita sarkeesian runs the fcc ,1,KotakuInAction

mcdehuevo, probably have not reevaluated them in light of modern understandings a relatively backwards community based on your own language it does not surprise me that you think sarkeesian is reasonable you both ride the same liberal high horse dispensing what you believe are enlightened observations but which are in reality nothing but sanctimonious fluff you are assuming the cost of treating everyone with respect what you call pc feminist sensibilities i call basic human decency is very high this is where you are the closest to getting the point you are framing it in typical leftist fashion but the essence is right time and energy spent anticipating and adjusting for the delicate sensibilities of professional umbrage takers reduces the overall quality of the product more to the fucking point and this is the thing that boggles my mind about how blind male feminists are to reality the thing that offends these people most is not the details of the content but masculinity itself men are not women we do shit that coarse uncouth rough whatever you want to call it sometimes that means calling people cunts or faggots or fat bitches that gets turned into misogyny homophobia and fat shaming there are lots of women who accept us for who we are anita sarkeesian is the other kind if you want to be a watered down beige wearing little beta supplicant begging for female favor by being more catholic than the pope that your deal just make sure you are doing it for the right reasons because it not going to help you get laid ,1,videos
mcdehuevo,listen kid try to keep in mind that most people have been familiar with this kind of stuff for a lot longer than last week sociology class this is not some isolated one off controversy it one piece of an overall feminist critique of cultural masculinity and male focused pursuits i do not even think most feminists would disagree with that characterization in their eyes the problem is not gaming in and of itself the problem is that it sticks out like a sore thumb on the modern culture map because it is not yet governed by pc feminine sensibilities anita sarkeesian is a propagandist no more no less i have yet to hear anything from her that contains a speck of intellectual honesty is she calm in her videos sure because she wants to give off a didactic professorial air in order to lend credibility to what are in fact very extreme and narrow minded views ,1,videos
mcdehuevo,three things in combination have helped my chronic headaches 1 alexander technique http en wikipedia org wiki alexander technique 2 atlas orthogonal chiropractic http en wikipedia org wiki atlas orthogonal technique probably particular to my situation more on that later 3 improving core strength and posture background i was born with craniosynostosis http en wikipedia org wiki craniosynostosis and developed strabismus as a child this led to a chronic right head tilt mild scoliosis and left right muscular imbalance in my lower abs and core i have had varying levels of headaches for as long as i can remember they are worst when i am lying down bending over or sitting in the wrong position i have seen neurologists craniofacial surgeons facial pain specialists i have had mris x rays jaw surgery ice crystal injections the list goes on far and away the biggest improvement has come from alexander technique i am also a developer and pc gamer and am overweight exacerbating the postural problems i mentioned above until the last year and a half or so i never had the faintest idea that my headaches could be related to posture and more specifically to my neck and core i always assumed my headaches were just because of my birth defect and there was not much i could do about them short of more major craniofacial surgery and even that would not be a sure thing learning alexander technique has helped me become more aware of how different parts of the body can affect other parts and just how central the neck is in overall muscular operation i am anything but a kinesiologist but the way i have come to think of it is that the combination of gravity musculoskeletal structure and habits of motion and posture create focal points of force and tension in your body the core is obviously one of them and the neck is another what i have also realized is that if one focal point is not carrying its weight then another is going to pick up the slack my core has never been strong enough relative to my weight and so my neck has taken on more and more of the work of supporting my body in an upright position this is extremely unintuitive at least for me but the simple fact is that i automatically tense my head and neck when i am doing motions that should be focused on the core such as sitting up from a lying down position bottom line i realize that a lot of this is specific to me particularly the atlas thing however i also think that with modern sedentary electronic lifestyles a lot of people have developed the same postural bad habits and lack of core strength that i have i firmly believe that just improving core strength to a level sufficient to support your body in an upright position without putting stress on your neck would be helpful for a lot of headache sufferers alexander technique may be overkill for many people but if you also have repetitive stress issues as well which i also did it might be worth checking out i feel like i have become somewhat of an expert in methods and processes of treating headaches so i am happy to answer anyone questions ,1,explainlikeimfive

mcdehuevo, i sympathize with women who cheat on a shlub like that the white knight is so pathetic so placating so false the man who is pretending to be moral all for a few breadcrumbs of affection he is a giant liar i could not agree more in fact i think these guys are worse than feminists because at least the feminist can be seen as blatantly using the victim card to work for her own long term gain she doing what females throughout the animal kingdom do using male resources and protection for the benefit of herself and her current and future offspring but she has the most advanced weaponry the white knight on the other hand the shame and contempt i feel when i see these useful idiots preaching the gospel of female moral superiority victimhood that they have learned to recite like good little sheep is excruciating and not just preaching but volunteering as verbal suicide bombers i would not trust one of these guys to deliver my pizza much less with anything of substance or import i have no doubt women feel the same way and to me that one of the central proofs of rp theory the fact that white knights are almost universally despised across both genders makes a mockery of the unique snowflake mentality yes each person is an individual and so on and yada yada but there are in fact certain axiomatic traits and behaviors that provide useful information to the opposite sex about potential mate value women learn and are chemically neurologically oriented from a very young age to do what rp teaches men learn about your partner before committing to anything http www justfourguys com tag miss marples detective agency when their natural information channels are snowed out by pandering and ingratiation how can they be expected to avoid the temptations of the alpha cock carousel if ordinary women understood that trp is actually teaching men to be more instinctive more real in ways that will improve the signal to noise ratio in male female communication because that how it supposed to work in nature i bet there would be a lot less shrillness about it ,27,TheRedPill

mcdehuevo,i have my own qualms about this one to be honest it a gray area for sure but think of it in terms of two things 1 preselection and 2 familiarity breeds contempt each of these applies to both sexes to one degree or another but much more so to women we all know preselection means her knowing that other women desire you makes you more desirable to her knowing this intellectually and being smacked in the face with it are two very different things so it easy to see why dread game is effective in the abstract the question of course is whether that smack crosses the line from reminder to abuse that where familiarity comes in even if she is already attracted to you she does not necessarily have the same in your face reminders of that fact on a daily basis you do you see her you look at her face her tits her ass whatever and you want to fuck her you know you are attracted to that hers is more complicated and i think can much more easily get lost in the day to day grind of life she may acknowledge that you provide protect etc but once that gets taken for granted it loses a lot of its power dread game removes the taken for granted aspect and reminds her that she has something other women value again i understand the misgivings and you have to be very careful not to overuse it if you are doing it to turn her into a puppet then you are an abuser if you are doing it to remind her that you are the one in charge and you know your own value so you are not going to take her shit then you are just a captain who recognizes the need for both the carrot and the stick ,14,TheRedPill

mcdehuevo,you have to look at the ratio not the absolute number any hourly wage increase costs x per employee per year the per employee cost is dependent on average hours per week and the total cost is dependent on that plus the total number of employees affected even starting with the bottom half or third you still end up with a massive overall cost plus when giving raises to a specific set based on starting rate you have to account for bracket shifts due to the increases here a spreadsheet https docs google com spreadsheets d 1f tza4icpmupa6 xduthqbflwezpavfosuxnphhybyg edit usp sharing showing different scenarios tl dr on the spreadsheet at 1 8 million employees it costs an assload and a half to increase wages for even a portion of them plus that does not account for non wage costs such as payroll tax and the employer portion of social security tax which i believe has to be paid on anyone working 30 hours a week or more and furthermore it assumes that 0 of profits are being paid to shareholders used for expansion or improvements etc over time investment is going to decrease unless the company is able to constantly increase its stock price relying on that carries its own set of risks and opportunity costs but the most ridiculous part of the comment that got all this fanfare is the idea that high turnover is somehow a good thing training a new employee is a significant expense because you have both the inefficiency of coming up the admittedly shallow in this case learning curve as well as the time spent by the people training them this is fine if you are turning over once a year or so but if as the oc suggests is the nefarious goal of this evil corporation you are getting new employees every other week you lose a ton to this kind of inefficiency and finally to address the point about why a company would not replace its employees with robots 1 the upfront cost and associated risk is too high with current technology to do it across the board 2 it probably will happen once the technology gets advanced enough to lower the upfront cost and risk enough because despite the potential for mechanical failures in a process that involves repetitive performance of a standardized chain of simple operations robots are superior to humans in every conceivable way robots do not require training show up late treat customers rudely fuck up dumb shit steal money sexually harass each other make false claims whine about having to do menial tasks browse reddit when they should be working get tired get sick have bad moods slip and fall and burn themselves on a grill and the list goes on source fried mcburgers when i was a teenager also slipped and fell and burned my arm on a grill tl dr say what you want about mcdingleberry capitalism dude at least it an ethos ,7,mildlyinteresting

mcdehuevo, the red pill consistently complains that women are naturally hypergamous that they will always take the next best thing that they are incapable of loving a man that they do not feel is above them in some way hypergamy is what it is trp simply states that hypergamy exists and must be taken into account proving its existence is part of making the case to a man who grown up bp that he cannot rely on unconditional love he needs to improve himself to a point where a woman can respect and admire him i have always found conversely that the red pill dislikes the career minded woman for various reasons career minded woman in the modern age often means a woman who has internalized the feminist notion that the only way to be a strong independent womyn is to put your career interests above those of your family based on the irrational belief that you can have your cake and eat it too let face it rp you get off on the idea of a woman needing you this is why so many men prefer submissive women even if it were true this only makes sense in the context of an ltr for plates ons etc it the opposite of true generalizations can be useful but they should at least make logical sense that being said i think all humans like the idea of feeling needed so it not a totally unreasonable statement it just not universal within trp or unique to it by any means if conversely you marry a man drop out of school pop out a kid and decide 20 years later that you want a divorce and alimony for your years of loyal servitude then you are a hypergamous slut who only married him for his money i assume you are using hyperbole to make a point but in this case it just does not work because the details are important women can of course have legitimate reasons to divorce what trp addresses is the pattern of guys getting blindsided by a woman who chooses to break the marriage contract for no discernible reason other than to pursue her own selfish interests at the expense of her ex who ends up beholden to her by the courts for the rest of his life there are really two schools of thought within trp 1 if you are going to get married choose your wife very carefully and protect yourself financially so you do not end up getting screwed over if you make a bad choice 2 do not get married to be honest this is the point in your argument with the most gray area i recognize that for every example of a hypergamous slut there is one of a woman getting cheated on or traded in for a younger model there are lots of cunts and assholes out there go figure feminism has done its best to rig the game in favor of women divorce laws courts the truth is that most young men do not want to believe this applies to them so what you see as complaining is often meant to shatter their pretty illusions ,3,PurplePillDebate

mcdehuevo,this question is an obvious straw man so i will respond in two ways first to the straw man itself then to the intellectually honest version of the question response to straw man the meaning of the word inferior is used in a broad generic sense and is therefore not well defined in this question so i will base my response on some points that i think are common stereotypes in equally generic form of what red pillers believe women are less intelligent and more emotional than men women are only capable of raising children and doing domestic chores women should be obedient servants to men in all things including sex in this framework the response is simple none of this negates the possibility of women using lies distortion manipulation and social relationships to get what they want from men in fact in a social context where visible power is in a state of complete imbalance in favor of one group the other group is more likely to use underhanded tactics against its oppressors to gain some semblance of fair treatment if trp were as it presented by its detractors then all it would be saying is that we have gotten to a point where the slaves have successfully rebelled against the masters something that has happened so many times throughout history that i do not need to cite specific examples so in its straw man form the question is moot response to intellectually honest question let say this question could be rephrased to given the red pill belief that men are genetically inclined to be leaders including both physical and psychological traits which support this status and women are genetically inclined to be followers how is it possible that we have reached a state in which it has become necessary for the leaders to develop and implement strategies designed to overcome the power of the followers in short most of the answers to this version of the question are in the thread you linked the only thing i will add is a point i have noticed is at or near the root of most misconceptions or misrepresentations of trp the idea of universal vs default many criticisms of trp seem to assume that its validity hinges on its principals applying to every individual male and female instead it should be viewed in terms of a bell curve in essence replace the words women and men in almost any statement with generic model of femininity or generic model of masculinity with the underlying assumption that a majority of women will fit that model within a reasonable range of variance and vice versa these principles are meant to offer men a starting point when interacting with women rather than having to mentally reinvent the wheel every time anyone espousing them assumes that an intelligent human will unlike say a machine recognize that he will need to adjust to the specific traits of the individual with whom he is interacting all that being said i have a counter question many in trp believe the only reason feminists and bp men direct so much vitriol at trp is that they regard it as a threat to the modern female centric culture a virus which must be isolated and destroyed this is coming from the perspective of those of us who know as individuals that the caricatures do not apply to us we are just trying to get our needs met in a social environment that has become hostile to the achievement of that goal so the question is if we assume that this perception bpers are responding in knee jerk fashion to a threat by attacking it without understanding it is wrong and that the caricatures and stereotypes rpers are closet misogynists working to re enslave the entire female gender are also wrong then what is c where c is the true deep down reason trp is so hated ,5,PurplePillDebate

mcdehuevo, that funny because the anti israel crowds i have encountered do not typically depict the occupation this way at all the comparisons i have heard typically involve settler colonial groups like the afrikaners in south africa or the british colonists in north america fair enough i was just establishing a scale for perspective the settler may not care but the soldiers and the homeowner in this video know full well that if anything would discredit the occupation in the eyes of the world worse than videos of settlers acting like racist criminals it would be a documented pattern of idf soldiers silencing amateur cameramen before committing alleged violations ok so would a non sugarcoated version of your position be these particular soldiers were too smart to behave like imperialist oppressors on camera but that what they would have done otherwise if so or any reasonable variant of that basic idea why would this video be cited in this context to be clear the main point i am interested in establishing is not whether palestinians get treated unjustly both on an individual and collective level what i am trying to say is that this video and many others that are used as proof of israel malevolence are often nothing but the natural friction between occupier and occupied furthermore that anyone who watches this video crying oh the humanity is seeing it through either the lens of sheltered western liberal sensibilities or visceral anti israel sentiment ,1,MapPorn

mcdehuevo,so i followed a few of the exchanges in response to this and what i mostly see is bpers fighting a strawman just because the dominant male submissive female paradigm works in some cases does not mean it right for everyone if those of you who are making that argument are doing so in good faith out of genuine misunderstanding then maybe it would helpful to distinguish between universal truth and default state you are saying that trp views its principles as universal truth ie applicable in all cases when in reality it about masculine dominance and female submission being the default state default state means we would expect in the population as a whole to see a significant majority of people exhibiting dominant behaviors and holding leadership positions to be male and vice versa modern feminism argues that there is no default state with regard to gender differences basing its case for the need to deconstruct patriarchal oppression in large part on common behavior patterns and statistical realities that line up pretty well with the results that would be predicted by any rp statistical model in fact over the last 30 years or so rp would say that the aggregate numbers have been skewed by artificial external interference quotas anti male legal and media culture government programs etc i am sure you have heard the evopsych arguments in one form or another so i do not need to go into them in detail suffice it to say that even evopsych does not claim universality just default status there will always be men who for one reason or another do not behave in a dominant fashion with respect to women the problem today is that those of us who have grown up in the last 30 or 40 years have been taught that demonstrative egalitarianism on the part of the male is an effective mating strategy ie a way for him to get his biological psychological and social needs met and trp says that this is absolute hogwash anecdotes about dominance do not demonstrate universal truths but they are examples of behaviors that would never occur to your average blue pill male because they are too sexist trp believes that many or most heterosexual women desire and will be happier in a relationship in which those behaviors are the norm those of us who have gone bp rp have seen repeated success with this basic idea where we had little or none before ,1,PurplePillDebate
mcdehuevo,i do not speak hebrew american non jew here and do not remember anything like that being said in english even if true it does not change my point one bit the narrative of most anti israel people involves some variant of israel wantonly tortures and murders palestinians because racism this video to a fair minded viewer almost shows the opposite set aside the question of the legitimacy of the occupation for a minute let just accept for the sake of discussion that the idf is an occupying force and occupying forces have a wide range of behavior patterns they can follow i am sure i do not need to give historical examples of the extremities to which occupying armies can go the anti israel crowd would have us believe that the idf is more comparable to genghis khan than to the america in japan and germany if we as fair minded observers are trying to answer the question of where in that range the idf actually falls rather than simply relying on the framing of people who may or may not have a reason to distort the truth it makes sense to look at contextual clues such as the dynamic between the soldiers and civilians in any given confrontation in this case i look at this clip and see the soldiers acting like cops who know they have a lot of soft power based solely on their position but who neither want nor expect to be able to use their hard power to trump any arguments made by the civilians cameras can be confiscated guns can be waved in faces threats can be made the soldiers do none of these things they do not come across as guys who are accustomed to squashing innocent civilians under their jackbooted heels they seem more like guys who just want to get their shift over with so they can go home and not have to deal with this annoying bullshit they want the guy to take the flag down because it making their job harder not because they want to silence his voice and annihilate his ethnic identity that how i read it anyway if you want to explain how this is actually a perfect representation of institutionalized brown people oppression i am all ears ,1,MapPorn

mcdehuevo,most of your effects are right on the money feminism is as pro government as it gets but you are leaving out a few equally important cultural societal economic changes that paint a very different picture of causes the demonization of wall st and the wealthy in general by the mainstream media and hollywood the myriad accommodations for women that companies have had to make extended maternity leave flex time quotas etc changes to entry standards so that women can meet them military firemen etc proposals like this http thinkprogress org economy 2014 02 13 3287791 sweden boards quota the list goes on the complete feminization of corporate culture favoring female styles of communication and de emphasizing the importance of leadership and discipline in favor of coaching and general touchy feeliness the entire concept of sexual harassment which can be used against executives as easily as against regular joes the heavy emphasis on social responsibility requiring corporations to kowtow to every special interest group that can get enough media coverage particularly environmentalists and consumer safety advocates safety over fun as bill maher says https www youtube com watch v x64cy3bcr98 there more but i think this is enough to get the point across that point being in the long run these kinds of changes are in no way beneficial to the power elite at least not the traditional ones they benefit a certain subset of crusading self righteous validation junkies who center their lives around demonstrating their virtue by deconstructing the status quo we know these people as social justice warriors if as you say feminism is nothing but a massive red herring used by the rich to divide and conquer the hoi polloi then they have let the tiger out of its cage and it biting the shit out of them i find it far more likely that the fairly obvious conclusion is the right one feminism is simply socialism with a different name it lines right up with evopsych do feminists want to increase dependence on the government yes but not to weaken one group of men in favor of another it just the modern expression of the female drive to extract resources from alpha males which in the female mind both the government and the wealthy are by definition socialism makes this automatic instead of the female needing to compete with other females for the attention of the alpha of course those at the center of the feminist movement will naturally have structured things to benefit themselves over other females but nevertheless the overall effect at least in the short term is to transfer resources from males as a whole to females as a whole from producers to consumers from the doers to the talkers read atlas shrugged ayn rand got it the best probably because as a woman she was forced to actively come to intellectual conclusions about how the world works that we as men take for granted tl dr feminism is not a conspiracy by the wealthy and powerful it karl marx in a power suit ,2,TheRedPill

mcdehuevo,i am with you on the nonstop assault of liberal bullshit and the inability to have even one space that is not permeated by political correctness and leftism the only way i do think that the gay perspective is helpful is because gay men probably have the least biased point of view on women of any group in the world as straight men we are often blinded by our attraction we excuse accept tolerate etc gay men do not have that and they are also not burdened with female hormones and emotional instability so what i am saying is they have 20 20 vision when it comes to female behavior and we do not that could yield useful insights ,1,TheRedPill

mcdehuevo,i agree that it was a dumb move to let her post on gw and that a smart person would probably have seen this outcome as all but inevitable so he was obviously deluded and if that what you want to focus on i am all for it he has to have been lying to himself if he did not at least suspect that something could go wrong with the situation that said from the perspective of the deluded person this is still a betrayal and he was reacting from within that framework the knife still hurts as it goes in and it worse if you think brutus is holding it given your volcanic reaction and desire for violence this phrasing seems typical of liberal intellectual types who believe that if they can distance themselves enough from the messy animalistic side of their nature they will be seen by their peers as enlightened so again i ask have you really never been angry and wanted to hit something ,1,offmychest
mcdehuevo,fair enough so why is your first reaction to a story about a guy getting stabbed the back to imply that he unstable or possibly even abusive i mean this guy is clearly the opposite of an abuser more like a complete pussy have you never been angry in your life i have and sometimes i punch things to vent it but never a woman ,0,offmychest

mcdehuevo, how could you hate women and still pedestalise them it not so much that you hate all women as it is that you believe you have not yet met a good one one that can see what a nice good boy you are when i was still bp my hamster would say things like the problem is that women do not measure up to my standards they are not as good as my mother i had an easier time coming to rp because i always believed that feminism had corrupted women to the point where they could not even see what they actually wanted i cannot really explain the rationale there because it makes no sense to me now looking back on it but i can tell you that what i believed so i pedestalized women in general while resenting all of the examples i met who seemed to ignore the important things in favor of shallow surface level characteristics the hamster makes all kinds of cognitive dissonance possible ,2,TheRedPill
mcdehuevo,in an environment other than the modern one i would probably agree with you as things stand right now i view this as someone standing up to political correctness and the takeover of western culture by female sensibilities no matter how much my own chivalrous or even paternal instincts might make me view something as distasteful if it contributes to reversing the tide of extremist feminism it gets a pass on that front ,2,TheRedPill

mcdehuevo,did anyone else notice that the phrase racism is institutionalized actually indicates a complete lack of understanding of her own bullshit ideology on her part what she saying is a behavior can only qualify as racism if it is institutionalized this probably comes from her having heard the expression institutionalized racism repeated endlessly in her sociology classes since she is too stupid to break the expression apart into its components the two words have overlapped in her mind and she now believes that whenever one is parroting a discussion stopper involving racism the institutionalized element is necessary tl dr the dumb cunt is even dumber and likely cuntier than it would first seem,2,TumblrInAction

mcdehuevo,this is one issue i kind of agree with but i also think is more complicated than on the surface a boy who spent his time programming would still get shit about it for being a nerd but in this day and age with all the rich successful nerds out there that probably somewhat less intense however the key difference to me is that i think a boy is less likely to make a major decision about what he interested in based on people giving him shit girls just plain place much more importance on their social standing and i am not sure there anything to be done about that it a double edged sword and this is the negative edge it probably also keeps lots of girls out of really bad stuff in summary i would say that in an individual case like your niece i completely understand the frustration but i still think the overall point of op article is right socially engineering the crap out of stem in order to achieve perfect numeric equality is wasteful and ultimately fruitless ,14,TheRedPill

mcdehuevo,you ask whether you should be her boyfriend are you interested in a relationship with her or are you just looking for gratification of your fetish and a quick fling you have to answer that question first and then be up front with her about your stance if the answer is yes you probably wo not need to do anything in particular to knock her socks off if it no then you will need to have a discussion with her about whether she ok with continuing a casual relationship if the answer to that is no then i doubt she going to be interested in you touching her at all and if that the case there really nothing you can do but say oh well and move on the key is to stay confident and in charge knowing where you want to go even if it does not seem like you are headed there at the moment ,1,feet

mcdehuevo,gotta disagree with both points 1 aladdin says something about how he will win jasmine she overhears and goes on some tirade about how she not a prize to be won no woman in today middle east would say anything like that much less a thousand years ago pure revisionism 2 getting angry over a fantasy is ridiculous if only it were true unfortunately a big part of the reason feminism has gotten as ridiculous as it has is because they have been smart enough to start early kids are far far more vulnerable to conditioning especially of the absolutist black and white variety so if you teach them that men and women are exactly the same and it only the evil patriarchy that disrupts the natural egalitarian harmony between the sexes they will take that shit to heart disney is probably one of the biggest reasons why so many young men behave in such an effeminate manner even aside from their political beliefs ,2,TheRedPill
mcdehuevo, this suggests that ipv may not be motivated by patriarchal values reality pie ingredients the emphasis on science in modern culture economic surpluses sufficient to allow for endless variants of experimentation and study the core decency and honor most human beings both male and female are born with leading scientists of all stripes to tend towards accepting empirical evidence even if it contradicts what they have been told to believe the internet ability to disseminate information outside of liberal controlled channels bake at 400 degrees for one hour serve hot with a dash of cinnamon and a heaping scoop of boo yah and you will turn any feminist into a quivering puddle of feelings and shrillness ,7,TheRedPill

mcdehuevo,i agree with what i think is your overall sentiment when i can tell that a picture is basically just an ad for a paid site or is professionally shot and therefore is coming through some sort of commercial intermediary i generally skip right past the pictures i like the intimacy the ability to attach a relatable existence to the person who as one part of her life overall is offering herself up for my personal enjoyment i cannot relate to or personify someone who just does it as a job that said as a couple other people have pointed out i doubt most of us have any concept of the extent to which girls who post pictures of themselves get flooded with messages and requests for articles of clothing if i am some gorgeous 20 year old college student and a dude is offering to pay me 50 bucks for a worn pair of socks or panties i am gonna be all over that like white on rice and if i do not have time to respond individually to and transact each request then maybe i fire up a storefront that handles those details the most important thing to me is that the commercial aspect not take over the personal one once that happens i lose interest tl dr i agree in general with op but can understand the pull for a desirable girl who starts out as an amateur of what amounts to free money the contradictory impulses of sexual supply and demand go figure ,4,feet

mcdehuevo,there no sudden prevalence there is 1 a larger population higher absolute number 2 better info sharing 3 greater destructive capacity that said i do not think this woman sounds like a psycho anyway she sounds like someone who cares more about hurting her ex than acting humanely ,3,MensRights

mcdehuevo,yeah that really my point whether you agree with the ingratitude or not thinking she ungrateful in no way indicates sexism ,3,SRSsucks
mcdehuevo,here my favorite line well this is my test when i look at personal ads i look at their lists of favorite books movies and music and they have to list women in all of those categories i cannot imagine a more fundamentally sexist statement than that this is the core problem with modern feminists they are too sheltered and intellectually lazy to understand their own ideology ,2,SRSsucks

mcdehuevo,i do not agree that it screams instability i can say that i was somewhat paranoid in the past based on my life experiences and i did not go through anything nearly as bad as she did frankly i think having the guns is exactly the right approach as long as she trained in their use and does not employ them to victimize others it certainly preferable to using her experience as a way to promote draconian rape prevention laws or other such statist measures she taking matters into her own hands and refusing to be re victimized ,1,LadyMRAs
mcdehuevo,it seems real to me and i am generally skeptical when it comes to accusations of rape that are broadcast outside the criminal justice system i look at that girl and i really feel terrible for her her pain certainly seems genuine then she gets to the part in the video where she talks about being an actress and it does make me wonder but i cannot imagine a plausible motive to make it up that would not be so heavily counterbalanced by the potential negative impact on her of airing her dirty laundry like that as to render it unthinkable if it is legitimate i can say this it a great advertisement for not going overboard on gun control personally i would prefer to use a baseball bat on the filth who did that to a child but a petite girl like that obviously needs an equalizer ,1,LadyMRAs

mcdehuevo,i disagree with this one i am a manager and if i send someone an e mail telling them to e mail someone else it because i want the e mail to come from them not me usually so they either get recognition for something they have done or so that the recipient knows they own whatever the e mail is about i probably felt the same way as you before becoming a manager though ,5,AskReddit
