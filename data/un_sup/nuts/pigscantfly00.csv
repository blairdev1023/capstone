pigscantfly00,what i do in these games is check every corner obsessively ,2,prey
pigscantfly00,i played on hard and like 80 of the game i conserved ammo and it was still easy the last 20 i really used all my ammo because i knew the game was coming to an end and it was super easy i only used grenade like 4 times i think in the early parts of the game you need to use turrets to help you i think by 50 i had stopped using turrets completely i never got typhon powers neither the guns were working so well oh but i quicksave every 10 seconds and replay every engagement if i wasted even one bullet lol ,1,prey

pigscantfly00,yea but she was extremely long winded however it makes sense from what i had heard from her i heard maybe 15 sec after she said she a mother based on your comment i thought she was the one complaining about sexism and the 3 women on stage shut her down however what she said was she was the owner of an it company so it didnt make sense at all to me so of course the truth was that her having real practical experience shows that the affirmative action female employees were inept that the only result that could occur from it statistics show that the richer and freer a country is the less women go into hard science careers that because they do not have to worry about making money as much most women naturally do not like it so the fact that women are trying to use sexism as an excuse to not be in computer science then trying to give women free high paying jobs in computer science is just atrocious ,4,programming

pigscantfly00,with jumper cables it basically mechanical there can be no power to do it without the cables there is no part inside the system that could fail and cause power to go through because it designed to have no power without the cables no matter what happens for example i am guessing there is a relay inside with a mechanical switch involving the door if the doors are opened there is no mechanical connection to transfer power to the relay and therefore the elevator has no power to move the relay only require a small current to drive it the relay is what connects the main power to the elevator motors the real design is probably more sophisticated with more redundancies for safety the main philosophy is that the default state is no power ,1,WTF

pigscantfly00,actually it not oil rigs workers are dumb and a dime a dozen they do their stint to make a lot of money it doesnt improve their reputation spacex employees enjoy the work they do and they are personally driven to do it they do not get external rewards like pats on the head from elon or a lot of money most also do not plan on joining for only 2 years neither they probably quit after 2 because it too tough it takes a new employee almost 1 year to acclimate to the work culture and company processes enough toproduce high level work spacex couldnt have the progress that it does if most employees quit after 2 years ,-4,bestof

pigscantfly00,6 miles in 50 mins is impressive i am not knocking it but i would rather sprint 1 mile and do heavy lifts jogging is tough on your joints so a really long jog isnt that great if you just want to increase cardio ,1,AskReddit
pigscantfly00,that really weird perhaps you are exaggerating regularly if you run 1 mile a day every day you should be able to run the entire thing without being winded in 6 months that a very long time to train 1 mile a day is like 15 mins a day of jogging max so it not really bad you can also try interval training where you spring at max pace then walk for 30 sec then jog then walk 30 sec then repeat the set as many times as you can handle the body responds to heavy weights different than light weights like if you bench 150 then go down to 120 you can do a ton of 120 reps if you stay on 120 it takes forever to increase reps over 15 as a matter of fact it takes only about 1 5 months to be able to run the entire mile non stop ,6,AskReddit

pigscantfly00,when i was a senior in high school i had this really smart physics teacher he was dying of cancer but didnt tell anyone and was trying to impart all his knowledge on his students in an unannoying way of course he had extremely good social skills one day he said to me the road to hell is paved with good intentions i had no idea what the fuck he was talking about for years after then as i went through life trying to help this person or that person and it often turned out horrible i understood it people are fucked i was tutoring my nephew and i found out the kid probably has a learning disability or something i told my brother and he got mad he tried to hide the fact that he got mad at me for it but i could tell the kid also fucking hates me too because his dad made him work harder i regret it so fucking bad every time i think back on it i should have let that kid drift through life like an idiot and when he realizes he fucked it too late to turn the ship around because it takes like 15 years to do it ,7,Showerthoughts

pigscantfly00,deeply respect scorsece but he absolutely wrong first people went to theaters for the ac then they went for the great movies that they couldnt see at home because they didnt have a tv and there was no vhs then they went because vhs took like 1 2 years to come out then dvds came out in 3 months so they went because theaters had better sound and imaging then home theater sound systems became cheap hd tvs went from 4000 to 500 dollars then blu ray came out and it looked even better the image i get at home looks even better than the projected one at a theater so why would i go to pay more deal with other people have a tight schedule to follow pay more for food cannot have bathroom breaks and get a worse image where the sound is set way way too loud the theater model is outdated as soon as we have some type of fool proof drm people would get it streamed to their house someone just has to release a tv that cannot be opened and tampered with and have the signal be encrypted they do not have to worry about pirates because the tv cannot be opened so no one can capture the decrypted signal if the tv is opened the circuit self destructs no one can crack an encrypt without the decrypter intact they just cracked uhd a few days ago because uhd players can be opened and studied buy that special tv if you want to watch theater movies at home you get to rent that movie and play it once for 20 dollars or something maybe even have a camera on the tv that detects how many people are watching and charge accordingly that probably a billion dollar idea right there just need a big company like apple to get the licensing deals together and make the hardware the tech is easy studios would make even more money off of this because they do not need to pay the theater cut more people would buy it because it convenient this would be a boon for indie film makers because their movies cannot be widely distributed once it comes on dvd it gets pirated like crazy this could be the next big tech idea just like with music it removes the publishers as gatekeepers of cinema ,2,movies

pigscantfly00,you guys and that article author got it wrong a review embargo is the best thing to do if a game is good everyone will know it good when it comes out if a game is bad the pre release review would absolutely kill it if they do it for some games and not others it obvious which one is bad so they have to do it for all pre release reviews are ok for small developers that know their game is good big publishers cannot be hands on and they make a lot of games they cant be sure all of them are good basically for bethesda the upside for a good game is small but the downside could be enormous if a game is bad ,-3,Games
