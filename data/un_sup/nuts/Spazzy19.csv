Spazzy19,i married my ex husband when we were 22 and he was getting out of the marine corps we moved cross country for him to go to college he worked as a produce and dairy manager in the meantime at a grocery store he used to work at in high school while i worked full time as well he did not get established in his teaching career until 5 years later but he always made decent money had a great work ethic and had plans i recently opted to not date a guy who was compatible on a time and emotional level as me and part of the factor was his job he works at ups as a loader unloader and while i have no problem with the job itself it was more a lack of drive that put me off he had a dual degree in literature and spanish and liked the fact he did not have to think in warehouse jobs because he lacks a car currently also a factor he got up at 1 30am some days in order to bike 1 5 hrs to work he had a good ethic in that regard but i prefer more drive in a guy not complacency ,1,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,except she not an addict ,7,relationships
Spazzy19,for every addict there is a co addict whose enabled the addict behavior guess that you please go get professional help for your codependent ways s,6,relationships
Spazzy19,she not an addict but having been in my own 12 step program and learning extensively about addiction i can tell you that even if she was shaming her is not going to help it would make it worse but way to go i would leave your holier than thou ass at the altar ,7,relationships
Spazzy19,nope not at all i keep momentos of my past which includes past relationship things too i am keeping my previous wedding album and i have various cards and other pictures of my past i would cherish them even more if my so had died i could not date anyone who asked this of me i do not fawn over my pictures but when i encounter them they do make me smile and remind me of why we did not work out and what i am still looking for i am sorry for your loss do not give up your photos for an insecure bf ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,for sure i have been through it myself and i know people react differently in situations but i just did not sense any emotion what so ever ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,the way he writes makes it seem like he not too broken up about it either despite how long they were together ,4,relationships
Spazzy19,yeah my ex bf was miffed he could not get me off through piv oh well he did finally get me off orally but it took me a while and he added fingers i was psyched because usually i have to participate to get satisfaction ,1,sex
Spazzy19,i think each person is just different i am an extremely touchy feely woman and love showering my so with kisses massages general touches outside of just sex but if you are having a good time with this guy accept it and do not overanalyze it ,1,sex
Spazzy19,holy crap i take home about 3400 mo but i am good with money so was my ex husband he was a teacher but together we saved up 30k for a down payment for a house i bought my subaru in cash last year after saving for 9 years i also had lasik for like 3500 a few years ago which was on a 2 yr interest free payment plan my ex bf and i recently broke up instead of moving in together because of money philosophy differences do not get married to this guy 1 he should easily be able to afford a car or lasik on that salary 2 you sound like my ex husband and me where we nitpicked finances and only combined for large joint purchase it worked but for at least me i do not want to be keeping tabs and track of who owes what etc it not even close to romantic 3 there are a lot of boundary and respect issues going on here ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,my ex was a sex addict to porn and some of this is similar check out out of the shadows by patrick carnes my ex collected unbeknownst to me and he occasionally deleted everything which caused him great angst we initially had frequent awesome sex and then it turned into 4 to 5 times per month at age 22 when we were married i am hl and was super confused he turned me away regularly but had no problem jacking off later ,2,sex
Spazzy19,my ex husband had this mentality but primarily stuck to using porn as an outlet since he was terrified of stds from my experience it does not get better it will still impact you on a deep level i was a willing and creative partner and even wanted sex more than him but it was never enough he had an addiction and would get bored after a while i read my life in out of the shadows by patrick carnes i would be very cautious if he got urges he cannot seem to control that is a huge red flag it a slippery slope with the extra excuse of him being emotionally faithful it a rationalization and you are both falling for it look for professional help if you want to stay together ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,agreed and he not anymore but it does not make him a predator or a horrible person ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,and you behaving as you are is probably the number 1 reason your brother is not giving you any details chill out if you choose not to go based on assumptions and gossipy drama that your own deal but prepare for the family rift ,3,relationships
Spazzy19,thank you the fact that op is freaking out and broadcasting it on reddit alone shows me i would not want to tell him something of this nature especially when he has not bothered to get to know the fsil really anyway ,5,relationships
Spazzy19,or most people just do not understand and crucify people for their mistakes it could be any of the above it not a comfortable topic to bring up to just anyone it takes a certain level of trust ,8,relationships
Spazzy19,why does it matter to you if your brother is aware and he trusts her why do not you trust his judgment my ex had a similar situation though he did not actually have sex with the student but he had to give up his amazing teaching job and now is basically treated like he had done more than fall in love with a student i cannot say i understand the mentality but i know he not a predator it was one particular student not the age group if your fsil really screwed up she would be in jail let her live her life without your extra unnecessary judgment ,19,relationships
Spazzy19,i agree plus the thought was a baby would solve this horrible situation better to not have that added into the mix i question whether i could go through a procedure outside of taking a pill if i were in ops shoes but i would not want to have this guy tied to me at all ,2,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,having just gotten divorced last year after 10 yrs of marriage i understand but despite how i initially resisted and hated it it is the best decision we made and he not a bad guy either so we have maintained our friendship ,3,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,leave whether you are pregnant or not for whatever reason he gone off the deep end and it not a healthy baby anymore he has zero respect for you and you are not respecting yourself trying to stick around taking his abuse ,12,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,yeah if i were a guy that would be off putting unless it was hyphenated but that not my style either good thing i do not want kids and do not have to deal with this one ,0,relationships
Spazzy19,sounds like he hooked on porn or various images to excite him this situation happened to me and for the first 4 years of marriage i could not understand why he was not wanting to enjoy his very willing and attractive wife it a very soul crushing experience but know it has nothing to do with you i would recommend looking at help through cosa for you read out of the shadows by patrick carnes to see if anything else makes more sense my ex husband and i met online too but we did a ldr for 2 yrs in the military his porn addiction kicked in significantly while he was deployed to iraq in 2005 and he assumed he would not need it once we were married and he had access to sex whenever hug ,29,relationships
Spazzy19,leave before it gets worse ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,my ex husband encouraged me to keep my last name but i opted to take his since i liked it and prefer a one name family after 10 yrs we got divorced but my married name has become my identity within my career i did not change it back i actually would prefer to just keep it this way even if i get married again but i know some guys are really weird about that issue but definitely talk to your husband about it and convey your concerns ,7,relationships
Spazzy19,dry climate cold about 8 months of the year and then hot for 3 months with 1 month to split btw spring and fall lol beautiful mountains surrounding the valley open landscapes and it pretty easy to get around it a smaller less glitzy version of vegas but is a great area for outdoor activities skiing snowboarding hiking camping swimming etc ,1,EarthPorn

Spazzy19,slowly better start realizing you are unhappy quickly ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,uhh f that set your standards higher and look for a guy who has his shit together and can actually take care of himself you and his parents have been enabling this entitled brat ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,i live in reno and have worked in enough social service agencies to know people can get more than 50 custody and at least request supervised visitation sure it harder to get it from a mother but try at least ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,living together should not be a test run neither of you is really going to change if you are already hesitant trust your gut i just had to do this myself before almost moving in with my ex bf it sucks horribly but we realized we were incompatible in some major ways and that trying to force it would result in unhappiness ,15,relationships
Spazzy19,i left my baby in ga with my parents because my ex husband and all his family were highly allergic 4 yrs later we separated and i got 2 cats we later reconciled and he offered to get shots because he knew it would mean a lot to me plus he was allergic to tons of other things his insurance covered everything thankfully ultimately while they helped him significantly his throat still closed after a while i gave my new little ones to a friend we divorced this past year and my next bf was also allergic we have since split but i have decided i wo not date anyone else allergic to cats in your case he does not seem worth the trouble if he flaking and testing your commitment ditch him and keep your cat it should not be so hard to have a healthy relationship ,3,relationships
Spazzy19,no one but you keep labeling this lack of setting boundaries as not being a man you can start setting boundaries whenever but hopefully sooner than later you might find that as you start setting them with your family your gf will start to feel respected that you have her back and are in the same page she might be willing to interact with your family more in the future too but even if she opts to continue avoiding them because they have disrespected her boundaries that is something you have to accept and if you cannot then break up she did not just start out hating your family obviously events led to this demise ,9,relationships
Spazzy19,how the heck did he get 20k in debt at his age run run far away do not move in together and definitely do not combine finances he has you paying for all of the essentials so he has nothing to worry about besides what he wants to waste his money on ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,bae uggh ,2,AskReddit
Spazzy19,be honest and tell her you are interested but have not experienced these things before it might surprise her but i am sure she would patiently guide you through the process just try not to slobber all over her when you kiss haha i would not recommend starting out with tongue but relax if you can and enjoy the sensations practice makes perfect ,7,relationships
Spazzy19,if you want to stay together then you have to improve your communication and deeply reflect whether you can deal with areas of potential incompatibility my now ex husband and i came back from infidelity on his part to last another 6 good years but it was initially hard to work through honestly you have to be patient show love and be truly forgiving he and i were on the same page on everything else and he one of my best friends even to this day times of crisis can pull you closer together if you allow it but just because you love each other deeply does not mean you are truly compatible a healthy relationship should not be so difficult my first love and i broke up when i was 20 after 2 5 years together we did the whole break up and get back together thing a few times until making it permanent i have deep affection for my recent ex bf too and we nearly moved in together but we mutually realized we are incompatible with our outlooks on kids and finances at 33 i want something that flows easily and is not volatile ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,it sounds like emilio goes through numerous ons if that were the case then i am sure it would be even more awkward btw emilio and the gf than op described ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,my ex family is mexican and he has a set of 5 cousins that all have red hair in some fashion the eldest female cousin married a guy with brown hair though i am not sure about his eye color and all 3 of their kids are blonde haired blue eyed you would never know they were even half mexican and the family jokes that they are sleeper agents that being said get a paternity test to ease your mind just be prepared for the possibility that unless you are able to do it secretly there could be a fall out either way you find out it is not yours or you find out it is yours and your wife has difficulty forgiving you for not trusting her i think it understandable why you want one but your hormone filled wife may not see it that way it a little odd she has not suggested it herself though as a solution for you ,5,relationships
Spazzy19,honestly if you cannot cope with it and it starts to impact your relationship you may end up without a gf which would be extremely unfortunate i would focus on the fact that she is telling you that she happy with her sex life with you though you do not want to screw it up with your insecurities she not with emilio she with you and has been for a long time also size and physique are not everything i have got a fwb that probably the size of emilio biggest i have had but you know what my best sex was with my ex who would tell you he was below average and he was 5 inches shorter than me and pudgier than my typical type your gf is obviously with you for a reason ,164,relationships
Spazzy19,i pay attention to spending habits and let finances make a natural progression too i do not need to know how much my so is making or whether he going to inherit a bunch of money until we are getting more serious the same applies to me but i want to know about debt and spending habits for sure it ended up being a deal breaker for me in my last relationship ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,it apparent he is not concerned about your well being do not disrespect yourself by dancing to his tune and doing what he wants when he wants and how he wants forgive him if you will but then cut him out of your life he just wants to use you until he done with you again ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,so your friend wants you to settle i did that once and was married to a man who actually would meet your criteria it why we were together for 12 years and are still close but there was no romance apparently he just never felt that strongly for me in that one area and it was heartbreaking he finally wanted to let me go to find the complete package and now having experienced romantic love again i will never settle again you should not either your criteria is not ridiculous or too high of a standard ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,i was 4 apparently some girl in there showed me and i realized it felt good ,1,sex
Spazzy19,i cannot even articulate how i feel for you right now because it so screwed up you are still 10 years sober since you did not make that choice yourself that being the case i would highly encourage you to contact a 12 step group for support since your body has been teased and i do not want to see you fall back down the rabbit hole wtf i do not think i could speak to my sister again it time to place her children elsewhere that healthy and let her harm just herself i am so sorry she did this to you ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,you cannot know and only you can determine whether you can ever trust her again my ex husband cheated on me about 7 years ago i nearly divorced him then but we discovered a lot about what was going on with him that made so much sense i decided to give reconciling a chance but we separated for 8 months during that process despite having gotten divorced in sept unrelated to the previous cheating i have no regrets about having reconciled it took a lot of work to overcome insecurities and resentment but i truly forgave him and we were able to grow exponentially individually and as a couple you have to pay attention to actions not just words it will take time if you decide to stay together and if you do you will have to let it go i knew deep down that staying could land me in the same boat later on down the road but i felt it was necessary to explore this path not everyone can do it but you cannot and do not want to become her babysitter that will only lead to unhealthy mentalities and behaviors and as a side note i very much informed the husband of the woman my ex had an affair with ,3,relationships
Spazzy19,text him back directly and tell him you would like him to bend you over and spank you for your transgressions last night and provide additional examples of how you would like to be thoroughly treated work him up throughout the day greet him at the door wearing something skimpy on your knees with a mischievous grin on your face go from there ,1,sex
Spazzy19,you sound like my ex bf though he would not have been ok with me being with other guys he was even 5 inches shorter than me and yeah he would slip out semi frequently but you know what i did not care i like your gf have a high drive he struggled to keep up with but i took care of myself when he was not able to or was not in the mood buy your gf some toys for when you are stressed or tired but do not rely on them solely they should just be a back up for the record i am now with a guy who above average and he still slips out regularly ,2,sex
Spazzy19,well i am the one giving lol but sometimes this guy starts giggling and making funny this is pleasurable but omg noises apparently it tickles his dick ,1,sex
Spazzy19,because you are giving her flattering attention on the side so it a boost to her self esteem ,5,sex
Spazzy19,uhh i would not be giving up my toys especially when there no sex on the horizon ,6,relationships
Spazzy19,have you gone to therapy to discuss this pattern before i do not mean this sarcastically the common denominator is you and having been married to an addict one of the things i learned in 12 steps and therapy is that if i do not fix what is wrong in me i am likely to end up in a similar situation with a different face we all deserve happiness but it needs to start within ourselves ,11,relationships
Spazzy19,she probably relies on the dog as much as you do for her own issues and is afraid to give her up my ex boyfriend mom does not want to let him take his dog away all the time either his dog has stayed at his parent house for years and soon he will install a dog door and he can keep the dog more often they are going to have to work out joint custody because his mom loves that dog too it might honesty just boil down to what is best for your dog i would love to have my cat out west with me now that i am not married to anyone allergic anymore but she almost 17 and is accustomed to my parent house i do not want to stress her out for my own interests ,70,relationships
Spazzy19,you are obviously worried if you are writing this search him on that site and verify if you find him you need to confront him about his inappropriate behavior ,3,relationships
Spazzy19,you are enabling her ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,there are always social service programs catholic charities diaper banks food pantries and welfare through her state she needs to tap into those resources before you give more money sounds like she picked a real winner ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,sex and cuddles always make me feel better ,6,sex
Spazzy19,omg i laughed way too hard at this ,1,sex
Spazzy19,lol i love how two of yours are focused on getting that movie in afterward ,18,sex
Spazzy19,i have been masturbating since 4 without fail i also have a high drive but i do not think it abnormal just who i am i have got similar kinks too ,1,sex
Spazzy19,you should be able to see them on the actual mattress if he has them pull back the sheets and check there would also be blood spot excrement on them they are tiny but not even close to invisible sounds like you are done with the relationship anyway ,18,relationships
Spazzy19,relatively normal from all outward appearances from your perspective but sex addiction does significant damage to the mind heart and soul of both the addict and partner it shatters relationships cuts partners to the deepest cores why are not we good enough what if i sacrifice my needs and dislikes and perform sexual acts i despise will that prevent him from going to prostitutes or having affairs why wo not my husband respond to my touch why does he prefer pornography over me add to the mix that drug addiction while obviously still painful is widely more accepted and people are more empathetic sex addicts and the addiction are far from understood pervert cheater creep whore scumbag those are common terms i hear do not get me started on the ones associated with underaged individuals or rapists there is immense shame for both parties and no one understands until they have walked the path i certainly did not my ex husband is mild compared to some but he struggles with how he ever going to find someone to love him again knowing how he behaved with me he might not have sweat and shaken violently during porn withdrawal but he got more agitated fidgety etc for a while after installing a program ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,those addictions are just as valid having been married to a sex porn addict i can tell you the experience was not even close to trivial there are brain changes for all of those addictions do some research ,10,relationships
Spazzy19,having been married to a sex addict i can tell you there are varying levels and degrees within the label but it still affects the brain the same way as does love addiction drugs and sex addicts are only different in as much as they have different coping mechanisms for reaching the same goal ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,get new friends ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,ugh this reminds me of why my recent ex bf and i broke up i was contemplating moving in with him but spending and attitude about money differences drove us apart he had a lot of cc debt from remodeling his home last july and is about to do more like roofing siding windows etc all the debt he paid off is going to accrue again he got diagnosed with adhd in november but he and i have vastly different philosophies on money i do not mind carrying some debt if it 0 interest and i will pay it off quickly but not for expensive hobbies trips and other purchases i bought my car in cash after i got a new job which has chain controls during the winter months my 16 yr old civic was not going to cut it i pay off ccs monthly and save for various things and retirement my ex bf says the same thing as your gf that i worry too much about the future and i am not living today i disagree i buy things and live comfortably but i have no desire to drop hundreds of dollars monthly on toys etc i would love to do an international vacation soon and was planning to go with his family on one in november just know that these are deal breaker territories and that you cannot change one another you will fight a lot but if you can handle it then fine i opted to decline moving in together and am closing on a condo next week we broke up amicably and realize it was a good decision and are maintaining our friendship otherwise ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,i personally would not care if my so admitted a stripper started kissing him at a club and it went down the way you described ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,you are long distance so it even easier you call her you tell her that you are not into the relationship anymore and bow out you set the boundary and stick by it and hopefully she wo not cause too much drama and accept it ,0,relationships
Spazzy19,it hardcore enabling the parents and yet it a struggle figuring out how to balance it i do not think i could speak to my parents again honestly they know she always going to be their cash cow and babysitter ,8,relationships
Spazzy19,she trapped in her own life based on her choices it has nothing to do with you time to leave do not be her safe spot to disrespect and use until someone new comes along ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,it by patrick carnes an explains sex addiction different types and how they escalate the cycle of shame and also how the partner behavior plays into the relationship partners become addicted to the sex addict trying to control their behavior or enabling them there are lots of books for partners of sex addicts too but i found understanding the sex addiction first was best for me in understanding it was a real thing i thought it was a stupid excuse for my ex behavior reading those books will help you find support and realize that it unhealthy to put yourself last or do or wear uncomfortable things to try an attract the addict attention to act out inappropriately to shame the addict i told everyone he was a cheating whore to get back at him and looked like an idiot when i decided to reconcile etc they are on amazon or you may find copies in the library ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,amen,1,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,i would encourage you to look into a 12 step program for support and resources to stop this behavior ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,while it hurts to an extent fantasy deepens if it festers in secret my former marriage counselor encouraged my ex and me to acknowledge that we would see other attractive people for that reason however it rather odd that he specifically told you about masturbating to her then again i masturbate to various fantasies and people myself so i guess it just weird he acknowledged it ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,you need to tell her and explain it ,3,relationships
Spazzy19,you might check out resources in cosa it for partners of sex addiction but it might be able to give you some better coping methods if you have had partners that forced themselves on you and we are hooked on porn then you have definitely been impacted it helps you learn to function without the need to control so you can be healthy ,3,relationships
Spazzy19,yeah no time to leave you do not need to live on eggshells for making basic human mistakes you will feel so much tension release once you are gone ,3,relationships
Spazzy19,i would do it myself and will whenever my ex husband finds himself in another relationship same with my recent ex bf ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,i would say he playing both of you and you need to stay away if he really did not want to be with his gf then he would not be with her despite you being in the picture plus no good usually comes from hopping relationships because you think the grass is greener he could not commit to you before and he definitely not committed to his gf run ,3,relationships
Spazzy19,sex addiction is absolutely painful and devastating to all parties i was married to one for 10 years and it chips away at the partner soul ,15,relationships
Spazzy19,porn addicts also get desensitized after a while the game was over after he would won me and we would gotten married but neither of us knew it sex was frequent initially because i was something someone new ,53,relationships
Spazzy19,look up cosa for partners of sex addicts there are resources and support groups i had a long distance 2 yr relationship with my now ex husband before we got married and the sex initially was frequent although carnal it basically stopped afterward and i could not figure out why we were 22 and i wanted to have tons of sex 4 yrs after marriage and 2 emotional affairs and one physical affair later i discovered he would also had a bad porn addiction which explained so much i read my life in out of the shadows he got help i got help and we did a lot of bonding and growing for the next 6 yrs but i can tell you that every day a little piece of my soul was chipped away by the lack of sexual desire we maybe had sex 4 times per month and i am a once or more daily sort of girl i could not get him excited by touch it was generally always carnal and never about my pleasure he would try to do things for me and immediately go soft always on his time frame he could never make live shied away from mouth kisses etc after 10 yrs of marriage he wanted to divorce bc he was tired of hurting me it was honestly the best thing he could have done for me i am sorry you are going through the same thing ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,i am like you and recently divorced and love my ex family like they are my own i do not even have kids but my family is on the opposite side of the country so they have been there for me and are way more supportive than my own family that being said this past christmas i broke my time up between my boyfriend family and my ex in laws it would be a deal breaker for me to be with a person who was insecure about it it would be even more of one of there was a child involved ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,my ex bf and i had already bought tickets to my brother wedding in july when we broke up a few weeks ago he still welcome to join me but if he does not want to then i am going to see about getting him a voucher to use some other time you could have her look into that option ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,you know you are not lazy and that what matters do not let them get under your skin ,3,relationships
Spazzy19,or that his wife has to hide her past ,22,relationships
Spazzy19,i love bollywood movies like jab tak hai jaan they are long and subtitled romances but they are not generally cheesy ,9,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,if you do not get paystubs then you can have your employer write a letter regarding your hours and wages make sure there is content info and a signature and date on it i used to have to verify income in my previous jobs ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,lol i met a guy this weekend while celebrating my former sister in law boyfriend birthday her boyfriend and this guy have been longtime friends and my ex husband was there sometimes my ex and i sat next to each other and at another point we were not but when i answered how i knew the b day boy i pointed at my sil i said we knew each other because i would been married to her brother for 10 yrs and pointed at my ex ops bf would have shit a brick the guy i met thought it was great we were all close in fact he used to date one of the other mutual friends thee with us who is now married does not faze me ,8,relationships
Spazzy19,what the hell trust me ditch him and you are going to feel a breath of fresh air he tearing you down left and right and making you think you are not good enough as is i am 33 and i would just blink at him if he asked me to take down my photos of me with my ex husband or ex bf then i would tell him to go fly a kite ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,i am 33 and have never had the urge yet am a nurturing person just broke up with my boyfriend because he wants 2 or more if you do not feel it definitely do not do it because there will be resentment forever ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,sounds like what happened with my ex husband found out he was addicted to porn it was still best to split and maintain our friendship because he knew he was messed up and wanted me to have someone who could love me the way i needed ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,i cannot speak for your boyfriend dynamic with his ex but i talk to my ex husband almost daily and we hang out regularly alone with friends or with his family because his family is more family to me than my own we were together for 12 years and married for 10 years but neither of us is romantically and thus sexually attracted to the other anymore i still think he handsome but i have zero desire to touch him with a 10ft pole other than a simple hug but he one of my best friends and closest confidants he spending time with a girl he reconnected with as i type and i am over the moon he has been comforting me due to my recent breakup i realize most people cannot handle having this kind of a dynamic but it works for us and we have a special love and bond it just not romantic or sexual our relationships with partners take priority but for us it a deal breaker if the so cannot accept our continued friendship ,3,relationships
Spazzy19,can you contact any of his friends or coworkers ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,oh i love this too and do mma as well i have tended to stick to carpeted floor which may end up on the bed or couch though i have nearly kicked my partner off the bed at times too i tend to give up a little at times to keep the situation in control then start squirming when he thinks he got me ,2,sex
Spazzy19,there a huge difference between saying oh i did not think you wanted to go still but i was actually looking forward to some alone time would you mind not going and the inexcusable reaction he had toward you treat yourself with respect and leave him for good and go alone to the event if you are really interested you might make some more decent friends in the process ,4,relationships
Spazzy19,i am child free and i promote couple time ,3,relationships
Spazzy19,lol i would totally do this too i need a microscope ,62,sex
Spazzy19,they apparently already despise you and it mutual better question is why she is not pressing charges when her brother punched her in the face ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,i think you will find there are plenty of people out there that have varying lifestyle dynamics bdsm communities exist on reddit too if you want more support ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,yeah it not ok to say your partner is annoying when you try to show a quick moment of affection i would not have taken that well at all ,3,relationships
Spazzy19,yep my ex had really bad impulsive spending habits until he started taking meds he also an engineer but still he bought a house and had to do a fair amount of renovations last summer then he bought a 3d printer on a whim then a 600 chemistry set in nov then a 900 guitar in dec an 800 portable keyboard in march he starting to dabble in the chemistry set but his interests are all over the place and he likes expensive stuff and those were just the bigger ticket items i do not like to be in debt except for houses etc i almost moved in with him but instead we broke up because my gut forewarned me about future problems that would stress me out i love that he keeps busy and constantly wants to improve and learn but i cannot handle that much spending ,4,relationships
Spazzy19,he sounds like my recent ex bf who got diagnosed with adhd in november as an adult throws himself into hyperfocus on these things but now he into becoming the next warren buffet or elon musk it was frustrating and i try to be supportive even now he struggled with balancing time with me and his passions and projects too i would see him most evenings after 7 30 and usually he had all of sunday to do his things but i am definitely a person who loves to spend time with a partner my ex bf also wants to be like these people but also wants to have 3 kids he recognizes elon musk is a workaholic and does not want to be like that yet refuses to give up on his dreams and who am i to say he should i just could not do it between differences in spending financial philosophies and kids we had irreconcilable differences in addition i know i would be more of a realist regarding his dreams and be freaky about him risking so much money on a dream that might not pan out he should be with someone less risk adverse and who does not mind going along with his dreams or raising kids without a lot of his time you have to determine what is best for you the break hurts but sometimes it what needs to happen so you are both happy ,12,relationships
Spazzy19,wtf is wrong with your friends you made the right decision if he was perfect he would not have been in bed with another woman he would not call you dumb he would not say you are never going to leave him ditch him and get new friends too that is all sorts of red flag territory ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,yep time to split i had to do this two weeks ago because he wanted 3 kids and i would prefer none i would have tried for 1 but i would have been resentful if that had not been enough and i was left a single mom ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,ahahaha ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,what a tool next time you see him you should tell him you will get to empathize with him about his situation with his ex since you are breaking up with him wow no joke though he played his hand and i would not trust him not only is he being shallow but it possible he will trade you in once your appearance starts aging one of my best friends had that happen to her after 6 years with a guy she was 4 years older and he started freaking out about her age after she turned 30 ended up cheating on her and ditching her for a 19 yr old ,7,relationships
Spazzy19,uhhh i do not get it i would love for my parents to be into this stuff and am totally jealous of your upcoming trip they probably are too honestly or it could just be that they do not think of vacations the same way people used to make comments when i would answer that for various anniversaries my ex husband and i would choose to go hiking around rural nevada or other places relatively nearby apparently it is not considered romantic do it build amazing memories and just know that the haters are not people you want around ,1,relationships

Spazzy19,my first real boyfriend and i waited 2 5 years to have sex i was 20 and he was 18 he was not religious but his family was huge on reputation and he wanted to wait until marriage we messed around a lot and i performed oral regularly but no actual intercourse i am hl and could not wait until we could finally be together so one valentine day celebration he decided it was the perfect moment and we made love i was in heaven it was beautiful even though it was short lived lol i could not wait to have more but the next day he woke up and said 3 things to me 1 can we pretend this did not happen 2 we cannot do this again until we are married another 2 5 yrs away or more 3 promise you wo not tell a soul about this it finally dawned on me he was ashamed but i took it like a stab to the heart i had been filled with such joy and love and that was his response soul crushing we broke up shortly thereafter since then my other 2 partnerships including a 12 yr relationship with my ex husband became sexual pretty quickly but i have to know the person for a while before getting physical to determine if they are worthwhile my recent ex bf and i have known each other for 2 years but dated for the past 7 months my marriage had suffered from sexual issues related to his porn addiction so having someone to have sex with frequently and lovingly was amazing i miss it but i am not going to just jump into bed with whomever ,1,RedPillWomen

Spazzy19,she may accept it and want to leave but do not be surprised if she chooses to stay either she may have already had inklings and has just ignored them in order to keep life as is my mother does this and it drives me crazy sorry you are having to deal with this burden ,8,relationships
Spazzy19,i do not think you can it in your parent best interest to keep your brother safe i hope your sister can get some therapy and rebuild her life but i would honestly stay out of it because otherwise there will continue to be rifts and resentment support and love your sister but remember the effect she will have on your brother ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,i have pictures of me and my ex husband together 12 yrs and my recent ex boyfriend and me too i do not delete events or people from my life and would never do that to satisfy a future partner however those would not be my main profile pictures so if that the case i would simply ask if he going to change it because that rather weird ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,no kidding all but two people i have known get into the medical profession have let themselves go it pretty bad in some cases and i honesty have issues wondering how people are supposed to take health advice from individuals who obviously do not practice what they preach but i absolutely agree setting a routine and following a schedule watching diet etc will help people find time for what is important do not nag her but encourage her to take care of herself touch her help coordinate healthy meals things like that ,6,relationships
Spazzy19,also once you are out of the immediate threat i would highly recommend finding support through cosa which deals with partners and family members friends of sex addicts i was married to one for 10 years and he was not abusive or as far gone as your so but it certainly did a number on my self esteem etc if there are no local groups in your area look to the internet resources and get some books on partners of sex addicts to help get you back to where you want to be you are not alone ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,obviously you do not like it so drop him and find someone who treats you the way you want and deserve ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,during a separation with my now ex husband almost 7 yrs ago i went on a sushi date with a guy i would met doing a stake out for a pi company the first time we would hung out and gotten ice cream and i enjoyed his company sushi was fine but when he went to pay his card declined he started freaking out trying to figure out what had happened to his money and though maybe his old apartment complex had charged him more because he would recently broken a lease i paid instead we were supposed to walk next door to a movie theater afterward but he opted to check his funds at the bank he was able to withdraw 20 and felt better but then realized he had nothing left he was fretting hardcore while i stood there so i suggested that maybe it would be best to go get on his computer to see the transaction history to know what happened he turned looked at me and told me to shut the f up and to not mother him i was floored and started to leave he caught up to me and apologized and because i was in such a shitty place i accepted it and still invited him home with me but never had sex with him thankfully the next morning i woke up and asked myself wtf was wrong with me and once he left never spoke to him again then got therapy i would even made him aware that he had an oddly shaped mole on his back and he got pissy about the mothering thing again ok ,1,AskReddit
Spazzy19,oh i love you i am child free and i despise when people look at me and tell me i am incapable of having an opinion on a matter just because i do not have children i still have a brain i still took behavioral psychology classes i can still see that giving your kid everything he she wants and picking him her up whenever there are tears instead of letting the kid self soothe is bad uggh thank you ,8,relationships
Spazzy19,that not necessarily true but that really sucks it happened to you are y all still together ,56,AskReddit
Spazzy19,ouch why do you stay ,3,AskReddit
Spazzy19,initially i was going to say no red flags but i suppose that not true we were young and long distance as he was in the military but we dated for 2 years and got married at age 22 did not realize he would developed a bad porn habit while stationed in iraq which later filled his boredom back home after hours when we first met we had a lot of sex which i was excited about because my previous bf had wanted to wait until marriage and then horribly rejected me due to his own shame when he opted to make love to me we would been together for 2 5 yrs too so it was not like he would just met me in any case i loved being sexual but i noticed my ex husband could never make love it was always carnal sex or quickies and never about my pleasure he also was std paranoid but he would never told his first gf that the reason he would broken up with her was because he would messed around with someone on the other side of the country where he was stationed naive me thought by him telling her after the fact it would mean he would not do it to me because i value honesty after his deployment i wanted to wait to have sex again until we were married thinking the build up would help the quality of sex it was about 8 months away it did not the quality was the same but the quantity diminished even more and i could not figure out why a 22 yr old newlywed man was turning down my advances i have a hl especially when there was no physical attraction issue a month later he developed a crush on a coworker at his new job after he would gotten out of the corp and we would moved cross country to where his family is located it lasted a few months a year later he got a crush on a different girl which lasted 8 months a year after that he got a crush on his high school friend wife he would reconnected with which ended up being reciprocated that was a super shitty period of time when we nearly got divorced because he had a full affair with that woman but then we discovered that he actually had a sex addiction i thought he was full of it and excusing himself but he admitted he had a huge collection of pornography sitting on the exterior hard drive sitting on my desk that i was never aware of then i read my life in a book called out of the shadows which made me break down how could i have lived with someone for 4 years and never known he never showed interest in other women until after we were married but it all made sense that the game was over he needed a new fix a new conquest we separated for about 8 months and each did a lot of work and reconciled it lasted another 5 5 6 years when he just realized he never been romantically attracted to me he would also fallen in love with one of his high school students no sex involved and i would had enough i do not regret those years whatsoever but i do resent at times the different person he became after we were married due to the addiction i would not have married him if i would known he was going to be having emotional affairs or could not perform properly without pornography ,4,AskReddit
Spazzy19,yes it called coaddiction because you become so involved trying to pick up the addict pieces considering you have been in other relationships that did not end well this is not surprising unfortunately al anon is the group to help you cope with an alcoholic in your life ,19,relationships
Spazzy19,you are in an addiction cycle that why it confusing he needs to seek help but so do you ,25,relationships
Spazzy19,go to al anon meetings because you are falling into the codependency trap tell him to stay at his parents and take care of yourself since it obvious he does not care about you or your relationship currently any idea what triggered this behavior on september ,21,relationships
Spazzy19,it sucks my recent ex bf was not close to your gf with money and he responsible but a primary reason we split because we have very different views on money and spending your gf should be selling her horse and if not then leasing it to other people to use for extra cash not spending to go to shows and not prioritizing your daughter time to cut back on spending you are also enabling her if you pick up the daycare difference your parents are dropping she needs to budget for daycare and pay for it before anything else ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,everyone is enabling her so why should she change child support might be worth the peace of mind of not having to deal with parenting two people ,3,relationships
Spazzy19,uhh trust me even me being recently divorced i can tell you there better out there you just have to believe you are worth it ,3,relationship_advice
Spazzy19,i do not own any and absolutely love horses but i said awwww at him being attacked especially while walking away ,2,gifs
Spazzy19,absolutely if you are interested in understanding where she coming from you might ask about borrowing any books she has on cosa and partners of sex addicts i also think there a difference between getting drunk and just drinking maybe you can come to a happy medium on it if you opt to stay together ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,oh but it does speaking as the former wife of a sex addict porn and affairs she is protecting herself and being healthy about setting boundaries if she did not and you just willy nilly watched porn despite her request and she stayed then it leads her into a hell hole that hard to get out of i personally watch porn on a rare occasion and asked my ex husband to stop collecting and not allow himself to get emotionally close to other women i would have preferred to have no porn but i did not think that was entirely realistic after a few years he did both again and we split amicably i refuse to live that way again where my touch has zero impact on his body where my advances are brushed aside because he cannot get it up unless he thinks about porn i am extremely hl where he could only really kiss me in the quick throws of passion that were 98 carnal and all on his schedule and never about me where i am with someone who cannot actually make love because his brain wiring is so jacked up he cannot mix emotions with sex it is soul crushing to be the partner of a sex addict it hits you to the core and makes you think that you are not good enough to captivate your partner that you are not loved and that you should perform acts or wear clothes that make you uncomfortable just to please your partner without boundaries your self esteem diminishes and you start to believe this is all you deserve and you cannot do it on your own to leave so the boundaries are absolutely about her and keeping her in a healthy mindset and relationship if you do not want to abide by them then find someone who it does not bother i am recently single again and i can guarantee you that pornography is at least a yellow flag for me if i want to have sex very regularly and am attractive then i do not really see why it necessary anyway my ex bf had trouble keeping up at times but he provided me with a wonderful emotional sexual relationship he stopped watching porn before we even dated because he felt so emotionally numb looking at it ,3,relationships
Spazzy19,setting a boundary is not forcing him to change if he does not want to then he should not but then they both accept they are not meant to be together ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,i do not usually say this but what the fuck are you serious i cannot even imagine all the twisted emotions you are experiencing but to add to it zero support from your family hell no look into community resources and work on ending your husband support apply for medicaid get the abortion without anyone knowledge and say you had a miscarriage if you need more time to get things in order this is something i would have great difficulty ever forgiving i am so sorry you are going through this ,10,relationships

Spazzy19,nah he definitely not a tool but we just want different things i am definitely getting a cat i was married for 10 years to a guy who was allergic and then my bf was allergic no more of that lol ,16,relationships
Spazzy19,or do not get married yikes ,8,relationships
Spazzy19,yes and i would be but i cannot get pregnant easily due to hormonal issues and quite frankly i do not want to be a parent to young children that late in the game i have never had the desire to have children and would prefer to be child free i could have potentially compromised with 1 but not 2 3 and then what because i did not want more he goes to find a woman that will i would be resentful and that not fair to me or the child either ,26,relationships
Spazzy19,i have never had the desire to be a mother and have fertility issues so it not like i can just pop them easily that why i said potentially one but definitely not three zero desire to put my body through that i will stick to my goal of eventually fostering teenagers instead i have never understood the craze of must having your own children i was open to adoption if my ex wanted children but he wanted his own ,47,relationships
Spazzy19,i am 33 and still share various things with my closest girlfriends and even my brother i think it significantly depends on the dynamic the romantic relationship and the topic ,11,relationships
Spazzy19,i get it i told people too because i was so excited my best friend waited 5 years until she was married to have sex she was my freshman year of college ra so i looked up to her too but it was not like i was out tramping around she understood and did not judge she held on to her own desires and plan to be celibate until marriage because that was her choice and she was proud of it she not perfect she changed her mind about various things in her life if you want to share it with your friend do so sit her down and say you have got news to tell her but do not act ashamed of your choice to not wait personally if i had a friendship like yours i would be more hurt that you felt you could not share and kept me out of the loop than from anything about the act itself ,19,relationships
Spazzy19,my bf and i just broke up because i do not want kids and he wants 2 i actually do not know if i can have them anyway and i might have considered one but not more i am already 33 and he 6 yrs younger we knew going into it that we had differences but i just cannot wrap my head around having that many kids so late in my life or paying a ton of money for surrogates we broke up last week and it really really sucks but you are absolutely right one or the other of you would end up resentful you deserve to be able to have children and he does not i hope my ex bf figures out his spending habits and finds a woman who will bear him many children meanwhile i will stick to getting a cat and living my life this way until a more compatible person enters the picture it sucks he been my best friend for several years and now i am aching because i cannot see him often or cannot snuggle kiss etc time and space apart may heal your pain enough to become friends again but for a while you are going to be emotionally charged especially if you have to continue living together take care of yourself hug ,130,relationships

Spazzy19,not really ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,marriage is really not that different than cohabitation but if you feel you cannot trust your partner not to screw you over should you split then i would question whether you are in the right relationship my ex husband of 10 yrs and i divorced amicably last year we did not touch each other financials we actually filed taxes together but separately in march and we would be ok loaning each other money if needed it unfortunate he realized that romantically he wanted something else because we made great partners otherwise my bf and i have wildly different attitudes about money and it can be rather frustrating ,27,relationships
Spazzy19,i would say definitely before you move in together but at the time y all discuss that decision is your gf ok with no marriage being on the table i would personally question whether it because you did not trust me with your money and that might change my thinking on the situation but if she does not want to get married then by all means ,28,relationships
Spazzy19,and that totally ok we each have preferences but if you anticipate having female companionship long term you just want to make sure you are able to make concessions that allow her to be happy too you can be conservative with your spending and still live comfortably if you are capable of striking a balance then that the best my grandparents lived through the depression and actually have a substantial amount of interest income however they were so cheap that they refused to pay for longer home care because it was expensive grandfather fell in the night almost 4 years ago developed pneumonia and died a few days later they could have easily afforded it do not be like that ,13,relationships
Spazzy19,the fact that his brother could put him in line in a physical manner also is quite disturbing in the grand scheme of things where would they both learn it it could make the situation better it just flat out worse physicality may be all your friend knows however that obviously does not make it right he an adult and should know this is not remotely appropriate talk to him outside of an incident you just witnessed and express your concerns suggest counseling or anger management he might get offended but at least he knows where you stand you may just have to walk away from the friendship if he refuses to see reason ,4,relationships
Spazzy19,i do not think you need to go into details quite yet not because i think she suddenly going to turn into a gold digger but because that can add a lot of pressure to her and potentially make her feel inadequate it also pretty early on in your relationship so i would probably wait to fill her in on the specifics until you have gotten engaged i would say it sufficient to say you are aiming to retire in your 30 are financially comfortable but prefer to live a basic lifestyle i am with you there minus that much income i could win the lottery tomorrow and would not change much of anything about my lifestyle just save and invest i would still want to go to work you could probably pick up more tabs but i think it important to let her financially contribute too especially if she wants to i know i am financially independent and have struggled finding a balance btw letting a guy pay for things because he wants to and feeling like a mooch usually i offer every other outing or will cook etc but given the disparity in income i do not think it bad for you to compensate in the financial realm more often ,45,relationships
Spazzy19,no kidding i am dying ,6,relationships

Spazzy19,based on what i read on the news he apparently tried bringing a laptop through without following typical procedures i really do not understand why it could not have been taken out scanned on it own boy sent through with a shorter pat down this really seemed like overkill he was in a freaking t shirt and athletic shorts good grief and family sent on their way i believe i read the rest of the delay was based on mom reaction to this pay down no i do not think he was groping for fun but it definitely very weird ,1,videos
Spazzy19,wow i am 5 inches taller than my boyfriend 5 3 without wearing heels he encourages me to water them when i want and loves my height my ex husband and i were the same height and i wished he was slightly taller and he wished i was slightly shorter it did not prevent us from having a 12 year relationship but i guess it goes to show you are with the right person when the disparity does not matter ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,you could also look into what i am doing and find a potential investment property get a renter that pays a little more than the mortgage etc and not only will you have additional income and equity you will also have a property you can go to if you need to in the future i am about to move in with my boyfriend but i will only contribute 300 mo i am currently paying 945 mo so it in my interest since i had to sell my house this past summer due to divorce i have got equity to use but have you sat down and talked to him about your concerns does he even realize you want him to inquire it seems like it should be obvious but you never know ,1,relationship_advice

Spazzy19,my boyfriend is less adventurous than me even yesterday being his bday i had plans to meet him at his house in lingerie bj and swallow sex whatever i texted him about 3 hrs to the end of day and asked him to think about what he wanted sexually he was confused and then responded indifferently lady boner killer i cannot even dirty text him to build anticipation because he just does not think that way he later asked if he could just have a massage which i was fine with because it his day i know he wary about sexually rejecting me but he explained that i throw more sex at him than he knows what to do with lol he also has adhd and maybe actually some type of autistic type traits like sensory overload issues and other quirks that i have to work around so when he focused at work he does not know how to respond to me he not in a sexual mood at that time i get it but it still disappointing i enjoy a build up i enjoy spontaneous sex at any time his has to be after noon and preferably as we are going to bed i like dirty talk some kinky sex switch ups and being way more adventurous than him but i love him and he considerate of my sexual satisfaction my ex husband was all about himself so i never got off despite more carnal sex so i guess you just have to weigh whether it worth it to you you can also have him try explaining his seemingly lack of interest it could be something totally different than you imagine ,5,sex

Spazzy19,living together is not really all that different before or after marriage there are adjustments either way but it whether or not you want to overcome ticks you may not have already noticed depends on how committed you are to the relationship with or without marriage honestly it sounds more like you knew there were issues that make you hesitate and wanted to see if they would change etc that a recipe for disaster imo ,5,relationships

Spazzy19,you take what he said to heart you look deep within yourself to see what your actions did to contribute to this breakup make changes and move on sounds like there have been a ton of ongoing issues and the fact you are only concerned about him breaking up with you via text after convincing him the other day over the phone to stay rather than what his main points are speaks volumes sometimes you can have crazy strong feelings for one another and still not be compatible ,9,relationships

Spazzy19,also i find it interesting you speak so highly of your sister friend but do not do the same of your gf you basically describe her as a nuisance why are you dating her if that your mentality it almost comes across like you just want the alone time with the family friend since you have so much in common ,77,relationships
Spazzy19,i would be irritated too you are basically conveying that after 3 years you do not consider her family enough to include on a trip what are you going to do when you get married in the future her or someone else you say it not about her but it really is since you are afraid her presence will screw up the dynamic you might actually find everyone gets along great and build some fabulous memories instead you are keeping her at a distance ,54,relationships
Spazzy19,oh i fully agree if one is not ready then they should not do it it was just very annoying for people to assume we were too young to be married etc we were on the same page and these two definitely are not ,9,relationships
Spazzy19,i feel like you should not have moved in together until these issues were resolved it definitely not fair to her when she clearly ready to make a commitment to you more fights are going to ensue out of frustration ,7,relationships

Spazzy19,lol thanks yeah i started looking around and putting an offer down but it fell through because they eventually realized it had to be a cash deal so last week he asked me to move in with him at the end of june it will be nice with him and his roommate albeit cramped but it will save me a ton of money too so i am still looking for an investment property for passive income instead he very good with me and being supportive and strong i only felt overwhelmed that first day and then all was well ,2,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,i get what you are saying but i do not consider my housing situation to be stupid shit it a big deal and more change it not like coming home with pointless drama at work where the wife gf stirs the pot or something of a similar trivial nature me trusting my bf with no plan of action is not going to get me anywhere i believe in god and having gone through a 12 step program for partners of addicts i can believe that things will happen as they may that being said i was working on a plan to solve my stress he suggested i talk to his mom who a realtor which i did but that not going to miraculously change the housing bubble here or where i could afford and he weird about poorer areas of town and would not want to visit as frequently despite me telling him it no big deal i used to run public housing in our city so i am very familiar he did not immediately ask me to move in either because he already has a roommate but i think you are still missing the point that women do not always want something fixed not everything is within our control to be fixed anyway women want and desire emotional support and a partner who can provide that when necessary you belittling how i felt that day i get it and do not take it personally just because it seems crazy to you is the mistake some men make and then cannot figure out why the woman is mad we feel what we feel and basically being told those feelings are stupid is not going to help the situation it serves to only shift those negative emotions to you think what you may but it easier to say i understand than wtf are you worried about you are being silly and stir the emotional pot p what is interesting to me is that i also provide this service for my bf listening rather he does not typically complain but he uses me as a sounding board for ideas or when he stressed at work he vents a little i listen and do what i can to make his day easier i cannot change anything at work except occasionally suggest he communicate with a particular person etc it on him to actually fix if he has it within his power you probably do the same thing but do not convey it with as much emotion as women should we shut you down and say we do not want to hear about your issues since they do not relate to us should we just tell you that your work family friend stress is pointless and silly or trust me it will pass no for one i would imagine you would get pretty peeved but secondly that kind of dynamic does not foster good bonding and intimacy yes i am sure it will pass but right now i feel stress you are there to help one another ,3,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,not knowing her husband was an avid sports watcher is weird to me even for a person who did not cohabitate you should date long enough and thoroughly enough to have already ascertained that information prior to getting married ,3,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,i actually wrote my senior thesis paper on this topic back in 2006 the stats have changed but the concepts i am sure are about the same honestly there are a ton of factors but the main thing i walked away with was that it all about attitude in the us there seems to be more of an attitude of well let live together for at least 6 months and then we will see about getting married it a conscious test and creates a barrier between the couple you already know things about your partner that are of concern you are not going to change him her so why bother it the test attitude that had the highest probability of divorce later on other times people just moved in too soon jumped into marriage before the honeymoon phase ended and then realized they really were not all that compatible my ex husband and i did not cohabitate and the things i learned that ultimately ended our marriage addiction were not uncovered until after 4 years of marriage and 6 years together there never a guarantee either way but i do not regret not cohabitating nor do i feel it would have shown me anything 4 years of living together married did at the end of june i am going to move in with my bf it is not my ideal preference as i would like to be engaged at least but i am actually getting excited about it it works out because my landlord had to sell my condo but he would been thinking about asking me for a little bit already i would not want to just move in haphazardly because i was going to be homeless and force it if i felt that way i would just keep looking for another place to buy or rent ,1,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,sometimes women just have to get their feelings anxiety off their chests by talking and then we can generally tackle the problem if it an option i am not typically flustered easily so if i am freaking out then i want and need my boyfriend to listen for example earlier this month my landlord informed me that he has to sell my condo and based on the prices in my area i am not willing to buy it myself now what you have got to understand is that last february started a whole upheaval of my life i went from being married for 10 years living in an owned house for 7 5 years etc to having to find my own place selling the house over the summer moving and adjusting getting divorced and just being in a pretty bad emotional state because i was also worried about my ex husband because he fell in love with one of his high school students i am a person that cherishes stability thankfully my martial arts partner helped me through all the transitions and we ended up dating eventually now i have been told i will have to pack and move again after i have finally come to enjoy where i am living and am feeling like my normal self i started stressing because rent is more expensive than owning but on my own i do not want to pay more than 150k since i can put 20 down but the main areas i can afford are more ghetto ish etc when i told my boyfriend he first started out saying everything will be fine i know that but at the moment i was a bundle of emotions feeling like a gypsy or regressing in my life more and more my ex suggested i buy a condo in his complex which is literally next door to our first apartment complex when we were married it definitely affordable part of me felt angry and resentful because the thought of doing that basically made me think well what was the point in going through all the hell and pain if we are just going to be neighbors in our old hood my ex and i have a good relationship but it was too much at that moment needless to say my bf quickly figured out i just needed someone to listen and not just solve my problem i just needed him to say he understood why i was feeling crazy and anxious he did a great job and since that day i have been fine i am ok with helpful problem solving but i also need to know i am understood and not feel like my concerns are illegitimate or casually brushed aside ,2,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,same he specifically told me why he did it when we first started dating when i asked out of sheer confusion it made my heart melt we both train mma and although he 5 inches shorter than me he built like an ox and i know how hard he can punch i feel safe in his presence ,3,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,my sister in law room at her mom house used to be the same way it made everyone else twitch she never wanted anyone over and no one could figure out how to walk through there without killing ourselves my ex husband and i helped her semi deep clean once and remove a few pieces of her child size furniture she was about 30 at this point there were inch thick or more dust build ups in areas etc she honestly just has a mild hoarding problem she finally moved out and keeps her studio pretty tidy but it took actually starting from scratch for her to cope with cleaning up keep granted most of her stuff is still stored at her mom house in the garage maybe get some help remove everything for a day clean and start putting things back in the rest put in storage ,1,relationships

Spazzy19,i love chiropractic care and finally got my bf to go too i would gladly accept an adjustment from someone who was qualified who offered it knowing i was in pain i would be more concerned why your bf is so hung up on this rather than acknowledging you got some relief from the encounter age does not matter between you and the former coworker it a moot point anyway your bf is being stubborn and insecure ,19,relationships
Spazzy19,i absolutely agree and i have the same mentality as you ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,wow i am so sorry my ex husband emotionally cheated on me several times in our first 4 years of marriage and ultimately had a physical affair i was ready to leave when he told me about his pornography addiction and had me read a book that made me realize the porn and affairs were related i opted to work through it and we had a happy enough 6 more years together his affair was short lived but it still hurt like hell the lies and betrayal hurt more but two years screw that where he did not feel an ounce of shame where he kept giving her the compliments and his emotional attention my ex would get ill and could not maintain the facade due to guilt and lies your boyfriend did not lose sleep or feel anything in two years until he got caught i would not go back it sucks and hurts beyond all recognition be angry you can forgive him later if you wish but you have every right to feel used and taken for granted because you were i am angry for you because it sounds like you were doing everything right but it just was not good enough whatever find someone who appreciates everything you do and wants to compliment the shit out of you ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,i am not i am a woman i am specifically talking about a subset of women that i personally find extremely uninteresting to each his her own but i do not want to associate with groups of women who excitedly talk about the kinds of foods their kids are eating and the consistency of the kid poop then they look at me like i am weird for having been in college at the time not for me ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,part of the reason i have been child free is because i was so put off by seeing women i knew become total moms and lose everything else interesting about them i usually ended up hanging out with the husbands and boyfriends because the women could not relate to me being in college at 20 and not wanting to have kids right away this was when my ex husband was enlisted marine corps i have seen other girlfriends still be interesting and others go by the wayside i get it it a huge change in life style i am always happy to play with my best friend kids and hear about what is going on but i also need my friend to listen and know more about what is going on with her job family interests etc i completely understand your concern and hope she can balance it for both of your sakes just tell her that you love her and it important to you that she remain more to you than just a good mom you need a supportive interesting wife gf too ,47,relationships
Spazzy19,no what he saying is that he wants his gf wife to remain interesting and not just be mom he is concerned she wo not also be gf wife who he fell in love with if she can balance it then he does not mind her being sahm but he will lose interest if she only identifies as a mom and nothing else ,21,relationships
Spazzy19,you can list them as beneficiaries in case something happens to you ,5,relationships
Spazzy19,if you are not comfortable with it then just tell him you are very tired need to rest and will reschedule if you are worried about him getting sick well it on him i disregarded my now boyfriend concern when he was sick 6 months ago and brought him soup watched a movie and cuddled i did not mind even kissing his forehead and cheeks we were not officially dating yet but i did not care i did not get sick either he probably likes you fyi but even if he does not it sounds like he wants to be a good friend ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,i do this for friends too ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,my ex husband sounds a bit like your bf and we are 33 granted i love me some got battlestar galactica star trek and star wars i have also read the wheel of time four times through but i also enjoyed the twilight series i know i know whatever he used to give me shit but mostly just in jest though one day he ran around the house pretending to hold a cape over his face saying forever in a dramatic foreign accent lol he also cued sparkling any time he saw me reading or watching it i would get crap i also enjoyed the vampire diaries though he admitted it was much more interesting he used to give me crap on occasion for only reading fantasy instead of philosophical scientific or historical books or self improvement type physical books things like that they were his passions not mine we once did attempt to watch an episode of the kardashians just to see what it was all about ouy not our thing hopefully he can overcome it but if he cannot respect and love you for you then it might be time to go your separate ways it what happened to me and my ex ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,you actually do not need to explain it to anyone it rude and inappropriate if he says something again just shut him down with something like mike i know you think you are being funny but it getting old and i have never found it funny please stop ,19,relationships
Spazzy19,lol this sounds ridiculous if this is actually legit then forget him and get yourself some damn therapy and 12 step coaddict help then you will know what to do and actually do it ,3,relationships
Spazzy19,my ex husband did this to me except he did not leave when he had his crushes and finally a physical affair he was leaving me for his high school friend wife when he got to his new apartment and sat down and went wtf he realized he was leaving someone who was good to him and who he was not unhappy with to chase something newer so he stopped he also did not want to lose his best friend and the history we would established shortly thereafter he confessed his pornography problem to me and we delved into the world if sex addiction i never suspected but could not figure out why he was not interested too much anymore at such a young age 22 26 we lasted another really nice 6 yrs but ultimately he started going down the path again even if you do not have the same problems there something within you affecting your self esteem and need for external worthiness have you gone to talk to a professional ,4,relationships
Spazzy19,been there done that and just finally divorced my best friend after 10 years of marriage hugs you should check out the help from cosa and read books for partners of sex addicts you are not alone he can seek help through saa and reading material by patrick carnes out of the shadows does a great job explaining the addiction we were together for 6 yrs married for 4 when all of this came to light i felt like an idiot not realizing he was collecting porn when all i wanted to do was be intimate it dropped off when we got married and then he started having emotional physical affairs afterward which broke my heart any time we were intimate it was rushed carnal and he could not make love it got significantly better once we both got help and counseling but it took a lot of time and work it will take time for you to heal but it important to focus on the fact that his issues are not about you easier said than done but it true ,8,relationships
Spazzy19,if she got 1080 left over for whatever even after the weed she can still afford a ticket you just sound pissed about the habit in general i do not smoke at all but unless she developed the habit after you married her please shut up about it she probably tired of you hounding her too you act like it came out of nowhere and did not have a choice in marrying someone who smoked it ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,ok tbh your gf sounds a bit much and fairly manipulative however could you provide a bit of clarification as to what you will be doing whether she met your family and how they feel about her i ask because after a year of dating i would probably at least be miffed if i had a good relationship with the family but was not included on a trip i get it you are not married but if you are planning anything long term then it considerate to include the person if the person is able to go my bf and i have been officially dating since the end of october and we are planning an international trip over thanksgiving this year with his family if i had to work though i would be sad i could not join but certainly would not throw a shit fit if he went without me ,1,relationship_advice
Spazzy19,we have always been best friends he was actually my rebound from a ltr but we dated for 2 years when we got married we acknowledged we loved each other but were not in love with each other we just thought we would skipped the butterfly feelings that fade but shortly thereafter he started developing crushes on other women four years later after an actual affair he admitted he also had a pornography addiction and was always chasing fantasy we almost split then but we worked through it all together and were happy enough another 6 years but he never apparently felt romantically attracted to me and viewed me more as a bro it affected the romantic sexual a side of our relationship eventually he got tired of hurting me knowing he would never be able to give me a complete love that he knew i deserved so he suggested a divorce it was hard and still makes me sad but it was extremely amicable i am happier in my new relationship but i miss the daily interaction i used to have with my ex too we have a very unique intimate bond that i will always cherish he obviously feels like crap after realizing all this after so many years but he just wants to see me happy my bf was actually friends with us while we were married and we all train at the same mma studio so it really throws people for a loop how amicable we are together even my in laws are amazing my mil was very safe about the split but understood she told me that she did not divorce me and that i am still get dil his siblings are all supportive and i still attend family functions and have now slowly started bringing my bf the siblings were fine right away but it taken my mil a bit to adjust even though she already knew him and likes him too ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,i did this when i got married back when i was 22 got married after 2 years long distance moved across the country and started our lives together my ex husband is from here so he already managed to have a job lined up after he got out of the military my best advice is to be patient and understanding it was a little daunting for me to have just graduated college moved to an unfamiliar place find an apartment find a job and acclimate to living with my husband there will be a lot of fun moments putting everything together and nesting as a couple it will be great to see your best friend all the time but you will start to get on each other nerves more too respect each other space communicate i found this easy having done the ldr and be kind congrats ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,same my ex husband is still one of my best friends and he my medical emergency contact and i trust him with financial things he has a key to my place as well we were together for 12 years and married for 10 it been a difficult transition and i have grieved not being able to have my best friend in the way i used to but i have moved on to a much happier romantic relationship he is happy for me ,6,relationships

Spazzy19,nope you are not overreacting my ex husband went to a female friend dorm to watch a movie in the early years of our marriage i was not thrilled but i got increasing annoyed when he was not home by 11 he thought i was overreacting for saying it was inappropriate for a married man to be in a girl dorm that late they did not do anything bc she was never aware of his feelings interested but he definitely had a crush on her for months not ok ,2,relationship_advice

Spazzy19,i am much more sexually open i think than my partner the only thing i really wish we could incorporate is toy play but he very hung up on feeling like it should be all him that satisfies me during sex i cannot blame him for his feelings but it disappointing sometimes he was initially hung up that i had one whatsoever but when he realized how high my drive is he does a great job meeting my needs though he got over it because he knew he was physically incapable of keeping up that much honestly i do not really mind i recently divorced last year after 12 yrs being together from a sex addict who could only perform sporadic always carnal sex sometimes sex but never making love no real foreplay and my sexual needs were in the dumps i always got myself off afterwards too i am immensely happy to be with someone who responds to my touch who is concerned about my satisfaction who desires me on a romantic sexual level and can make love he can be aggressive at times sometimes i want humiliating rough sex but i would rather be with someone who is not going to objectify me and cares than have more carnal sex etc he not totally vanilla i just think adding a toy would be great for both of us ,2,sex
Spazzy19,lol no worries he feels like and identifies as the bad guy and would not even let me split the divorce cost i just have learned to have a lot of compassion for people in these situations even for the one causing the problems there is generally a lot of pain for both parties of course there are those out there that are total sociopathic douchebags too ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,it is and it unfortunately makes lots of people uncomfortable because it so rare my boyfriend was actually friends with us both while we were married so that adds to a more interesting dynamic because all three of us train at the same mma academy i am sure people who do not know the details actually think i left my husband for my boyfriend oh well he is still very much one of my best friends and i trust him with everything he still my medical emergency contact we have no financial drama and just worked out filing separate tax returns together and we just have a very special bond do not get me wrong the split hurt both of us and there have been moments of great sadness and bitterness because of changes and losing that person i loved but it still there albeit different i think it just takes a lot of introspection and work to get to this place obviously rejection unbelievably hurt and people would have told me to divorce years ago but despite that the experience allowed both of us to work on ourselves and even grow closer together he even had multiple emotional affairs and a physical one before reaching that place because neither of us realized what was going on ironically the affairs brought us to a more intimate level with one another after all the secrets were brought to light ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,the unfortunate part is that he really is not he just had a lot of problems i would have stayed married despite the lack of sexual satisfaction but he wanted to release me to find someone who could completely meet my needs to this day he very much loves and cares about me he is extremely happy i have found satisfaction elsewhere ,5,relationships
Spazzy19,i have always been in a gown and had a lap cover too ,2,sex
Spazzy19,it scary when my ex husband sex addict and i divorced this past summer i felt overwhelmed despite his issues he would been my best friend for 12 years we are still close but i am now at peace with our decision shortly thereafter i fell into a fwb situation with one of my best guy friends bc we trusted one another and i wanted to feel desirable again and just have some freaking sex with someone who wanted to have sex with me i have always struggled with external sources of validation so it a fine line to balance it ultimately developed into my relationship i like you have an extremely high drive even my bf struggles to keep up and i am respectful to his energy levels and desires if he not in the mood i do not press after about 2 3 days if we have not had sex i will tell him that i would like to be ravished and then we are back on track i would say on average though it 5 days wk i could do multiple a day though but the difference is that he wants to be with me non sexually and sexually he responds to my touch can make love and is a considerate lover it night and day comparatively do not lose hope just because your self esteem has taken understandable damage i will never settle again for a shitty sex life ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,yeah my ex husband was the same way i just resorted to taking care of myself but i was resentful of it he would not get angry if i mentioned it but he would get performance anxiety if he tried to perform without him initiating but when he initiated it was generally always carnal little to no foreplay and anything i would told him over and over again that i would like was tossed out the window ,14,relationships
Spazzy19,it great that you have improved so much from therapy i would also recommend looking into resources cosa can provide or books for partners of sex addiction i have been there too and it such a soul killing experience it was a relief to find out i was not alone and i slowly built myself up again our marriage even survived through pornography masturbation and an affair through counseling cosa and boundaries classes we had another good 6 years and then common themes cropped up again the thing is if you cannot overcome the destructive impact it had on you then it time to move on he knows he screwed up i do not know if he still masturbating a lot when you are not having sex or whether it just something eating away at you when there are some gaps either way it not fair to either of you holding it over his head is not forgiveness i get it it not easy you do not have to stick around if it triggers you ,2,relationships

Spazzy19,back when i was 20 i was not in a good place having reacted to my boyfriend rejection of me after finally having sex for the first time we waited 2 5 yrs and he was not even religious just concerned about reputation i royally screwed up by running into the arms of the next person who found me attractive i could not handle it and was immediately remorseful i shared it with my best friend that same day and she comforted me then she told me that she was giving me the opportunity to tell my boyfriend or she would i was going to tell him anyway but i did not resent her for that course of action i drove 3 hrs to meet my bf and tell him face to face shittiest day of my life but i would rather own my actions than live disingenuously i am also proud to have my best friend in my life we may not always see eye to eye on everything but integrity and a strong moral compass are what i look for in friends ,14,relationships

Spazzy19,this is all on you if you were my employee i would have a lot of difficulty taking you seriously and would question why you are able to make smart successful choices at work but not in your personal life i would lose respect for you and honestly it would probably affect whether you get promoted in the future you do not need to quit your job you need to quit him and you know it since you are the one with money start finding your own place that he does not know get a tpo notify your work you are leaving an abusive asshole in case he starts problems at work and seek assistance with domestic abuse agencies in the area why you got back together with him is beyond me ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,nope we are still brutally honest with each other he finds me physically attractive nowadays he realized he is not romantically attracted but owns that it a completely personal problem this also occurred after he was already hooked on being in love with a former high school student of his so obviously the attention was focused elsewhere he found me attractive 10 5 yrs ago when we married after dating for two years a month later he had his first crush the game was over he already had the prize and needed to chase something else he was chasing fantasies and porn added to that fantasy he used to say he wished i could have the same talent as mystique from xmen so he could feel like he was with a different woman on a regular basis ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,yes and no in the case of sex addiction yes the masturbating and other behaviors are a symptom of generally a very low self esteem it not accurate to say it just because he not attracted to her my ex husband to this day finds me attractive but his behaviors that started out of boredom anxiety etc eventually warped his brain wiring in his case he assumed once we were married and he had more access to sex that the pornography would go away it did not ,3,relationships

Spazzy19,why did not you discuss this prior to moving in together personally i would have offered to contribute more than just utilities but i would also be pissed if you suddenly wanted to treat me like a regular tenant and charge going rate btw 200 300 fine but you do not have a mortgage to pay and it all your furniture you are changing the dynamic of your relationship maybe that what you want generally people date and live together to progress to a more serious level but it sounds like you do not want to do that ,3,relationships
Spazzy19,my sentiments exactly if it was a regular roommate situation fine but this will change the dynamic of the relationship i would not charge my bf rent on a free house but i would expect him to split utilities groceries and chores any furniture i buy myself or home improvements i make would stay with me or add to my financial improvement later not his also why was not this discussed before they moved in together ,5,relationships
Spazzy19,wait your dad bought you a house in cash so you are not even having to deal with a mortgage but you are resentful about your bf not paying you rent basically you are wanting to make money off your boyfriend to help toward furniture which he would not even get to keep if you split i would assume he also contributing to food and helping with chores he probably did not offer because it paid for and you never asked if i were to move in with my bf i would be expecting to split utilities and some rent but i would expect it to be less because there already his friend renting there and i would have to put my stuff in storage he also is actually paying for a mortgage though would you be resentful if he was not there and you were footing everything on your own sounds like you want him to contribute as a married couple without the benefits of equity or furniture splitting ,7,relationships
Spazzy19,time to work on yourself and move on yes it over and it was over probably longer than 3 months ago ,0,relationships
Spazzy19,definitely not a healthy relationship but you can only do so much if she dead set on ignoring you then she going to have to experience this mistake they both have some serious issues to address you can only control yourself though so if you do not want to get sucked in to their drama or start feeling resentful you are probably going to have to break away from her for a while or forever ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,then honestly if you cannot make it work without the long distance where you could still visit him on the weekends then it does not sound that sustainable anyway i lived 350 miles from my ex husband for two years while we dated it not ideal but if both people are dedicated to making it work it not the end ,18,relationships
Spazzy19,this is where you then need to stop feeling so guilty about your decisions he has decided he too stubborn to move therefore he responsible for his own loneliness you are not responsible for his feelings or actions i know better said than done i get that he comfortable there but you should not give up your life and get into massive debt just to satisfy his needs does he have any pets i get it my family lives across the country from me and i am lucky to see them once a year my parents are starting to get older and have my brother around thankfully but even if they did not they are resourceful and would get involved in the community etc they wish i was closer but i am not willing to go back that way and give up on this state retirement program that i have already vested in yet plus the last 10 5 yrs of my life have been here ,336,relationships

Spazzy19,well my mom met my bf back in september when we would fairly recently just become fwb i had just signed divorce papers and she came out to visit me to offer support we live on opposite coasts so i do not see my family but maybe once a year now it was not bad and he hung out with us a few evenings my mom shared my bed during her visit so he stayed at his house in the evenings he also met my mom sister in late august too when she was in town for a conference in january my bf met my brother and his gf when we all celebrated my bday in vegas it was a longer weekend trip but we all had a good time originally my plan was to take my bf home with me in july to celebrate my grandmother 94th bday my dad bday and my brother bday within the past two weeks that changed to my brother getting married over the weekend i am there so now the poor guy is going to get lambasted with tons of family and friends all at once my dad will like him and actually i believe my neighbor basically my surrogate dad will really like him too my neighbor is the one he really has to impress though lol he already asked my brother for the scoop on my bf my bf knows that my neighbor is that stereotypical dad being protective of his daughter whereas my dad is pretty chill i am looking forward to introducing him to everyone though i met my bf parents when my ex husband and i were invited to his dad western themed bday party sept 2015 so i would had several interactions with them prior to us dating they are lovely people and i have cooked dinner for them twice we are all going to the movies this evening too ,0,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,your brother and sil are in a cycle of codependency and probably sex addiction with affairs usually porn too in any case you are getting sucked into the dynamic by trying to change them when they do not want to or are not ready dysfunction generally stems from the family and if your parents are still enabling and stuffing then there not much you can do boundaries are key here you might have to move far away or you might just have to limit your interactions with your side of the family if it stresses you out if your sil says she going to leave tell her you are not going to entertain the topic until she actually does you can also mention getting help through cosa so she can recover from the ongoing pain of your brother affairs i was angry with my parents bc they are still in la la land about a lot of things and cannot bear to truly face reality they would have to be introspective and address their own problems and people prefer to avoid that process sometimes it hard for me to talk to my parents for the same reason especially after all this work i have done over the years through my own addiction codependent journey ultimately you can only control your reaction and behaviors step back and let chaos reign until they are ready to address it ,3,relationships
Spazzy19,in highschool and early college i was dating my first love but one of the most frustrating aspects is that he would drop money on expensive hobbies remote control planes trucks other mechanical things etc but i would fight to occasionally go to a freaking applebee usually it was wendy or waffle house i resented the time he dumped into it as we would started attending schools 5 hrs away from one another and felt he made his hobbies a priority ultimately i could not handle it you may just have to realize this is the way life will remain can you live with it ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,since everyone has already told you that you are in the right the only thing i will add is that i hope your bf learns not to discuss money with his parents it none of their business and their reactions are over the top ,6,relationships

Spazzy19,if he does not believe it an option then he already making his love for you conditional follow your dreams and go to where you will best be able to jumpstart your career and enjoy yourself i did a 2 year ldr with my ex husband before we got married because he was in the military and deployed to iraq for 7 months while i finished college out of state from my parents i was 3 hrs away from home and 6 hours away from him even my highschool sweet heart and i went to different colleges ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,you are welcome my husband always felt better at least knowing there was a time frame for a resolution and then he could give appropriate space ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,whoa my ex husband deployed back in 2005 while we were still dating we had a 6 hr ldr when he was stateside but even then it took a bit for him to acclimate i assume you have been through more than one deployment yourself if you already have reservations especially considering your financial concerns and previous history i would really encourage you to follow your gut you need to decompress not have added stress of moving money and adjusting to living together immediately those things are stressful enough without a deployment honestly what is a couple extra weeks going to change when you have already been apart this long have him come down for a romantic weekend together to reconnect and then go from there ,3,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,my ex husband and i had the same issue and eventually we instilled a 24 hr rule it still made him twitch because he hates to go to bed with unresolved issues but i needed time and space to process and articulate my feelings usually i was ready to talk before then anyway bit if things were starting to escalate i would say 24hrs and we would go into separate rooms or stop discussing that topic ,6,relationships
Spazzy19,why on earth would you want to fix this after 2 months of this and if you say i invested 5 years into it and love her kindly recall it obviously not reciprocated ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,i think too the wife probably picked up on their tension and distance btw the guys and he could explain that what caused it she would probably at least mull that aspect over if there is not anything concrete ,5,relationships
Spazzy19,burning man is at least a week long if you intend to go the whole time it a much better value than vip at a concert which would last a couple of hours for 800 i would rather be taken on a cruise ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,yeah i am questioning whether his personality just got hijacked op seems very baffled about this new behavior ,32,relationships
Spazzy19,but it is and will continue to affect him it good that they respect him but they should also be behaving for you you are basically making him the bad parent already bc you wo not step up and take that responsibility i would resent that as well my nail lady has a daughter of her own but keeps finding guys with multiple kids that they are letting walk all over them it ruined those relationships for her and she has a kid of her own she feels that their lack of boundaries and enforcement is an indication will roll over into their relationship and she correct she gets irate when the rule is no electronics at the table for example she watches his kids blatantly do it and her bf will tell the kids several times to put the things away but they ignore him because there are no consequences if her daughter disrespected her that way she would have immediately confiscated the item and added further punishment there are lots of other examples my sil finally had to stop dating a guy after 2 5 years because of these types of issues it may be best to call it off if you are incompatible in this area whether he remains in your life or not you will still have the same issues if you are ok with that then fine but you may want to consider taking some boundary classes etc ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,that just hurt my head reading due to all of the tension and vitriol i would bet things were not perfect before your first kid but why on earth would y all bother to have another child together you both hate being together and have stopped appreciating and respecting one another you are both to blame for your actions and responses do yourselves a favor and separate ,47,relationships
Spazzy19,uggh i could not handle it my bf has been with more people than me but it does not change the way i feel about him or our relationship this issue is with her and if she cannot cope then you either accept it or move on sounds like she could use some counseling normally i am one to advocate honesty but in this case i feel it will add a whole lot of unnecessary drama for you ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,if after 9 years she cannot figure out you are committed then i do not foresee much hope for you y all are both young but you should still be able to trust your partner i do not think i would be thrilled about you going on a trip with three female friends but i would be more bummed i could not go with you your major however is par for the course you are always going to be surrounded by more women than men it would seem she cannot handle it the question remains can you handle her like this forever ,8,relationships
Spazzy19,if you do not mind me asking what are some examples most of the step parenting couples i have encountered had tension over lack of discipline or enforcing rules how are you putting your kids before him which leads to arguments ,3,relationships

Spazzy19,agreed it a lot of work but my ex husband could not do condoms and i was tired of being on the pill we tracked and pulled out with no problems it was also pretty interesting to be present with my body and pay closer attention to its changes ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,wow this sounds like a horrendous situation honestly though you already know what you need to do it will be hard and there will be grief sometimes it harder because it really no one fault but if you are no longer even attracted to him as a spouse and he not able to meet your needs then you need to take care of yourself i had an amicable divorce this past year due to circumstances that were not caused by anyone fault per say either and it still takes a toll especially if you maintain a friendship with your former spouse in some ways it a relief to be supportive and have a piece of the person you once loved but you will probably have days of resentment because this is not who you married either it can be very frustrating but you are already there i am sorry you are at this cross road ,14,relationships
Spazzy19,no kidding my bf has the opposite mentality that he does not want to get married to someone until he sees that they could overcome the stresses of child rearing together i keep saying you should not have children with someone you did not think you could marry my bf is not afraid to have to potentially pay child support but i guess he heard too many horror stories where the husband is screwed financially with alimony etc still does not make sense to me ,1,relationships

Spazzy19,the point is not that she bought her own ring but rather that she was unaware she bought her own ring as he presents it under the guise it was a gift from him if i was funding my own i would want to be involved in the cost etc the fact that she had no idea that she funded her own ring in her name bc who knows if he actually paid off the card it could be accruing interest or ruining her credit is disconcerting she would be the responsible party should he default ,23,relationships

Spazzy19,then he should do it himself she not responsible for his feelings or actions thereafter ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,i was you back 13 years ago when i was 20 i was reeling from an excruciating rejection by my long term boyfriend and royally screwed up it understandable but not excusable i told him and we eventually broke up i later married my rebound and moved across the country was with him for 12 years shortly into my marriage i realized there were good reasons why my ex bf and i were not a good match despite my actions the hooks started releasing but for a few more years i refused to forgive myself he was dating other girls long term but never got married i kept thinking i had screwed his life up i finally forgave myself back in 2010 and realized i deserved happiness too i stopped punishing myself he would already forgiven me a couple years ago he did get married and now has a baby i am glad he happy i still did things you are talking about basically romanticizing it and thinking of him regularly bc my marriage was not romantic ended up getting divorced in sept and dating a great guy i have known for 2 years i realized the other day that i had not thought of my first love in months i smiled the important thing to remember is that you are not responsible for his feelings easier said than done but cut him from social media i did that myself a few years ago which was hard initially and keep repeating that to yourself he is choosing to wallow plus it sounds like you messed up during a break in your relationship so i do not know if i would beat myself up as much ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,i do not think most people who have their children circumcised do it for medical necessity but rather for religious reasons social reasons etc different cultures around the world alter their bodies for various reasons that have nothing to do with medical necessity some people pierce their kids ears as children too i am personally indifferent to male circumcision and if i have kids will let the father decide i do however feel female circumcision is a very different ballpark because that done specifically to control a woman sexuality my male partners who have been cut have had no issues with their performance or in receiving pleasure ,5,relationships
Spazzy19,i am not arguing for the procedure just offering the point you are making yourself even if his son did not like being uncircumcised he may just opt to keep it that way to avoid the consequences when he will actually remember that pain no men that i have known who were circumcised as babies remember the experience ,7,relationships
Spazzy19,because some people do not think in those terms i get what you are saying but at that point it would potentially become a more painful experience rather than one he would not remember she might have wanted to prevent him being made fun of by other boys though i know it becoming more normal in the us to not be circumcized this debate gets about as hot as declawing cats same principle applies yet child circumcisions and cat declawing surgeries still exist ,3,relationships
Spazzy19,perhaps in your mind and you are probably correct that it medically unnecessary but many people still get it done just because you do not agree with it does not mean those people opinions are invalid and not worth considering ,6,relationships
Spazzy19,she might have been concerned about the amount of pain that it would cause when he older there a reason it typically done at that time however i agree it should not have been done behind your back ,3,relationships
Spazzy19,just saying as a devil advocate there could be a reason for that lack of response we are only seeing a sliver of their marriage and from one party perspective op could very well be the dominant party and could have a history of dismissing his wife concerns or feelings about other things i agree she should have expressed her desire but there may have been a reason she went about this poorly ,13,relationships
Spazzy19,also outside of the blatant issue of opening the card was he at least making payments or was he leaving that to screw up your credit ,13,relationships
Spazzy19,hi baby besides breaking your trust and being fraudulent i wanted to hide the fact you technically bought your own engagement ring wow that a special sort of special time to cut your losses and leave ,200,relationships
Spazzy19,i got into the martial arts community at age 31 bc i was tired of having no legit friends locally i would been in an employment situation for years where i was a supervisor and then promoted again thus dwindling the little ability i had to develop more friendships bc of my position mma was awesome my ex husband finally convinced me and for two years i have had a blast my now bf has been my martial arts partner for 2 yrs did not divorce bc of him but he started out being one of my closest friends definitely start getting into some hobby meet up groups where you can foster friendships over common interests ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,my 33 bf 27 of officially 4 months and i are in similar boats though he not as bad as your so our viewpoints on money will never be the same and we have come to accept that about one another however i have made it clear money and impulsive spending is a deal breaker for me as is having no savings should he want to get married and start a family when we were just friends i always told him i was surprised by his spending and lack of savings he ended up being diagnosed with add in november and the meds have curbed his impulsive spending habits however he is also paying down a similar amount of money on ccs but his is primarily due to house renovations from his home purchase this summer he started budgeting and is paying them down he still feels like he getting nothing when he pays 400 600 toward a card but i reminded him that he already received the goods he had not thought about it that way i am always weary when he keeps using the cards and have tried to get him to act like he only has cash available to him so he focuses on waiting to get something until he has enough spending money budgeted vs buying immediately it a work in progress but it enough that i am satisfied by his efforts i am hesitant to combine all of our income should that day arise but would be fine with a joint account at least you need to sit down and be honest with your bf about your feelings on the matter it may get his act in gear but if not then it time to say goodbye because it not going to change even if you get married ,1,relationships

Spazzy19,over complimenting me before you even know me for example i wanted to learn how to backpack and this guy i was just talking to we would met at a wedding for mutual friends and live on opposite coasts told me he bet i would have a bunch of guys lined up to do that with me he said other things but it pissed me off because a no i do not but thanks and b i do not like when men throw themselves at women feet compliments are nice but wait until you get to know me and my personality before going on and on it just seems disingenuous ,23,AskReddit
Spazzy19,lol i totally had to go back bc i missed the watermelon initially omg this is amazing ,1,gifs
Spazzy19,a lot of guys have this same dilemma actually even my best gf started doing something that you could incorporate when i start telling her about a serious topic she immediately asks are you wanting me to just listen or add input sometimes i say both other times i will say one or the other it easy and it allows her to establish how she going to listen does she need to be engaged more to come up with responses or can she just actively listen until i am done ranting i do the same for her because sometimes we already know what the solution is if there is one and acknowledge that our logical emotional sides are not synching but we still just need to verbalize what is going on inside ,2,relationships

Spazzy19,frankly i do not know how you lasted 13 years i would have blasted her a long time ago i would honestly maybe send an email and convey your feelings in writing you need to explain how the comments and blame has made you resentful and how it was inappropriate at your wedding etc you can apologize for crossing the line as far as being glad he is dead but make it clear that no more snide remarks will be tolerated in a compassionate way i get it i imagine she still hurting and probably actually blames herself or maybe not if she incapable of self reflection i know i would have questioned my lack of parenting and whether it led to his behavior and ultimate death she just wants a scapegoat to not feel that immense pain but it inappropriate and needs to stop ,0,relationships
Spazzy19,so it all good and dandy until the new girl leaves yeah no the time you might have been able to salvage it would have been immediately after the first fuck up and that a big might the fact that you left your gf for this girl and now only want your ex back because she left you speaks volumes leave her alone you need to be alone yourself for a while ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,yes i instigated it and then he enforced it even after i freaked out and tried to work it out despite realizing it was not a good fit in many ways it was not a toxic relationship by any means but we were just on two different pages and i hated the control his parents had over him us ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,i am about to leave my boyfriend house and go visit my ex husband so i understand being able to have a meal with a person of the opposite sex without it leading to sex however if you are that concerned why has not the topic of y all dating come up from either one of you in the past and why not just be there for said bday coffee i agree that i think it weird that one dating status does not come up at least once if you are regularly getting together to chat but i do not automatically assume inviting someone over for coffee leads to him cheating especially since he told you about it ,3,relationships
Spazzy19,i can understand your concern as a mother but you have to accept that you have no control over the situation and if you try you are likely to push your daughter away and toward other behaviors you do not approve of 14 15 yrs ago my first love and i took several nude pictures of each other and together when we broke up i deleted them my ex husband may have a few of me still i have no idea none have ever surfaced publicly i do not think it an overly common occurrence as far as premarital sex well there no turning back time even though you are in a conservative area she will just have to find someone who accepts she not a virgin she taking precautions so that good but keep the lines of communication open so that if she needs your help it available it your house though you can put restrictions on visitation at your home i do not really recommend being stringent however and you can also tell your daughter she can get her own computer to store her photos but a relationship with a guy will not necessarily divert her focus to her studies in many instances it can add happiness which influences academics too ,1,relationships

Spazzy19,for me this topic is a deal breaker and my bf is thankfully beginning to budget and save pay down debt from purchasing a house that needed a fair amount of repairs he got diagnosed with adhd in november and the medication has helped curb impulsive spending which is why i have opted to stay it still something that i am watching though i know however that he and i will always have opposing view points on money he thinks that because i have over 150k saved in retirement pension accounts at age 33 that i am overly concerned about retirement and could be spending that money now and enjoying life i do spend money on things i want too but am a long term planner i am also debt free minus a cc i pay off each month i saved up for years and purchased a new car in cash he does not think this way so yes i am nervous about finances in my potentially future relationship too i had separate finances and a joint account with my ex husband my bf would want combined he also weirdly enough is adamant about wanting a prenup should we get married which boggles my mind i have told my bf that i would not want to consider starting a family until he started becoming more fiscally responsible because i have no desire to foot the extra expenses on my own do not get me wrong he pays his bills and has a decent job but i know i need the additional security the question remains is can you deal with it or do you suspect it going to be an ongoing battle if you proceed then you will have to trust he will do best by you but know that more than likely he not going to change with such a high income he should not be having to ask for money i would have trouble respecting him too and would caution you as to whether this is a road you actually want to go down ,9,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,yeah again it sounds like she picked a bad apple when i was married i would just let my husband know i would be home later if i was going to dinner with friends he usually had his own things to do so he did not have time or occasionally interest in joining i get wanting to stay in more or spending more time with your spouse but it should not be all consuming ,2,relationships

Spazzy19,i get not having a definite time frame but is not the point that in your career field you expect it going to be difficult to maintain any relationship anyway your point is that you are alone because you are tired of cultivating relationships due to the career path either you are going to have to accept that and choose to be alone accept that and cultivate a good relationship with someone even long distance for however long or find a new path to follow or i guess you can find a guy who is able to work from home anywhere ,21,relationships
Spazzy19,just because you get married does not mean things have to drastically change if you are willing to still go out and spend time with them then it should not be an issue but it can sometimes change the dynamic if people have stigmas associated with it did you feel weird hanging out with your now divorced friend while she was married it sounds like you are growing apart from your friends and yes while you are in different stages of your lives it does not make one better than the other or the main reason for growing apart you are just starting to see what peoples priorities are currently if they are strong friendships then they will overcome all stages of life and you will be supportive of one another yes marriage can take work but it sounds like your one friend chose the wrong guy to marry you can be supportive of her pain while making it clear to her that you do not want to be subjected to her negative projections friendships also take some work and if one or both are not willing to invest then you are going to drift apart ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,i would be miffed too if my boyfriend did not want to include me on an annual family trip because i would mess up the dynamic if you want her in your life in the future you are going to have to get used to her presence for these things how do you know you all would not have fun together ,5,relationships
Spazzy19,just out of curiosity if you both feel similarly about each other then why is 5 hrs distance a problem especially when you are miserable having to start over you can meet halfway and spend various weekends time off together or one person drives one time and the other the next my ex husband and i did 6 hrs one way for 2 years and a deployment to iraq for 7 months before we got married i was finishing college at the time it not ideal obviously but you are still able to maintain that connection and have emotional support plus in the interim you can both focus on your respective jobs studies ,81,relationships
Spazzy19,unfortunately you are just going to have to make it clear to him that despite all that you want to separate give him a time frame and ask him to find other accommodations if you are not sure whether you want it to be a permanent break yet then tell him you need space to sort it out and you are not going to get that while living together once you have had time apart you can figure out your needs and work on yourself to determine whether it worth trying any more but if you are certain then specifically tell him that while he may not want to call it quits you do ,3,relationships
Spazzy19,i do not think it was wrong personally i think it sweet and shows me what kind of man you are inside and that will be conveyed to your son too i did not do anything particularly special for my ex husband no kids but i did wish him a happy vday and casually gave him an extra box of conversation hearts i had around i spent the actual day with my new bf though she sounds like she just very insecure about the history you have with your ex ,-1,relationships
Spazzy19,because anyone in their right mind would display flowers from another man you are cheating with geez i did not realize i was doing it wrong this whole time s do not bother trying to convince him he being an utter idiot ,24,relationships
Spazzy19,i had a difficult time coping with my views on marriage like yours and staying with an otherwise wonderful man who had a sex addiction and slowly ate away at my self esteem he got tired of hurting me and we agreed to a very amicable divorce like you i had been extremely confident as well sometimes i get annoyed at myself for having put up with it for so long but i realized god would not want me to be bound to a person who did not take care of me in all ways and have me be miserable i believe in stepping stones my ex came into my life for a reason and we had a good 12 years together and i learned a lot about myself i now know what i will and wo not accept in a romantic relationship and i wo not settle for less you are living consumed by fear he has basically brainwashed you and you allowed it you will grieve what you once were and how you got here but there is hope if you choose to take the steps if you are afraid of the welfare of the baby talk to a lawyer and convey his lack of desire and ability to care for him see if you can obtain custody with supervised visits since you have not been working seek child support and alimony but start looking for your own employment the first part of overcoming codependency is realizing you have a problem and you cannot control your husband i went to a 12 step group to address mine and it does work in addition to opening your world to a vast support system learn to have self respect again by taking the steps to rebuild yourself ,1,Divorce
Spazzy19,it basically learning to take care of yourself setting healthy standards like in my former marriage i agreed to reconcile provided he did not collect porn anymore and did not have further emotional physical affairs and then enforcing them ie leaving in my case if he did actually following through it can also be not succumbing to guilt trips not letting anyone dictate what you should or should not do ie a mother or mother in law who is constantly critical of your appearance wearing your hair or clothes the way you like and shutting down the criticism learning to say no and being ok with all of it i was pretty decent with boundaries at work and with friends family but i still took a class when my marriage first spun out of control cloud townsend were the authors of the book we used since i took it at a local church they put a christian spin on it bc religious people with no boundaries tend to martyr themselves and overextend themselves or just tolerate a lot of bs thinking it the right thing to do but there are plenty of secular ones available out there too boundaries help you retake a lot of control of yourself and your emotions reactions and learning to enforce them by following through with a consequence hanging up on a repeat criticizer after a warning separating from a so disciplining disruptive children etc ,1,Divorce
Spazzy19,i know when my mom wanted to join me and my in laws on a cruise she would have made the odd party they said she would have to pay double bc the cabins fit two ,4,relationships
Spazzy19,i was able to reestablish a trusting relationship after my ex husband cheated on me 7 years ago we divorced this past year but it did not have to do with that incident or lack of trust however it took a lot of work self examination on both of our ends and he actually felt shitty granted i caught him too and the omissions were the hardest to get over more than the act himself you have to determine whether you are capable or willing to do so it within your right to walk away despite your busy schedule and your thought you contributed to it the fact of the matter is that your schedule may have but it does not justify his behavior he should have spoken to you about his needs and desires so you could have reconnected together he could have walked away beforehand if he thought you were too career oriented and could not meet his needs you do need to confront him though once you figure out how you want to approach the future ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,you will get significantly stronger the moment you actually leave and start therapy and learning to set boundaries it a journey but a worthwhile one ,1,Divorce
Spazzy19,could be true or it could be fabricated in either case the only thing that matters is whether you can deal with it if it is true and whether she wants to be in a monogamous relationship with you ,0,relationships
Spazzy19,you are experiencing hardcore codependency therapy boundaries classes and support groups will help if you stay you will be teaching your son that daddy behavior is normal ,1,Divorce
Spazzy19,my ex husband was addicted to porn and affairs and it ultimately ruined our marriage from at least what you have said it does not appear you are my ex did not want to be intimate with me regularly and when he did it was carnal and emotionally empty your ex wife sounds like the manipulator down to guilting you into marriage however it sounds like you need to work on setting enforcing boundaries improving your self esteem etc i would have felt alone too ,1,Divorce
Spazzy19,absolutely which i also conveyed because it definitely problematic some people were just hounding that she would broken the window and based on the narrative it just seemed to be incorrect oh well ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,absolutely i cannot believe the friends are down playing both of y all list names ,7,relationships
Spazzy19,just out of curiosity why would he get laid off i am curious as to whether his recent odd behavior may have contributed to the lay off at all ,9,relationships
Spazzy19,same but apparently i am getting down voted because i pointed this out the leaf would have come in with her ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,personally i think your friend overreacted since the plan was for you to stay there but she could just be tired of your drunken antics and is using this as the final straw op says the window was open and that the following day they discovered it was broken not that she broke it there a possibility but i do not know how much physical effort could have been used at that level of intoxication to have broken it herself i personally get weak limbed just being slightly more than tipsy i am rather confused as to why your friends just left you alone in that state after they were aware you got kicked out or whether you notified your friend you were going to her house as planned and if she had a response not to enter the house etc i would imagine there would have been a dialogue did she tell you to just go home to your place since she was not ready to leave in any case you have got some serious drinking problems that need to be addressed she has the right to stop being friends with you and you have got to realize there are consequences for your actions i do not think i could remain friends with someone if your track record who cared only about getting trashed rather than how it affecting your judgment ,-4,relationships

Spazzy19,my ex husband was addicted and his issue carried over into the bedroom because he had difficulty responding to my touch initiation or it was typically all carnal he was very secretive about his usage and i never knew how much he looked at it until his world of fantasy escalated to affairs if he cannot control when he looking at it i would say he very much has a problem there are tons of resources through sa or saa and there even stuff for partners through cosa you can also read out of the shadows to see if you think it applies to your relationship ,6,relationships
Spazzy19,yep i have even moved on to someone who fits me better but it still hard to come to terms with how much my ex changed since we dated my logical and emotional side just are not on the same page at times and i prided myself on vetting and knowing him so well in hopes of never having to be here it just extremely unfortunate ,2,Divorce
Spazzy19,i love how the employer even called them and warned them but they are still confused as to why they got fired and please do not whine about how it unfair and ask how you are supposed to support your children now they made a blatant choice to disregard the policy and warning and do what they wanted if they sue i hope they all lose ,77,news
Spazzy19,so pretty makes me want to get another cat unfortunately my boyfriend is allergic ,2,aww
Spazzy19,i very much find this to be a beautiful letter i have got an amicable relationship with my ex too i may write one for him soon but i need to wrestle out some internal conflicts first so i can forgive everything i have forgiven the infidelities but i have not been able to forgive the feeling of being abandoned and having my life turned upside down etc or now feeling jaded about marriage i am sure it will come in time ,2,Divorce
Spazzy19,same here life is certainly funny ,1,Divorce
Spazzy19,it been 5 months since i have been officially divorced and about a year since i knew it was going to happen i still feel a bit jaded and spiritually confused angry so i am going to talk to my priest tomorrow because i am even having a difficult time attending services it has to do with partly still feeling spiritually married and being resentful about how empty vows are etc i am dating someone new now and it been great but i am not ready to actually think about that step i never wanted to cohabitate prior to marriage but i would probably be more open to that than marriage currently ,3,Divorce
Spazzy19,does he look at pornography my ex husband was addicted and i never knew until our 4 yr anniversary when we would first met we had a lot of sex and it was great but then he stopped responding to my touch and having difficulty in bed i was just confused and frustrated for a long time so i feel your pain has he said whether he can get off on his own ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,where are your parents in all of this considering you have been with him since you were a minor his at least see that his anger caused this situation and are inadvertently protecting you if you are in the us look up local caaw shelters for resources and therapy to rebuild your self esteem and address your codependency you are otherwise more than likely going to end up in another abusive relationship ,3,relationships
Spazzy19,ok nvm i thought you were being insecure just because he texted her this crap would not fly with me ,6,relationships
Spazzy19,after 10 years of marriage and no kids i still texted it to my ex husband but i spent it with my boyfriend and got him things etc i think you are being insecure ,0,relationships
Spazzy19,you are welcome and yes we remained married for another 6 years his was sex addiction but ultimately parted ways as a married couple but we grew significantly together and i am better at articulating my feelings rather than stuffing them i also learned great coping tools which lessened the sting of divorce and has helped in my current relationship learned how to set and enforce boundaries and explored my past and where i developed these patterns of behaviors it not an easy journey but it extremely rewarding ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,i would really encourage you to seek out al anon or the equivalent for partners of drug addicts it will put you on a path of self discovery and help you get strong again i was the partner of an addict and while i too had been extremely independent and confident i fell into the same trap if you do not address your own issues why you dabbled in drugs and why you keep going back and forth with him in codependent cycles you are more likely to find yourself in the arms of another unhealthy relationship ,3,relationships
Spazzy19,i do not have kids but i have watched my friends turn into moms and it fascinating and frustrating at the same time that being said if her kid is 2 months old you later said 2 yrs so i am not sure then she is more than likely exhausted being a single mom of an infant she wants as much rest as she can get also breastfeeding that wine will go straight to the kid so that why she probably wo not drink i know moms who wo not even do caffeine until 7 10 months of breastfeeding is done you guys are now on totally different paths you can choose to be supportive which will entail a lot of patience on your part or you can move on but her behavior sounds completely normal to me and i am surprised you are not more sympathetic ,3,relationships
Spazzy19,what have you been doing with your money since you started working that you are at this point i get having ups and downs in various professions but typically people put aside during the high months to cover the slow ones do you just blow through your cash or did some sort of unanticipated event occur that knocked you back ex one of my best friends got diagnosed with a rare autoimmune condition after experiencing sudden strokes and blindness shortly after turning 31 last year she already out a shit ton of money and she was a pharmacist in either case you are going to need to be truthful and make the hard but mature decision to not go on vacation so you can pay your rent trust me it bad enough to know your bf is not good with money but it worse when it so bad you cannot even maintain your home bc of poor choices i nearly broke up with my bf a couple months ago bc of impulsive spending he ended up diagnosed with add and the meds have significantly helped him get back in a better financial spot he even budgeting ,5,relationships
Spazzy19,does she actually want to have a baby right now i would have been crying if i had been in her shoes and i am 33 and still debating kids she probably overwhelmed and thinking life is going to be speeding up rather quickly if she wants it just keep providing support if she does not then respect that and support her as well also the doctor may have gotten the prescription to her late but he she did not force y all to have sex with or without additional protection ,11,relationships
Spazzy19,i am not sure if my thyroid ever affected my emotions but it is a hormonal imbalance i typically was always cold and suddenly fatigued weight gain i went from super tiny and 1 lb a year to still tiny but gaining 13 lbs in a short period of time etc if she confused romantically though i am not sure the meds are going to fix that part i would say carry on with your life and if she reaches out with a change of heart once she balances out keep it as an open option i would not recommend hinging everything on this though ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,so i personally think that you are getting too much into her business but i also think your mom could be handling this a little better if she just casually dating fine but i think she could compromise and not have the guys there when you are going over to visit with her to me that should be time for you and knowing that it makes you uncomfortable i would not rub it in your face however if she starts seeing someone seriously or you show up unannounced then you are going to have to deal i would suggest proposing this to her but she an adult and may choose to do her own thing anyway you cannot control her so you would have to decide whether to distance yourself from her but taking her to dubai is not going to solve this problem ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,my ex husband would sometimes be in a dream that got him in the mood and he would roll over and grope me it amused the hell out of me because he was better at finding my spots half asleep than awake it was even more amusing when he would start dirty talking and later not remember what he would said if i was ok with it i would let him proceed and he would usually wake up a few minutes later sometimes he just fell immediately back to sleep on his own after patting my butt if i was not in the mood i would just roll him over and he would fall back into complete sleep i jokingly called it night rape but i never felt assaulted by it i figure this is similar to ops situation i have told some close friends about it because the dirty talking was just too amusing not to share but my friends just took it for what it was not as me being sexually assaulted if ops friend cannot trust her word on it then unfortunately the strain is already in the friendship until the friend comes to terms with her own trauma i would be frustrated as hell that she was not attending the wedding for that reason and i would have to give myself distance ,5,relationships

Spazzy19,last weekend i treated him to a 1 5 hour professional massage unfortunately the couple room was already booked and then continued to dote on him on valentine day morning i slipped some candy into his bag along with a heartfelt card to surprise him at work i got his roommate some candy too and put it on his bag and then spent 20 minutes that morning washing their dishes and straightening up the kitchen little did i know that i inadvertently helped myself out because my bf surprised me with an elaborate home cooked meal when i thought we were going out his roommate even made the potatoes and finished making the soup while my bf went to pick me up they were both thrilled to not have to tackle the cleaning before cooking my evening plans had originally been to do a photo shoot in this super cute apron he got me for christmas and other lingerie heels which then led to more fun but we have postponed that until one of the next couple of weekends because it got too late on vday ,2,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,then as unfortunately harsh as this seems stop bitching you are in control of you and your life you cannot fix him or hope that someone miraculously waves a magic wand and changes his mental health and complacency toward you i have been there i divorced from my best friend this past year after being together for 12 years and am now 33 i did not want to lose him and thankfully i have not but i have moved on to someone who fits better than the person he changed into over the years and i am significantly happier so you really have two choices accept him as he is on his time frames and do not resent it or move on with your life and find someone more compatible ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,it was indeed it funny because he introduced me to rpw and in my previous marriage i loved my husband but i yearned for a bit more of a traditional relationship with my bf it has been so foreign to me to willingly get up in the morning with him before my own alarm and make him a breakfast sandwich to go so he can get out the door quicker plus it allows us more cuddle time my ex did the majority of the cooking in my marriage but now i do with my bf and i totally do not mind actually i find it pleasing to help him at his place and he finds it extremely attractive so him turning the tables on me was really amazing ,2,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,lol guess i should have waited a year instead of how quickly i moved on but my ex really wanted my current relationship to work out anyway and i had months to process the divorce before we actually moved filed ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,i would say you need to do you i am recently divorced too and felt myself sliding into the same behavior patterns of putting my needs and wants below a partner my bf thankfully came to see the light but i had decided without any malice or manipulation to break away when he could not decide whether he was ready to transition from fwb to a formal relationship we spent every day together did couple like things etc but he could not commit i realized i was tired of finding myself with guys who could not be romantically attracted to me but wanted me around for great companionship we are both in a place where we need to take care of ourselves it was not easy for me to make the decision to walk away and care for myself but it was very empowering it sounds like you are going to resent staying there for yet another man and should then be focused on finding a place that makes you happy ,9,relationships
Spazzy19,just out of curiosity what is your husband opinion on what his brother is doing to me your bil is being selfish despite whether or not linda is a good match for him it comes across as though he just using her for easy access sex than because he actually cares about her i would be losing a lot of respect for him however i think it needs to come from your bil i do not think i could be around them in the meantime though and if he asks then tell him the truth ,42,relationships
Spazzy19,i have to brag a little i have known my bf for about two years but we officially started dating at the end of october my boyfriend had me convinced he was taking me to this local fine steakhouse i have always wanted to go to in the 10 5 years i have lived here he told me he would pick me up at 8 10 for an 8 30 reservation one important thing to note is he was recently diagnosed with add adhd in november and started taking meds but planning and timing are still a bit of a struggle he would already requested i wear a specific dress and boots and i was happy to oblige so i texted him at 8 10 inquiring whether he would left yet he had not as he was finishing final touches 8 30 rolls around and i am trying not to fret i look up the restaurant and see it closing at 9pm he finally gets me at 8 40 tells me not to fret because his parents know the owner etc i convey that i am still not comfortable showing up at closing time when people want to go home but he says to trust him he gave me a little box of chocolate and a card which i did not open right away we are driving a few miles and he realizes he did not have his wallet and has to stop home i am getting really antsy now and offer to call the restaurant he says he will do it from home so now i am really suspicious we get to his house and his roommate is in the kitchen cooking not unusual he brings me back to his bedroom and i am totally surprised he would converted his bedroom into a little bistro with a cute table and two chairs had the record player going and had me sit down he proceeded to bring me wine and homemade tomato bisque while he finished the entree of ribeye steak green beans garlic mashed potatoes and special sauces he also made an appetizer of gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches this is a guy who has cooked for me twice before and struggles with planning yet he took off work early the day before to get the table grocery shop and adjust to me changing plans i would wanted to stay at my place that evening so as to not bother his roommate but he did not want to hint at a surprise etc it was wonderful and so thoughtful apparently he has ingredients for a souffle but the cooking took awhile and we were tired so he will do that later after helping him clean up we did not get back to my place until nearly midnight so i told him my evening dessert plans could also wait until the souffle night we ended up just cuddling together while falling asleep he kept berating himself for falling so behind schedule but i keep reiterating that it was super sweet and made my evening plus it was damn sexy watching him work in the kitchen ,27,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,yeah it sucked because he a wonderful man and has a lot to offer but we ended up more platonic best friends because of it ,1,relationship_advice
Spazzy19,i have a high drive but he was an addict and only porn or sudden bursts of carnal sex could get him excited zero emotion and i basically felt like a cum dispensary with someone normal sure but it would not have worked with him ,1,relationship_advice
Spazzy19,he may be fine immediately or not the important thing to consider is why waste energy thinking about a guy who obviously does not feel you have impacted his life significantly if he just fine focus on yourself and what your needs are if he not invested then do not keep trying to stay with him it hurtful to realize the effort was not reciprocated but it more painful when you realize you chose to put up with it knowing it was not meeting your needs ,3,relationships
Spazzy19,my husband told me the novelty wore off awesome,2,relationship_advice
Spazzy19,my now ex husband is a sex addict to porn and affairs in the 2 years of dating our sex life was fine but apparently he got super into porn again while deployed for 7 months we were long distance but otherwise would see each other every other weekend he assumed it would get better once we were married and had access to sex more frequently within a month of marriage we were 22 he had a crush on a girl at work i could not figure out why we were not having sex like bunnies because i certainly wanted to be lo and behold 4 years later with 2 emotional and one physical affair under his belt he told me about pornography he collected tons of it had started paying for it and just wanted to be aroused by fantasy during our separation we both started going to 12 step groups sa cosa it extremely painful for partners but it helped to make sense of my life counseling and boundaries class helped too it takes a lot but know that it not about you you can dress up do various acts etc but if he wants the porn he going to go back to it until he realizes he has a problem you need to talk to him about your feelings though for 10 years rejection slowly chipped away at my soul thankfully this past year i have found someone who does not care to look at it and is excited to touch me and be intimate you do not want to wait and let this fester ,3,relationship_advice
Spazzy19,i get your points but think they are a little extreme but here what your wife probably heard i do not trust you you are stupid for going to this person even if you are getting benefits from him her and you are improvements are invalid because of who you are seeing i would be hurt if i my so reacted that way especially if i was trying to reach out and share my improvements with him i would recommend talking with your wife validating her efforts and maybe at least meeting this person that means something to her obviously there are things she wants to address with you as a couple ,4,relationships
Spazzy19,i get that there is a huge stigma and shame associated with being a sex offender but he really should have been up front about that and the other things you have mentioned it seems definitely off that would be my deal breaker not bc of the actual label but because of the ongoing lies and being unable to trust i actually sat on a jury last year for a guy who supposedly accidentally went into an empty women bathroom in a quieter area of a local casino to do his business the male female entrances are open and have about a foot of wall separating them so people get confused a woman rushed in and chose the first available stall which happened to be next to him the freaking guy who would been drinking a little and honestly just did not seem all there anyway reached under the stall twice and stroked her leg and said hello how are you doing obviously the woman freaked out bc it creepy and he got arrested but he did not pursue her had no weapons and the police found him doing his business he did not try to leave ultimately the majority of us settled on assault based on the testimonies and lack of evidence he admitted he touched her leg but could not explain why right but if we would gone with gross lewdness he would have had to register as a sex offender too i personally think that would be rather extreme but people have to for getting arrested streaking in public too in your bfs case it sounds like there more to the story if he cannot be honest then it may be time to move back home ,1,relationships
Spazzy19, shrug when i use it it basically the sensation of having it inside might be better to make an inquiry in r sex,1,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,wow my ex husband had an affair about 7 years ago but i had him show me the results the only reason we reconciled is because we both did a shit ton of work reading 12 step groups and communicating for months and it was still a difficult path i do not know how you were able to reconcile without her doing those things sounds like you are a person who sweeps things under the rug even though your instincts and feelings are dying to come out from one stuffer to another do not you are setting yourself up for a world of misery and passing these behaviors to your children my parents are still conflict adverse i have worked hard over the years to articulate my feelings on something within 24 hrs max you have not had any closure or communication on this issue i hope it not an sti but even if it not it sounds like there are bigger underlying issues to address ,5,relationships

Spazzy19,if it average then i would say no but maybe it would not feel as pleasurable if it was very skinny never had a negative experience with girth so i cannot say some women cannot take a lot of girth either so i think it will just depend on the woman ,1,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,guys typically prefer women naked so do not fret i assume he satisfied considering he met you and knows what you look like i would just recommend making sure your nether regions are trimmed unless he expressed a preference for natural or something else but to alleviate your fears convey to him how you feel take things at your pace if something goes awry then laugh about it you may find that touch just gets you going and you forget your fears and keep in mind he thinking the same things ,6,sex
Spazzy19,because she could also be batshit crazy good looks do not automatically equate healthy sense of self and maturity ,19,relationships
Spazzy19,you may be projecting if you are a good employee then hopefully there nothing to worry about i would assume more that he wants to invite your ex dad to the concert to discuss an upcoming business deal or give a perk for being the 1 client just do not let your breakup impact your job duties ,15,relationships
Spazzy19, hug it hard no matter what my ex husband told me last feb he was in love with a teenager and it floored me he got his shit together otherwise but i understand the confusion too he now is open to kids as well but was adamantly child free with me but this situation reminds me of this guy i used to work with granted he works like a dog hour wise but he extremely charismatic and wraps people around his finger in any case i tease him about being a total con artist he is 39 and loves cougs they take care of him he has not had to pay rent in years and he can juggle multiple cougs so they all think he just the cutest best sex ever because they have still got it well i certainly do not get it now he found a circle of really rich divorced ones and they actually listen to him when they convey and interest in selling their huge houses to save money but he convinces them not to all the while avoiding having to pay for said house and its upkeep seriously wtf some guys apparently just want to be taken care of and it seems that since you were unwilling he found the next opportunity you will eventually be glad you did not get stuck with him ,2,relationships

Spazzy19,yeah i did this too but it lasted 10 years then he decided he wanted the passion and to feel fiery romance for another person queue selling our house and divorcing though thankfully we are still close he has the audacity to be miffed i spend every night with my new bf ,6,relationships
Spazzy19,not really my ex husband paid off my student loan 7500 before it could accrue interest i paid him back over the next year it was his money that he could have invested or done something else with but it did not create any sort of power imbalance we had a joint account and separate checking savings ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,i offered to do something similar for my bf granted we are fairly new to being together 6 mo but been close friends for 2 years i offered to loan him 3k to pay off some high interest ccs since he remodeled his house he bought which was built in the 50s i knew he would not want me to cover the whole amount even though i could but he still declined my offer because he does not want to mix finances and our relationship yet plus he wants to do it on his own shrug it not my preference but i get it ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,i think i would need some examples of things he trying to talk to you about for better clarity in any case i suspect he keeps going on because he assumes you are tuning him out or he is not getting what he needs from you the first time therefore he keeps trying different angles to see if that will work which only serves to frustrate you what are his goals for these situations ,5,relationships
Spazzy19,actually it unclear whether he released on her if he did that screwed up but the way it worded suggests he just masturbated no mention of what happened at release ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,my bf is not the biggest guy but while he jokingly acknowledged his size on occasion he never appeared insecure in any case i always tell him how much i like it and that having sex with him is a fantastic experience because it is i would never comment negatively about it even if i actually had a problem with it since there nothing he can do about it anyway ed would be handled depending on the reason behind it medical porn other obviously performance anxiety enters the picture and starts a reoccurring cycle so i would aim to be patient understanding and compassionate ,1,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,if he can get porn free ex wife of a sex addict trust me it had nothing to do with me in the bedroom ,1,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,yeah but what will those people think if mommy finds out he been revenge sleeping around and one day gives mommy a not so pleasant std surprise etc i just think staying for the kids without her being aware of what you are doing is a recipe for disaster if y all decide on an open relationship then fine but you are deluding yourself otherwise i get it sex is fluid i read an interesting book this summer called sex at dawn that biologically discusses how humans are not meant to be monogamous one of the options later was basically an open marriage to avoid divorce so as to not disrupt the kids but both people need to be on the same page ,1,adultery
Spazzy19,i felt the same way about my ex husband no kids thankfully he the one that kept having eas and one physical affair but it was not bc of a db on my part finally he just realized i was his best friend and he was not romantically attracted to me after 10 years we are still very close and i have moved on to better sexual and emotional grounds he just wanted to release me and was tired of feeling selfish keeping me just because he was afraid to lose me ,2,adultery
Spazzy19,why even remain married then obviously the one night stand messed with you but why does that turn into you getting multiple people behind her back just does not sound healthy overall and i suspect shit will hit the fan if she finds out ,2,adultery
Spazzy19,i 33 recently started dating my bf 26 and he got diagnosed with adhd inattentive in november things have improved since he started his meds but sometimes i have struggled with how to cope with the differences we have thought process wise i finally got some books online on how to successfully navigate adhd in relationships and marriage and it helped put things in focus pun he actually not too bad off but i tend to get frustrated when he hits the new obsessive state or loses track of time when we have things to do sometimes he still forgets things but i am diligently working to not feed the parent child dynamic because i know he perfectly capable of doing things thankfully he motivated to modify his behaviors listen to my concerns and do things himself ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,i had the same thought about adult adhd very curious as to whether she has it ,3,relationships
Spazzy19,i never thought i would ever consider this but could it be possible she has adhd i ask because my bf got diagnosed recently as an adult and some of the things you have described remind me of symptoms being an ass is not one of them necessarily and it sounds like there are other issues going on as well but this book i am reading currently specifically talks about the parent child dynamic and obviously how unhealthy it is for relationships even if it not adhd the parent child dynamic needs to be addressed by both of you if there any hope for success ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,it not as common but it not abnormal my ex and i divorced in sept after 10 yrs of marriage and 12 years together same reason he just did not feel it anymore as the primary reason it hurt like a bitch having to find a place sell our house and divorce but it was peaceful and we are still very close i have started dating a close friend who knew both of us while we were married and my ex is ecstatic we all three do mma together too i think most people are more weirded out about our amicable dynamic than anything else you will miss aspects of your relationship but it does not mean you have to go postal it may not have entirely sunk in for you yet either ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,i get it my ex and i are still extremely honest with each other like to the point that my bf promised not to be that honest with me because he was horrified about what we share with one another lol but i realize my ex and i have a dynamic that few can handle for example it was important for him to share that he developed feelings for a former teenage student of his and started collecting porn again his was porn and emotional one physical affairs so my boundaries related to those areas i asked that he notify me afterward if he looked at porn after we reconciled and he took the porn blocking program off the computer but collecting was more his thing so i did not make it an issue however i did not want to hear any details about what he looked at or how much he felt for her the reason it good to omit details of the specific nature of your fantasies is because partners tend to try and please you to win your attention back that could include dressing in things or doing sexual acts that they are not comfortable with that is different than expressing a certain interest to please like my ex loved athletic wear yoga pants volleyball shorts so i did not mind obliging it becomes an issue when it turned around and done out of a negative response or fear than out of a genuine desire and love it took me a long time to get past urges to do acts that he told me he did with the woman he had an affair with i asked for details and he was extremely uncomfortable sharing some things i got from her or her ex husband look online for sa or saa groups in your area if there are not any then join web or phone groups for support there are groups for her too called cosa which are unfortunately not generally well attended because of the nature of the problem read out of the shadows and find additional resources out there to help both of you i hope you can find the help you are looking for and i think it great that you are heading in this direction keep up the good work ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,do you go to a group and have a sponsor that who you should tell as the former wife of a sex porn addict i can guarantee you we do not want to know the nitty gritty details like those it good that you told her about the addiction but it not healthy for either of you to put that on her if your addiction starts hindering your relationship like you do not get aroused by her etc then i would bring up more conversations but still those types of details should be left to groups and sponsors ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,so is co sex addiction where the partner obsesses over the sex addict behavior if she feels she cannot go to work then that a huge problem ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,do you have any mutual friends that are friends with him on social media that might be able to shed some light on the situation obviously this is not going to get to the core of the issue but for more immediate answers they might be able to tell you if there are oddities i agree with everyone who says that while it does not matter to him it does to you and conveys a lack of trust i think you should sit down and express that exact sentiment and see how he responds go from there ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,holy shit i am glad you are alive and got away i am sorry you had to experience that horrific treatment ,12,AskReddit
Spazzy19,cool thanks i will definitely look into that one i need some strength exercises since i was out for 3 4 months with a foot injury and lost much of my gains ,1,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,i absolutely agree with you i was horrified and just utterly confused trust me it did not go over well ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,i understand that but 18 is an arbitrary age in many cases years ago it was socially acceptable for a 14 17 year old to marry a man in his thirties and by age 18 she was considered nearly a spinster if she was not already married and having children teenagers used to go to war it this day and age that holds individuals as incompetent children until they reach a certain age i realize there is still a lot of maturing to do but biologically speaking a 15 17 year old girl who already menstruating is already a woman and more than likely looks the part if i thought my ex was a total sicko just preying on her i would have reported him myself the age gap does not seem to matter once you are in your late 20 and up ,-1,relationships
Spazzy19,oh i really need to get back into this my ex husband and i were doing 5x5 progressive sets fairly regularly for a while until life went to hell i am about 138lbs and 5 8 with little t rex arms haha but before i stopped i would gotten to 100 lb squats ass to grass and 67 5 lb bench presses i have started getting heavily into mma over the past two years so that consumes a fair amount of time though but my booty was looking fabulous ,2,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,well you did not indicate you did so i have only this to go off if you think the positives were exhausting what do you think will happen with this one ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,absolutely i am very active with mixed martial arts and i love to hike in the warmer months so it helps me do that i used to need 10 hrs of sleep to feel really rested and now 7 8 is good and i am warmer be patient with yourself at least you have that option to lose weight to improve symptoms i cannot really do that much the meds will help you maintain weight but i know any i have gained tends to stick ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,then why even include it i get the idea behind this because marriages and relationships should probably be looked at as more business contracts in some capacity too many times feelings get in the way or fade and responsibilities to each other get tossed out the window in any case in my mind a contract should not be based on infractions but rather more positive things we will do these things for each other we will pause and come back when we are calmer to sort out things we will speak respectfully toward one another i you will handle these chore responsibilities etc i agree to xyz focusing on infractions just focuses on negatives and does not address the underlying problem ,6,relationships
Spazzy19,i am 33 now and got diagnosed at 21 yrs old i am not a huge fan of medication but these meds will help you significantly you are not broken nor should it affect your ability to get married last year i felt like i was dragging ass and dying whenever i did martial arts so i finally went to an endocrinologist because my regular tests kept saying i was normal yeah we found i am very t3 resistant so now i am on two meds for it but i feel so much better i also got diagnosed with pcos several years ago and i am thin for both of these conditions it frustrating still because i wish my body would function properly but take your meds and pay attention to your body and you should be feeling better soon ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,he was not trying to bang her i do not get it either and think he in a fantasy world personally but that his deal if this girl pops back into his life and the dynamic changed which i doubt because he does not want to go down that road until she older it would be legal here ops so is 21 now so it should not matter ,-1,relationships
Spazzy19,to clarify he did not do anything with her nor had any intention to do so ,-1,relationships
Spazzy19,good to know actually still not finance though ,7,relationships
Spazzy19,not necessarily there are a lot of factors related to this addiction and just liking sex a lot is not it usually there an emotional disconnection paying prostitutes may be heading in that direction but if it safe and legal then maybe not do you feel you are able to say no to the urges is your life being impacted by your urges you can look into sa and resources from patrick carnes if you think you have a legitimate problem my ex was hooked on porn and affairs ,1,sex
Spazzy19,my bf was not thrilled about the fact i have a vibrator bc he feels he will never be able to match it ability i get it and i do not use it around him he now been with me long enough to know my drive is insatiable and i need something when he not around i wish we could explore more of it together but i am content with my near daily sex with him not to care too much get what makes you happy though ,5,sex
Spazzy19,eventually you are going to be glad you are juicy enough to never need lube i get being embarrassed but it normal if he were to shame you for it know that you would be in for a lifetime of thinking sex is gross and shameful no fun in that ,1,sex
Spazzy19,yes but it typically associated with men females can also express it differently like with feeling unworthy and seeking validation by sleeping with lots of strangers etc than men typically do there are wide ranges of behavioral patterns for any sex addict it an extremely painful yet fascinating addiction ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,lol i used to be put off by shorter guys and it bugged me for a bit that my ex husband was the same height as me 5 8 now i am dating a wonderful guy who 5 3 and it does not faze me in the least he a full personality manly and at the perfect level with my boobs and i have no issues bending down a bit to kiss him he is my strong little brick and can carry me to bed quite easily when you are horizontal there is no noticeable difference just reverse what most guys have to do for females my guy does not shy away from busting out a step stool to reach something but sometimes i will reach for him my bro recently met him and said it looked a bit amusing watching us hold hands while we walked in front of him but he was not put off by it ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,why supposed to be zero despite this i can guarantee you there are women out there that will think it odd you fell in love with such a young girl woman but depending on the circumstances could look past it ,12,relationships
Spazzy19,hey you sound like my ex husband as of sept who told me he now 33 was in love with his then 15 yr old student he lost his job she ghosting him so he can move on but he stuck on her usually into women around his age so no i do not consider him a predator we actually continue to have an extremely amicable relationship i personally do not get it but to each his own but he got the same concerns while she now of legal age and there never been any sexual interaction he knows he been cast into sexual deviant stereotypes and it killing him his family is also supportive but he knows there will be a stigma even once she your gf age why did she suddenly get back in touch honestly if you are going to do it then just own it it not like she still 16 she now an adult and there a large age gap no one but your family and closest friends need know when you first got together ,-4,relationships
Spazzy19,you have been engaged since you were 16 17 no wonder your parents are concerned i got engaged at 21 and married at 22 and we got a lot of backlash but we both had our shit together still got divorced 10 years later but not because we got married too young i would say he at least has not done enough exploration and is not ready to actually settle down there is no need to rush into a marriage and you should not with this on the table also it fianc e not finance ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,having been married to a sex addict and learning so much on the topic i would say she meets the description of a female sex addict they are not as common but they do exist you can look up info by patrick carnes or buy check out a book called out of the shadows a lot of it can be compulsive and then each day feeling shitty about it spurns the next round of the cycle it not about just liking sex but having an extremely unhealthy relationship with sex i would not be surprised to find out she would been molested growing up especially given how pretty you say she is if you think she got this big of a problem though and i would agree with you then i would suggest giving her the book information and telling her you are concerned she may be open to it or she may be in denial unfortunately you cannot save her it may take contracting a horrible disease going to jail or being raped to wake her up as a friend relative spouse it not easy to watch there are 12 step groups out there and more if this is in fact what is going on you are a good friend and right to be concerned ,18,relationships
Spazzy19,huge red flags all over you are not going to change him if you stay fine but i think you already know it time to cut your losses and find someone who is able and willing to commit he stringing you along ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,you would probably be better asking this in r sex in any case i am not going to lie the crudeness in which you talk about sex makes me cringe yes it an act and can be straight up fucking but it sounds like you have no idea how to incorporate emotion into it for an even better experience if you want better reciprocation or a girl to initiate and please you then my recommendation is to actually build a relationship with a woman and not come at it in the attitude in which your post portrays i think it great that you have changed your porn and masturbation habits i was married to a sex addict for 10 years but sex can be way more than just the act itself and how many women you have been with and pleased as far as this woman she very well may have orgasmed you should probably talk to her more and find out how she normally is satisfied it very well could be that way if not talk to her and find out what would work better for both of you ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,good lord i am not even dating her but i was stressed reading that and am glad you made this decision enjoy life ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,thanks so much i will we did gain on the house though about 65 000 from original purchase price so we both walked away with a decent chunk of money ,1,Divorce
Spazzy19,thanks i just was not sure how house interest payments and such would be handled we still owe off the 2008 first time home buyer rebate but we can split the difference on that too ,2,Divorce
Spazzy19,you cannot fix him he has to want to take the initiative for his own life rather than place that responsibility at your feet medical condition aside he sounds like he is a negative person and continues to send the message that you are not good enough do not fall into that trap because he a schmuck and wo not communicate effectively or contribute to his own happiness ,29,relationships
Spazzy19,why did not you invite your gf ,3,relationships
Spazzy19,this is why i am terrified to have a kid i am afraid i will get all the responsibility dumped on me and i will resent the everliving piss out of life the baby and my partner she sending you a cry for help and you are in denial ,9,relationships
Spazzy19,also start asking what else you can do around the house if you are not already doing things not only will this help your mom but it will build self sufficiency skills for you once you leave the house overall i would say it a great start you realized this and actually want to change your behavior hug your mom tell her you love her and implement better behavior if you need a tutor at school get one if you need to sit at the front of the class to focus to get better grades then talk to your teachers and surround yourself by positive people who are going somewhere with their lives ,12,relationships
Spazzy19,i am unclear on what specifically you are not doing for him that he wants you listed a bunch of things that sound like you are being attentive so his defensiveness strikes me as total manipulation on his part what exactly is he doing for you to meet your needs ,81,relationships
Spazzy19,yeah i am changing it today but i am accustomed to paying each year anyway i was just curious how the divorce impacted taxes in general too guess i will find out when we get together to do them ,2,Divorce
Spazzy19,it honestly a steal for the nw reno area so i jumped all over it thank you craigslist i am originally from ga so cost of living was eye opening for me when i moved out here 10 5 years ago ca is way more expensive though good luck i hope you get it if you opt to do it ,1,personalfinance
Spazzy19,better start the legal process then if she wo not budge tell her you are initiating it so god will smite you not her ,6,Divorce
Spazzy19,awesome thanks that good to know nah we are on great terms he just realized he viewed me as a best friend than a romantic partner i have moved on to a new guy and we are all friends we are not worried about our financials i still have him listed as my beneficiary and emergency contact too still part of the family just different next year i will get my own stuff unless we opt to split the cost of turbotax ,1,personalfinance
Spazzy19,you sound like you have got a good head on your shoulders and you could more than likely afford it but i wanted to make sure you have accessible backup funding my monthly house payment would have been less than my current rent of 945 mo for 2bed 2bath condo and i make half as much as you right now i can swing it if i lost my job i just did not want to deal with the extra costs associated with a house and am up in the air with my life post divorce one day i will buy again ,1,personalfinance
Spazzy19,that good but with that high of a mortgage i would keep aiming for 4 5 months just in case i bought my house with my now ex husband when we were 24 25 and i had a nice paying job i never thought i would lose life went askew and i found myself unemployed for 4 months thankfully max unemployment covered the mortgage but without my husband i would have fallen behind on other bills without dipping into cds etc i asked because i dropped 25k cash on my new car last feb after saving for 8 9 years life was good at the end of the month i found out info which led to divorce man was i pissed we ended up having to sell the house since neither of us could have bought the other out i have a nice chunk of savings again you just never know what curve balls life is going to throw you and you want to be as prepared as possible ,1,personalfinance
Spazzy19,i switched to biweekly for a bit but the company always took a small piece i finally realized i could do what i was already doing without the extra fees pay a lot more monthly ,0,personalfinance
Spazzy19,if you lost your job do you have money set aside where you could still cover the mortgage it a nice down payment but you do not want to potentially screw yourself over if something happens to you or your job ,1,personalfinance
Spazzy19,i started paying my student loans as a freshman my dad set it up for 60 mo and then basically doubled it each year though i asked him to keep it at 180 my senior year because i did not have too much income the sooner the better ,1,personalfinance
Spazzy19,ok i guess i am just confused as to how the transition will go i do not remember if turbotax gives us that option or if i have to get my own copy to file that makes total sense though ,1,personalfinance
Spazzy19,my ex husband paid the remaining 7500 i had left on my portion of my student loan after we got married before the interest started accruing then i paid him back over the next year ,1,personalfinance
Spazzy19,my ex husband cheated on me back in 2010 the worst part was the lying and then hearing the excuse it was protected with plan b made me absolutely livid i was dead set on divorce but a variety of circumstances finding out about unknown addiction etc led me to opt to reconcile it was extremely hard but to this day i can say i am glad it happened because we were able to get through it together and become so much closer while sorting through our own individual issues ultimately we divorced this year for other reasons but we still remain extremely close it really depends on how much each partner wants to work to make it successful and whether you can truly forgive my ex and i got to the point we would occasionally joke about it but that how we handled it my best friend said she could not have handled that and i respect her own perspectives ,0,relationships
Spazzy19,boundaries you need them there are books and classes on how to say no without feeling guilty they are going to continue bothering you because they know they can your resentment is totally on yourself ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,my ex husband could never get off that way no girl had ever succeeded it was because he would masturbated a certain way for so long that he had to control everything if it was just a face fuck then sure but otherwise no because he had to have a very specific rhythm and control to get off even during sex ,2,sexover30
Spazzy19,i am one higher on oral than piv i enjoy it but i have never gotten off to just it alone this one guy i had a one time encounter with back 13 yrs ago spent almost an hour on me and was perplexed i did not get off do not get me wrong it definitely felt good but i was not in a good mental space my current bf has been the best experience he does not do it every day but usually about once a week he basically demands some pussy makes me feel all desirable the other day he would asked if my cycle had ended yet because he was feeling deprived i was initially confused because we would had sex two days before and it was fine but he said he would been deprived of tasting me for too long needless to say i was happy to oblige i enjoy giving oral too and some days i just like making it about him usually we just like having sex together though ,1,sexover30
Spazzy19,i tell him ahead of time that i need want him every so often i will be specific and ask for slow love making other times i will just start letting my hands wander enticingly and nibble his ear or start kissing passionately the first time i surprised him by lying across his bed in lingerie at age 26 he would never had a girl wear lingerie for him a garter i would caught at my friend wedding the day before and heels he was super excited lol ,2,sexover30
Spazzy19,not that it their responsibility either but could you contact his parents see if they will reimburse you the 2350 and deal with him themselves then just walk away because it not going to get better any time soon if ever my bf financial habits have driven me batty to the point of considering breaking up because of impulsive spending thankfully he pays bills on time and is otherwise responsible improving his credit etc he just got diagnosed with add in november and meds have helped curb the spending but it was a huge concern for me i could absolutely not handle your situation ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,my ex husband started having crushes a month or so after getting married back in 2006 it was about one a year for varying periods of time until his full on affair in 2010 i thought we were going to get divorced then i was dead set on it then because of a variety of factors including finding out about addiction and him working diligently to get it under control we reconciled after 8 months of him living elsewhere it was not an easy process but even the affair brought us closer together in a way i will never regret fast forward 6 yrs to last january and he admitted he viewed me just as his best friend and was not romantically attracted to me last feb i discovered he was now in love and crushing hard on one of his teenage students we tried a couple sex therapy sessions but ultimately he wanted to release me to find someone who could love me completely he was tired of hurting me too in my head i knew it was time but i still resisted it a huge upheaval of your life i still have bouts of grief and i have moved on with a guy who i can tell adores me in a romantic sexual way too i did not want to lose my ex who been my best friend for 12 years i did not want to feel like a failure i did not want a spiritual crisis since we got married in the church but ultimately i knew this was going to continue to happen and i deserve to be sexually and romantically fulfilled i moved out in july our house sale finalized in august and we filed in sept and it was finalized within three business days 2016 went by in a whirlwind we have an extremely amicable relationship but i am still terrified of losing him forever because he lost his dream job over this girl nothing physical thankfully but she reciprocated and it fraternization so now he in a tailspin of depression so my point is that you cannot force someone to stay who does not want to but if she has doubts and y all are able to truly forgive and work through it then do not go down that road yet it will be awkward for awhile anyway but the fog does clear and you will start having fun together again as you rekindle the relationship never forget to remain the best version of yourself by slipping into complacency and taking one another for granted ,2,Divorce
Spazzy19,she can maintain a relationship with his family if she wants just because he being a coward and does not want her in his life does not mean he calls the shots on her other relationships she needs whatever support she can get i am still extremely close to my ex husband and his family and we were married for 10 years my mil specifically told me that she did not divorce me and that i am still her dil considering my family is on the opposite side of the country my in laws are a great support system my boyfriend knows them all too ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,in some cases that is true we had to be careful while verifying job searches when i worked at welfare some employers look at welfare recipients in a negative light however even if an unemployment worker verifies one or two applications it not likely to do anything i never had to report any job applications on my 4 months of unemployment i simply had to answer a weekly questionnaire as to whether i had applied for jobs turned down any jobs etc ,2,personalfinance
Spazzy19,being on unemployment was a life saver for me during the 4 months i was between jobs maxed out it was a quarter of what i would been accustomed to per month but it paid the mortgage have her go apply ,2,personalfinance
Spazzy19,that screwed up wow my first bf got bj nearly daily bc we were not having sex yet i was 17 20 and he was 15 18 while we dated and he would finger me i think he went down a total of 3 times i felt self conscious bc he was not into it so i did not press but looking back i am like wtf my current bf and i do not always start with oral before intercourse but there are moments he randomly surprises me by saying he just wants to go to town on me some of those times he does not even get off bc he not in the mood to cum i have also just been in the mood to please him if my bf had that attitude like it was beneath him i would walk away these days ,14,sex
Spazzy19,well i can tell you that my now ex husband 33 was the same way with his students who were all exceptionally gifted i would told him over the years that he was too chummy with many of them but he thrived in his job rewind to this time last year and i found out he had fallen in love with a 15 yr old student even if she would been 16 18 age of consent it still a crime to have relations with a student at the same school thankfully they never took it that far but they had plans to date when she graduated in the meantime they worked nearly every day together at the end of oct a parent noticed their dynamic and voiced concern neither lied about it but guess what he out his amazing job he was so passionate about and she still there with no issues we got divorced in sept because this was the last straw no jail time but it ruined his teaching career and he still looking for jobs and has to explain the fraternization i would very much caution your bf these are former students but if her parents made a claim then there goes his reputation too ,3,relationships
Spazzy19,i have a background in public housing and welfare in most communities you will find resources that help parents get educated or certified for programs which get you a better footing in the work world local community colleges also may have resource options do you both have a high school diploma or ged hiset if not that should be a priority i know in my city welfare has started adding smoking cessation presentations to their requirements for cash aide as far as parenting there should also be resources for parenting nutrition child care programs hopefully in your area our major university has child development classes offered in the community as does children cabinet just so you are aware while weed smoking may be legal in some states public housing is still federal and not tolerated many housing agencies are requiring smoke free complexes too or are moving in that direction your child is going to be using you and your gf as examples there is nothing inherently wrong by using the system to get ahead and off of programs but you do not want to create a generational cycle being poor and income qualified does not mean you have to have a poor mentality that what generally keeps people in poverty take charge build skills and character and raise your daughter the way she needs that may include becoming a single parent if your gf is not up to the task i hope you are able to get through to her but it sounds like she not found much to enjoy about life yet either maybe a career would help set goals and work toward them good luck ,2,relationships

Spazzy19,i am getting back into bj after a 12 year hiatus since my ex husband could never finish that way in any case he always wanted me to swallow and resented that i swallowed 4 times for an ex bf who usually got a bj every day since we did not have sex then the taste was not my favorite but by far worse was the texture my ex husband was like freaking elmer glue very sticky and more solid than liquid that texture sets off the gag reflex hardcore my new bf actually does not taste too bad and i have swallowed once last night i almost did but the angle in which i was facing was not conducive for it so rather than try and potentially gag and spit all over him i went and spit in the bathroom then i came back and cleaned him off i would like to do it more so practice makes perfect ,2,sex
Spazzy19,having recently divorced from my sex porn addict husband of 10 years i 33 can tell you that i feel your pain i can also surmise he has probably started falling into pornography masturbation again when i first met my ex husband we had a lot of carnal fun sex after a while it felt empty to me but i did enjoy feeling desired i asked to put a stop to it for a bit so we could connect on a deeper level he had a 7 month deployment to iraq and when he returned he respected my wish to wait until we were married in 6 more months we were long distance anyway so it was not that difficult within 2 months of our marriage and me relocating to the west coast he had a crush on a gal at work a year later he developed a crush on a girl from school which lasted 8 months a year later he developed a crush on his high school friend wife who reciprocated and they had a full out affair i planned to divorce but at that time i learned about sex addiction he also told me at that point about his porn addiction which blew me away apparently it would started up full swing when he deployed so many things clicked i could never understand why he did not want to have as much sex anymore or would turn me down when i initiated when he did it was always carnal typically quickies and was not at all about me i always had to take care of myself afterward i tried wearing enticing clothing worked sometimes offering to indulge his sexual fantasies worked for a while but always he ended up with another crush and hurting my feelings i am attractive and wanted sex i would strongly recommend looking into cosa so you know how better to handle this situation and get connected with meet people who can truly support you it for partners of sex addicts there are a lot of resources available to help you understand both him and help you recover as well my ex and i reconciled after a separation and worked it out another 6 years ultimately he fell back into porn and then fell in love with a now 16 yr old former student he wanted to release me to find someone who could love and treat me the way i deserved it was still a difficult decision but the tools i learned through cosa have made this transition much easier but the toll years and years of rejection had on my soul still shine through on occasion i have since started dating my former friend and it such a refreshing difference he can actually make love to me does not want to look at porn and is set on making sure i am satisfied sometimes he tired but when he is he still cuddles and kisses me we probably have sex an average of 5 times per week too before with my ex i was getting maybe 4 times per month and only after i voiced my concern i am sorry you are experiencing this but there is hope out there whether you ultimately choose to stay or go ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,wow i mean people can have preferences but these requirements are over the top my current bf actually does not really meet any of my normal preferences i usually like sculpted caramel colored guys and he white and 5 shorter than me but i find him to be super sexy and i love his personality we do mma together so he active but he never going to have a really lean body does not bother me there are things i have started doing to please him like shaving my legs every day and not adding too much sunless tanner bc he loves my whiteness but only because i want to not because he requires it some of the things on that list are ridiculous and outside of your control i mean completely hairless if you have back hair and i really was turned off i would inquire about waxing it tops but not your entire body i ask my guy to just keep his goods trimmed her size requirement is just horrible even if you do happen to fit the bill i have small boobs and my bf is definitely a t a sort of guy he enjoys them as they are and has never made snide comments about how if i just modified my body he would want me more any guy who says that to me will no longer be dating me i hope you tell her the list is shallow and move on to someone who appreciates you as you are you deserve to be loved and not questioning whether you are good enough ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,though i was the aggrieved party i still felt ashamed i am religious though my ex is not and having gotten married in the church meant something to me i felt i had failed or would be judged i thought i would vetted my spouse well enough compared to people who get married on a whim or just out of love without true compatibility this was not supposed to happen to me but then i realized that god was not punishing me nor would want me to suffer in a marriage that was no longer legitimate after numerous emotional affairs and one physical affair i now look at my former marriage as a stepping stone to something better a period of my life i needed to work on and resolve various issues to prepare for something better like you the first infidelity occurred shortly after our wedding about 2 months actually i felt i deserved the treatment based on an incident in my own past and rationalized that my ex husband was amazing in other areas so i could tolerate this behavior i thought i could help fix him or do offer things that would bring the attention back to me i questioned what it was about me that was so horrible that he was rarely intimate and sought the attention of other women not a healthy mindset at all he is still a wonderful man with great qualities but he an addict and has gotten some help over the years but last february he came to realize he viewed me as just his best friend and could not give me the romantic sexual side he knew i wanted and deserved now i am with a guy who despite his recent diagnosis of adult adhd looks at me with such love and desire you can see the excitement and happiness in his eyes and that carries over into his interactions with me yes he forgetful and can barely plan things like intricate dates but his touch and concern for me is truly amazing plus he can actually make love to me whereas i got carnal sex with my ex or at best basic sex where i had to get myself off afterward anyway divorce is scary and you will have various feelings but it also can open the door to happiness if you choose to go through it ,3,Divorce
Spazzy19,yeah my baby kitty is still in ga with my family since i got married back in 2006 and moved out west it was hard but my now ex husband never gave ultimatums whenever he would visit my family together or when i would play with a friend cat he would always prepare by bringing allergy pills we did not let her in the room we would be sleeping in and i took off my clothes covered in fur before hugging him he and is family are all allergic but his throat will eventually close after a bit back in 2010 we got separated and i got two cats here for 8 months when it appeared we would reconcile he took it upon himself to get shots which he still does to this day now he can be around cats longer but his throat still closes i eventually gave them to a friend because i did not want to return them to the spca and he wore a mask and helped me de fur the house we ended up divorcing this summer but my landlord had not given me the ok for a cat now i am dating another guy who is allergic go figure but if i was in ops situation there is no way i would have been able to give up kissing my cat the bed is where i would stop and even then i would be super annoyed since he not allergic this guy is being a controlling jackass even if they stay together i feel he going to resent the cat even more now ,7,relationships
Spazzy19,your husband sounds like a sex addict i was married to one too though mine was not this far gone you need to focus on yourself and get help you do not need him and you deserve better i recommend looking into cosa for partners of sex addiction you are not alone ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,and that absolutely what you need to do there are always support groups for partners of addicts and i would highly suggest it for you you may be leaving the situation but it takes a toll and there is something within you that caused you to put your needs aside for a long time it all about self focus and recovery ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,my mom always said you are most like the 5 closest people you surround yourself with i used to roll my eyes as a kid but i felt it was true no you do not have to ditch friends because they are not in college but it apparent they do not have a lot of positive character qualities do you want to be associated as one of them ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,i bet you will find your depression improves without medication once you get yourself out of this situation i know being with someone who dismissed my concerns i need financial stability and was putting my finances in jeopardy would send me into a tailspin i lived with a sex addict for a husband and finally had to set boundaries for the marriage which ultimately resulted in divorce it not easy and is obviously emotionally painful but your husband wants his addiction more than he wants you you need to decide what you are worth and want in life i am sorry you have to go through this though ,15,relationships
Spazzy19,i agree and was going to say the ex seems sad but ok not hanging out with him anymore it the cat which i get i am on great terms with my ex husband and we do not have cats or kids we share a stuffed whale lol i absolutely refuse to be with someone who threatened by our friendship luckily my bf was friends with us both before our divorce i just think it ridiculous that the new gf is not even happy with a 3rd party dropping the cat off and even that is a bit ridiculous to have to do to me it shows high levels of insecurity and lack of trust ,4,relationships
Spazzy19,i started having uncomfortable pinching pains during intercourse on saturday and we had to readjust i figure it was creating pressure on a cyst sunday evening went fine during intercourse but immediately as i tried to go to the bathroom afterward i was struck by extreme sudden pain radiating around both of my ovaries i could barely breathe or move and after about 20 minutes it dissipated enough where i could fall asleep i went to urgent care yesterday bc the pain was still present though not as severely and it appears a cyst on my right ovary 2 3 cm hemorrhaged i would never gotten a sonogram before since my doctor confirmed pcos in me 6 yrs ago via blood test i guess it really depends on what sort of pain you are experiencing and where how often ect,1,PCOS
Spazzy19,i have got pcos and hypothyroidism and am skinny for both so while i am happy about my size there not much i can do about lessening symptoms by losing weight i just had my first extremely painful experience with a hemorrhaged ovarian cyst sunday night which landed me in urgent care to make sure it was not a uti or an ectopic pregnancy ,1,PCOS
Spazzy19,umm well you would have to choice to get into bed if that even his intention i saw my first love a week before i got married and it was hard but i was moving across the country i finally realized he was not worth my feelings and another ex brief 3 month thing from highschool filled in for my brother as a groomsman only you know your motivation and whether your fianc would be ok with it if you think he just trying to get you in bed then why are you even asking us if it friendly then only your fianc opinion matters ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,my ex and i m f 33 were married for 10 years and bought our house together at the end of 2008 we opted to sell our house though he wishes one of us would have stayed but there was no way one or the other of us could buy out the other especially after i dropped 25k cash on my new car last feb 3 weeks before i found out he was in love with one of his students i was pissed obviously but i found out he was an addict 6 yrs ago and knew when we reconciled then that this could happen again we decided we would sell and then get divorced so it would make filing easier we put the house up in july and it sold within 3 days thankfully i would already found a place and then he bought a condo to transition into but in the meantime we amicably prepped the house and packed we helped each other move we slept in the same bed until i moved out and 2 weeks later the house closed we split the equity and then filed for divorce in sept which was also processed in 3 days it taken awhile but i have come to really like my new condo i am renting i sometimes miss our house but i have started moving on and ended up investing my equity too it would have been ok to stay there despite the memories but i wanted to live closer to town and friends and there was no way i could come up with 56k to buy him out ,2,Divorce
Spazzy19,my best friend husband is not that bad but he very similar it hurts her feelings but she aware that he more physically affectionate when she lost weight she conceptually understands and works toward a healthier weight for herself too but it a pretty shitty situation too unfortunately he just a more visual guy i suspect your bf is the same way but he should have still invited you to work events too i can wrap my brain around lingerie and clothes but the other is awful ,5,relationships
Spazzy19,i am 33f still redefining myself after splitting from a 12 year relationship this summer essentially the final straw was him realizing he viewed me as a best friend and ended up calling in love with a 16 yr old former student fabulous right my ex husband was not cowardly about it though he faced me and we had an extremely amicable divorce do not get me wrong it still hurts at times and i miss his company even though i have moved on and my new bf gives me more than he ever did sometimes it confusing for me because we do get along so well tonight we were even sparring at mma and yesterday he took me out for my bday i do not recommend this sort of dynamic for you because your ex fiancee is lying acting callously and you are obviously emotionally raw it liable to end up in a manipulative situation it going to be hard but focus on yourself and do things that make you feel better cry soak in bubble baths with wine or cheesecake travel somewhere you have been meaning to go i finally booked a night at a bed breakfast because it was something i would always wanted to do but he always poo poo ed it it was liberating and scary at the same time do not rush into another relationship or fling if you are not feeling up to it yet if you just want to have sex then cool but be wary of attention becoming your validation tool been there done that and i ended up marrying my rebound ex hubby hug ,3,relationships
Spazzy19,my boyfriend has a similar opinion as yours and even though i have never been in that field it still baffles me the topic came up after reading a reddit post about a man wife who was posting nudes of her pregnant body to help with household finances i told my bf that my ex husband half jokingly suggested several years ago during a brief unemployment period that i cam or do something of that nature in any case my bf said it would be a deal breaker even as a cam girl i cannot change his opinion but i think it weird i am sorry he had that reaction and even more so that he looks only at that period of time instead of the woman he currently knows and loves i once cheated on an ex bf back 13 yrs ago under shitty circumstances but i told him right away ive never done it since nor want to ever again however i have always been up front about it when i dated because i know some guys just cannot see past it i do not want to get invested and then be heartbroken my bf has no problem with that but if i would been a cam girl then it a deal breaker go figure ignore the bitchy cousin too ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,oh yeah in college the most i got off during a day was 24 times it might have been exam week it was awesome and painful at the same time i still get this way but i do not do it that much in a day anymore ,3,sex
Spazzy19,from my 33 perspective my bf 26 pays enough attention to what i am saying that this is not an issue for me sometimes i do double check that he heard me and he repeats what i said of his own accord i really try to avoid the parent child dynamic but it more a struggle for me in the financial department i am very good with money and time management and he just starting to dabble into wanting to budget and get financially stable he recently started medication and is making active strides to limit unnecessary spending and pay down credit card debt but it still stressful for me i try not to add too much input unless he asks or i feel it going to impact us on a trip or prohibit us from taking one etc i will generally opt to ask questions about a situation rather than provide unwanted advice or seem naggy we do not live together and he is free to do what he wants with his money however i have expressed my concerns on numerous occasions and he listens and has gotten better i have also expressed my hesitancy to potentially have a child in the future because of monetary concerns i do not want to foot the bill on things bc he did not plan for the future the same applies for planning dates or meals i struggle with these two because to me it screams i do not care about you enough to think about your needs and wants i realize that is not the case but i have expressed my feelings and he and i have been very open with our thought processes he has also made some steps to buy food that i can later cook for us when i am there rather than scrounge around last minute i am very new to this he just got diagnosed in november and we started officially dating at the end of oct so i am thus far just reading books on adhd and relationships i also value an open dialogue i do not want to feel resentful and we are trying to meet each other halfway during this new phase i do very much like his spontaneity and personality both on and off meds and he does a great job meeting my physical love language everything else we talk about before issues arise ,2,ADHD
Spazzy19,i kept my married name and plan to unless i marry again and even then it questionable my ex husband recommended i keep my maiden name before we got married to avoid extra hassle and now that i have done it i do not want to deal with it again ,0,Divorce
Spazzy19,yeah i am not sure why she would rather watch porn than have sex with you but just because she likes gangbang porn or any other type does not mean she aching to have it done or wanting other guys it apparent y all need to communicate more you should not wait around for her to have sex with you either go do your own thing ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,i check out guys because i have eyeballs and can appreciate other men but it does not mean i want to ditch my so for them you have eyes too especially working where you do however just because you work there does not mean you are oogling women around your gf either if you do not like it i get it but it needs to be equal i was not thrilled when my ex husband would blatantly check out chicks in front of me but it was because i would be talking and he would get distracted it was not out of insecurity i can also get your frustration about porn because i have been there with my ex husband he had an addiction though in any case you can only express to her how it makes you feel she not obligated to have sex with you however but i can guarantee you most women do not find insecurity attractive so if you want to salvage it own your confidence no matter how good looking you are an average confident guy will beat you bc of your insecurities ,3,relationships
Spazzy19,ha ha yeah i am about to be 33 but it was complex issues that led to the divorce rather than youth lack of cohabitation ldr for 2 yrs prior to marrying but you are semi right in my mind though i would potentially consider moving in with someone prior to actually being married only if i felt i could marry said person in my current case there are several factors that i want to see differently before even committing to cohabitation it still a huge step for anyone despite whether marriage is a factor and i do not dispute that you do not learn anything about a partner living together you absolutely do i just assess major compatibility things for me ahead of time much of that comes through communication and observing behaviors i do spend a lot of time with my bf but i got to know my ex husband on a uniquely intimate level only seeing him every other week or so while he was stationed in nc 6 hrs one way from me living in his barracks and with a deployment to iraq i was living in a college dorm then too but we could see that we were extremely compatible very quickly and there was no sort of bait and switch once we lived together ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,i was married for 10 yrs without cohabitating so i am aware of how i can learn about my partner both beforehand and after living together and i already know there are reasons why i am not gunning to jump in and move in with my current bf now for me it would make it harder to leave should various issues not get resolved ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,but even in this instance you can get a genuine idea of how he actually feels about cleanliness look at his room is he cleaning up things himself in the joint areas and complaining that his roommates are slobs etc i do not live with my boyfriend but i already know key areas of concern based on hanging out over here frequently ,0,relationships
Spazzy19,this guy posted in another sub what he and his wife do that i thought was neat unfortunately my bf was not into it but they each have different colored paper that they write requests on from simple drop what you are doing right now and come give me a massage or oral or whatever to draw me a bath tonight with candles and wine that kind of thing then they put 6 10 notes hidden around the house car once they are found the action must be taken and then another note is added to the mix the notes can instruct immediate attention or for a designated time frame ,5,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,yeah me fingering myself never did anything but i get the grinding thing i like that too and found it was easiest for me to get off while on top so i can grind and have it inside of me start where she likes it best and explore from there ,1,sex
Spazzy19,i am kind of the same and it rare that i get an orgasm from piv i have not had it from just oral either with my ex husband i would usually just go take care of myself afterwards but it frustrated my current bf i have figured out that i love the feeling of him inside of me and i provide my own clitoral stimulation i am able to get off that way especially so if he adds a finger in the back end some girls just need extra stimulation see if she will dabble in some experimenting ,1,sex
Spazzy19,best course of action is to ask her in the moment because she sick she may or may not be up for it but i am generally always down when my bf says he in the mood to please me that being said some girls me included to an extent are relatively self conscious so if you give her a heads up she probably will shower first so she will enjoy it more too ,1,sex
Spazzy19,when after waiting 2 5 years to make love i was 20 and he was 18 he asked if we could pretend it did not happen told me we could not do it again until we were married another 2 5 yrs and asked me to promise to not tell anyone about it side note he was not even religious just super hung up on reputation also he could drop tons of money on his expensive hobbies but would only want to take me to waffle house which i do love and wendy ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,i did my senior thesis paper on this topic back in 2006 and back then the stats were about 50 likelier to end up in divorce there are tons of factors but compared to other countries in the world where cohabitation is more the norm americans tend to use cohabitation as a test before marriage those who then marry were likelier to divorce msny times these people already know their partner flaws but are expecting him her to change during cohabitating however if a couple was engaged prior to cohabitation then there was significantly less chance of divorce you can get to know your partner well even without living together first yes there will be an adjustment phase afterward but already knowing you are committed to your partner can help get through those times if they are bumpy some people just give up other times people are ambivalent and still get married because they are already together with intermixed finances etc if you are hesitant it best to wait you have not been together that long and you need to feel comfortable with such a life changing situation keep getting to know him pay attention to things that make you concerned keep the lines of communication open and save up money for yourself for the record i was married for 10 years and still ended up divorced this year even though we did not cohabitate the reasons had nothing to do with it nor would living together prior to marrying have brought those issues to light my divorce was extremely amicable but it sucked either way it still hard to leave and cope with changes once you are invested and living together married or not i still do not think i would want to cohabitate until i was at least engaged ,4,relationships
Spazzy19,lots of research articles and studies i did my senior thesis project on the topic back in 2006 ,3,relationships
Spazzy19,uhh you get to know them you pay attention to their habits state of living space how they treat their families and friends etc better yet you communicate you do not have to live with someone to get to know them ,-9,relationships
Spazzy19,my bf feels tired because i drain his supply so much lol plus work stress and mma that we do but he still wants to satisfy me as much as possible which i truly appreciate ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,i have this same issue currently but recently realized i was pushing too far and did not want my bf to feel pressured or used i apologized to him recently and he understands i have got a really high drive and a past of sexual rejection in my previous marriage i am a daily or even sometimes multiple a day kind of gal but he would prefer 3 4 times per week he is not used to being the lower drive in a relationship but has come to tolerate my toy i have for moments he not in the mood sometimes i use it before we see each other so i do not feel as geared up when we are together in case he tired i can have sex with him even if i am not rearing to go so i understand your gf point of view it an accommodation we make to please and not reject our partners because we do not want that same treatment that being said you should not have to feel this way if you are not in the mood it going to lead to less and less sex anyway can you compromise and kiss touch her while she gets off i have to keep timing in mind so i do not end up rejected if my bf is tired i do not initiate and will let him decide sometimes i will suggest we go to bed early enough so we can have fun and still get decent sleep i do not pester him when he focused on other activities even though i would love to distract and please while he working at his computer etc y all need to communicate your feelings more and see if you can reach a compromise ,3,relationships
Spazzy19,then there your answer ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,no but at 18 i cooked did dishes did laundry for the household bathrooms and cared for the cats your son is not 8 either my point is that he should be doing this stuff regularly anyway in order to contribute and learn to be self sufficient not as a punishment you are teaching him as an adult that someone else will do that for him future gf or wife ,18,relationships
Spazzy19,it still outside of her control and not healthy anyway it not even logical to have to tell your work you cannot go away on a business trip because your adult son and husband are so immature they cannot be left alone ,-6,relationships
Spazzy19,for a week as punishment he should be doing that stuff at his age anyway and not as punishment i have been cleaning my own bathroom since i was 8 and it was expected of me what will you do if he gives you the finger and refuses you may not want to call the cops on him but next time you are away and they are doing hard drugs and under aged drinking things might go differently a neighbor might call and then you are up shit creek because it your house and you are responsible and you might end up with fines etc ,28,relationships
Spazzy19,because you are bitching but still enable his behavior he knows there are no negative confirm his actions and that he can disrespect the hell out of you you sound hardcore codependent ,67,relationships
Spazzy19,uhh i disagree this is not her responsibility nor is it within her control she has to live her life and work and her son is a legal adult she not their babysitter but i would be leaving the both of them and protect my own sanity ,17,relationships
Spazzy19,as a person who very much agrees with you and would have probably stayed in a decent but fairly problematic marriage except that he wanted to release me you deserve better it been 5 months since i moved and almost 4 months since my divorce and i already feel so much relief my ex is a wonderful person but he has some issues i tried to work with them for years and years we were married for 10 and believed i was there for better or worse now i am free have a happier relationship and am still there for him for better or worse just in a different capacity your husband does not give a shit about you it appears mine at least did do not let fear of being alone keep you in a dysfunctional family ,37,relationships
Spazzy19,if you were thinking about moving in together right now i could understand their concern but talking about it and planning for 10 months down the road is not crazy i am fairly freshly divorced but i think that enough time to assess whether you are a good match for each other having a welcoming family is extremely wonderful too do what feels best for you and whether or not you actually end up moving you are learning and pushing yourself in a positive direction ,1,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,you should not need them anyway honestly what is the motivation for wanting it trust goes both ways and if neither of you trusts the other then what is the point my now ex husband cheated on me but one of the traps i did not want to fall into was constantly checking up on him because it unhealthy i also did not want to feel like a parent to him yes ideally things should be open for both but you are a snooper and she cheated she very well may just want her space or to vent privately without you seeing it you are still in the rebuilding phase so emotions and feelings are raw but again i reiterate you both need to forgive or just move on ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,good lord and good riddance ,8,relationships
Spazzy19,sounds like he one of those parents who idealized parenthood too and is now frustrated with his life and is jealous of you and every other child free couple once you announce he probably going to tell you just how terrible it is since misery loves company and he will want to rub it in and will probably start a new pissing contest i have no sympathy for people like this and just because he and his wife had children does not entitle them to have people clean their house etc next time he demands hand him a card to a local cleaning company hire a nanny whatever but it no one else responsibility and if family chooses to help then he should be freaking gracious and appreciative ,17,relationships
Spazzy19,wow seriously now i am curious to know the size lol either way i have been with guys ranging from barely 4 inches to 7 5 inches they are all quite satisfying to me i am small chested but i do not need constant validation from my bf i would be tired of it too ,3,relationships
Spazzy19,my boyfriend is in some regards the same though we have sex an avg of 5 times per week i absolutely love the fact that he into just me and not porn or other women my ex husband was a sex addict and i had a ton of sexual rejection he can actually make love to me and i love his tenderness but sometimes i feel like a freak and i am way more vanilla than you i want sex daily or multiple times i want to sometimes be humiliated i want spontaneous sex out in public i want a facial on occasion or just all over my tits i like to get all sexy and surprise him but it usually catches him off guard or i choose my timing poorly when he exhausted or focused on accomplishing things he dominant in the bedroom which i like but he ok with the same variety of positions in bed and just being with me i have even asked what porn he used to look at and it was typically missionary bc he likes to look in the other person eyes i absolutely love that about his mindset actually it pretty romantic he listens and accommodates some requests but i think i am just more afraid of pushing my luck on other things and him thinking i am too crazy it already odd for him to be the lower drive in a relationship ,1,sex
Spazzy19,i was once in a similar position that left me terribly sad i have a guy friend i met online when i was 18 or so but i was dating my then bf at the time my friend was a year younger but we always got along fabulously he started dating a girl named heather and i met them both about a year later after he was sent to ga for boot camp i lived there and he in pa a bit later i went to pa as a brief side visit to family in va and at the time i was reeling from a horrible rejection from my bf heather stayed with us overnight at his place and it probably good because i more than likely would have sought his comfort even though i am not really physically attracted to him in any case heather found out about a year later how close it nearly came after she stumbled upon an im convo he would saved i was dating my now ex husband at the time previous bf and i broke up and apologized to her i explained i had not been in my right mind she did not want him to talk to me again so he did not they later married i respected it but it sucked bc he would been one of my closest friends 7 yrs later he resurfaced ironically after she cheated on him i was already on the west coast but it was amazing to reconnect my husband was fine and there nothing romantic 5 years later we finally got to see each other when he and his gf i adore came down to va while i was there for a friend wedding he went with me as my plus 1 so we could see each other a little more since i was a bridesmaid it did not seem like had not seen each other in 12 yrs he apologized to me years ago for up and ditching me but i understood it it was just unfortunate i personally could not be with someone so insecure despite distance and time we are still very close i am hoping he and his gf will make it out my way this year my bf understands that they are important to me so i say get in touch with your old friend she may be resentful or she might just be ecstatic you are in her life again it sounds like she a better friend to you than your gf was as a gf in your life anyway ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,my ex husband had this same point too and we married at age 22 his core issue was not feeling worthy and was seeking additional attention for external validation added porn sex addiction into the mix too casual sex and sewing your oats is not going to fix your problem you have to figure out the root perhaps you can salvage your marriage ,15,relationships
Spazzy19,my now ex husband had the same problem but realized he was not romantically attracted to me after 11 5 yrs of being together this obviously extended into the bedroom too i am definitely not unattractive and he would describe me much like you describe your wife only difference is that my ex realized he never was in love with me although he loves me he fell in love with a much younger woman we are 33 and was tired of hurting me through rejection it extremely painful my ex had an addiction to porn and emotional affairs too which compounded the problem but ultimately he viewed me as his best friend instead of a lover and viewed me as sexually as he did his sister if you are repulsed then you will more than likely have to swallow the bitter pill and split it hard but i am glad to be free to be with someone who finds me irresistible ,8,relationships
Spazzy19,my now ex husband dropped that number on me last january though while he found me sexually attractive he finally admitted he never been romantically attracted to me and therefore it impacted our sex life a lot we finally decided to divorce after coming to the realization that while he deeply loves me he would never been in love with me for 12 years he wanted to let me go to find complete happiness we are still very close and astounded people with how amicable our divorce was do not get me wrong it extremely painful and there a lot of grief but i am glad to have been released to find someone who wants all of me ,28,relationships
Spazzy19,not if you are regular and pay attention to your body i am not regular with my cycle so it more difficult to track but i can determine which days are days either to avoid having sex or wear protection ,1,sex
Spazzy19,actually she needs to get to the root of why she spending what is she coping from ,3,relationships
Spazzy19,to not argue whatsoever over money my ex and i had separate and a joint account we are both good with money but we would only have to discuss large joint purchases anything else was ours to spend and save he always ragged on me for getting my nails done bc be thought they were stupid but since i paid for them he did not get any input ,10,relationships
Spazzy19,lol i do he not accustomed to being the lower drive in a relationship ,2,sex
Spazzy19,i prefer to keep a maintained strip there and shave the rest sometimes i get ingrown hairs other times a lot depending on the quality of the razor and usually i pluck any that may cause me trouble before i reshave none of my partners have had an issue my first bf 15 yrs ago preferred it completely shaved at times so i accommodated his request i like my guy area to be manscaped too ,1,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,i am about to be 33 and am struggling with this same topic my previous marriage of 10 yrs was child free and i have known since i was about 17 that i had no desire to have kids that being said i am still more of a fence sitter because i realize my fears of parenting are more related to loss of control independence and having a partner who very involved will help alleviate it i like kids and would be open to adopting or fostering my bf really wants bio kids and is 6 yrs younger than me i also have pcos and my mom had to take drugs to conceive me i have told him i may get to a point where i will consider taking drugs to ovulate but i refuse to go through ivf i also would prefer not to have kids past 34 35 so i am not sure what will happen in my marriage kids would have ruined it sooner because my ex husband would have resented the shit out of them and life with my bf it reassuring that he would be very involved and is easy going i could not be a sahm though also as some have stated it is not selfish to not want children i finally had to remind my mother that it was selfish of her to wish an unwanted baby upon me knowing what you like or dislike does not make you selfish it makes you smart the world is overpopulated enough as it is too ,1,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,yeah i hear you i was a virgin until 20 and my then long term boyfriend of 2 5 yrs felt ashamed afterward and made me feel really rejected i started looking for attention elsewhere wanted to pretend it had not happened and wanted me to promise not to tell anyone i get how scarring it can be i am almost 33 and have had technically 4 sexual partners 2 real deals more than 5 min lol i do not think you should be seeking your validation from how many girls you wished you would slept with get it from within and your own self confidence i am a good looking woman but i have got small a cup boobs i used to toy with the idea of getting a boob job but then in highschool i realized i would able to find guys that liked me for me and not for my boobs nowadays bigger boobs would just get in the way of my jiu jitsu my bf sometimes jokes about his size and acknowledges it not huge i am also taller than him but i always convey that i find it quite satisfactory lol before we were dating while i was still married i would told him a story about how i would nicknamed my ex bf penis monster mathews he still remembers it but knows i am always up on him despite being smaller than that ex bf he drastically improved his overall confidence levels though which is a huge turn on ,1,sex
Spazzy19,girl here who has never been with an uncut guy but i wholeheartedly agree ,2,sex
Spazzy19,having been formerly married to a sex addict hooked on porn and emotional physical affairs i can agree it an issue i see the negative impact of porn on how it affects quality and frequency of sex and how many guys end up using it as a coping mechanism the size component is interesting to me because i have never been hung up on it my first bf was probably about 7 5 inches and it was rather painful my ex husband was about 5 5 and i had no complaints my bf is slightly smaller but it been the best sex of my life yeah some angles are more difficult but i cannot get enough of it lol but either way porn skews reality for male size and female appearance and demeanor too ,4,sex
Spazzy19,yes legit natural family planning teaches couples about how to take temperature and observe mucus to determine when not to engage sexually or sexually it pretty cool ,3,sex
Spazzy19,yeah me thankfully i have pcos and even my mom required medication to conceive me i would prefer to remain child free but my bf really wants kids the first time he came inside of me i took plan b then we would hit or miss condoms now for the past 4 months we have basically had nearly daily encounters unprotected it so hot when he cums inside me ,1,sex
Spazzy19,exactly to be honest i felt like a monster too and wanted to be hated for it i had valid reasons for being unhappy but my actions were inexcusable luckily i had some good friends that supported me but it took a long time to get over i hope you have found peace within yourself ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,same here i used to think that my now ex husband who wonderful and a best friend was what i deserved even though he was never in love with me and it obviously impacted aspects of our relationship then it came out that he had addiction problems and i came to realize through 12 steps and counseling that i do deserve the whole package we worked through it and as crazy as it sounds i am thankful he did cheat on me because it allowed us to really come together and address our personal issues in order to be healthier ,0,relationships
Spazzy19,maybe for you but not necessarily everyone i have lived with a sex addict who had emotional physical affairs and preferred porn over real intimacy which was extremely painful in its own right i can say that i very much hurt more deeply having cheated than by being cheated on though neither was pleasant to say the least ,0,relationships
Spazzy19,i used to work employment training for tanf in my state and the monthly limit varied on household size it was not 700 though also while there are federal time limits there are states that start paying out of state funds i imagine it a combination of tanf and food stamps though or just food stamps if she was doing tanf then she would have to be doing self sufficiency activities like you mentioned ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,agreed i have worked for housing welfare and now medicaid in nevada while each state has different program implementation the sanction period is probably the worst she will see no longer having a source of income may also actually push her to do something productive with her life ,3,relationships
Spazzy19,almost 13 years ago i went crazy after my boyfriend of 2 5 years rejected me horribly after finally agreeing to make love for the first time he was ashamed he was not even religious and wanted to pretend it had not happened refused to do it again until we were married at least another 2 5 yrs and did not want me telling anyone about it i was not in my right mind and did end up in the arms of the next guy who found me attractive not my proudest moment but i told my bf that day in person i would gone from the person who judged and swore would never stoop that low to the person desperately trying to make amends he broke up with me and while i know he hurt i hurt myself more based on my own integrity i have never done it again nor ever wish to experience that level of pain ever again my now ex husband of 10 years cheated on me nearly 7 years ago it was a difficult time but ultimately it brought us closer and allowed us both to examine our pasts and grow significantly i still found it harder to be the cheater i was able to trust him again and he never crossed that line i think it depends a lot on circumstances and the individuals involved yeah i made a choice but i realize it also a mistake i made i learned from it trust can be reestablished only if both people desire it and there is total forgiveness and the offending party is making great strides to rectify the situation generally speaking though if there a point where someone is cheating there are usually other major underlying issues that point to incompatibility ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,o o i would not have thrown that thing out perhaps relocated it but not thrown it out i do not recall my parents ever having specific talks with us about sexuality but i was given a kid level human anatomy book at about age 6 7 by the time i was 13 14 i was all up in aol sex chat rooms being that girl who said she was 18 and cyber sexing because i was super curious and it turned me on i started using a legitimate back massager as a vibrator about that time too and i remember when i was in late high school early college i had gotten a uti not from that my little brother ratted me out to my mom about my back massager must have just put 2 and 2 together and so she cautiously inquired whether i was cleaning it properly to make sure that was not the reason for my uti i was fairly mortified assured her i kept my underwear on and then she laughed and said it was a really good idea sexuality is normal and you are teaching your son that aspects are shameful by throwing it away or telling him it not what it actually is i would reopen the topic and explain that just like boys have sexual urges so do females we just have more options for satisfying them alone or within the context of a relationship marriage ,8,relationships
Spazzy19,good grief i got married at 22 and my former husband of 10 years bought me a beautiful set piece for 2100 i never sent him pictures but i did convey that i did not want just diamonds i got a mix of diamonds and sapphires which made me quite happy of course i noticed other glitzy rings but i would not want someone to drop that much money on a ring i would prefer to save for our future and for him to show me how much he values me in non materialistic ways good luck with the conversation with her ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,lol and many say kids ruin marriages too actually i do not think kids specifically do that but rather add to an already unhealthy brewing pot ,2,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,i had a similar but fairly different situation in as much as my fwb and i were basically having a relationship without titles right after i got divorced i started wanting more but he was not ready it would been about 2 months at that point shortly thereafter a gf introduced me to her chiropractor and we emailed for a few days he wanted to meet and take me on a date but i felt weirdly guilty about how my fwb would take it i knew i technically did not owe either of them anything at the time but it just not my style so i tearfully told my fwb that i could not continue this way and that i was contemplating going on a date he finally admitted he loved me but understood because he still did not feel ready went on two dates with the other guy and lo and behold fwb showed up at my door saying he could not handle it and was going to break up with me as friends because he could not bear to see me date others i told him there was an easy solution and voil we made it official the other guy was a little irked but he would been informed i would previously had a fwb so i would just tell your fwb it does not seem like you want more from him so just tell him you have met someone you connect with and want to pursue that path ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,gifts are not my love language i would rather take someone out or spend time with them but i still get people gifts at xmas even if it not my innate style my boyfriend of a few months is a big gift person even if he does not get anything back but i definitely got him several things he will appreciate and enjoy one is even as a tease due to an experience he had earlier this year we do not live together but i know what he likes this is just a hurtful cop out that he does not know what you like maybe he should open his eyes ask or pay attention to you ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,do what you feel is right i was married for 10 years this summer but officially became divorced in sept my martial arts partner is 26 and i am 32 but we became fwb bc we were already very close i never thought i would do something like that outside of a marriage but it was fine at the end of oct we officially started dating i have changed a lot of my perspectives on sex over the past year ,1,sex
Spazzy19,or you eat healthily exercise get out into the fresh air sleep enough and be a generally happy person and you will rarely get sick too try daily green smoothies and add some garlic to boost your immune system i made my bf some of those while he was sick since he obtuse and wo not drink them presentably but they helped reduce his overall days sick ,1,relationship_advice
Spazzy19,yeah i do not understand why she does not come in and tell her son to help or do something the behaviors of both of them would be red flags to me my former mil insists on sometimes washing my dishes when i am at her home i hate it because she disabled and has bad arthritis usually i can convince her to just let me do them so she can relax but other days she very insisting so i begrudgingly accept i always offer and i help her with harder things around the house too her three kids do as well but we all know her ways ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,nope we never wanted kids so they did not enter the picture addicts thrive on the secrecy and then experience shame which exacerbates the cycle you might check out out of the shadows by patrick carnes you may currently be ok with him cheating just for physical needs but i think you are in denial the pregnancy is just an excuse to step out what if you catch something or have something have you been tested which can then potentially affect your child he has porn voyeurism and affair problems these things can escalate as well i know ladies whose ex husbands were extremely charismatic and later were caught with child porn wasted their needed money on prostitutes or started forcing themselves upon women you are rationalizing his behavior but it important to understand it not about you and you cannot control his issues either codependent people are afraid to be alone and therefore stay in their miserable situations i can tell you that if you opt to stay without both of you getting professional and 12 step help your baby will develop similar patterns of behavior do you want that ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,and that your prerogative ,1,relationship_advice
Spazzy19,lol good gf judge much you do you he just did not want to get me sick i can make my own choices regarding my health and he was plenty happy to have me there doting on him ,1,relationship_advice
Spazzy19,we were together for 12 years met at age 20 and married for 10 years no kids thankfully but immediately after getting married he started developing crushes some lasted a few months another lasted nearly a year our sex life was infrequent which frustrated me especially being newlywed 22 yr olds had an outright affair in 2010 and we separated for a bit but we both worked through things and were able to reconcile it only been in the last year that he had an internal paradigm shift and dropped pornography but now he in love with a teenager go figure if you choose to have an open marriage that btw you and him if you are just silently putting up with it then that an entirely different matter my ex and i had multitudes of happy days which is why it dragged on as long as it did we were and still are best friends and loved our life together but i cannot deny i am glad to be free of him in this regard and have finally been able to experience being with someone who is romantically attracted to me can actually make love to me responds to my touch and wants to just be with me i am an attractive woman but the constant sexual rejection i received over the years slowly started chipping away at my soul your husband needs help and so do you you will need to confront him about how it affecting you because that part of learning to take care of your needs and loving yourself enough to do so ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,do not give up on getting help through cosa if there not a local group yes and no is the answer to your question you can love and support your spouse but not to the detriment of your own health and sanity there are generally core issues that lead to codependency coaddiction like low self esteem or feeling like you deserve the situation etc but you cannot save him from himself he has to want to change and start taking action to do so ignore words and pay attention to actions there are sex addiction anonymous groups out there too i stayed with my addict ex husband for another 6 years we grew significantly from the experience porn and affairs and i learned to set better boundaries and articulate my feelings more i come from a family of conflict adverse stuffers while we still deeply love each other and care about each other we divorced this summer because he would developed feelings for a much younger girl who was his student before he got fired he never physically acted upon anything but he was tired of hurting me and no longer felt romantically attracted to me he also violated boundaries by allowing himself to get emotionally attached and started collecting porn again keep looking for help through cosa it will do wonders and make you stronger ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,wow i would be all emotionally conflicted i would definitely be spending xmas with my mother but i think in the future i would eventually be able to forgive them and have less awkward interactions it would definitely take awhile though ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,i do not think she is either but i do know some women who have had multiple abortions i did not understand the chemical pregnancy thing and thought she would had two separate pregnancy scares while using one method and figured it could happen again ,-3,relationships
Spazzy19,she has to be willing to try though and ditch this intruder ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,if there are no local groups there are online or phone in groups i would also get some books on it it an extremely painful and embarrassing place you are in i felt shame and i did not even do anything it does get better though with or without him look into cosa ,1,relationships

Spazzy19,these exact things he told me at the beginning that he has self destructive patterns and would eventually stop focusing on me and go back to hobbies i figured this would be a more natural evening out as the honeymoon excitement ebbed except within a month he was antsy to be super focused on other things i explained that was fine but i needed some time too so we initially worked it out where we would spend 4 nights a week together before it was official i told him i needed a break because he would become obsessed about add to the point he was obsessing over noticing when he phased in and out of convos etc one night he came over late i fed him and i really wanted to have sex and be cuddled usually he a very considerate lover but that night it was all him and then he just rolled over and went to sleep two nights later something similar occurred and this was all after we would spent a fantastic weekend together backpacking for the first time the previous weekend he was entirely in his own head and could not pull himself out trying to talk to him in person was pointless we were both miserable apart so since he was actively working to seek professional help i opted to be patient and continued to articulate my needs my bf is very sensitive to my needs and thankfully the obsessive level dissipated somewhat within 2 weeks i am empathetic to what he going through though and try to accommodate to fit his needs typically i would like to talk on the phone with an so but texting is better because he can easily reread i have offered to read books to him since he had difficulty getting through them and it frustrates him he was and still is going through cycles of relief and disbelief because he could never understand why he rarely finished anything he gotten to a point where he realizes he does not have to be good at everything nor does he know everything and asks me for pointers on financial things or time management he writes things down but will ask for reminders occasionally i will do most things like that if he asks but i have made it clear i do not want to treat him like a child or create a parent child relationship he definitely does not want that either i have expressed concerns about compulsive spending and he does not want to buy like that either even though we have differing views on money anyway so that a relief he expressed excitement this weekend bc he feels now being on medicine and having counseling is giving him a true first opportunity to experience a successful relationship it is extremely helpful that he wants to get it under control and wants us both to be happy ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,so why are you putting up with it you are correct he controlling if you have to get a restraining order do it you can also evict him from your house if he refuses to leave ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,have you ever researched cosa for partners of ppl with sex addiction i used to attend groups but there is a lot of support you can find without judgment from people who do not understand the specific nature of the problem ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,it better to do it now than raise a child you do not want do not feel ashamed however being that you are on bc and have now had 2 pregnancy scares i would suggest another kind or have him wear condoms too you do not want to use abortion as bc ,-5,relationships
Spazzy19,when was the last time you both went on a date and actually spent quality time alone together things start going sideways and people tend to fill the gaps when needs are not met before this point when did you last have a quality conversation even if it was on the way home from work this guy is making time for her are you what she doing is not right but the breakdown occurred before this point ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,if he willing to throw you out after you have been together for 4 years based on this discussion then you probably should consider moving on anyway a marriage or other committed relationship is going to encounter future bumps if he cannot maturely handle a discussion about this then how is he going to handle bigger issues in the future he may not be cheating but something is definitely amiss ,6,relationships
Spazzy19,good grief you have no business being married if rather than focusing on the happiness between you and your new husband you are focusing on your sister your husband did not marry your sister and that the most important thing you need to remember you are the center of his attention i agree with others seek therapy ,27,relationships
Spazzy19,just to point something out since you are on it all my fault mode but while you may have inadvertently mentioned the two names your bf made the choice to have an unauthorized roommate i have a housing background and this always made me twitch in this case though i would not take this on as your fault at all he a grown man who made a poor decision if you want him to be manlier start by letting him own his mistakes and not taking them on yourself ,3,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,if you believe he right why are you broaching this topic i demand reciprocity of affection in my relationship even if we speak different languages my ex husband had sex issues but he always cuddled me my current bf is coping with newly diagnosed add and increased stress at work so sometimes he inadvertently comes across as insensitive or cannot meet my needs i know this is temporary and i talk to him however when we are together he makes sure to express his appreciation of how i care for him and lives to pull me close demand kisses and tells me i am beautiful even if he not in the mood or is not interested in getting off during sex if i want some he will provide until i am satisfied i am highly physical followed by time and service your husband based on these and other posts sounds extremely emotionally abusive my ex was not abusive but he could not meet my needs and wanted me to have the opportunity to find complete happiness already i have way more satisfaction than in my marriage it might be worth considering bc you do not seem happy ,1,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,huh good to know i am thin for having both hypothyroidism and pcos and am always looking for more natural ways to help with it thankfully i do not get the hair but i do have acne since i got off bc 2 5 yrs ago ,2,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,i know which is why it weird to me all around to me unless she specifically declined invitations due to social anxieties in the past it signifies that her bf does not consider her anything but someone to spend time with occasionally rather than someone very important if i had roommates with so they would be included too automatically especially considering op said they have been together for a year ,6,relationships
Spazzy19,now he on 10mg of adderall but tomorrow is a follow up appt and he going to request a little more because he feels nearly normal but not quite there it been a fairly emotional experience for him because he now sees patterns and behaviors that can be attributed to it when people just thought he was lazy he an engineer but had learned various coping methods some not healthy he was dosing on high caffeine levels to concentrate at work for a while to squeak by his counselor tried getting him on a more regulated sleep schedule prior to referring him to a psychiatrist and they are working on the core of other anxiety issues too dad was an alcoholic growing up etc diet and exercise can help and i am working on getting him more involved with diet but the changes are positively significant to even me i still do not bother him when he focused on a project and we are working on communicating on the same page when i feel neglected only recently during a super high stressful project at work i just ordered some books on amazon to read in order to help me understand his brain a bit more because i realize it not necessarily him being purposefully obtuse or insensitive with his word choices or actions with his add are other anxieties and compulsive behaviors like shopping and i am financially conservative and the meds are helping curb those compulsions his parents have similar tendencies though the financial one is what worries me the most though we do not live together he sees it and is striving to change though ,5,relationships
Spazzy19,i was going to suggest this too my bf recently got diagnosed at age 27 and he not hyperactive it has been extremely frustrating at times because usually he seemed to be focusing on me and my needs and then would get obsessive on some hobby and be inattentive not ask about my day and sometimes forget to even really talk to me it does not lend itself to making partners feel special we have been together for about 4 months though we have known each other for almost 2 years he said that he really started questioning whether he had it once we became an item because he noticed my brain did not work the same way and he started struggling at work he started meds on thanksgiving and already says he feels more considerate and more positive about being in a relationship for the first time ,8,relationships
Spazzy19,i find it equally weird and would feel uncomfortable knowing that the roommates would not think i would be coming anyway unless of course in the past i would failed to attend events they have invited me to due to the social anxiety my new bf and i have been together for a little over 4 months but i am invited to his friends gatherings one would think they would all tell ops bf to extend an invitation to his gf even if she does not come over a lot considering this person is supposed to be special to him and then the topic would be broached ,5,relationships
Spazzy19,words cannot express what i would like to convey to you accurately but i feel for you and wish you did not have to experience this decision that being said i know i would want to be let go it pisses me off though that we force our loved ones to basically be alive or starve to death to end the suffering f that we treat death row inmates and our pets with more dignity and consideration it going to be hard but focus on the fact that you are ending the interminable waiting game that more than likely will not bring back your wife to pre accident conditions you have given ample time for the possibility of recovery it is ok to say goodbye grieve and allow you and your children to move forward with her watching over you i wish you the best ,6,relationships

Spazzy19,most people have an ideal body type i know i was not my husband either nor he mine but i thought he was good looking and vice versa but porn addiction leads to unrealistic views toward real life women anyway there no way to meet the expectations nor should we try i went through my own phase of trying to catch my ex attention by dressing different offering to perform acts i was not comfortable with and anything else that i thought would pull his attention from porn and affairs to me i finally came to truly realize it was not about me it just takes time ,1,relationship_advice
Spazzy19,to play devil advocate and because most people look at me and my ex husband like we are crazy unless they knew us really well it could just be an amicable platonic situation i realize my bf is cool with my relationship with my ex together for 12 yrs married for 10 bc he was friends with us while we were married and knows every related to my divorce if my ex husband invited me to such an event i would go too but would make sure my bf was aware and did not overly mind last weekend my bf my friend and my ex were over for xmas cookie decorating i have had my ex over for dinner by ourselves we have hung out and watched tv shows together depending on the nature of the breakup it could be that they just like each other company yet have no desire for a physical relationship my ex is still one of my best friends i even tell him about dating relationship issues from before my bf and i became official he still my emergency contact my point is that after that length of time being together people are accustomed to doing things together and breakups do not have to be hostile forever but i would convey any concerns you have to her and discuss them ,3,relationships
Spazzy19,former spouse to a sex addict check out cosa and see if there are groups in your area otherwise participate in the online meetings and support forums it an extremely painful and scary situation are experiencing but it can and will get better with or without him my ex and i worked through another 7 years together after i found out and we are still close though no longer married i would also check out books by patrick carnes and his wife so you understand more of what is happening and what it entails to help both of you you also need to be going to a group and getting counseling so you do not fret as much over him and his behavior this is coaddiction pm me if you have more questions i am sorry you are going through this hug ,6,relationship_advice
Spazzy19,i wanted to know and informed the other spouse in my own situation yes would you want the wool pulled over your eyes ,3,relationship_advice
Spazzy19,my now ex husband actually cheated on me nearly 7 years ago and before that had had several emotional crushes that started a month after we got married i was initially dead set on divorce but during our separation we were able to reconcile through a lot of hard work counseling and 12 step groups it also took changing my mentality about wanting him to pay for the hurt he would caused and actually forgiving him this summer we got divorced but because he realized he has not ever been romantically attracted to me and was tired of hurting me by not meeting my needs we are still very close because we married on the premise of being best friends but i have no desire to get back with him in a romantic sexual capacity over the years since that event though we grew closer together matured and delved into our patterns of behaviors in order to have a healthier relationship it is doable but it takes work ,1,relationship_advice

Spazzy19,my bf was sick toward the end of october and wanted me to stay away but i would bring him soup and cuddle we did not make out but i would kiss his head or a quick peck on the lips i did not get sick and figured it was too late anyway since we are intimate on a nearly daily basis when i am sick i want at least snuggles ,2,relationship_advice
Spazzy19,omg i saw this too and suggested it to my bf because i like to try new things and just love sex he did not like the pressure of feeling like he would have to drop everything to have sex i suggested a modified version but he was not game oh well we have plenty of regular sex thankfully as for your gf it unfortunate she being insecure about it i guess it somewhat depends on the delivery but i would try to convey to her it just an opportunity to have fun together and build memories while bonding and remind her she able to request things from you ,1,relationship_advice
Spazzy19,i treat each failed relationship or bad experience as a stepping stone since i learn things and know better what i want and need there are some days i feel the past 12 years of my life were wasted because i am hurt but then i remember that my ex husband is a wonderful person despite his flaws and i have grown significantly through all the years i would not be too hard on yourself ,2,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,personally i think you two could try it since 4 hrs really is not that far in the big scheme of things there really no harm i actually dated my ex husband long distance for 2 years because he stationed on the coast of nc and i was in college in sc it was a 5 5 6 hr one way trip then he had a 7 month deployment i found it quite nice to have time to myself and then when we got together usually every other weekend we looked forward to our time together and always had fun it also gave us the opportunity to get to know one another on a more deeply intimate level through conversation ,3,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,this has the makings of an extremely codependent relationship you need to focus on yourself and your needs you keep saying he allowed to play but he does not want to allow you to get a guinea pig it all about him his time his plans for you and his hobby he does not care about you or your needs otherwise he would not ignore you hours on end knowing it bores you to sit there and watch him game your time is equally valuable for your own pursuits so take advantage of it improve yourself explore your own hobbies etc and if you decide to stay with him then meet up with him when you are both ready to spend quality time together as a couple ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,i am working on getting myself back to my extremely confident later teenage self now almost 33 because while i keep myself fit and stylish i do not place my worth in my appearance a long time ago like age 14 i realized i did not need or want a boob job still small chested because it helped me vet out guys who just wanted to be with me for superficial reasons however through various traumatic events i later made the mistake of placing my self worth in the hands of the men with whom i dated outside of that my self worth comes from my life accomplishments learning experiences and the ability to share them good or bad and priding myself on being a person of integrity and compassion ,1,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,my ex husband and i used to joke that we had a self arranged marriage he was my rebound after a 2 5 yr passionate relationship when we met when we were 20 dated long distance for 2 years as he was in the marine corps but we loved each other and were best friends we just were not in love with each other over the next 10 years he kept having various emotional crushes and then 6 yrs ago had an outright affair he hated it because he felt i too was a good woman over the past 2 years i was supportive of his fitness endeavors and i unlike your wife had my own friend base and enjoyed numerous things both with and without my ex husband but he came to realize he wants not just support for his zealous running and fitness interests but someone equally passionate about them i am fit and do mma but he wanted more then he realized he was not apparently romantically attracted to me and was tired of hurting me it sucked to hear to be sure but despite my whole life turning upside down i am glad to be free of him in that capacity we are still close and i have moved on but i would think your wife would not want to be your chore you will continue feeling less attracted to her i imagine and that going to cause more friction and deterioration i personally am glad to be with someone who wants to be with me not just because we get along fabulously but because he desires me and makes me feel sexy and appreciated that latter dynamic was always missing in my marriage it will hurt either way but it soul crushing to be considered an obligation just because you got married young and now feel differently i would try counseling first but ultimately you just nay not feel it i came to that conclusion three sessions in with my ex and just said we would be better off saving our money i would be different if we would had an amazingly passionate relationship at one point that had faded but i figured counseling was not going to suddenly bring forth romantic inclinations when he had not had then over 12 years ,3,Divorce
Spazzy19,i started a fwb relationship with my now bf a week after moving out and my now ex husband kept bugging me about when my bf and i would make it official ex initiated the divorce so we started preparations in april i moved out at the end of july him a week later our house closed for sale mid august and then we filed sept 7 divorce final on sept 12 my ex and in laws know my bf and were all rooting for us to get together if you are ready then date i would not throw it in your ex face but i would not hide it either but i would check about the divorce laws in your state in case it does upset him ,2,Divorce
Spazzy19,mine an addict and had several emotional affairs and a physical one over the past 10 years but despite that he a good person trying to change obviously i was not happy both 6 yrs ago with the full on affair nor during this divorce process but things i learned 6 yrs ago in therapy and 12 step groups helped me get to this calmer demeanor i knew there was a possibility that it would happen again but this time i had the tools so relatively successfully handle the situation without hostility still sucks though ,1,Divorce
Spazzy19,see if she will look into overeater anonymous local groups or online it not good for either of you to be policing her food intake your concern is completely justified though ,3,relationships
Spazzy19,i am a huge kisser and cuddler huge cuddling is basically my drug of choice my current so always obliges and loves to kiss as well with my ex husband we would only do pecks because he did not like to make out except occasionally during sex any other time i felt like i was raping his face the less than frequent enough sex i had in my marriage was balanced out at least by his desire to satisfy my cuddling needs though i absolutely love sex and would do it daily or multiple times per day but i love cuddles even more ,1,sexover30
Spazzy19,my so cumming inside of me really turns me on and thoughts about him doing it while we gaze into each other eyes is a turn on so is thinking about nights where neither of us goes down on each other but we kiss while his warm dick teases me until i am wet enough to just enter love it ,1,sexover30
Spazzy19, i still very much love and care about my ex husband we are recently divorced after 10 yrs 12 together but his sex drive was whacked by sex addiction to porn and affairs i have a hl and i thought he did too but immediately after getting married sex dropped to about 3 4 times per month we were both 22 then and then it was all on his terms and very carnal in his world love was expressed through cuddling and playfulness and sex was just sex i thought i would have to suffer through a lifetime of sexual incompatibility but he was tired of hurting me my new bf is amazing and i have never been happier sexually i refuse to go back to a dead bedroom you can still love someone and move on to someone else who meets your needs staying may just deaden your soul like it did to me rejection after rejection ,1,sexover30
Spazzy19,i have always had a hl and while my partner is lower than me he meets my needs on days he needs a break i take care of myself he used to grumble about me masturbating because he thought that why i was not getting off during oral or piv sex but we have figured out a method where i am satisfied during intercourse too now he feels ok though he still wary of toys sometimes i think i am going to scare him away with how much i enjoy sex and cuddling he never been the ll in a relationship so it new territory for him ,1,sexover30
Spazzy19,usually i almost 33 want it daily but my bf 26 would probably prefer 2 3 times per week i think we average about 5 times per week for nearly the 4 months we have been together ,1,sexover30
Spazzy19,i kept all the furniture i brought into the marriage bedroom set and couches and i let him keep the tempurpedic mattress and i took our original mattress we later used in the guest room he originally wanted the kitchen table set but it did not fit in his new place i had him keep our tv and stand with dvd towers and left him my older computer since i wanted a new one anyway we split everything amicably one of our friends gave me a smaller flatscreen tv and stand and i bought a used ps3 and new blendec blender he felt like shit and i did not care to fight over stuff in any case we are still in each other lives despite no kids and we are fine sharing anything one or the other of us needs or wants to watch etc ,2,Divorce
Spazzy19,how are you doing ,1,cosa
Spazzy19,yeah i am one of the people who started a fwb that now official about a week after i finally moved out in my defense the divorce process mentality began in april and i moved at the end of july we did not file until after our house sold so sept thankfully it only took 3 days in any case my ex was ecstatic when my bf and i made our relationship official of course he been in love with an older teenager for the past year which was the final straw hence the divorce he cannot date her yet but if he did then i am actually at a point where i would be happy for him it taken me several months to reconcile my rejection with that but i feel ok about it now bc i have moved on and know he was tired of hurting me it does get better especially if you focus on what you no longer will tolerate and define what you want in a future relationship but first you need to be ok with yourself maybe start slowly and do things just for yourself even with a new bf i was not feeling particularly festive this year go figure when your 12 yr relationship falls to pieces and life completely flips upside down right but as my coworkers started bringing in things for the office i started getting more in the mood my bf does not have any decorations and i left 95 of mine with my ex bc i just did not care but yesterday i realized i want a white tree so i bought one online then i got excited shopping for ornaments and just having an amazingly colorful tree that i would not have otherwise had the opportunity to do it the little things but try to focus more on yourself and then over time it wo not matter as much what he doing or who he dating ,2,Divorce
Spazzy19,congrats you look great ,2,pics
Spazzy19,i had the same issues for much of my 10 yr marriage but my ex husband was addicted to porn and later convinced himself he just is not romantically attracted to me he was tired of hurting me and wanted me to find someone who could meet my sexual and emotional needs though ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,i relate more to men and typically have more guy friends though i inadvertently ended up at an all women college go figure i was a pretty big tomboy growing up and still have a do it myself attitude i also actually get a lot of pleasure out of doing more masculine activities such as plumbing repairs and mixed martial arts i have never had a desire to have my own children and that like the most anti feminine thing out there shrug over the years i have embraced a more feminine side that been creeping out while i do not wear them overly often i have a great desire to purchase cute dresses i would love to be able to wear a southern belle or quincea era dress somewhere some day i started doing my nails professionally gels but while i love having blingy nails it also serves a practical purpose bc i no longer bite them and they do not break as easily which helps while doing mma i get my hair colored highlighted about once a year bc i cannot be bothered and do not style except to straighten when i have super bed head i do wear makeup though and flattering clothing i am not overemotional and like to be logical practical most of the time but lately i have started changing my overall attitude and am enjoying doting on my bf by cooking for him making him feel special and even partaking in a new feminine activity like needlepoint my main goal though is to be happy being me there nothing wrong with who you are unless you believe there is something you want to change in that case do it so you are aligned with who you want to be no need to compare if you are happy ,1,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,while i personally have not been with more than 4 guys i am 32 now but was with my ex husband for 12 yrs so obviously i was not on the hunt i do not find your number to be as strongly negative as you do i also suspect it higher than you would like because of your sexual abuse some counseling might do you well but the important thing is that you do not want to do that anymore i do not particularly think there should be shame if you did but since you want to change then great on the flip side when you have found a guy worthy of sharing yourself with he will more than likely be excited about how experienced you are be patient and love yourself no need to be so harsh ,1,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,errr that stupid reasoning on her part wow way to be an uncompassionate blockhead ,1,AskReddit
Spazzy19,i cannot keep my hands off my bf and tell him all the time he in turn tries to implement no sex just to rest some nights bc i cannot get enough of him lol i think he knows ,2,AskReddit
Spazzy19,i generally prefer men about 5 11 who are muscular love me some defined arms chest and butt abs are a plus who have beautiful eyes and smiles must have decent teeth i seem to have a thing for caramel colored men and can handle some facial hair but big bushy beards are a total turn off and leg hair but relatively smooth elsewhere personality wise my last three relationships have been with very passionate hobby oriented intellectual men strong personalities that can sometimes take over mine since i am super easy going so i have to make sure my needs and desires are being fulfilled too i need a balance of dominating yet sensitive and compassionate i do not like door mats and need man with a spine but values my opinion and insights a man who not a nice guy but is good hearted must be witty and have an amazing sense of humor must also like to please sexually but know he deserves the same treatment my current bf is hispanic but as white as me and he actually 5 inches shorter than me so physically he not my norm but he got a personality that fills the room and captivates me he both physically and mentally strong and i am quite happy ,2,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,cannot speak for pot but porn can definitely do it if he hooked on it and likes it bc he does not have the hassle of having to meet your needs having been married to a porn addict i can tell you that it is not you nor should you try and change your appearance or offer services you are uncomfortable just to get his attention there are resources out there for both of you if this is the case ,2,sex
Spazzy19,i do not agree i am friends with a trans female and her family did not push her into feminine activities she was naturally drawn to them from a young age i also had a client who was extremely involved in the trans community because her six year old bio daughter identified as a boy and wanted to be one he even changed his name trust me it would be way easier for the mother not to deal with cps and all the judgment she receives by forcing her to be a girl but what kind of relationship does that build personally i would want parents who accepted me as is and did not force me into stereotypical gender roles that will build resentment later ,10,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,definitely with you on this my ex husband and i did not want children but my bf really does i am not even sure if i can have them but i still sit the fence i do like kids in general but i would die inside being a sahm i like having the rpw mentality but it does not mean i have to go against what i like out of life even if that includes not having a traditional family or doing more manly activities too ,2,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,i personally enjoy working and like to be in positions where i can positively impact people or the overall agency updating policies or testing the effectiveness of social service changes etc but that just me i am nearly 33 and do not have children but if that should change then i still would not be able to be a sahm however i do not look down on anyone who is or who enjoys feminine hobbies i just started learning needlepoint but i also very much enjoy mma not cage fighting but the techniques would be applied if i did because it empowers me i also love doing on my bf and learning new recipes etc ,6,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,wow i have been officially dating my bf for slightly over 2 weeks the dynamic changed 3 months ago but we have known each other for 1 5 yrs and i am going with him and his parents to thanksgiving in ca at his sister house probably going to even share a room with his parents that super shitty that he cannot even acknowledge you are in a serious relationship does he just view you as a fuckable roommate ,5,relationships
Spazzy19,i am on the west coast here in nv too and just recently started embracing more rp aspects i will still vote on things i feel protect women rights but i am fine having a more traditional relationship and balancing most of my perspectives ,2,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,wow that level of denial is amazing my ex husband had several emotional and one physical affair and i needed to know everything we worked it out for 6 more years after a lot of effort but ultimately he started falling into the same patterns i would definitely want to know if my husband was having an affair and do not just want to stay because i fear being alone ,4,relationships
Spazzy19,trust me i want sex too but i am not just giving it up willy nilly to whomever i do not expect anything from any particular guy i might choose to date and he free to leave and fuck whomever i never said i did not care what men want but it needs to be in congruence with my own needs and desires the mentality that he wasting his time because i may not choose to put out by the second date is sad imo why does that automatically lead to i must be looking for a better guy i was in a relationship with a guy for 2 5 yrs started my senior yr of highschool and he was the one that did not want to have sex until marriage i respected it albeit wished we would but we were devoted to one another my next relationship marriage was 12 yrs long and it did get sexual on the 2nd date and i am currently happily dating someone exclusively i have no need to compete against anyone else in particular and am fine waiting until i find a guy worthy of spending time with and vice versa i do not think one or the other in a relationship deserves anything over the other however they each need to be on the same page and have mutual respect for one another ,1,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,i am rather torn on the issue because i do feel women should be able to wear what they want or go where they please without being assaulted note i do not consider cat calling rape and would roll my eyes at a woman complaining about it after getting dolled up it to be expected at that point however like some others have said a woman has a responsibility to ensure her own safety my friend was raped by guys she knew in the military and thought she trusted she is definitely not one to be all girly and worked the mechanic shop in the army she has a 14 yr old daughter from that experience but going out alone to places seeking that attention is risky there a youtube cartoon video that came out after a fairly recent ca rape that made headlines where a girl passed out outside and this kid went to town on her even if she may have said yes before and who knows if she actually did no one should have sex with an unconscious person the youtube video compares consent about sex with asking for a cup of tea it sadly humorous but very accurate imo you can just search consent tea and it will come up ,3,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,no she did not say she would never put out but is frustrated about how quickly some women put out you do not deserve sex just because you took me out on two dates if i like you and feel chemistry maybe or maybe i would rather wait to see if a guy is worthy of me sharing myself with him if a guy wants to bail on me for having standards then great he is not worth it to me then anyway but there are no worries of a dead bedroom on my end in any case i will be his little slut when i have deemed him worthy ,2,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,i brought up my desire for a relationship with my current boyfriend in a couple of instances we would known each other for 1 5 years and this change in dynamic started in august after i moved out of the house with my now ex husband finally the divorce process had started in february but we did not actually file until september of this year needless to say it started out as more a relationship esque fwb which i was ok with for a while considering how things had been going in my life i also understood his concern about not wanting people to assume he was a homewrecker because we all attend the same martial arts studio he was also concerned that i was freshly divorced but admitted he just was not ready for a long term committed relationship however i at times conveyed my opinion that we were a couple without the title given we spent basically every evening together i cooked for him he would met my mom and aunt i have known his parents etc he even took me backpacking in october too however toward the middle end of october i started getting frustrated because it was going nowhere and he was still just introducing me at gatherings as just my name it hurt because i was actually starting to feel the falling in love feelings but i realized what we had was not sustainable as it was and i had no desire to remain in a relationship with no romance yet again so i tearfully bid my goodbye and informed him that i could not maintain the dynamic as it was and indicated i was going to move on and try dating this new guy my friend introduced me to i had not yet met him he understood and admitted he was actually in love with me but still did not think he could provide me with what i wanted i went on my two dates but really was not feeling it when i returned home from my second date a week after the conversation i had with my bf he showed up on my door with a pot of mini roses my ps2 which had been at his place for over a year and a card telling me he loved me but basically had to break up with me as friends because he could not bear seeing me date other guys because he realized he was an idiotic emotional blockhead and wanted to start over correctly with me because i am everything he always wanted i obviously told him there was an easy solution to this problem and voil here we are today point of my story is that i made my intention known was patient but ultimately had to take care of my needs even my dating the other guy was not motivated at all out of malice but it just so happened to have a positive effect on my bf i am grateful it worked out but i was fully prepared to just even be alone since i was not a huge fan of the other guy i would rather do that than just dredge along in a relationship going nowhere ,2,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,no you put yourself in this debt wow yes you desperately need to seek therapy i hope you have come away with learned lessons from this mess ,5,relationships
Spazzy19,i am obviously a hl female almost 33 yrs but i have always been hl it only dissipates when i feel like my partner is not interested in me sexually my bf is 26 yrs old and struggles to keep up lol but he does a fabulous job ,2,DeadBedrooms
Spazzy19,i am sure she is jumping to do that considering you think she ugly and otherwise unattractive sounds like a fabulous marriage where do i sign up rolls eyes ,6,DeadBedrooms
Spazzy19,you are correct in saying this because otherwise she develops coaddictive behaviors policing him porn is his problem but it ultimately also affects her cosa is for partners of sex addicts to help do what you are suggesting ,5,DeadBedrooms
Spazzy19,having my own accounts plus a joint if need be has always been my motto when i was married my husband and i had our separate checking accounts play money and we would contribute a portion to joint to cover house expenses or dates we also saved separately makes life easier in my opinion to not have anyone nagging me about how i spend my money i get why it upsetting but you should probably have your own funds available too not necessarily as an escape from your marriage but just to have and do with as you please ,3,relationships
Spazzy19,i like it daily but would settle for 4 5 times a week in my previous marriage it was maybe 3 times per month ,3,DeadBedrooms
Spazzy19,porn addiction is a real thing and so very painful i am recently divorced because my husband of 10 years 12 together also kept having emotional affairs and one physical affair we did 12 steps for awhile but he resisted he finally wanted to divorce because he was tired of hurting me had gone back to porn collecting and was in love with a 15 16 yr old over the years i had countless discussions about how our sex life was not what i wanted it was always about him and when he was finally in the mood but it was emotionless fucking even then i am sure he was fantasizing about something or someone else too he an awesome guy but he could not meet my needs and he knew it when we dated our sex life was way more frequent which he admits was because of the novelty newness factor once we were married it was game over and the thrill of the hunt was no more you are boring sexually to him because he wired his brain to respond to unrealistic stimulation your husband needs help if he wants to salvage his marriage but so do you saa or sa is for the addict and cosa is for you they are great sources of information and support ,3,DeadBedrooms
Spazzy19,he gets off usually more than me and generally each time but if i am rip rearing and ready to go then i get mine once or more there have been a couple of times where he has not wanted to get off at all but he gets immense pleasure pleasing me i have no complaints and have been extremely surprised about how my attitude and ways of showing affection have changed compared to my previous marriage my bf actually was the one to introduce me to this sub because he realized i was beginning to fit with the mindset besides physical affection i do not mind doting on him via cooking and cleaning either which i either was indifferent to or semi resentful of in my marriage it amazing how having your needs met changes your overall attitude and demeanor ,3,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,i am the same but i think it a natural response to feeling desirable and turned on more frequently it puts us in happier moods and therefore we seek to find that feeling again ,1,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,my new bf and i i have known him for over 1 5 yrs though generally average 6 times per week and this has been holding steady for the past 3 months he expressed a concern that we are having too much sex lol because i wear him out i am almost 33 and he 26 but while i do love to cuddle and sometimes torment he responsible for at least half or more of the sessions i love it when he tells me he finds me so sexy and irresistible and coupled with that is our amazing emotional dynamic most people who know us assumed we were already together even when i was still married because we just got along so well i have a very high drive though and it even higher when my needs are being met he not a fan of toys as he views it as a reflection on himself but he knows i have one and use it when i wo not be seeing him i prefer the closeness to him though ,2,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,hypothyroidism and pcos aside i got diagnosed with then at age 21 and thankfully have been slender for both but it frustrating too bc i cannot weight loss fix any if it you are in this boat because of emotional eating most likely you have self worth issues which is why you are also tagging along with this jerk you do not think you deserve better surgery will probably be pointless because if you do not address the underlying issue which consequently results in you tolerating his disrespectful behavior you are going to eventually put on weight again and the cycle will continue you have the power to say no and leave love yourself enough to do it he certainly does not love you ,2,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,you are welcome there is always hope it just takes a bit of time reflection of self improvement why did you end up here and for as long usually it boils down to lack of feeling of self worth but you need to explore it and patience to pull yourself back out there really no point in harboring anger toward her in the long run so i recommend just focusing on yourself and your needs ,1,DeadBedrooms
Spazzy19,i left my db marriage and have found someone who closer matches my hl i could still probably have more lol so it a good thing i can take care of myself too but i went from 2 4 times per month of unfulfilling emotionally disconnected sex to nearly daily with a bf who also emotionally meets my needs he is capable of actually making love to me as well which has been absolutely fantastic my ex husband was a sex addict so for 12 yrs i did not have sexually normal relationship i absolutely refuse to remain in a sexually unfulfilling relationship in the future the process of leaving was difficult because i was attached to my ex husband but life is so much better he actually initiated the process bc he was tired of hurting me ,3,DeadBedrooms
Spazzy19,i about fell over when one of my catholic priests suggested i leave my now ex husband it was very freeing i am glad you have family support ,6,DeadBedrooms
Spazzy19,i would love it my ex husband did not seem to care that i used my toy to get off i think he just felt i was impossible to satisfy and basically got his and knew i would take care if myself rolls eyes we had sex maybe 2 3 times per month which frustrated me because i am hl my current bf is amazing and i generally have it daily but he weird about toys thinks it a reflection of him he knows i have one but he also realizes i am super hl and can get off several times and still want him later he does not want to play together which saddens me bc i think it would be fun but if he got me another vibrator i would consider it such an act of love ,1,DeadBedrooms
Spazzy19,my now ex husband had several emotional affairs and one physical affair over the course of our 10 yr marriage and pornography and fantasy on his end led to a dead bedroom from my perspective other than the issues with sex we had a great relationship and partnership so i understand your viewpoint on seeing life unravel before you this summer i had to finally move sell our house and get divorced it a shame like you we did not have kids it hard to walk away but you can and it can be done amicably i had an extremely easy divorce and am still close to his family it will hurt like a bitch for a while but only a month or so out i look back and am more frustrated with myself that i stayed for so long i have someone now that meets both my emotional and sexual needs is pretty normal sexually and is in love with me we have known each other for a while there is no comparison i will always love my ex husband because we have so many good memories but there is no way in hell i would touch him with a 10ft pole romantically or sexually ever again i hope you can find the same peace ,7,DeadBedrooms
Spazzy19,my ex husband never could with anyone but he would developed a personalized method from years of masturbation and porn even in sex he had to be in complete control to cum ,2,sex
Spazzy19,my bf and i will typically get up to pee individually and then brush our teeth and hop back into bed for a few more cuddles and kisses ,2,sex
Spazzy19,my husband of 10 yrs did this to me this past year it completely sucks while you are in it we had to sell our house find places separate our stuff and i had to lose the unique connection i had with my best friend husband but i realized i cannot force someone to love me and he wants me to be happy and find someone who can meet my needs it was amicable but it killed me inside for a bit divorcing was hard too but thankfully easy but like you i have had amazing friends and in laws my family is across the country too that have been extremely supportive and wonderful i have a good job church and martial arts here so i do not plan on moving back but it a smart choice if you cannot do it on your own it might lead to some resentment for awhile but trust me it better in the long run that he letting you go if he feels he cannot meet your needs my ex husband misses me and loves me still but i am already much happier without him just give yourself time to heal hug ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,i followed my high school ex bf for years after a nasty break up and literally jumped into the relationship with my husband recently divorced 12 yrs later who even had the same name as my ex for me it was guilt and anxiety that fueled it i actually did not think it was healthy to be with him but i desperately wanted to fix relations and misses my best friend i was still in love with my ex even when i got married 2 yrs later and i finally shook the main obsession another 1 1 5 yrs later i would occasionally fb stalk him over the years until i finally just stopped doing that by defriending him bc i saw he finally seemed happy obviously it was not healthy especially in the beginning and later i came to realize i thought about him more as an idea because my husband had a lot of his own issues which included no desire to be romantic with me as a result my ex became a thought because i wanted that romance and passionate feeling again once i finally started healing from my past i just had not cared when i got married because i was so hurt i never wanted to do that or be that close to someone again your gf may resist your suggestions to see someone my husband knew i still was hung up when we got married and that i still was reeling a couple yrs later and i regret i basically skipped over the phase where i could have initially fallen in love with my husband i later did but his own issues prevented the marriage from lasting i do not even know if we would have gotten married if i would been in a healthy place he a great guy but i need passionate romance and he wants it too he just does not feel it for me apparently even though he deeply loves me so i caution you that while you may be in love she not 100 yours and you do not know how that could adversely affect you later counseling may help if she willing to go though ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,good points above also to clarify sex addiction is not just for those who like to have a lot of sex i would not necessarily roll your eyes at it because if it is becoming a problem and affects your health or job etc then you might want to look into it some guys with sex addiction do not have sex with their partners regularly because they are so hooked on porn others use porn and are hypersexual some go to prostitutes rape or go for children it a very diverse addiction world most of the time though people with the addiction feel a lot of shame based on their actions and are emotionally disconnected which it sounds like you are not entirely i have a very high sex drive myself but i refuse to satisfy my cravings in an unsafe manner or by taking on numerous partners it all a matter of what is meaningful to you based on what you truly want vs what your body wants ,1,sex
Spazzy19,nope you are not enabling immature behavior props ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,thank you you and my bf are the same height and he does the exact same things he very smart and charming and his personality attracted me to him easily i am 5 inches taller and he likes when i wear heels too ,1,sex
Spazzy19,trust me as a woman who 5 8 and very much loves my 5 3 bf it about how you carry yourself no one will be attracted to a whiney guy who cannot get over what life dealt him i have small boobs yeah i could modify them but i have no desire to do it i would rather my guy love me for all of me the way i was born i call my bf my little napoleon he funny witty sarcastic works out and is strong he charismatic yes he went through a rough stage in high school etc but literally outgrew it i would not be with him if he was still in that phase because i want a strong confident partner start loving yourself and you will start attracting women ,5,sex
Spazzy19,nope no kids in the middle and at least my bf now is a guy who gets aroused in my presence extremely easily my ex had a bad porn addiction so i absolutely love seeing the sense of ecstasy wash over my bf when he cums or how when we first did it without a condom he moaned in pleasure about how good it felt how close we were and how hot tight wet i felt even more of a turn on i have only been sexual with 3 guys and really only my ex husband and my bf but the difference in their cum really fascinates me my ex was almost like sticky glue he a health nut but my bf is super watery my first bf was probably in between i could probably consider swallowing my bf based on the consistency but my ex would have made me gag lol ,2,sex
Spazzy19,my ex husband had a pretty bad porn addiction and it adversely affected our marriage because he no longer desired to initiate sex with me regularly and did not respond positively when i would initiate if you are uncomfortable then you need to convey that to him if he disregarding your feelings after you have conveyed them then that a completely separate issue i personally am not too iffy about porn unless excessive but i know other people are sensitive to it but i know the extreme pain of feeling rejected only for him to run to porn too ,2,sex
Spazzy19,a mixture of fear of pregnancy and being superbly naughty which turns me the hell on lol my ex husband of 12 yrs always pulled out but he could not use condoms i was on bc for pretty much all but the past 2 years though we just did not want kids fast forward to my current bf he pulled out a couple of times and occasionally we use condoms but prefer nothing i am not crazy about having kids but if it happens it happens i think i would need special drugs anyway to assist with that endeavor soooo we have sex nearly once a day and i absolutely love it it turns me on so much to think about the potential risk in addition to knowing that he loves it too it pretty messy but i love wrapping my legs around him afterward and cuddling sometimes i will ride him this is the way i prefer to get off during sex and we have cum together on a couple of occasions it freaking amazing and then we laugh at the mess we make when we pull apart it not the greatest after feeling with it physically falling out etc but i do not mind it anymore i kind of feel that since we started doing this several months ago i have been crazy hornier too ,2,sex
Spazzy19,ooh yes this is definitely a perk too d,6,sex
Spazzy19,yeah i am taller than my boyfriend and have no desire to dominate him quite the opposite actually i love it when he takes charge ,4,sex
Spazzy19,normally i have been attracted to men a bit taller than me i am about 5 8 but my ex husband was my height and it initially threw me off now i am dating a guy who is 5 3 and it does not phase me at all does not matter when you are lying down right he got a big personality and is super strong and i like that he can easily pick me up plus i like enveloping him in my long legs i definitely do not mind bending down for a kiss ,6,sex
Spazzy19,i would recommend that as a possibility too but only if it was discussed up front in the beginning now doing it only cements that he does not trust her and i personally could not do that it would hurt too much i think this relationship is done for if he invalidates her feelings and does not trust her after 2 years ,3,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,lol that me too closeness is very important to me outside of even just sex physical touch is my primary love language my bf is happy to oblige my need thankfully ,1,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,he can very much get help as can you cosa is a 12 step program for you and saa is for him there are great resources out there but do not fall into the trap that leaving solves all your problems there are reasons why you have stayed through this and obviously your self esteem and worth have been impacted you are likely to fall into similar situations until those issues are resolved ,1,relationships
Spazzy19, hug i just got divorced because my husband finally admitted in january that he was not attracted to me anymore i look fine and still the same way as when we dated but he never apparently been romantically attracted to me over our 10 yr marriage and married me because he loved and cared about me otherwise he just could not do it anymore and wants to be with someone else he can feel passionately toward sometimes there a reason and sometimes there is not it a bitch to experience either way the difficulty is not thinking it you because it not ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,this is a classic case of sex addiction and you are the coaddict i have been there and you should really look into some professional help to avoid the manipulation games he is grasping at straws to save his life from spiraling out of control he does not control you nor is he in control of his own life so what if he spills the beans on your new relationship he would have to face the music himself there is probably a lot of shame for you both from tolerating the behavior for so long and for your fear of the relationship with the new guy but it not on you or about you and it passes you do deserve happiness but only you can decide if you want it first step is saying no to your husband and standing up for yourself ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,i am 32 and still would not feel ready it perfectly ok to not want kids but we feel societal pressures there are obviously good sides to parenthood but i have never felt a biological drive and enjoy my life as is outside of having a partner who really wanted them and would be very involved i like kids but have no desire to deal with kids under 6 on a long term basis i also know women who both are ecstatic about being moms and those who horribly regret it and resent it outside of what your husband wants you need to reflect upon it yourself i would say you are leaning more toward child free but are somewhat enamored about the idea it a huge decision then you need to convey your concerns to your husband ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,this is totally bizarre to me and i am catholic too i get they are paying for school but she 22 and not 16 why heck is she allowing them to control her this way and if you live in the same town why are you having to skype rather than see her at your place or a neutral place my ex bf had super controlling parents which significantly impacted our relationship but at the time he was 15 18 yrs old it finally took its toll and i am glad i did not marry into that family if she cannot stand up to them now or even keep you in the loop i would seriously reconsider your engagement anyway ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,this is my worst fear and why i am honestly one of the reasons i am not interested in having children if one day that should happen i know i am not cut out for being a sahm separately from that i understand her frustration several years ago i was in a top level position after a recent promotion but because of our state laws the former executive director who did not like me used the state probationary laws to let me go with no legal repercussions i am skilled and was passionate about my job but it was beyond my control my ex husband is a teacher so i made about twice he did at the time for 4 months i was unemployed and trying to find a new job it was frustrating and demeaning in a way it affected my self esteem and the process took a toll on me my ex husband was extremely supportive but i resented his ability to go to work and be productive i finally had to start volunteering at the spca while job hunting to just feel productive and like i was impacting something it did wonders before i finally got my next job it was not a great job and took me 2 years to find something better but it was better than the frustration at home as some others have suggested networking some areas also have programs geared toward job placement and skills training here in nv we have a community college with a program specifically geared toward sahms transitioning back into the workforce they offer certification courses and guidance because they know they have been out of the loop check out community resources even if it not in her desired field she needs to feel productive and identify as something other than mom i am glad you are concerned just keep supporting her ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,yes it extremely intoxicating to have attention and be physical but what i am working on is not seeking that validation externally but by having my self worth come from within being confident in my choices loving myself and not shying away from situations because of fear i view every relationship as a stepping stone hopefully in the right direction i am not afraid of future relationships or that every guy will cheat on me or be addicted to porn like my ex but i am open minded and know concretely what i want in a future relationship and will no longer settle i would not worry about girls specifically right now start doing more things you like with people you enjoy as you are doing already it will boost your self esteem and develop you as a person outside of your condition and that confidence will attract the ladies even if they do not work out do not get discouraged the guy i am seeing now is dealing with figuring out whether he has add it a lot and taking a toll because he also obsessing etc honestly i am not sure i can handle some of the ocd parts impulse to buy things goes against my more conservative financial outlooks but his condition does not make me like or care about him any less it outside of his control if it does not work out for me or you with a girl it better than the alternative which is staying together resenting and having a shitty relationship better to move on to find someone who is more equipped to handle it you know ,1,relationship_advice
Spazzy19,i would say you just started albeit not ideally however the girl has to sort out her own issues with her relationship and you cannot own her actions i do not recommend going after taken girls though however it made you realize it can and does exist out there for you it exhilarating and freeing i just got out of a 10 year marriage that i felt stifled in and did not think i would find someone who wanted to meet my needs i now have a fwb who does and it given me a taste of life again and i love it do not let your pain and condition hold you captive live love take risks you wo not know if a girl would be able to handle and support you until you try ,4,relationship_advice
Spazzy19,i had the same issues with my ex husband over 10 years it does not get better especially if he not paying attention to your needs after numerous discussions it extremely hard but you proceed to seek out someone more compatible i am still close with my ex husband but have zero desire to go back to my dead bedroom ,6,relationship_advice
Spazzy19,your husband has a serious sex addiction problem and you are doing the right thing protecting your daughter you also have an addiction to your partner and need serious codependency help as well because you no longer can ignore the signs in front of you and must deal with the situation i was married to a sex addict too and know women men in similar or even worse situations than you there is hope cosa can provide you with materials and a support group to help you cope your self esteem will improve and you will get stronger you do not need judgment you need love and support to deal with the transition and shame that associated with this chaotic situation but you have to want it you are hitting bottom realizing you have allowed the problem to continue this far and now your daughter is suffering the consequences so are you protect yourselves and your children you all deserve happiness and a safe environment your husband is responsible for his own actions and choices addiction or not he needs to hit bottom too and he never going to do that if he sees it tolerated ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,you are not needy but you have needs i have a hl and like you have physical touch as my love language i am done with being with guys who cannot meet that need in me i was married for 10 years and had way too many conversations about hey kiss my shoulders and neck hug me passionately vs playfully why wo not you make out with me i am a cuddle whore too so as long as i have that i can forego sex for a bit but i want it all my ex husband had a porn addiction that affected his ability to be intimate with me do yourself a favor and take care of yourself that may mean giving up the relationship to find someone more compatible it sucks and is scary but from my own experience i now look at myself and question why i waited so long ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,unfortunately they can change their minds even after they put a ring on it learn from it add it to the cache of what you actually want and push through ,1,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,uggh yes just yesterday i had the discussion with my closest friend that became physical in early august we have helped each other get through a very hard time for me recently divorced from my marriage of 10 years and my friend was up front about not being ready for a relationship cool neither was i however we were exclusive spent pretty much every evening together have planned things together and all in all had an informal relationship right now he going through an obsessive state trying to determine whether he has add which obviously very much impacts his life some of my needs are no longer being met and as much as it hurts i requested stepping back until some point if ever he is capable of having a ltr with me i realized the other day during a convo with a girlfriend that while i am not ready to date a total stranger currently i cannot wait to find someone who knows what he wants be honest about his feelings not be afraid of hurting me so that it makes him hesitate about having a ltr etc i want to be desired in all ways and have someone willing to do that and be proud to show me off but i am no longer willing to settle and i am not going to sacrifice my needs for someone who is not ready for a ltr ,1,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,yeah that rather weird in my opinion especially if he comfortable having you at his house hi i am afraid you could potentially be psycho so i am not going to give you my real name but here my address i do not know if i could handle this situation it just brings up a huge red flag to me ,14,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,neither of you is ready to be married and certainly not with each other ,4,relationship_advice
Spazzy19,start doing things you want rather than catering to her whims either you will see that it over and move on or she will respect you more for not being a spineless doormat and be more into you you are choosing to mope and take what she serving you and even say you do not have the balls to tell her how you feel own your life and take charge of your own happiness ,1,relationship_advice
Spazzy19,i am 32f and have a very high libido too i remember back in college before i would really had sex i would masturbate numerous times per day sometimes it was to porn but i generally felt icky afterward but usually to stuff in my head the max i did was 23 times in a day and i was sore afterward for a while i currently an exclusive fwb situation and typically have sex once a day but i sometimes get off at other points before he there etc i have never tried curbing it because i embrace my sexuality i do not know if training your brain to think about something that would turn you off when you are in the mood is good either but sometimes if it inconvenient i just focus on work and try to ignore the sensation until it passes i often think getting off regularly or porn literotica stimulates my drive so maybe holding off for a few weeks of added stimulation will help ,2,sex
Spazzy19,i am currently in one for the first time though both of us acknowledge it relationship esque we were strictly platonic friends and martial arts partners for 1 5 years but after i recently got divorced it turned into a fwb but we see each other every day i cook for him dote in him and vice versa we do things together his family has invited me to various events they knew me when we were just friends etc he even met my mom and aunt when they were recently visiting that being said i would not mind more so he is going to evaluate how he feels about it he more afraid of potentially breaking my heart and losing the friendship he truly values ,0,sex
Spazzy19,you will be fine then i did not have lawyers either and it was super simple but we did not have kids or cluttered debts because we sold our house ahead of it ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,yeah i get it i was not even moved out for more than 1 5 weeks before mine occurred but in our hearts and minds it has been over since feb april my ex is enamoured with yet another person so no point in trying to salvage it so much for 10 12 years but hey if you are happy with this lady then go for it i have learned that i deserve better and know what i want and currently i am happy exploring this opportunity i hope you enjoy it too ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,my ex husband and i made the decision to divorce in april but it was all on him emotional affairs porn etc but we still lived together amicably until the end of july when i moved and we sold our house shortly thereafter we waited until the house sale to actually do papers and submitted them in sept meanwhile i started a fwb that quickly developed into an exclusive yet still informal arrangement in mid august with a close friend i have known for over 1 5 yrs and knows both me and my ex we all three attend the same martial arts academy so my friend was obviously hesitant to make it known there right away lest people assume he was the reason for our divorce i respect that i am still a tad cautious there but now we have posted pictures together etc my ex is extremely happy for me so i am not worried about it we are now officially divorced anyway 3 days woohoo i assume your gf already knows you are still legally married i know lots of people who have not formalized their divorces for a variety of reasons but to me the important part is her knowing and being ok with it and you working toward that direction if you have already been separated for a year i would not worry too much about it people already know the marriage is over ,3,relationships
Spazzy19,if he getting off to porn regularly he could have developed an addiction happened to my ex husband and for years i could not understand why we had crazy sex at the beginning novelty fantasy and barely any when we got married at age 22 did not find out until 4 years of marriage and it was extremely difficult afterward even with both of us going to groups and him actively fighting the desire to look at porn it a very real and painful situation but i didnt know it existed until i read out of the shadows ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,a real man knows when to say no and not be a doormat i would say you are doing fine ,4,relationships
Spazzy19,i am catholic and have used plenty of contraceptives in the past however i am all about the natural family planning they now teach and wish it was more accessible to the public it honestly keeping track of a woman bodily changes temperature and more to determine when she most fertile so you know when to proceed or avoid having sex that being said i also did my senior thesis on cohabitation vs marriage 10 yrs ago and it was quite fascinating ultimately though nothing is a guarantee and it really boils down to what your commitment levels are beforehand those who cohabitate as a test of compatibility are likelier to have failed marriages than those who cohabitate while engaged ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,you are not obligated to have sex with anyone and especially since this is compromising your health he does not appear to truly care about respect you find someone who does and is responsible on top of it ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,i only like compliments really when i have gotten to know someone and am interested otherwise continuing to push them on me without even knowing me really turns me off but once a guy is in just him even getting excited by me walking in the room whether or not i am dressed to the 9 or in pjs is a huge turn on ,5,sex
Spazzy19,thank you i think i am easy on the eyes but personality is more what is important to me as well ,1,Incels
Spazzy19,self fulfilling prophecy gain confidence and happiness with yourself and you will exude attractiveness the guy i am seeing is 5 3 and i am 5 8 without shoes but i cannot get enough of him ,1,Incels
Spazzy19,umm i am tall and slender not big chested but active martial arts hiking etc and i would say fairly pretty maybe a 6 5 7 i do not rate these things but i have never had self esteem issues related to attractiveness lol unicorn when i played socom 2 all the guys who saw my pictures thought i was too good to be true too to be fair i did not have to see him go through the phase of learning to be a man we met during martial arts while i was still married then and developed a strong friendship when my husband decided he wanted his addiction more than me this sort of fell together but i am definitely attracted to his confidence and personality i do not mind bending down to get my kisses as long as i am getting kissed highly physical person i need a strong man to handle me though ,0,Incels
Spazzy19,because it rewires your brain and desensitizes you to real life women she not as exciting as porn it takes longer with her rather than instant gratification it all about you so you do not have to bother with her and you have got your movements for pleasure down to an art real women cannot compete and i can tell you as a partner of a former porn sex addict it extremely painful to cope with the rejection etc ,1,sex
Spazzy19,yes if you have got that kind of a collection as well i would say you have an addiction my ex husband of 10 years had the same issues there are books by patrick carnes out there as well as 12 step groups if you struggle to maintain a porn masturbation free lifestyle ,1,sex
Spazzy19,with my ex bf from high school he would generally get one daily to completion because we were not having intercourse my ex husband of 12 years could not get off that way so i did a bit pre intercourse as a lubricant and added stimulant my current guy generally gets one only done 2 to completion tho because we typically take it to sex daily as a precursor to sex some days he just wants it to be about me though ,1,sex
Spazzy19,i love when they are pinched a bit or lightly bitten when i am riding cowboy and leaning forward i also like to rub them with my guy dick and precum ,4,sex
Spazzy19,legit the guy i am seeing now is not physically what i am used to being attracted to but i do not care he 5 inches shorter than me but he strong and stocky and can pick me up and throw me into bed he carries himself with confidence and his personality fills a room i call him my little napoleon sometimes haha he dominant yet considerate makes decisions yet will make sure anything that impact me is ok by me protective and tender and while he an average libido to my hl he addresses all my needs and vice versa i cannot get enough and he brings out my desire to dote and cook for him etc ,1,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,i get where you are coming from but i maintain any addiction is caused by problematic beliefs of self or experiences obviously there are reasons anyone seeks to cope through unhealthy outlets in a compulsive manner this also applies to heroin or pornography but i can guarantee you that a porn masturbation addict can develop erection issues over time as he becomes desensitized to anything not porn related my ex husband basically had to fantasize about porn or pornographic situations while being intimate because i was no longer enough and i am not unattractive physically addicts can have an erection but it a mental block that then causes problems in the bedroom ,1,sex
Spazzy19,i am 5 8 and the guy i am seeing now is 5 3 and it does not bother me at all because he extremely strong and carries himself confidently the latter is what makes him so appealing to me plus he cute and meets my emotional physical needs trust me he is not denied sex bc of his height he used to have lower self esteem but grew out of it by applying things he read in no more mr nice guy etc ,1,Incels
Spazzy19,if you are legitimately curious start looking into the research and studies by patrick carnes he written a lot on the matter and quite frankly my own personal experience serves as better evidence to me than what someone found on the internet with groups of people that do not suffer from this addiction you will never understand because you have never walked the path and i hope you never do ,1,sex
Spazzy19,this is only good to an extent but what you are suggesting should it be a legitimate addiction problem could also create a worse co addict out of the partner who will then internalize that it his her fault which in turn makes a chaotic unhealthy cycle boundaries are essential yes evaluate yourself and your actions but pay attention to actions rather than words and if your partner still cannot abide then enforce those boundaries i finally had to leave my marriage which broke my heart but i have to take care of and love myself ,2,DeadBedrooms
Spazzy19,it awful but there are support groups out there cosa is for partners even if he wo not get help do it for yourself there are tons of books out there to read too ,2,DeadBedrooms
Spazzy19,yeah i just got divorced bc of that after 10 years it called sex addiction read out of the shadows by patrick carnes i cried when i read my life in a book there are support groups for partners too cosa because it so unbelievably painful and we start thinking it us rather than them hug i feel compassion for them but i will never be with one again my needs were never met but i stayed because i loved him years of rejection kills the spirit his brain is hooked on the porn and fantasy and you do not look or act as exciting as porn nor should you ,2,DeadBedrooms
Spazzy19,i would agree with you that they are separate and that ed is generally a medical issue however continued usage of porn can lead to men not being aroused in a real life scenario i have been on that end porn can become a drug like frenzy and affects some men women the same as any other addiction there are generally underlying problems associated with it obviously just because i drink alcohol on occasion does not make me an alcoholic but the alcohol can make an alcoholic for those susceptible to it the same applies to pornography and too much masturbation for some people i look at porn on occasion and masturbate regularly but i still prefer real life interaction and intercourse but some people cannot handle it saying it simply a myth is rather ignorant of a larger issue ,3,sex
Spazzy19,yes this and my shoulders i also just love it when i know he appreciates me and the things i do for him both sexually and none sexually it also a super turn on to know my mere presence gets him excited and then i want to torture him more ,4,sex
Spazzy19,just because it does not affect you that way does not mean it does not affect others there would not be so many desperate and ashamed people in sex addiction anonymous or cosa otherwise ,2,sex
Spazzy19,i lost my husband of 10 years to porn because it affected his brain so much even after stopping for years he was no longer interested in my advances could only be erect while thinking about a porn fantasy not sure if that even included me could not get off from blowjobs because he needed certain stimulation could not maintain an erection for foreplay so i rarely got it could not conceive of sex and love being intertwined and ended up escalating into multiple emotional and one physical affair i am not anti porn or masturbation i am extremely hl but i am wary of porn as i know firsthand the pain it causes both people in a relationship ultimately his addiction kicked in again and he believed he was not in love with me though he loves me so he wanted me to go find someone who would treat me better just be careful ,6,sex
Spazzy19,my ex husband and i were married for 10 years and generally split tasks he preferred to organize and cook and i did more cleaning tasks i appreciated his efforts he would not want me even involved in laundry lol i miss having a guy do most of the cooking but my new guy is really turned on by me being domestic i have discovered i actually do not mind cooking for him at his place if he buys all the ingredients i have wanted to expand my culinary skills so it works out for both of us it also a way for me to express my appreciation of him for meeting my needs too he not the best at clean up but he will do it even at my place when i ask so that nice i work full time and do martial arts and like to stay busy but i think both people should be involved in household activities but i do not see a problem with doing an activity he does not care for if you do not mind it,1,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,sounds like he has a sex addiction problem and they are all females who believe if they are even aware of it that he will change for them wrong it unfortunate your parents wo not let y all stay alone at home because personally i think you are at an age where you can take care of yourselves if you are worried about getting close to your future sil then either do not or do and maintain relations with her afterward or inquire why she bothering with your brother ,-7,relationships
Spazzy19,based on your mom age in relation to yours i am going to go out on a limb and say she not had any time to herself and now feels she can dump the little ones on you and live out her missed younger years now she still has a parental responsibility and should be communicating with you if you want to adopt that your choice but i would have some major words with my mother ,37,relationships
Spazzy19,even with medicaid she should be using yours as primary she should have reported yours to welfare medicaid is the last resort ,3,Divorce
Spazzy19,do you know if he looks at porn my ex husband of 10 yrs was into that and had the same problems over time he began to look at me as a best friend sister rather than lover wife hugs ,0,DeadBedrooms
Spazzy19,kudos i recently discovered the same thing went from maybe 2 3 times a month and never about me to an avg of once a day where he extremely aware of my satisfaction i cannot fathom how i endured 10 yrs of a db will not go back congrats on your new relationship and realizing that you are worth more ,2,DeadBedrooms
Spazzy19,i think it weird that you have never met him after 2 years i recently got divorced due to complicated issues surrounding my husband but it was extremely amicable while his issues made him not sexually desire me we were extremely close as best friends for the past 12 yrs we did not have kids either the guy i am seeing now knew us both when we were married though he was more my friend at the time he hung out with my ex and me at a free concert but he feels a tad awkward dating his friend ex wife now even though my ex is happy about it but my new guy knows i am close with my ex and still talk to him semi regularly he also encouraged me to hang out with him because he knows my ex does not connect with many people and is going through a bad time so i do not blame you for being jealous when you do not know this guy it one thing to have a good relationship but another to not include you in it it would probably be good for you to suggest having him over or going out to get to know him too since he important to your gf if she resists that you might have to reevaluate your relationship with her ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,i bruise easily and while i am not into bdsm i do martial arts and inevitably come out with fantastic new ones on a regular basis jiu jitsu and sparring are especially bad for me though i did end up with fingers on my arm from a self defense session we did my massage therapist laughs but says if she did not know what i do she would be concerned too no one has ever thought my ex husband abused me though that may be because i always beat everyone to the punch pun and showed them off ,7,relationships
Spazzy19, my husband decided foreplay was boring and too much like work he wanted me to just flip a switch and want him on demand yeah my ex would just lick it and stick it even though i would have loved to have just made out etc i talked to him hundreds of times how hard is it to kiss your wife neck and shoulders too apparently it just took too long and i never got off so what was the point definitely made for less initiation on my part which killed my spirit too i am with a guy now who is turned on by my reactions and likes to please as much as me he will even get turned on seeing me walk into a room with no makeup and in my pajamas he cuddles listens will make out with me for hours my ex hated it and would turn away or i would feel like i was raping his face if i tried he appreciates my affection and my gestures with lingerie cooking etc it is a total 180 i will not go back to anything less i would rather be single and take care of my own needs ,5,DeadBedrooms
Spazzy19,the db is related to his fantasies of men and other types of pleasure you do not cut it for him anymore and porn rewires the brain i had similar issues not about men though with my ex which i tried to work with for years we finally got divorced after 10 yrs together because he kept wanting fantasy carnal sex or no sex it was not about me at all i am sorry he doing this to you but more than likely it not going to change even if he wants to it will repeat again ,1,relationships
Spazzy19,save up from not having kids and set yourself up with services to help establish a friend base etc you do not have to have kids to have someone there at the end of your life lots of parents are left alone by their kids as it is no guarantee with that one,32,relationships
Spazzy19,crushing of the spirit is the perfect description pornography is insidiously damaging to relationships my sex life with my husband started off quickly and frequently then it died when we got married and i was left confused and frustrated for years until i learned about the addiction i never realized how badly he was into porn because he always made time for me he worked full time and went to school full time even graduating the top of his class it all sat on an external hard drive on my computer desk he even told me recently that i would been a novelty not unkindly but it still hurt porn inspired him to develop multiple emotional affairs unknown to the crush and even have one actual affair at that point is when the addiction came to light and we both started recovery groups you are not crazy you are not alone i read my life in a book called out if the shadows and broke down crying but i also felt relief knowing what was actually happening ,1,DeadBedrooms
Spazzy19,this my 10 yr marriage to an amazing guy just ended because of pornography it extremely painful for partners especially when like you i was willing to do pretty much anything was always up for sex and i am a hl but sex was all about him when we did have it and over time i just lost the enjoyment and felt used he would lose it during foreplay so i would never get that and it was usually difficult to initiate since his brain was rewired since i have left and found a hl guy i am still higher lol i feel like a new person i will not settle for such rejection again i stayed bc i loved him immensely too now i am irritated for forgetting to love myself do not put your self worth in his hands set a boundary discuss what you need and want and if he unable or unwilling to do it then leave ,2,DeadBedrooms
Spazzy19,let me start off by saying i understand you especially as a newlywed i just got divorced after 10 years but we got married at age 22 and i was always a hl until stuff in our marriage crushes porn actual affair extinguished my drive i am hl again thankfully that being said marriage is not going to realistically be nightly sex and intimacy as the day to day grind wears on y all stress is huge huge and obviously affects men worse than females i believe since we do not have to get it up and going does he actually need the 2nd job depending on how you are broaching the topic which i understand is out of justifiable concern it could also be causing him added performance anxiety that happened to me a lot which was even more frustrating bc i wanted to convey my needs i would disagree that sex is not a validation tool for you though if after two weeks you are questioning your attractiveness etc it really does not sound like it you at all it him and stress if y all can come to a compromise like he stops and goes to bed with you to even cuddle before returning to the evening job or just ditching the 2nd job if it not necessary that would be best otherwise it might be good to invest in a few toys to get you through the dry spell until y all can enjoy each other stress free i agree he should have taken advantage of the wedding opportunity though my recommendation is to support him a bit since he working to support y all be patient but express your desires find out what is making him tick is it a scarcity fear a desire to show you he a worthy husband by financially supporting y all my dad is that way and completely loses focus on the family he actually trying to support but he going to have to start meeting your needs too ,0,DeadBedrooms
Spazzy19,if you change that then you will probably start noticing a difference ,2,DeadBedrooms
Spazzy19,naturally i am a hl female but i became fairly ll over 12 yrs with a man with complicated sex addiction who loved me but did not desire me it returned amazingly well thankfully but in either case you mentioned a core validation problem i am an extent touch oriented person and express my love and desire as such however i do need to feel loved and appreciated to make me shine my brightest no amount of sex will bring forth my genuine happiness and sexual satisfaction if it not coupled with being treated properly the thing i notice around here is that people are putting their self worth in the hands of their partners rather than from within if that changes so too will your sex life whether you choose to stay or go ,6,DeadBedrooms
Spazzy19,i was in a similar marriage for 10 yrs after so much frustration i learned he was a huge porn addict and he could not get it up around me anymore he also ended up having an affair i nearly divorced then but opted to continue as we were both in groups and actively working on recovery fast forward 6 yrs another emotional affair which led to porn collection and more rejection i am not unattractive and i have a hl and would have accommodated whatever he wanted alas it screwed him up and he wanted to let me go to find someone i deserved and who could meet my needs i look back now and am pissed i put up with subtle overt rejection for so long i should have focused on my needs and realized a long time ago we were not compatible in this regard i love him dearly and despite his issues he a wonderful man but there is no sense beating a dead horse ,3,DeadBedrooms
Spazzy19,how unfortunate i crave physical touch and am in heaven when my so reaches out to me even my ex husband who i had a db ish marriage with would always show physical affection that way from my experience of sexual rejection in marriage leave or demand to go talk to someone together to resolve the issue i will not settle for someone not meeting my love language needs anymore ,3,DeadBedrooms
Spazzy19,might want to reevaluate that too it not something i would be excited about unless there was some truly physical inability to do so,1,DeadBedrooms
Spazzy19,if you do not respect yourself she not going to either nor will any other woman it time to call it quits and take care if yourself ,1,DeadBedrooms
Spazzy19,maybe i am alone here but i am an extremely touchy person i show my love through touch kisses and cuddles if i have gotten to that intimate level with a guy even on a more platonic level i had a similar experience where i was not able to talk to one of my best guy friends for 7 yrs and we finally saw each other last month after 12 years and i got to meet his gf which i was excited about too we three cuddled nothing else but i feel such a bonding repair through it and if i would been deprived of someone i cared about for so long because of manipulation i would find myself wanting that closeness to soothe the pain that being said something needs to happen if your wife is that callous it something to consider how does she feel about y all reconnecting there was definitely a breach of trust you cannot just shove that under the rug how have you felt in your marriage overall with her was this just a one time thing as for you you have confused your mind and need to actually sort out what you want and truly feel it not appropriate to cuddle being married and with no one knowing about it nor is it obviously good you are having sex dreams about her a line has been crossed are you blurring your excitement of seeing her again with sexual desire or did you actually desire her all along ,-4,relationships
Spazzy19,this does not apply to me of course i have pcos and my hormones are not normal but i have always enjoyed and wanted more sex and intimacy than my partners and i will take care of myself throughout the day if need be too ,1,RedPillWomen
Spazzy19,no offense but as a woman i would not be gunning to engage in crazy amounts of sex with a guy who did not hold himself confidently or did not want to go out and socialize with me if she wanting to incorporate other men in the mix it sounds like it not truly a ll problem but a partner pairing problem ,3,DeadBedrooms
Spazzy19,yep my 10 yr marriage just ended and it was basically this because of his outlook on everything next month i am finally going to my first b b because we never went to one together bc it was expensive and we lived within driving distance so why spend the money the moment i booked it i cried both out of excitement and because i was so upset that i gave up that romantic desire for so long ,9,relationships
Spazzy19,you have got a good head on your shoulders but even while you have been together for 4 years you will both continue to change probably fairly drastically into your 30 i got married at 22 and it lasted slightly over 10 yrs he still my best friend but he no longer felt we jived the way he now desires do not rush into marriage quite yet until y all are absolutely ready and can do it the way you want anyway ,6,relationships
Spazzy19,completely understandable i used to joke that my friend was another little brother to me he 6 yrs younger but i always noticed him even if i did not have a desire to be with him he kind of drove me nuts and i see a whole new side to him now i think when i get back out there i will do the online thing again not tinder but something more legit i like to talk to people awhile rather than jump right into bed plus i am terrified of stds and have not been with very many guys lol but it does get a little crazy when you have got needs that need to be satisfied just be careful but do not be afraid to put yourself out there ,1,Divorce
Spazzy19,yeah leave i just got divorced from my husband of 10 yrs who has a problem with pornography which led to numerous emotional 1 physical affair over the years i would be intimate any time he initiated rare bc i desperately wanted the connection and feeling it was never about me or my needs and i have a drive like a male now i am with a guy who all about pleasing me which works bc i like to please too i wear him out lol i now know what it like to have someone take my needs and desires into consideration to react to my touch in a positive manner to kiss me for hours rather than feel like i am raping my ex face wanting a passionate mouth kiss to talk and cuddle afterward with no rush to go elsewhere it bliss and i want to hit myself for waiting so long and sacrificing a great need in me rejection was crushing my soul and spirit you have a choice too ,27,DeadBedrooms
Spazzy19,we just did ours in nv and it was scary easy initial about 10 things on 6 7 pages have a witness complete a portion and pay 283 which he refused to let me contribute to did not even require notarization we sold our house before filing have no kids and are not claiming assets almost hurt more knowing 10 yrs of marriage was so easy to dissolve it was finalized in 3 days too ,1,Divorce
Spazzy19,i moved out recently this process started in feb tho and my divorced finalized on the 12th of sept and thought i would be in the same boat i stumbled into a friends with benefits relationship esque thing with my martial arts partner in august though other than my now ex husband this guy has been my best friend in the area for over 1 5 yrs and was completely platonic up until last month but we trust each other and that why i can do it it was scary being with someone new after 12 yrs but holy shit do i see what i have been missing i cannot do tinder and awkward meet ups i met my ex online but we talked for over a month before meeting i need to trust someone do not rush into something but maybe there someone already in your life you could meet your needs with it also allowing me the opportunity to work out some issues too ,1,Divorce
Spazzy19,i am sorry you are going through this too i just got divorced this month from my best friend who realized in january or probably just acknowledged that he is not romantically sexually attracted to me anymore and i am definitely not unattractive we were married for 10 yrs but together for 12 and also got married at age 22 he struggles with sex addiction though so i have gone through hell working with him supporting him and loving him i still do and we deeply care about each other i started having panic attacks in april briefly after i realized my whole life was flipping upside down we like you do not have kids so that was easier but the pain the confusion having to sell our house so we could split equity knowing he in love with someone else and not me having an amazing relationship with his family especially since mine on the opposite coast it overwhelming but i found my own place i moved at the end of july and am now starting to enjoy being there house sold and i have a fair amount of savings still have his family and even him he a great guy and it hurts that i cannot have my best friend accessible the way things were but i had to acknowledge it was no longer good for me and i appreciate him letting me go on a huge level but it still painful the world is scary but it beautiful we change and hopefully together but sometimes it not enough take care of you i lived with my ex for 4 months before moving to get everything in order if you can handle that while increasing your hours to afford a new place do it otherwise look for roommates he an adult and can start taking care of things he taken for granted that you have always covered it does not have to be spiteful and hateful people are more unsure of how to relate to my ex and me because we are so amicable some days i do want to punch him or i cry bc i miss him but i realize how much i was sacrificing emotionally trying to accommodate his issues i will not make that mistake again i am fine working and compromising with someone but no longer to the detriment of my soul and spirit you are not alone and are strong channel that strength ,2,relationships
Spazzy19,i went through this same thing for 10 years of marriage and just recently divorced i found out 6 years ago after my husband had an outright affair there were several emotional ones prior to that he had a sex addiction to pornography and affairs i read out of the shadows by patrick carnes and broke down because i was reading my life in a book and finally understood there are support groups for partners cosa ultimately he started having another emotional affair and collecting porn again and realized he was never going to be able to meet my needs i was so tired of carnal sex and desperately engaged in anything he would give me because i craved the connection he was tired of hurting me so he let me go and while it still extremely painful i realize how much overt and subtle rejection i endured for all of those years it heartbreaking but there is hope maybe not with him but you need to start by loving yourself enough to know you deserve more i am with a guy now that provides me with the complete opposite experience and it is amazing i look back and cannot believe i tolerated this crap for so long look into cosa and research the addiction it will make a whole lot more sense ,4,relationships
