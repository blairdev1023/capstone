r_industry,oh give up already christ ,-19,politics
r_industry,oh it was from that perspective here my take population and energy use is an issue but technological maturity plays a big role too that where things start getting murky and contentious we do have a larger footprint in the us but out energy generation is way cleaner and will get cleaner as time goes on that development costs money r d and is best left to the markets to figure out something like pca effectively taxes coffers per regulatory activities so development is curbed plus those costs typically flows down to consumers so everyone pays more for anything since energy is always required in this case everyone is paying more for crappier energy industry shuts down or moves etc etc that why larger producers who have a personal stake fund counter research which is fine imo elon musk does the same thing he upset at trump pca withdraw because half his companies rely on acc financially as in tesla and solar city can be competitive if other forms of energy are curbed that the only way alternates have been able to make it wind and solar are just inferior products when people say green is overtaking fossils they do so only in certain areas and because the other guys are at an artificial disadvantage big oil and the like also saved our butts on the research end of things since the public sector has been funding and promoting pro acc research and nothing else that hat the ipcc does by design they are job is to prove acc via co2 that actually skewed the scientific theory in one direction only recently do we have some counterpoints to common acc talking points that way healthier for progress having said that i still have not seen even close to good data proving correlation between co2 and higher temperatures higher temperature readings are also suspect but that a whole different discussion as far as developing countries are concerned nothing we do will solve they are issues except of course for tech innovation that the only way quality of life has been rising globally ,1,Libertarian
r_industry,oh lol no issues here i was just sharing my perspective with you let me rephrase it a tad i got a science background and did some poking around on the subject matter i effectively have different definitions and uses for science and models that why i am pretty hard on how they are used i am all for ecological preservation but it has to be reasonable pca is not practical since it bases it emissions targets laws on spotty assumptions as a libertarian or classical liberal i do not like laws passed by people that have no accountability as a conservative and capitalist i do not like laws that harm productivity and wealth creation as a tree hugging hippy i want the quickest rout to a greener planet as a cheap taxpayer i do not wanna pay for stuff that is not going to work as a scientist and engineer i cringe at the fact that limited resources are unfairly and inefficiently spent on strategies that have a poor track record based on data that cannot be proven nor disproven appear to be politically motivated do not stand up to basic scrutiny at face value do not stand up to scientific scrutiny and do not hold up philosophically as a trump supporter i am proud of my president i hope i do not get banned from this sub lol anyway what would you learn in your class or come across that put you on the acc side of the fence i have not looked into the pro side in a while ,1,Libertarian

r_industry,so engineering solution short path distillation also called a molecular still you might have something like that in your lab bps should be different enough and since time at temperature with this process is so short you should not see any thermal degradation or side reactions ,1,chemistry
r_industry,well combinations of remote self taught part time learn on the job apprenticeship democratized networking that will work for most people prolly get that in some easy to digest package from some centralized body in the future haha with praxis not everyone an entrepreneur this guy just selling his school ,1,Libertarian
r_industry,yeah you are right some regs will have to do for now or could be argued to be too risky to end currently on the topic of the pca it just based on crap science i am not against an international commitment tackling pollution all for it but the co2 temperature models tell us nothing so libertarian or not if it do not work there not reason to implement especially if you are concerned about the climate spend the resources on the right things instead of wasting everyone time ,1,Libertarian
r_industry,solid points on a sillier conspiracy theory side of the argument i always wondered how tech giants that are in the business of disruption tech which basically put low income labor out of work long term want universal basic income and green energy i am not too shocked they have been so critical of trump lately i smell money and business opportunities lost for them or i guess they could just feel bad about what they are doing to rural economies lol just a though exercise ,0,Futurology

r_industry,haha if you can wait maybe 12 months while we stabilize you would get a call for sure also you would have to move to socal if that your thing i can link you to people in the coatings industry down here not fancy but it a thing and i am figuring the market picking up on that front except it socal so buyer be ware guess i can get some numbers for headhunters if you want ,1,chemistry
r_industry,guess i gata give that a shot if it does not work it your fault lol expect u curdled to be in the references of the report specifically the 50 kg footnote either way it sounds more doable than the co2 infusion scheme i have going on right now thanks for the tip let me know if you need a random brain to pick down the line in the future i will do my best to help you out ,1,chemistry
r_industry,it for cellulose dissolution ils work really well for that they also readily leave celluose and similar products for water allowing for reshaping of materials gels and fibers etc lol so they are very good at 2 out of the 3 things a green tech needs to do to be green if one cannot recycle it too well one has gallons of a ground pollutant at the end of a process i thought about synthesizing or re synthesizing the stuff but it wo not be cheap or quick enough to bother with plus i got sunk raw material costs which makes the economist in me very upset hahaha ,1,chemistry
r_industry,i am not big on green at all at this point it just worth a shot because of savings since the stuff is pricey works really well otherwise just wanted to see if someone had an idea or experience with similar systems ,1,chemistry
r_industry,ah that what you are doing hmmm i really did not want to get into methanol hahha but yeah if you manage to work with that c2 carbon carbene semi functionality you can match it to a counter ion mines acetate water once you stabilize the nitrogens for best potency need that aromaticity that whole system will become hyper ionic salty and could be well separated for a good yield your product might be ok if you have low working volumes try a super fine size exclusion or ion exchange columns those work like crap realistically though you are right 70 yield at best with lotsa pivots anyway shoot back if you figure something out i will keep your issue in mind since i will probably have to do similar things ,1,chemistry

r_industry,lol what are the chances i got imidazole problems myself working back from my problem of extracting imidazole salts from water you could try throwing nucleophiles and counterions at it salt those are water soluble as opposed to the products if they survive excess water could be evaporated rotovap extract gunk with semi polar low bp solvents guess it also depends on what your product is watcha got going on p s columns are rubbish worst deal maybe of all time edit what else do you know about imidazoles i am having a hell of a time with purifying off the shelf derivatives ping away u imidazoleaway ,1,chemistry
r_industry,interesting have you tried looking into eco wildlife research programs i had a buddy who would sign up for expeditions maybe 6 months at a time as a field aid lol you would obviously need to be flexible with your living situation but that experience in your pocket right there try usajobs gov they post temp jobs like that often ,1,AskReddit
r_industry,are you curating or is there tech work there ,1,AskReddit
r_industry,a double major would work best plus master for sure kinda sucks cause it will take so long but you will need 1 strong chemistry core works like a trade skill 2 some bio specialization concentration 3 cs courses you will be modeling everything so learn the basics expect to do basic lab work for some years during and after bs level after that you can freely move around different fields of interest degree wo not matter so much and you will know what you wana do for sure at that point also keep an eye out for alternative schooling options in the next few years a classic university education is lengthy and costly so take that into consideration when choosing cheers ,2,AskReddit
r_industry,totally agree why is everyone obsessed with humility of a president obama his image was the poster boy for humility reason oration etc and he ended up being a disaster for geopolitics and long term internal stability trump offensive sloppiness is justified because doing the opposite did bush in he got raked over the coals by the opposition specifically in terms of media coverage which counts a lot and trump gets that i get that his behavior is incendiary but look at the results his opposition lost their minds they cannot cope it a rough ride and will be still but that how change comes about if it does high risk high reward i thought people wanted that for a change ,0,Conservative
r_industry,their chasing him for other reasons ,2,Conservative
r_industry,you are comparing apples and oranges it one thing for a president to disclose sensitive information to the public for personal gain and another for some yellow paper to write alarmist pieces trump been critical of newspapers if you have not noticed would you prefer the head of state go to full blown war with the 4th estate i mean obama went after journalists from what i have heard the precedent is set besides the literal events appear real the gravity and the context are often wrong trump could have disclosed data on isis with people russians who he working with to defeat isis any random schmuck close to the event could leak something about it without knowing the full extent of the situation or that schmuck could just hate trump and spread bullshit around wapo does not care i also do not think most reasonable people take wapo nyt cnn etc particularly serious anymore so there few liars to expose anymore ,1,Conservative
r_industry,so according to some people who are official trump disclosed information at an undisclosed locations to russians translation you are just going to have to trust us again we are wapo we are patriots and not at all trying to sell newspapers ,3,Conservative
r_industry,this whole narrative is preposterous if you are legally qualified to get food stamps you get food stamps no ones going to retroactively deport you or hold that against you public charge might come into play if you abuse the system or lie about your needs if they find you which is laughable immigrants know immigration and entitlement laws very well everyone knows an immigration lawyer especially in la no ones so dumb they do not sign up for ebt just in case and if you can go without you do not need ebt in the first place and in the off chance you are that dumb and go hungry there nothing anyone can do for you there loads of immigrant outreach programs in la where you get questions answered in your own language smh ,2,Conservative
r_industry,i have always felt it was a population density issue not so much wealth i mean at this point you need to be very wealthy to live in cities you tend to want more government if you live densely more authority required to upkeep shared territory the young typically left prefer cities for social reasons when they start families become more right they move to suburbs for safety that the coarse trajectory for most people engineered or not all other factors like education occupation political leanings left v right of running things are secondary and need to be handled on a case to case basis kind of like industry leaving the cities leaving poor people behind la and detroit went through that different stories different outcomes lol anyway hangout in this sub more often there debates and discussions to be had here ,2,Conservative
r_industry,ahh how is this still a thing two outcomes 1 erosion of representative democracy 2 growth of legitimate racism within the populous ,2,Conservative
r_industry,lol i was thinking that imagine ,1,The_Donald
r_industry,there many possible reasons hard to say from where we are sitting politics aside if you consider that likely syria is about pipelines and ports and afghanistan is and was about mineral deposits this is all a little easier to digest sounds kinda simple but it the best i have managed from what i have seen ,1,politics

r_industry,there also way to much information to parsed through now funny how everything you hear has to be absorbed as rumor first and then layed out in some rational manner by the consumer by themselves ,1,pics
r_industry,well maybe trump trying to be selectively aggressive look i do not like any president being able to just bomb w e country no oversight freaks people out but this has been going on for decades now obama rightly went to congress and congress did not do anything for reasons we will never know most likely they are kinda slow and cannot get anything done obama also did some covert shit which was likely justified at the time and likely violated national sovereignty of several nations osama was killed in pakistan with or without official green lights from that government again all we can do is give the guy the benefit of the doubt for trump we will have to wait some time to see if there was any effect ,0,politics
r_industry,he often changes his mind though that what non politicians do and that why lotsa people voted for him duno how this will work long term for us but he been alright so far ,1,The_Donald
r_industry,that guy something else lol,1,The_Donald
r_industry,nah i am not applying the same standard to countries in question i know how tough it is let alone in places where it only a few decades old democracy needs upkeep hell we are in the middle of retooling our system in the america right now and it choppy but looking at even western europe that had it revolutions and colonies and terror attacks since the 50 right thing are not that calm maybe this is steady state for that region from a broader historic perspective i dunno they appear to be eroding year over year though ,2,pics

r_industry,most of this story does not make sense i saw footage that made the gas attack look fake i saw footage that made the gas attack look real trump said he would retaliate in some fashion is it opportunistic for his domestic benefit is it opportunistic in some geopolitical sense is it an attempt to re balance us perceived military might that some claim has been dwindling is it an attempt to get the region under some sense of control with all party agreeing before hand and this is just theatrics as i have pointed out is our inlet wrong is trump just mad what about those reports i have heard about israeli activity in the region lately are we showing off to the chinese lol does the guardian know anything we do not or is this just the best response all things considered domestically and internationally with the eyes of the world watching i sure hope so but i do not know ,-1,politics
r_industry,there fact we are just not privy to we can pick sides when it comes to kremlingate vs spygate or w e both make sense in w e context you pick i duno the theatrics we are presented are wearing thin we have got some bigger problems ,-1,politics

r_industry,got a hold the full hand of weapons it seems ,2,The_Donald
r_industry,ok i will give you the benefit of the doubt ,1,The_Donald
r_industry,no they are not obsolete several decades of operation i am sure they work great in network but considering disruption of that network which will be weaponized and probably is already there will be issues guess same goes for drones increase in armor agility and mpg to put it broadly should help do not think the modern fleet is known for that anymore eh i probably over imagined drone weapons haha ,1,The_Donald
r_industry,if we are splitting hairs over whose tanks are tip top my point holds water ,1,The_Donald
r_industry,yeah there 4 seats potentially up for grabs funny how the scotus became proving grounds for legislation as of late i am just hoping people who lean left realize that scalia textual perspective is the best thing long term regardless of ideology technically they do not have a choice that is if the circuit court crap fizzles out worst case scenario they embrace state rights i guess i duno i am feeling pretty good lol no whammys ,2,The_Donald
r_industry,lol why is this in the tech section ,8,The_Donald
r_industry,it a cheaper solution than tanks tanks will still be relevant in some situations but a head to head conflict with a matched adversary will probably not happen anymore and would be dealt better with drone tech anyway kinda like an automated seek and destroy weapon instead of manned mobile armor tanks are better for psych and field battles last one was desert storm the modern theater is urban or against guerrillas hiding among civilian pop guess it a good idea to maintain the fleet for obvious reasons but those are fleeting ,2,The_Donald
r_industry,eh we will just wait till ginsberg retires lol times a ticking ,2,The_Donald
r_industry,is not it more about drone tech now anyway ,2,The_Donald
r_industry,that him dealing with the fact that the funniest thing on tv is spicer punking reporters on cspan 2 that gata hurt that probably what chapelle meant when he said that trump bad for comedy their craft is dead ,3,The_Donald
r_industry,eh cocos alright generally way less funny than he used to be old act but alright it alright to bash a public figure he done this with all presidents if they were in the news and his material is benign especially relative to the blatant cuckery of everyone else in late night his trump obama call sketches are pretty good ,7,The_Donald
r_industry,you gata respect a guy who holds it together while both sides take turns hating for months now hard to imagine a human dealing with this much stress ,3,politics
r_industry,she more of an executive level manager who has a clothing brand aside from w e else she did for her dad business dealings not too shocking all things considered ,-3,politics
r_industry,we either need some new amendments or issues like this need to be handled by legislation this is getting ridiculous i mean it sounds like a state commerce issue to me i get charged extra 10c all the time in ca ,1,politics
r_industry,theoretically there nothing wrong with this if the buyer is informed prior to the transaction it a voluntary transaction after all but do not we have a bunch of commerce laws on the books to deal with this why is it always the 1st amendment ,1,politics

r_industry,lol it always been messy and the country been paralyzed for many years as a result because no ones done it correctly or chose to proceed in the appropriate fashion one would hope leaders of the free world would i mean point to a time in recent history when politics were not a shit show eisenhower ,2,Conservative
r_industry,if you conciser how difficult it is to be in government right now the polarization in the public sphere and the nuts and bolts of actually legislating that being toast since bush and maybe earlier his approach is pretty effective i mean he did get elected against all odds right must have been doing something right let take the wiretapping tweets for example he was getting hit with russian collusion allegations for some time the dem tactic was as follows point to sketchy bits and peaces with no proof hype it up and boy did they do and then say that this is too controversial and for the sake of the public and transparency and w e all these people he barely got appointed need to step down flyn then they went after sessions again on some technicality worked very well it was the only thing anyone had energy to pay attention to as opposed to actually transitioning and allowing trump room to establish his office and govern or the important things to do so trump tweeted about obama wiretapping him on saturday morning totally blew that narrative out of the water for like 48 hours got the opposition shaken up dems are still pressing that and so are the msm because they have worked themselves into a corner and cannot just drop it only now they are literally mad or look mad doing it and there an equally confusing anti obama allegation of mishandling classified material and also people are starting to talk about that whole system in general dems got declawed so the dems on a fed level are busy yelling about that gives sessions the space to start going after sanctuary cities or the last stronghold of the dem party it being municipalities and where the dems would farm the next generation of leaderships since they were just wiped off the map similarly the ahca is now ryan problem and in theory should start pushing the reps and dems closer together so there could be some shred of hope to pass legislation as congress is supposed to do on the surface it looks like he lashing out and throwing tantrums but it been very effective if i had to imagine anything the republicans had in terms of a presidential candidate in trumps place right now the pressure would probably be the same that person would prolly be steamrolled by schumer and pelosi but the opposite is true lol now i know this all sounds strange but you gata admit the dems went from all powerful with high polling numbers to literally insane people yelling in the dark it beautiful is what it is unless you are found of the dems in which case i am sorry and you did not just hear me roll out trumps probable strategy to re structure partisan positions ,2,Conservative
r_industry,oh i must have misread your question yes that why lol different conditions so you cannot compare the specific accuracy has to do with polling in general in the context of the ebb and flow of public opinion in our current time makes outputs of these polls less relevant especially since a lot of them failed in the run up to last november could be useful in some cases i am sure as a piece of news i do not know what to do with that information tbh anyway i am sorry to hear you do not like him we clearly have way different definitions of what governing should look like lol and that ok ,2,Conservative
r_industry,the economy overall was not this crappy we had a surplus gore was not as popular as hillary no big wars no scotus issues lol no twitter bush was a politician with experience and not an eccentric business person reality tv show host with 2 ex wives who lives in a skyscraper and did business with everyone and anyone as a private citizen everyone is coming to grips with their biases also and we have an over saturated information pool facts and numbers hold little value lol anyway how do you rate him i trust redditors over media at this point ,2,Conservative
r_industry,guess gallup is good enough but this is a very different presidency and political atmosphere do not know how to apply trends across time ,5,Conservative
r_industry,i will agree to that but a few percentage points is way below error so we do not really know i also do not know what to think of the hill it a trust issue as well cumulatively this poll just gives a number ,3,Conservative
r_industry,considering a lot of people are burnt out on the topic i would wager a lot refused to participate in a poll if called or overlook opportunities the second point should be even more true for people who are comfortable or happy with trump now there also should be people dissatisfied with trump after ahca true but that the least crazy thing he pulled relative to all the things he done thus far people who would switch sides over that and force his approval rating to a new low which is every other week for like a year now are difficult to imagine in a practical sense these could be the same people that scored obama very high during his last few months in office even though most people were not paying attention to him due to the election the math just makes no sense or i am super biased lol and would score him well ,4,Conservative
r_industry,would not the only people interested in participating in political polls right now be people who do not like trump also did not most people learn by now that polls are stupendously inaccurate and a waste of time ,11,Conservative
r_industry,technically not an admission but feeds with the wiretapping hallucination either way probably was not too smart to remind everyone about the sketchy means and methods of mass surveillance unless of course it a way to diffuse pressure from obama admin specifically and pass blame onto the system this scandal sucks i would like to talk about taxes now please lol ,3,Conservative

r_industry,yep nuclear is the best thing on the table ,1,The_Donald
r_industry,yes possible to quantify how much we put in but no the degree to which it drives the whole system and by system i mean the summation of every process on earth and the environment in which the earth exists planet in space next to a star to the best of my knowledge i have never heard of a direct contribution factor i have not probably because the answer would be in a form of a complex function which we do not have the capacity to compute yet do not get me wrong pollution is an issue what i am upset about is the concentration on co2 and the direction of solutions presented thus far especially since so many have proven unsustainable hence i go as far as to reject the current environmental dialog all together since it too narrow ,1,The_Donald
r_industry,in a nutshell it impossible to quantify the contribution of man made co2 to changes in climate within the constraints of our current ability hence legislating carbon emission targets ie increased government oversight of the energy industry makes no sense almost noone denies changes but many are concerned with resulting policy ,1,The_Donald

r_industry,that all fine i agree my beliefs matter little to zero much like yours lol so we should be at about the same level no way of figuring out who more correct but we can exchange anecdotal evidence experiences and maybe start to agree on some trajectory as fellow earthlings i guess tax payers and energy consumers are better constructs for the topic at hand i also do not have a phd and am not working in anything climate related but i understand data sets measurements errors and how difficult it is to 1 understand something and 2 make something work close to 100 of the time do it everyday i further understand fairly well the politics and economies of the research industry and academic cultures along with all the biases humans have by default as stated before research in cc is good very important if indeed we are facing certain doom or extremely likely as the ipcc puts it and useful for things like mitigation of damage during storms etc i am sure the people doing the leg work behind measurements and modeling did their very best and have the best intentions but again no definitive proof or concrete laws just outputs of models assumptions words like extremely and likely do not mean much if the context is poorly defined the context is poorly defined because i have no way knowing how good the information presented to me is it will take over a lifetime to understand it all there is no person alive that has the cognitive capacity to answer the questions i might have nor is there a model that can do it we know that because only some have gotten close to reality which we can measure only kinda good and noone knows why they work well or for how long they will work well it a multidimensional problem one i would like resolved at least better than it is now prior to any major policy decision that why this is such a heated topic so we are left with two choices a trust experts or b attempt to get some more clarity out of and hence mature climate science i chose b because i know enough to know that there are things we do not know enough about to properly engineer out of a possible climate catastrophe even though some experts say it is extremely likely the ipcc has it critics some are shills some are not do not know who who or how many are on each side it is also logical to assume that some acc proponents are shills themselves again no way of knowing exactly who who besides that i have heard climate projections in ipcc reports vary dramatically year over year or however often they come out which is fine they do not have to be but i am not liking how specific carbon emission targets are calculated and eventually enforced they are based on modeled predictions right but that a whole other topic ,1,dataisbeautiful
r_industry,you have almost had it so let clarify there lotsa data that hard to process on the topic of co2 changing the environment lotsa resources which you kindly googled for me but none can produce a number which represents the degree to which human activity is contributing to the changes in climate most people you are still stuck often dogmatically arguing that co2 is a contributor even though the conversation has moved on luckily some brave souls despite being called anti science and or dumb have began pointing that out that a good thing just about everyone agrees that co2 has warming properties i for one think it is 100 responsible for some of the changes lol no clue to what extent though every time i ask or look into it i am told it a hard problem to solve no kidding perhaps noone knows you would have to build a very accurate model of the earth and all the processes within it and the environment in which the earth exists and be able to modulate all the inputs to change all the variables we cannot do that well practically at all yet and hey i am all for that let figure out what makes all of this work cumulatively but until then i am more interested in the cost and effect of solutions available or proposed today and how much better off we will be in the near term and in the long term but you know thanks for letting me know that some models produce between 17gb and several terabytes of data and that i might have to learn matlab to work with complex data sets i am definitely one step closer to sciencing like a pro unlike those non science loosers who have never heard of rectilinear grids and cannot differentiate between various groups within a research organization ,1,dataisbeautiful

r_industry,the days of books are over it hard to recommend a text when you do not know the person especially for chemistry which is fairly abstract as in it hard to teach what i have been doing with pretty good outcomes is use whatever text available if you get stuck on a concept just google it there lot of good stuff on youtube as well keep cycling through videos until someone presents the material in a way that makes most sense to you concentrate on concepts rather than specifics it will be a little confusing at first but you will be more rounded as the material becomes more complex the good news is that most gen chem texts present information in a linear fashion very similar so you are less likely to get confused and if you do there probably a youtube video dealing with your issue lol ,0,chemistry
r_industry,i agree with your views on causality of acc good on you not many people dare utter those words i do not get your point on focusing on the outputs of the both sides to make the decision though i mean if you lean towards the side claiming the worse outcome of an un provable problem would not you need to apply that logic to all such claims i figure a better way is to weigh the cost effect of solutions on the table you are more likely to have positive unintended consequences that way thoughts ,7,dataisbeautiful

r_industry,true all data is processed but there a difference between good and bad data noaa data just became a little worse and correcting models is a whole thing in itself i am not even sure what the model would entail convert from probe voltage to centigrade calibrate against a standard done all the time this whole thing is about correcting for heat coming off of their boats right if that true and correct me if i am wrong on the specific thing they needed to fix they have some issues to resolve cause you cannot account for all the inputs and get the resolution nor results they certify the moment gone lol the further you go from raw measurements and closer to reference signals you like especially as a function of time which is what is in question right now the more your claims degrade it not the end of the world but they are managing it poorly ,0,Libertarian
r_industry,does not do a whole lot to prove it either ,1,Libertarian
r_industry,the key is you need to model the error there no knowing what it actually read that a no no could have been 2 degrees warmer or cooler besides a house is at different temperatures in different places you can average all the temps but that becomes qualitative data at best same thing with the ocean and noaas probe positions you correct to what you think it was based on assumptions but whose to say if it true or not the scientific thing to do is to throw the data away which would not be good for noaa credibility and past work ,1,Libertarian
r_industry,when most people say the gap is a myth they mean institutionalized sexism as in women are automatically valued 78 100 to men there plenty of dynamics in there like you said i am personally against the myth in that sense because women might feel or be perceived undervalued and men overvalued leads to tensions in the workplace etc it hard to compare apples to apples because of age differences and total hours worked some numbers suggest women under 30 make more than men overall for instance this could all be artifacts from earlier times or just crappy research as well i just do not see how to legislate around it probably impossible ,1,politics
r_industry,you would be surprised maybe you just think the other side thinks that who knows sure you got the crazies but the liberal spectrum is no different cannot do this with 100 of the people but there stuff i personally learned hanging with the other side i just played dumb and asked questions lol it becomes much easier to talk to them or debate policy if you understand what they are actually thinking and why before you know it everyone in a neutral universe ,1,politics

r_industry,i will play devil advocate i have no data to support either side i only have a random bag of anecdotal evidence asking more of students or people you are trying to train typically means you are doing more for the person in question by straining their logic as in you like them especially if you are an older professor and getting asked more about your work usually means it more interesting maybe the guys at those conferences were not anything special conferences is also where you typically scout for workers or post docs in this case during student talks sounds to me like those ladies were worth looking into i mean one typically ignores people of low perceived worth unless they were blatantly mean spirited with their questions were they ,1,politics

r_industry, 1 lol you guys and your formatting requirements 2 markets are self regulating via supply and demand it manifested in prices if you can compute all the elements fast enough you can start regulating because your market projections would be accurate enough to do so i am one of those people that question our capabilities to do it well open to new ideas of course but everything i have seen so far has not panned out well much like the 08 crash only in hindsight were we able to eventually trace back the cause and there even disagreement about that healthcare does follow those same market principles it a service offered on the market for money it obviously a little more personal because it has to do with life or death or wellness as opposed to shopping for home appliances but one can trace quite a bit of the issues we are having to monopolization of labor or price controls to the high costs everyone is paying for healthcare or not receiving adequate compensation for work yes civilization is based on cooperation and competition ying and yang trade is the next thing the human species invented after discovering farming in the fertile crescent thousands of years ago it allowed for labor specialization freeing up time for many to to invent or write or create and competition is the only tried and true way the whole system moves forward sometimes breaking down but recovering well i can always give examples 3 we are on a cusp we have been on the cusp for some time already but you can draw connections to historical events for example we are in a new information age and we are still settling into it you know the whole fake news thing etc all of a sudden the world became much smaller and people are struggling with the overbearing load of information panics are common is this that much different than the invention of the printing press and the large volumes of random newspapers people started to read in the 1800s lol the press of the earlier era was just as scummy as they are today and trump is not the first president in american history to feud with them most people just have not experienced this in their lifetimes but it the same pattern automation could break certain sections of the labor market and on paper yes 47 is possible will it happen as fast as people claim maybe but rest assured noone knows lol there hype about tesla and self driving cars but anyone that i talk to that has a solid understanding of computer science says that we are not that close lots of issues with crunching all the data for the cars if they are driving in the city i know this is all anecdotal evidence but i am fairly comfortable talking about manufacturing in general a good portion of my career and you will obviously need to give me the benefit of the doubt it going to be too expensive to replace that much labor that quickly the tech is just not there same reason republicans do not like renewable energy it unreliable on a technical level as well as a on a fiscal level 4 yes people want the same things but they want them for themselves and their family first then for their community state and finally nation and at some point the world people can say that that not true and they care for everyone but in practice it family first then community etc that actually how the economy works its a vast network of localized interests competing to get the best value at the lowest price it a hard model to sell because it comes off so cruel but that the reality life is unfair but through this competition good ideas technology and philosophy come to fruition the fastest if at all relative to other economic structures you can say the iphone started a revolution in communication it certainly has made steve jobs very rich one of those greedy rich guys noone likes and he was an asshole in real life too but what he orchestrated was a revolution and has increased the wealth of so many did jobs do what he did because he wanted to help impoverished people in africa kickstart whole economies a lot of people are using smartphones to trade due to the absence of proper governing no he was driven by money because he was a greedy bastard lol how much wealth did the smartphone create hard to measure did it destroy industries sure are we better off as a result arguably yes noone wants to go back to a time without these things well maybe some do and the whole thing keeps on getting better and cheaper because there competition in tech it largely plateaued but other industries are getting better as a result of the digital revolution lol the cusp before the storm but these things take time currently we have so many fingers in the natural flow of things it hard to figure out which ones are harming it the most and which could actually help a lot edit stupid automatic formatting why does reddit even have that you will just have to read through my notation lol it the only proven way to correct bullshit auto formatting that noon asked for ,1,politics
r_industry,agreed my points 1 we are a nation of laws and we have good and just core laws but we have strayed from them by writing laws that provide only temporary solutions to the problem of the day and have unintended consequences in the long term often bad ones 2 the rich can be regulated but not by the means we have been trying to regulate them taxes specific do and do not s 3 the market and the economy will always have issues regulated and unregulated and there will always be suffering as there is now the question is why and to what degree can we control that and what have we done in the past that led to good and what led to bad and are solutions to the problems of today good enough based on history 4 everyone is working towards a different utopia the biggest issue today is that most people cannot agree on a single path forward and yet they try and try even though it impossible because the end goal is different that where the root of all of this lies and from that some form of a compromise can be achieved ,1,politics
r_industry,hahahah and i pointed out the flaws in your counters lol what a mess i wonder how many different people i have been talking to lol drinking that whole bottle of wine was a bad idea edit nope checks out it was all you my points all stand except for you suggesting po banks are a good idea sorry about that ,1,politics
r_industry,i duno you were suggesting the post office should provide banking services to people of low means sounds like you were offering a concrete solution to a problem to me and i have asked you to expand your reasoning lol which lead us to cna and the welfare state and then to rich people and for some reason drone strikes i am pretty sure i understand your positions ,1,politics
r_industry,of course they are congruent limit powers get rid of dead weight and write better laws my point is your solutions are no different than what was already tried in the past and continues to cripple us already the rich will fuck everyone if they continue to fuck via the government we have anti trust laws for that already you disagree with what i have to say because your core philosophy is different and with my giant walls of text which are not that big by the way i have outlined why your philosophy does not cover all the bases ,1,politics

r_industry,lol no i am for laws that work and as it happens we have a very nice set of laws put together by some very smart people the bill of rights is a beautiful document the original amendments really do cover all the bases at the core some of the later ones were a little questionable lol for example we have an amendment calling for prohibition and then we had one later that repealed it waste of time and money than we have other laws introduced on the state and federal levels that regulate this or that maybe some have to go right and new ones written right one must be very careful how laws are written implemented and enforced i gave a bunch of examples already you want more laws you want the government to do more have us post provide banking services to the poor right you want the government to force employers to run their enterprises a certain way right for this to work the government will have to administer every aspect of society to ensure equality and fairness lol that communism are you a communist there are plenty of countries out there that have lots of socialist elements some are very socialist everyone there gets a fair share and is taken care of how come noones fleeing to china for a better life then lol manufactures are because they do not have strong environmental regulations and labor is cheap what is the result cheap but poor quality goods and a broken us economy we regulated the crap out of wallstreet what is the result the best in the business traders left for asian markets or switched careers our current problems are a century in the making lol here a though exercise social security of course we want to take care of those in need when they get older but how stable is it we are struggling to pay for it right now it difficult to optimize and make better should i pay a 50 income tax to support it and many other entitlement programs the government runs should the next generation pay even more to support me when i am on social security because i live so much longer because our health care is so good haha do we regulate how long people live if i worked harder then the next guy all my life should we all get the same benefits or the same salary or have unionized labor charge up the ass regardless of quality of work none of these things worked look what happened to soviet russia you can try to paint these points as logical fallacies all you want these are all historic facts you have not given me any points that disprove my position yet you have just pointed out symptoms of a larger problem and suggested temporary solutions that will fail over time and it not your fault these things are not taught or talked about anymore lol the guy trying to undo crappy laws right now gets called a racist or sexist or an idiot how dare he consider repealing a federal employment law designed to protect lgbt workers even though there is little evidence there is an issue and i do not know how the law is written and what it actually does but i read on vox that trump hates gays and i have a gay friend and i am against discrimination and anyone who agrees with trump hates gays i am going to march lol sorry had to tie this back to the original narrative we have gone on some crazy tangent ,1,politics
r_industry,damn beat me to it ,-3,gifs
r_industry,your serial killer argument proved my point we have laws against murder yet serial killers still murder lol so how effective is that law serial killers are not businesses they are people with deep psychological issues murder is illegal i believe in all countries except honor killings and crimes of passion in some societies because people are prone to killing one another and workers are not live stock a horse is property obviously you need to keep it alive to get work out of it same thing with maintaining your company car workers are private citizens no one owes them a job or a well paying job people voluntarily exchange labor hours for money an employer seeks a worker to do a task posts compensation the employer thinks is reasonable the worker agrees or disagrees the worker has the freedom to leave if compensation becomes inadequate or finds better compensation else where the employer can choose not to pay a wage that suits the worker the worker can ask for me or leave or stay if not enough people will accept the wage the employer is forced to raise it so people take the job or retain people if that becomes an issue same with cnas these rules apply to everything obviously its an issue with cnas and it sounds like there is very little competition in that industry your friend who an excellent worker in her respective tier should be able to get better compensation over the vast majority of those that are crummier workers higher than the 12 hr she getting at her current place or else where or maybe 12 hr is fair for the job she is doing it being no to low skill it could have been adequate for her when she was younger but is no longer adequate now that she has kids so she looking to go to school which is a natural trajectory the other caveat is her needing to get some i imagine expensive certification to make more than she does now on the surface it sounds like a good idea you would want trained people to take care of the elderly but what does that schooling entail often times it just an artificial barrier between those of low means but good work ethics and higher pay if your friend had a supportive husband that could take care of the kids while she went to school she would be licensed years ago and the whole family would be better off already but she scrapping by due to several laws lol that force her to get extra training to ensure the highest quality of care for everyone involved and to weed out bad workers certs like that have been used by lol organized labor to establish labor monopolies since antiquity that why our health care system is such a mess and is now too expensive for most to afford it can be traced to the formation of the ama a bunch of doctors got together under the assumption that malpractice is a big issue and set up various hurdles for people who offered health care service they did so through the government making it law health care costs skyrocketed because there were to few qualified doctors to practice lol that was decades ago now it gotten so bad it too expensive for americans to even go to medical school all of our new doctors are imported from india and yes immigrants will agree to work for less than 12 hr to be cnas we are not going to outsource grandmas your friend will likely have to take a pay cut if she stays or perhaps she already did that why she cannot afford to live on her wage as is if you force her industry to pay a minimum salary they will just cut her hours part time workers are cheaper than full time or she will have to do the work of more people in the same amount of time that why rolling back these regulations and various requirements especially for low skill jobs is so important ,1,politics
r_industry,public health sure relative to everything else doubt it you are also not ever going to make any industry accept a lower margin you can try like everyone always does with any issue but that always leads to costs labor in this case being passed onto to the customer you can mandate some minimum wage but that does not work businesses close or move happening now in ca people just packed up and left or closed down lol or automated workers out completely now there even less work for low skilled people back onto welfare for them same thing with starbucks they decided to raise wages to 15 some time ago and realized that it not going to work they ended up shortening people hours and had less people on the floor business suffered if you want the nursing home industry to pay more you need to lower other items in their budget like all the regulatory minutia they have to deal with or make it easier for newer companies to compete the better ones will end up with more of the business more money and better workers who they can afford to pay more ,1,politics
r_industry,so you want to have the welfare system subsidize the cna industry this is a cna problem lol different subject matter we can look at why cna are being paid so little hence the turnover rate and poor quality of life but guess what it aint the only industry that has this issue and granted cleaning the elderly is a noble task if you were to make a list of all jobs i do not think it will be very high up there in terms of importance nor disfunctionality your point makes sense if you are not considering the whole economy and concentrate on just the case of your friend and her specific field and backstory lots of jobs are important and pay little because they are low skill and lots of people are forced to rely on government hand outs to support themselves that bad it bad for society because we all pay in to have this and many other safety nets operational meanwhile people suffer and have less opportunity to build up skill sets that are in demand and pay better your friend has section 8 food stamps and medicaid that several hundred dollars a month easy just for her add on the overhead to administer all this easily 100 markup i mean money does not grow on trees and the government does not have any to begin with that public money taxes society pays taxes in a better world society pays taxes just for what we all deem necessary in the real world that money is spent very inefficiently and people assume their specific passion is worth adding to those burdens add all of them up and we have a several trillion dolalr budget deficit we have huge problems if your friend is such an excellent cna and you are so passionate about those services start a small private cna network where you pay good money to good workers and offer good services i know lots of people who do that part time your point about having every other industry absorb 1 5 million cna workers every year makes no sense people rotate in and out of jobs like this all the time and they typically climb the ladder slightly higher each time as a result you can top out at 15 hr as you said but those are different issues that a labor supply demand issue that tied to the whole economy and broken down regionally cna solutions better training new business models lower bulk regulations increase the quality of regulation you do want to keep lower taxes so everyone can afford to pay cnas a proper wage instead of filtering tax money through a bureaucracy via food stamps so cnas can keep the lights on the well being of you me your friend society do not know how else to explain this lol it kind of sounds like you want to sacrifice the well being of your friend for some vague greater good ,1,politics
r_industry,lol yeah your friend is incentivized to work a lower paying job her benefits will go away if she makes the next step to 14 hr or whatever it is in her case even if she does not want to for personal reasons the objective is for people to be self sufficient and yes that means working more to climb the ladder that how people with money got their money look at it this way your friend is using public resources of which we clearly do not have enough of or else we would not be having this problem to help support her family if we implemented something like the negative income tax model where she can more freely scale her income from work without going over benefit cliffs she will be less likely to rely on welfare programs so she better off long term the tax payer me and you and yes her as well are better off people who are in line to get the benefits will get those benefits faster and once they do get them they move out of the system faster it a win win win now there nothing wrong with enjoying your work even if it pays little but it not our collective problem to support people pet comforts by giving them enough money so they can feed their kids i am not trying to be rude or belittle your friend i am sure she a terrific worker and i want her to be happy and work the job she wants but that not how the real world works i mean i would prefer to do something other than what i am doing now too i would live a happier life but i have financial responsibilities and i am always trying to increase my cash flow so i can lol one day afford to have kids and be less likely to need welfare there nothing wrong with being ok at where you are as your friend does but if you cannot pay for your life by yourself you need to figure out a way to do so and that mean being a little ambitious welfare is for emergencies or extraordinary circumstances not to maintain people lives indefinitely the current framework makes it hard to leave and very easy for people not to have a strong sense of ambition i am glad she looking at training to become an lpn and i hope she finds a way to do what she loves and can also make ends meet and hopefully even more just in case things come up ,1,politics
r_industry,it will help in a very big way and it a big problem lots of people cannot handle the jump between welfare and self sufficiency so the system is always stressed because people rely on it i mean the objective is not to subsidize people lives the objective is to make sure people do not need welfare in the first place right and yeah most jobs pay 15 or less hard to live on in expensive areas like la or ny but doable in middle america the former have really lavish welfare programs which cost more which depress average wages via higher tax burdens which push more people towards welfare rinse repeat besides standards of life are subjective whose to say how much people are entitled to are they being subsizidized too much or too little or just right does it need to be handled on a case by case basis and if so how much is it going to cost to figure that out and implement can it be done more efficiently than is already these problems do not seem to be going away because they are complex we have been fighting the war on poverty since 1965 we have more ghettos now where there are no bank branches and people cannot find adequate work and have very little opportunity for mobility because our schools are terrible and police cannot keep up with crime so if the government is at the root of so many issues we have today why the hell would we want them to run post office banks especially since it not going to solve anything except fulfilling some minor gesture for rural areas there nothing there never was really economic climate shifted and the standard of life increased now people are stuck some cannot move to find better work which is how it usually done but that always going to be the case i do not think it wise to go out of our way as a country to prop up failing areas their probably failing for a reason ,1,politics
r_industry,that episode was hands down the best thing i have seen in the last 5 years ,5,television
r_industry,so what we are really dealing with is issues with the safety net where welfare does not cover enough or in all cases in certain areas correct the welfare system needs a hell of an overhaul for things to get better and the economy needs to improve so people are less likely to get stuck in that weird region between welfare qualification and being able to afford 100 bucks to keep a bank account open there are things that can be done to the safety net to fix this converting us post offices to function as banks is a nice thought still think it quite random but i am pretty sure where bernie sanders got it from but i doubt it will help people be less poor as there are other issues at play there for this to be resolved for good you retool the welfare state to incentivize people to start working which it does not currently having done that you have freed up funds to cover more people without jacking up anyone taxes which seems to be the popular solution to all of our problems because norway does it or something i mean if you are hell bent on keeping physical post buildings open sure but have whatever welfare office that going to do this do this why would you build an entire banking infrastructure into us post if there are already federal agencies and offices that are set up for it ,0,politics
r_industry,true cannot argue i am an immigrant myself still legally a white male hilarious enough but i grew up poor and made my way having said that i love all the guys i used to work with they helped me become a better person i literally look back and wish to go back to what i used to be doing they were from mexico el salvador guatemalan mixes in between if they were young enough to sprout up state side and other classic mixtures that the definition of americana and all the old timer chicanos from decades ago i was blessed enough to have met and learn from one was my old prof in college love em honest people family people hard working people to the extent that put my old soviet block relatives to shame i duno if you are a male and in case you are not those are the guys you want to work with elbow to elbow it huge thing for hands on guys and it painful hilarious that that is a conservative value that people from the rust belt are screaming about and everyone else is deaf to and yes immigration from south of the border is a stupid task all other tasks held the same it retarded the wall wo not fix anything the thing is trump is much smarter than by coincidence or by design most people believe i struggled with it for all of 2016 he almost appears to be dumb and incompetent to only disarm the opposition who have lost sight of what they truly stand for and god knows if they truly stand for it today does he really want to kick out all immigrants unlikely more research is needed is he using this as leverage to get other things done of course in a really fucked up way work with me here he given us an opportunity to re establish priorities that have been held up in popular culture political limbo that my pet theory and that my hope i would like to re establish dialogue with my fellow tax paying neighbors citizens as they were once called to figure out exactly what america stands for regardless of where you are from or what you think and get down to brass tax of how we are gana get this super diverse nation rolling again against all odds lol and if it takes an orange clown to spark that i do not really care because i care about results and so should you because you are american this is what we do all other labels are irrelevant we are all in this together lol chirp back if you want to know why trump is trump and how an effective way forward can be realized and accomplished from my humble perspective of course ,1,politics

r_industry,i am pretty sure they did since they could not sell as much cheap crap to us because we were broke and you have left out many other elements of the equation but you bough up a very good point are india and china doing so well because they have tight central regulations or because they discovered capitalism some years ago and now reaping the rewards i am pretty sure mao communist china would not have felt the 2008 recession either lol ,-4,politics
r_industry,for predatory payday lending practices i am pretty sure we have laws on the books about lying to the customer about honoring contracts sure they are sneaky and immoral and some do break the law but the consumer agrees to the high interest rates or variable interest rates that most people would not touch with a 10 foot pole the issue is people fall for it you are not going to solve financial illiteracy by having the post office offer banking services what ever that means and i am still waiting to hear what that entails to poor people which also needs some clarification i think private banks or credit unions do a fine job there usually a chase branch in poor neighborhoods i drive through those all the time where you can go cash a check or open a savings account for free you do not even have to go to a bank anymore to cash checks or open savings all done online you can go to the library to use the internet for free if you cannot afford it we have those public options already if you want a small loan there are lots of credit unions that can help if they refuse maybe the loan is a bad investment for them as is usually the case already and the client has bigger issues i doubt a post office bank could solve those an example from you to change my mind would be of much help for me here i mean if you are super screwed financially i believe we have lots of welfare programs already and private charitable organizations this us post becoming a federally controlled bank thing just makes no sense as a good solution to a problem that questionable to begin with help ,-1,politics

r_industry,i am still not sure why post offices needs to be banks it free to open up a checking account at any bank if it the shitty neighborhood case those communities either need to be dissolved bad option or allowed to grow good option one of the criticisms of dodd frank is that it makes it too expensive for new banks one started in an impoverished community to start up it essentially guaranteed monopoly power to the few large ones which noone likes having us post offer banking services is a strange proposition unless you want to keep something unnecessary around to do something private industries could and have done much better i mean have us post offer small loans or savings accounts i am not being an ass i just could never understand why it a solution and why it a problem in the first place ,-5,politics
r_industry,you have fallen for my trap ,2,funny
r_industry,well i happen to know about several things trump gets shit for but i am ok with i dislike him for other reasons but i am not gana give him extra shit for those because 1 everyone says he a piece of shit and 2 it no different than most other presidents most of his recent executive orders are largely irrelevant lol i agree but you have missed my point so let me extrapolate a little bit trump is a shitty person most people that run for potus are says things that triggers half the country yes is pushing for agendas that are disliked by half the country and you happen probably to be on that side and he does so in the most chaotic information age we have witnessed yet so he fucked if he does and he fucked if he does not now you might know a thing or two about immigration because you live in az and you think he fucked up are you an ice agent i do not know so we are kinda stuck now sure i am optimistic about things being alright but even a small sliver of some agreement on something even minuscule is a good thing baby steps we are fucked not because trump is a hitler and people disagree with him we are fucked because people are still learning to filter information and converse with one and other without using biases and it quite literally is propaganda as crutches both sides do this so what is your knowledge on the 6 big steps backwards he making i might have knowledge too we could quite possibly learn a thing or two ,1,politics
r_industry,yeah there is you typically need to prove some worth but migration lottery is a thing i think it been scaled back as of late though but here the problem everyone follows the money employees and employers but not everyone has the same culture personal temperament and skill sets not language and food and religion or whatever your point is that people should be free to move to places where they want to be as in me moving to bruges because i liked it there so much or you moving to california because there something wrong with you lol correct have that freedom and if the country you are moving to thinks you can enrich it somehow go ahead we do not know how well that going to work out as in the balance of who goes where people tend to want to come to the us for opportunity their home countries do not have this generally outweighs other migration patterns people do not move to india for opportunity unless they want to open a factory for cheap ethnicity has nothing to do with this it all money tech giants hire cheap h1b workers because it cheaper and the risk of loosing money due to poor production value is low enough for them to do so so when you are on market as an employee you trade skill for money i mean google does not hire indians because they have cultural secrets to success they best ones were probably trained the european way and all developing countries rely on western ways to better their economies educational system capitalism etc us engineering students do not travel to china to learn manufacturing chinese students come en mass to any us university that will take them to learn the ways of us success so those productive enough obviously would prefer to live in the us if they can get it depleting the number of productive people in the home country lowering overall efficiency that what is happening now if bright and talented people in india stayed in india they would make india a better place over time they can compete on the world market not just as a cheap goods producer international cooperation can only happen through trade but it needs to be harmonious now since we have a welfare state we need migration controls if it were like in the past when you did not get benefits for being poor you can have open boarders because the natural flow of the labor market would dictate if there are indeed jobs for you regardless of skill level ethnicity etc but that not how it works today ,1,politics
r_industry,ponder this people are not alarmed and sometimes welcome trump plans pertaining to the issues said people know a thing or two about there are many issues trump is dealing with and no one person can be an expert in all of them but again perhaps an honest opinion can be formed on 1 and in this case at least tech professionals who hate trump are fine with changing h1b laws against popular rhetoric on his plans which is usually fuck trump could one reason that for all other issues let take your 6 people who know a thing or two are also alright with trump plans so is it fuck trump 6 out of the 7 times or fuck trump only 3 4 out of the 7 or fuck trump less than that even maybe sometimes 2 7 sounds pretty alright to me ,1,politics

r_industry,hilariously it already kinda works like that industry typically writes out the specifics reg targets under pressure from the government of course but there lots of cooperation that why a lot of them are useless not in every case of course but for instance if you read the sticker on the back of your laptop surge protector you are gana see a bunch of certs from a bunch of companies like underwriter laboratories a lot of them are private they design tests test components etc there are whole industries built around that now if you are the manufacturer you get those certs largely based on consumer needs it marketing and have to comply with public sector regulation by law those are usually less stringent as well from that perspective things are safer now due to consumer desires and insurance fees the producers tries to keep low its also faster to qualify goods that way government known to take quite a while to get things done it kind of weird to approach this from the free market perspective but you are unlikely to be less safe with reduced regulation but way more likely to have much lower prices and better products faster sure trump 75 targets are stupid but i doubt he means removing regs like led thresholds in potable plumbing i mean you are probably going to wana know that before you buy and the producer knows it ,0,politics

r_industry,well you just hit the nail on head you are quite right in my experiences i am down lol there is room to shift priorities regulation has the potential to help edge the fact towards a better future it has in the past some good cannot argue lotsa bad still processing it skeptism right and do not get me wrong i am not a cranky 60 something i have not dinged 30 yet i do not know if you are my senior or my junior and frankly it does not matter i care for the well being of all of mankind and our tribe most of all i am assuming you are american canadian also counts i love camping i love nature when time allows there not better place i would rather be than some corner of the wild i hate cities i live in one it tough to do what i do especially ever since i truly understood what it takes to support civilization as we know it and how i make money to pay bills but i am there with you let better society towards a brighter more sustainable future that why it pains me to even have to have this dialog to begin with should be a slam dunk but it been politicized to death if it all worker perfectly there would be no disagreement but we have systemic issues recently and en mass for better or worse there has been an incorrect assessment of issues at hand looking back at the original promt of this thread are the ipcc models and america proposed solutions obama era good enough to handle the issues at hand clearly not and we have another ideology at the helm and like it or not all we have is each other everything else has been erased we do not know where we are going luckily we have freedom of information through reddit in our case to chew the fat of these facts and i want to thank you for hanging on for as long as you did most do not it important it the issue of our generation let line out the facts as best as we can noone gana help us otherwise that why i like to chirp back to people curious enough to ask on here good on you i know i have learned quite a bit from our exchanges over the last few days i hope you have at least considered some of the things i have said lol i know it should not mean nothing coming from a couple of strangers but this is how we grow as a culture everything is way more complex than we think it is i am surprised everyday ha ha anyway this is why there is push back from conservatives about co2 emission regulation i am not conservative but i am very concerned about how it all implemented and i am kinda pissed about the job liberals have been doin from what you have told me so are you did i get it right cheers ,1,politics
r_industry,consumers and producers are interrelated that the truest definition of an economy attempting to re direct and or re balance the exchange of money for goods and services especially in terms of energy which is encoded into every aspect of the supply chain is very risky this goes beyond extra money for r d but on that topic lets look at it this way i have been in r d for a while the more money my company spends complying with regulation or dealing with increases in prices of goods the less money i have had for r d r d benefits from higher profits higher costs and regulation have incentivized companies to move production to mexico and china there is literally no one whose anyone that does not have a plant in china today they are taking some steps to reduce pollution but it will take them a long time they do not have the tech we do since we took theses steps some decades ago already and we had the money to do it less so now we had more skill as well less so now too less work in mfg less people choose that as a career right now everyone trying to build these infrastructures in their chinese plants not just to run more efficiently but to increase the quality of goods for instance i have had to deal with crappy epoxy resin from india after the chinese garbage failed it was the only thing that was 1 largely available and 2 priced reasonably enough to stay competitive in local markets lol the company lost a lot of money because the damn floor coat we were making did not last 6 months on the shelf so the consumer lost the producer lost god knows how much the environment suffered money that should have been spent on rnd to make a better product was spent dealing with returns while i spent more time than i should have figuring out why the crap went bad in the first place there are more efficient ways to make everyone happier but it ai not going to be blanket regulation edit spelling ,1,politics
r_industry,of course there are ways out of this and there are great risks either way what i am trying to get at is that it not being rich versus being poor it not being poor at the expense of sloppy legislation as in lack of affordable energy will make you poor in some cases it can kill people if they cannot afford heating or cooling or the price of basic goods get too high transportation and production right aside from that the downward pressure on all industries in terms of environmental regulation has not been successful on a global scale which is what we are interested in factories in california closed and moved 300 miles south to mexico where they pollute even more that a net gain of carbon at the expense of local well being everyone lost lol so sure invest in green energy and it will mature to the point where it will be better than fossil fuels naturally over time but strangling carbon producing tech right now while propping up green start ups will only hamper progress it has hampered progress already if you look at some of the failures we have had already forcing innovation through mandates which is why i am so interested in the hard numbers they are based off of has been backfiring as it almost always does besides if an economy has more wealth it has higher potential to invest in new tech that how capital works and it done on a case by case basis meaning it more efficient that why there is hype about solar currently which only works a fraction of the day in a fraction of geographies and we still do not have safe enough nuclear or thorium or bio or even truly energy efficient dwellings but that local zoning gridlock ,1,politics
r_industry,agreed i have actually had way more interesting and thoughtful talks with conservatives everyone had to look around before touching on subjects like race or the environment but it was really refreshing and lots of ground was covered talking to liberals is tedious because you need to spend a good while explaining philosophy first and calmly nodding while they list their rights and opinions and then explaining to them that america is in fact diverse not just in terms of income and skin color etc etc worth it though ,3,Libertarian
r_industry,look dude the worst thing you can do especially if you are of a scientific mind is to oversimplify very complex problems before making claims that have very real and likely very negative implications on society i completely understand that many people do not care much about the economic aspect of this but it very important as i have said before there is nothing wrong with curbing co2 emissions or researching this or suggesting solutions but much like the people of germany who cost of energy went up after they decided to go with renewable energy to the point of re opening their coal power plants recently i do not want to pay more than i have to for literally everything that makes my world work especially based on numbers that are pulled from the literal thin air and neither should you if you are fine with risking energy poverty i do not see why i need to be poor with you this is very complicated both politically and yes scientifically the points you have made are not complicated and that fine it your choice to approach problems that way but lots of people prefer not to so maybe you should exchange your boundless apathy for some healthy skepticism lol ,1,politics
r_industry,good page it does a good job at explaining energetic exchanges in the atmosphere specific to the gasses we are measuring and putting out it is a solid case for co2 warming the planet but does not explain the magnitude delta t right so you have dco2 dt directly proportional dt is complicated though lots of contributors and drivers for dt green house gases have saturation points water in particular since it changes phases and behaves differently they could also reflect energy coming in sliding door works both ways by that logic this is qualitative evidence quantitative evidence is much harder because you need to take all elements into consideration and test results need to very accurate they are not very accurate currently there is a chance there are thermal drivers we are not considering i have not looked into it much personally but sun spot activity lines up well with the decade long heating and cooling trends the sun being the source of this radiation cannot be logically excluded from the system right it also based on pretty solid science the question again is what is it contribution to dt large small complicated these are good conversations to have especially in the context of the current public debate on the subject matter people are concerned about the accuracy of these dt functions because our politicians in their infinite wisdom have figured out specific targets we need to hit to prevent cataclysms in the future is there anything wrong with researching man made contributions to the climate system no should we study it of course do we need to reduce our co2 emissions by 80 by 2050 i think is the target because the planet will not be able to handle more than 2c maximums above average i think are the targets again no those numbers are based off of multiple assumptions as in your error bar just became much larger the proposed solutions are not likely to solve much if anything at all but that a completely different conversation ,1,politics
r_industry,yes it very subjective both ways murky and clear assuming measurements are good enough here the problem co2 is measurable is a green house gas does have a warming effect but is not the major green house gas 200 400 ppm is trace levels on top of that the atmosphere is a very complex system coupled with the complexity of oceans which are large carbon sinks you quickly face a very complex system right off the bat it curious that a trace gas could be the catalyst of warming of such a large system which is not adequately mapped yet it appears to go against the laws of thermodynamics now if you assume all these effects as constants which is what ipcc models do sure co2 causes warming and models could be constructed in such a way to match the data that we have collected and we can project future temperature levels the same can go with building models around methane contribution to warming or water vapor or urban heating so at the core the claim that carbon in the atmosphere is driving the warming that we are seeing is too simplistic if you know otherwise please share ,1,politics
r_industry,there disagreement there too 1 land v sea v satellite data 2 accuracy of running averages as a function of time and method 3 degree of changes in the running averages 4 claims of errors and even fabrication of data for each case by both sides once you start looking into these specific issues the data becomes murky since reported changes are on a sub centigrade scale spanning decades claims become murkier still these are common resolution issues in data sets especially those that need to be corrected or adjusted we can see changes happening but we cannot specify causality co2 in this case without calculations modeling so you come back to ipcc models ,1,politics

r_industry,academia is in pretty terrible shape right now graduate students unionizing is a pretty terrible symptom the purpose of a graduate program historically was to help specialize people towards some branch of the greater school of thought b a s so some extra classes and research which is typically heavily directed by the professor kind of like helping you learn how to do research the next level is phd where you do your own research you would get some stipend for ta level work or similar as far as comparing graduate students to workers they are the equivalent of entry level in the real world minus actual work experience because you truly would be a part timer of 1 to 2 years experience that why most ms graduates start not much higher if higher at all than b s varies from industry to industry of course additionally you still pay for a master like 30 60k now maybe the money you get for work is negligible designed to help you pay rent and buy food so run like hell do a few years of industry earn some money live a little you will learn way more when you feel an ms can help your career about 5 6 years in on average go back to school part time while still working if possible you will get way more out of it than just transitioning straight from undergraduate your employer might also cover your expenses ,2,news

r_industry,the question i ask myself sometimes is how functional stable are these programs they are very popular and many people benefit but there always a crisis with funding safety nets are great concept i am just weary of upkeep over time for instance when sanders wanted to make college tuition free full disclosure i do not agree with that for various other reasons which would obviously help everyone get an education and is a good thing he proposed a tax on wall street speculation the tax was small as in the market would bear it but would not that create incentive for people to find workarounds or trade less the tax would need to be increased to keep up with funding requirements there will be fights about it and will add to political gridlock while students end up suffering due to possible funding gaps or budget cuts we have been living with this pattern for several decades now the only way to manage sanders concept is to turn it into a blanket tax or spend extra money on enforcement assuming the amount of trade speculation remains constant thoughts ,1,politics

r_industry,i remember reading about numbers higher than 1 billion la times said about 5 other estimates from bloomberg i believe were around 80 look i am not knocking on the guy he does wonderful things and 6500 jobs is better than nothing but the business approach is unstable let also not forget about the thousands of jobs lost from closing down classical energy companies regardless if you think they are good or bad if the government gets involved in subsidizing transactions be it from tax insensitive or large grants the market skews and generic operations of a private sector enterprise automatically becomes politicized it a known fact that if subsidies are pulled from the green energy sector it will collapse this is not news from a right wing conspiracy website this was bloomberg market watch the only reason green energy is competing is due to positive subs into things like tesla and taxes on fossils again nothing wrong with green or musk lol i invite you to bring up historical examples of subsidies done right i am not aware of any that have panned out long term but i know of many that are still lingering and damaging the natural flow of markets ,1,politics
r_industry,that because musk companies are heavily subsidized that does not work long term he has interesting solutions to problems we would like solved but look at it this way the federal and some state governments subsidize the purchase of solar panels which are too expensive for most people to buy otherwise on the other hand other state and local governments find themselves competing for business public utility for instance ironically and issues come up with zoning regulation this was a problem in the la area other solutions have been offered like getting panels at no cost but overflow energy belongs to the company indefinitely underway in sf my main concern is the tech is not ready to compete in the market on its own and is heavily dependent on the government which changes course more often than the required rnd life cycle as we just saw with the replacement of obama with trump on top of that if government funding for tesla and spacex dries up or shrinks he will likely have to close his doors if he was less dependent on subsidies he would be far more likely to stay alive per free market mentality ,0,politics

r_industry,your point about being treated differently by employers per your degree is interesting in my experience b s m s get treated relatively the same even pay sometimes phds have clout but a lot of industry professionals actually have biases against them having said that what is the activity in higher ed chemistry right now it was limping really bad a few years back when i was considering it ,5,chemistry
r_industry,o chem is the most important chem discipline understanding the concepts will give you a leg up no mater what you end up doing it also hard to teach and learn cs and bs are natural and sometimes necessary do not worry if you feel your peers are grasping concepts faster do not worry either because you would be surprised how many people a are at your level or lower and b pretend to grasp it when they really do not or think they grasp it the good news is that you are honest about your skill set and if you are willing to train harder you will absolutely get it and you will be surprised to see how your mind has evolved after the fact 1 2 years i guarantee it went through it myself d now to truly grasp o chem read every single text you find ask here on reddit hit up forums very soon you will figure out how to phrase questions correctly and get the answers you specifically need to hear good luck ,5,chemistry
r_industry,i think it all depends on what you want to do day to day here my take from the professional side of things pharmacists do little to no chemistry it a pencil pushing and administrative profession if you enjoy the process of discovery engineering etc stick to the broadest discipline possible biochem in your case as it will open more doors for you when you start working as i take it you do not know what you want to end up doing yet on that note it is in your best interest to try to find a job right after your b s and get a feel for what science offers outside of the classroom hint it very very different do not listen to your professors as most only understand the world of academics once you work a little bit you will figure out your trajectory applied versus academic science is or if you want to do biochem at all hint 2 higher education is necessary but very expensive and time consuming be very careful with your selection of schools and disciplines as a lot of people end up wasting years and burning out now go out there and make the most important decision of your life d,4,chemistry
r_industry,hmmmm chem philosophy pro chemical interactions are still very abstract and difficult to quantify unless isolated which in turn usually skews the true nature of said interaction within the system in question the need for abstract though is hence required con text book definitions of science and its principles already entail philosophy its called theory conclusion fire all social philosophers academics and politicians replace with scientists and engineers to solve socio economic problems ,1,philosophy

r_industry,i would go as far as suggesting people conscientiously avoiding the topic all together you never know what trouble you can get into socially professionally let alone in corporate climates everything is in the context of the unspoken unwritten laws of things it drives me nuts but then i catch myself behaving similarly in certain situations so i cannot blame anyone honestly and i bet you can relate i feel we are in the midst of a gender normalization chapter of modern history where we are trying to harmonize the biological differences of the two dominant sexes into a functional social structure it sucks that many older cultures figured it out already but as far as we are concerned this is actually a very exciting time even if people like us have to put up with the current state of affairs no pain no gain d ,1,TwoXChromosomes

r_industry,how that error calculated ,1,politics
r_industry,it definitely better than nothing but say the numbers everyone is discussing right now are based on several hundred entries most people do not participate in them millions of americans your error is hence great the percentages values that are used as outputs cannot be correlated to the mood of the public in bulk there also no way of telling how accurate these numbers are especially poll to poll hence the quality of the data is diminished trying to get a difference from the outputs clinton 57 sanders 15 etc should be used with more than 1 grain of salt ,0,politics

r_industry,no do not get me wrong competition in the marketplace is very important i agree 100 i am trying to point out that a good number people in this thread and in the comments section of the article are reading into his sentence too literally and missing his point which simply states that it does not matter how advanced our economic sector is many options of products if the middle class is struggling to afford basic necessities while the bulk of the profits are funneled to the top tiers of the economic ladder as you mentioned the middle class is the driving force behind tax revenue via consumption in this case but once the spending power of this group is diminished income inequality the system will break and has been breaking for quite sometime in short it wo not matter that we have 18 different types of sneakers if we cannot afford any of them ,5,politics
r_industry,by saying that we do not need 23 types of deodorant and a bunch of different type of sneakers he meant that the american public is more interested in simplistic material possessions than our grave socioeconomic issues i would also add that we might as well just have 1 type of sneaker already they are all poorly manufactured knockoffs of each other and this goes for almost all durable goods on the market currently ,1,politics

r_industry,car dealerships are increasingly making their money from selling you a loan package they function as a middle man between you and a bank hence your price goes up cred unions are generally cheaper than if you went to a bank yourself the only way for a better deal is to have very good credit and qualify for a 0 apr incentive if you are in that camp you will get good treatment anywhere you go go buy a tesla since you can both afford it and they do not have dealerships anyway d if you are either young or have bad credit your best option is a credit union ,8,personalfinance
r_industry,a more educated public generated from a reduction in cost of education will enable more individuals to become job creators the exact opposite of the current conservative trickle down mentality ,1,SandersForPresident
r_industry,a very good work around dealerships is going to your local credit union they will give you a max sum they will finance you for with a very good set apr then you go shopping for a car talk the dealership down to a price of the car always concentrate on just the sticker price and when it comes time to talk financing tell them that you are doing an options contract you usually have 7 days to find your own lender after you agree to purchase a car no matter what the car sales guy tries to tell you do not let them try to see if they can get you a better apr walk away from dealerships that are very pushy once this is all done and you are in the finance office refuse all the add ons your credit union likely offers the same insurance packages at much much lower prices i have recently done this and wish i had from the get go ,57,personalfinance

r_industry,if you have been attempting to find work in the past several years you would notice that almost all jobs a step above cleaning flipping burgers require some sort of bs ba any decent job requiring stem education a field of education we are struggling in relative to all 1st world countries and some 2nd and 3rd too already requires at minimum a masters in the next several years when we are going to see full scale globalization we all need to compete with well educated workers from other countries no matter what your profession is at that point no one going to care that you went to some trade school where you learned an already outdated trade and did not receive any critical thinking skill sets the fact that most current graduates are not doing much with their degree is a function of poor job growth and not one of poor personal choice ,1,politics
r_industry,i have always been amused at some people love interest with nasa i would even argue most of them have zero experience in applied science or engineering academic nor professional the work nasa does is yes cutting edge exciting but it is considered rather flashy by both people in the public service sectors and relevant private sectors it has also devolved over the years into a collection of pencil pushers with phds much like the rest of our sci eng public institutions most of the thrilling innovations come from the private sector now nasa just places the order besides a lot of nasa level tech is also commissioned by other government agencies albeit mainly from the pentagon and do not discount the stuff the doe does it less interesting than space exploration but its some gnarly stuff all sanders had implied and very logically is that we have more pressing issues at hand as in if the bulk of our population is too poor to afford basic necessities let alone go to college and major in aerospace there wo not be a nasa at all ,5,SandersForPresident
