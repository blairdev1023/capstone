incryosleep,if it degrading then yeah sounds like it would break it i am saying offering a bonus or no data usage services is not violating it but the problem is this was taken out of context because you have data limits across your usage and while you have the high speed data limit you pay for the speeds are the same binge or not they were claiming it can lead to reduced speed because if you go over your limit which is easy if you are streaming hd videos you have a slower speeds for all of your connections but since binge do not count against your speed it not slow it on the line but no it does not cross it for the service you pay for they are not limiting you ,1,news

incryosleep,the regulations you are implying could be used in negative senses as well simply offering any forms off benefits would be up to question from any company they are not limiting anyone they simply offer a perk to customers it does not violate net neutrality the true neutrality you are stating would effect any company business or person that uses the internet since they all have to follow the regulations not just isps and people forget this since the main focus was isp organizations i see nothing wrong with it and by over regulating you add more loopholes for abuse as well backlash from people and companies that would otherwise support it edit sorry tried to clarify what i was saying it was the end of the day for me ,1,news
