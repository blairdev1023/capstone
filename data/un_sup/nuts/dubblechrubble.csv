dubblechrubble, cod and bf are sort of similar but still different they are both giant franchises that inspire new games every year and it all started with bf1942 and cod4 maybe medal of honor deserves a spot there instead but i went with cod as if i say medal of honor these days most people ask me what game is that i do not know how this makes bf or cod earn their spot there you specifically did not mention cod4 in your original post so i am going to ignore that you suddenly mentioned it here cod1 was caught right in the middle of the ww2 fps fad a few years after moh had established itself and a few years before cod4 cod1 was seen as good as mohaa but it has no place here as it just continued an trend instead of setting one then for battlefield i do think bf1942 popularized the combined arms gameplay despite games like ww2 online before it but just because it cranks out a yearly iteration does not mean it worth including in this discussion as for milsim ghost recon was around before opf as were rainbow six swat conflict delta force spec ops well i guess some of these were tactical shooters and not milsims specifically i do not think we can give that much credit to bis for popularizing the genre but we can certainly give them props for continuing to be a milsim dev when every other franchise i just mentioned is dead or a shadow of its former self ,1,Games

dubblechrubble, story is story of course however one needs to be aware of the role the form plays into how the story is experienced i read a book by william goldman where he talks about adapting both the princess bride and marathon man for the big screen he wrote both of them as novels and was later tasked with writing the screenplays he said the thing that most people do not appreciate about converting a story from book to film is that they are two different mediums with two different ways of telling a story this applies to video game adaptations as well you cannot make a faithful one to one copy sacrifices have to be made with transferring a story from one storytelling medium to another reducing this conversion to say story is story is a little disingenuous and minimizes the effort that is required to reshape a story intended for one medium to properly work on another i do not think the future of video game movies are wholly dependent on people to have been raised in video game culture from childhood but it surely cannot hurt with that said just because one understands games well does not mean they understand how to retell that story in film either there a lot of factors here more than just waiting for the next generation to get old enough to make video game adaptations ,1,movies

dubblechrubble,seeing as how there so few mice with 4 6 thumb buttons i am starting to think i am weird with my peripherals too it just makes more sense to me to use my thumb for auxiliary actions but according to company marketing departments only mmo players have needs of more than 2 or 3 side buttons and they need six times that i am weird with peripherals i use a model m for gaming you have been to r mechanicalkeyboards before right if not check it out you will be treated well ,1,buildapc
dubblechrubble,do you find the buttons next to lmb or rmb to be useful i have buttons like that on the m90 i have but i rarely ever used them because of how hard they were to reach and how hard they were to activate so i have pretty much been dismissing any mice with those buttons and looking solely at thumb buttons i tried a 502 in best buy and i am still not sure that i would be satisfied with auxiliary buttons for my index or middle fingers that one reason why i was considering the g700s as it has a reasonable amount of thumb buttons as well as some extra buttons near lmb and rmb that i might eventually learn to love but then i thought why make that compromise if the rival 500 or roccat nyth were just as good granted the nyth has a laser sensor and they both have less than stellar software so that why i turned to the community for advice aside from the dpi buttons on the m90 i have no experience with buttons next to lmb or rmb but i do have experience with using several of the thumb buttons there 9 on the m90 which is too many really i just want slightly fewer thumb buttons but looking at the product offerings of multiple companies it does not seem like there much of a market for what i am looking for sadly ,1,buildapc
dubblechrubble,no sweat and no need to apologize i just want a few keys near the thumb for auxiliary actions and ideally i would not have to take my fingers off lmb or rmb to do these actions it just tough to find any mice that meet this requirement most seem to only have 2 side buttons except for mmo mice which have a dozen there not much section in between them,1,pcmasterrace

dubblechrubble,in regards to the chaos if you liked the movie you would probably enjoy reading the book it will give you a much greater appreciation for the film and you will be surprised at how many little things are included in the movie but are not explained but also you would be given much more context to understand what a 2 hour movie could not take time to explain like how the black hawks were all supposed to drop the rangers in a square formation surrounding the target building but the helicopter carrying eversmann chalk dropped its rangers one block out of formation this is shown on a monitor but not directly addressed or how gallentine kept using his radio and could not get through to anyone it because he had a cable running from his radio to his headset and when he rode the rope out the plane the friction of the cable rubbing on the rope burned a hole right through the middle leaving his headset useless aside from a little extra insight with moments like those you would also learn more about what command was doing and thinking and also what the other chalks were all doing the book is not quite centered on chalk 4 as much as the movie is you will be able to make sense of some of the chaos a t least i wholly recommend the book i think you would like it too ,2,worldnews

dubblechrubble,oh man you are going to be disappointed when you read this i just meant the difference between heating styles conduction only like the iq convection only like the hopper or fw4 and conduction convection hybrid on the mighty give me different highs and i am sorry to say that i am not sure i could articulate how the highs affect me or how they differ ,1,vaporents
dubblechrubble,of the vapes i own the hoppers are the quickest at extracting hands down i can vape a load in about 3 5 hits and it will come out as brown as tobacco a similarly sized load in the mighty iq or fw4 could take a dozen hits or more but with the speed of extraction also comes the heat issues which should not be understated i have got a technique down to mitigate the heat issues but you can really only do so much and by that i mean that there are measures you can take to cool the metal frame of the hoppers so you do not burn your lips but the vapor will still be really hot even when you cut the power halfway through a hit i find myself coughing like i did with smoking when i use the hoppers i generally use the hopper to get me high quickly and then i will use the fw4 to maintain throughout the day or evening i generally use the hopper as my primary on the go piece since it so small and pocketable in a kit with extra batteries and with a doob tube which makes it a little less pocketable what other vapes do you own the reason i have so many vapes is because they serve different purposes not to mention that they function differently as well giving different highs i determined the vapes i have to be a good compliment to each other with exception to the mighty and the iq they both kinda fill the same role i know i said earlier i could not decide between just one but i that may have been a lie lol if i could only have one i would say maybe the fw4 just because of its versatility if you know you can regularly commit to 5 10 minute sessions i would go with the mighty and then if you value portability stealth and quick sessions then the grasshopper i am hesitant to really endorse the hopper as a sole vape though because of the risk of failure during my honeymoon phase with the hopper i bought a second one and sure enough the ss one started having a hot backend which required warranty repair service i know they are improving their operations at hopper labs but i only just bought the ss hopper in late feb or early march so they may still have some kinks to work out but i do think things are better not trying to turn you away from a hopper just trying to making you aware of the reality of hopper ownership ,2,vaporents
dubblechrubble,the mighty is my stay at home portable vape it not actually as big as many people make it out to be or maybe i just have bigger hands than i thought but i still keep it for home use only part of the reason is how hard it hits the vapor comes fast and hard and is deceptively cool as well and like i was telling the other guy the fw4 is a little bit session vape and a little bit on demand vape i got an extra set of capsules this week and i have been using the fw4 as my daily driver for the last few days because of it the high is not as intense as from the mighty but it more than satisfactory but the capsules really help keep me going with the fw4 i just wish the extraction were a little more even with the fw4 the bottom of loads usually get browned or even close to blackened while the top of loads could still be a light golden brown you can mitigate this pretty effectively by only putting in a half load into the capsules for what it worth i do not think i have ever combusted in the fw4 even when the avb is blackened it still feels like the brown avb it does not feel like ash or charcoal does plant matter turn into charcoal by comparison the mighty is the king of efficient extraction avb will be dark brown like tobacco after a session i do not even save the mighty avb because of how spent it looks but the flavor is easier to taste on the fw4 my weed has nearly zero taste for me in the mighty but it tastes so sweet literally sweet like candy just not that sweet and you can also taste the terps really well too the first few hits with the most potent flavor taste like a sweet floral bouquet or something the mighty just tastes like sucking air i really cannot taste much with it at all but the mighty vapor stays really cool where the fw4 can start to get warm hot toward the end of the session i hope i have said something to help you decide because i do not think i will be able to help any further if you told me i could only keep one i am not sure which one i would keep the fw4 feels so much more personal and warm and inviting where the mighty is kind of like this brutalist industrial design the mighty can be had for about 300 with some 4 20 sales but with all the addons i suggest you get for the fw4 strongly encourage anyone to get the extra capsules set and the extra mouthpiece capsule set as well as the cooling unit you are starting to pay close to what you would pay for a mighty replaceable batteries are a huge plus for the fw4 imo really quick and easy to change them when you are in need hmm i dunno what else to talk about but i will answer any other questions you have,2,vaporents
dubblechrubble,the fw4 is great i love its versatility it like a session vape and an on demand vape all in one i sometimes vape larger loads in a full session and sometimes i just vape smaller loads like 50 of the capsule or less and it works well as on demand the capsules are almost essential to get the best experience from this vape otherwise you have to wait for your capsule to cool before you can unload and reload it it really easy to pocket and it really easy to reload when you are out and about without having to worry about making a mess trying to refill a capsule when you are not at home with all your stuff the iq is also an amazing piece but i have not been using it as much lately ever since i have been unable to properly clean between the herb and flavor chambers it been putting off awful smelling and tasting vapor and it gives me a headache to keep vaping whatever is stuck in there if i could do it over again i would have a second flavor chamber and i would rotate the two chambers out frequently so that thc oil does not gunk up the front of the flavor chamber which eventually becomes a gunked up nether region which is incredibly difficult to properly clean aside from that it my favorite session vape yes even moreso than the mighty the small size is incredible and the high is comparable to the mighty not to mention iq has higher temps than mighty so more can be extracted it kinda messy to unload and reload the chamber and there no easy way around this from what i can tell but as small as it is it can easily be carried with a doob tube and an extra battery in a little kit and it just as good on the go i just wish i could clean it so i can use it again because i miss using it so much i hope that answers your questions,2,vaporents

dubblechrubble,using the vapes without any other accessories the mighty for sure but using the iq with a glass spacer and a titanium screen like these http www ebay com itm five count titanium pipe screens lasts longer than brass or stainless steel 351141481582 hash item51c1a9cc6e g sm0aaosw7i5tvpk6 in the herb chamber delivers a pretty comparable high imo the glass spacer provides an additional heated surface and the screen just prevents the air holes from getting clogged so airflow stays consistent and well flowing ,1,vaporents
dubblechrubble,yeah they are pretty cheap for sure i did not know about reducers i only knew about m f adapters to reduce or increase size but this might be a better option going back to the nectar collector on davinci site is there anywhere that sells a 14mm piece like this http www davincivaporizer com nectar collector 10mm female joint tip is that honeybird collector even worth the premium i would be paying or should i just build a collection of the 12 nectar collectors instead ,2,chinaglass

dubblechrubble,thanks for such a rich and informative post ah so the f bomb is another name for this type of hydratube i just had a sudden realization reading your post when you said the nectar collector had a 10mm option the whole reason i went searching for glass was because i found the honeybird nectar collector on davinci website i was not keen on buying a glass piece with 10mm connection since the other vapes i own would end up needing 14mm connections but it just occurred to me that it has a 510 threaded head and the joint connector could potentially be switched from 10mm to 14mm but davinci site is the only place i can seem to find nectar collector joint tips any thoughts on this or is it just not worth it for the price i would be paying i could have at least half a dozen of the nectar collectors you linked hmm i really appreciate all the links you provided but i am sorry to say that i am not that excited about most of them the nectar collectors are interesting for their size and stevenlmz hydratube is actually pretty intriguing as well this bubbler http www dhgate com store product hot sell new 6 arm perc glass percolator 228923897 html is also interesting i suppose these 3 are the best choices from what you have shown me you said more diffusion kills flavor but how can you look at a piece and tell how much diffusion it has by looking at the perculator am i right in assuming that bubbler would diffuse more than the stevenlmz piece you linked thus muting the flavor more thanks,2,chinaglass

dubblechrubble,thanks for the response i have a few more questions now so you are saying these hydratubes do not make much difference to the heat and harshness of the herb it just a fashion accessory more or less why would you want to get rid of taste unless it mostly for the unpleasant taste at higher temps or when the bowl is nearly cashed and when you say best bang for your buck are you referring to the bubblers you prefer could you give me an example thanks,1,chinaglass

dubblechrubble,i do not really have a favorite they each serve different needs the hopper has become my go to piece while on the go vape since it so quick to use the mighty stays at home and is mostly for lazy days when i am doing nothing productive all day fw4 is my wake and bake piece i use it as a nightcap and also when i go on walks through the woods behind my house since it so chill and not overpowering with the high and the iq fills the same role as the mighty except for when i actually need portability like if i am going out and want something more powerful than the hopper or sometimes i use it just as a change of pace from the mighty if i could only keep one i would be torn between the hopper and the mighty iq the high i get from the mighty and iq is comparable and is the best high of all my vapes but being session vapes they are a bit of a time investment to get high the hopper is much quicker and the form is the ultimate in stealth and portability but the high is not as strong but for the time you use it you get higher than you would with the same time period with the mighty iq ,1,vaporents

dubblechrubble,for what it worth cleaning the rest of the vape has been a breeze it just this one spot that is such a pain in the ass that it could be a dealbreaker for me what specifically do you mean when you say you find this happens to conduction vapes tough to reach areas ,1,vaporents

dubblechrubble,for some reason it never occurred to me to use a dab tool although i do havev some other skinny tools like it i guess i could give that a shot and see how well it works as for regular cleaning i agree this is my 3rd cleaning session after about 20 hours of usage according to the davinci app that why it such a big deal to me that i get this thing actually clean instead of just leaving stuff behind that will only get harder to clean in the future i did not use the light to check for vapor with the first two cleaning sessions i wonder if this thing has been there since the beginning it possible i have never cleaned this spot in the past,1,vaporents
dubblechrubble, you talking about right here where the arrow touches http i imgur com pbcho0s jpg i know it not very visible in the video but with the light behind it i can see a pretty noticeable and steady stream of vapor coming from behind the gasket at the bottom there if there vapor coming from anywhere else it not very noticeable because this mystery vapor producer is putting off a significant amount of vapor i just ran a sewing needle around the areas you mentioned and there as nothing on it when i brought it back i really need help getting to that area beyond the gasket,1,vaporents

dubblechrubble,i have some herb or some resin in the area between the two chambers that i cannot get out any ideas no matter how many qtips i run through there i cannot get it clean i think it the underside of the gasket that the flavor chamber rests on when i do burnoffs i can see it producing vapor ,1,vaporents

dubblechrubble,i have never heard complaints of that nature with wood units so i was just trying to hear what the criticisms were was it addressed specifically toward log vapes or toward any wood vapes in general personally i find that the fw4 is pretty damn comfortable to hold the wood makes it feel so warm and charming i actually i have a ton of praise to give the fw4 i could go on and on with what i like about it but i will just share what i am not a huge fan of the biggest thing i do not like about the fw4 is the work involved in reloading a capsule if you do get a firewood be sure to get the capsules set as well this way you can just reload all the capsules at once and then you wo not have to deal with them for a little bit i wish there was any way to streamline this process maybe the fw5 and the other thing is you can combust on the higher temps if you are not careful but a little practice can minimize this although i have to admit that i am still practicing lol but it pretty idiot proof at the lower temp settings the unit can get a little warm if you are hitting it like a champ and in one spot in particular but if you are only using it solo i would not expect that to be a big issue i am willing to answer any other questions you have about the firewood,1,vaporents

dubblechrubble,hey thanks for the update message sorry to hear things did not get better though i think i was asking for an update at the time because i was in the market for a vape and i did ultimately buy the iq i even got spooked by all the reports of failure and so i did a survey to try and see what the likelihood was of my iq failing but there were not enough responses to make an informed opinion and so the whole project was a bit of a letdown the pearl post breaking was one of the most commonly reported issues with the iq i wonder why the post is made from the same material as the pearl and why not make it metal or ceramic like the rest of the area around the herb chamber the pearl is a good idea on paper but does not seem to be very well executed i urge everyone to not play with it because of how fragile it is sorry i was not able to pass the word on to you in time frient and sorry you are having an awful experience with them ,1,vaporents
dubblechrubble,i just conducted a survey to find just exactly this my results were disappointing and i also had too small a sample size to get any realistic idea of the failure rate 33 of respondents said they had issues with their iq 18 total responses out of 54 i had a brief chat with someone from puffitup and they said their return rate on the iq was way lower than what my survey showed although they did not share the exact return rate with considering my survey what piu experience is and judging by the amount of problem posts on here or on fc i would estimate the failure rate to be low posts of problem units are very infrequent maybe 2 or 3 per month outraged customers having to jump through hoops to deal with customer service represent a larger percentage of the iq posts and i think leads to a frequency bias but their complaints are legit and i hope it does not sound like i am minimizing them having to use any channel available to contact them email facebook phone and still being given the run around and told to wait or not told to wait but still having to wait to make matters worse one user on fc said they told him that they like to give special care and service to end users who purchased directly through their site that seems way disrespectful to all your customers as if ignoring your customers and taking your sweet time to respond was respectful with that said the iq definitely is worth it when it works but seeing as how big a struggle communicating with cs is i would not get one unless you had a backup vape and for what it worth there are stories of people getting through the warranty system with relative ease so maybe they are getting better who knows ,2,vaporents

dubblechrubble,i am really excited at the idea of surveying your customers but given how poorly this poll fared and the grasshopper one is not shaping up to be much better after looking at the results more closely i have become a bit disheartened with the whole project at least there would be more data points to look at but i am still hesitant to spend more time working on this with that said i am not opposed to the idea i am just reluctant would you be interested in a general survey asking what failed on any given vaporizer or only for the iq your sales data could have some interesting information too but i am not sure how willing you are to share any specifics although you saying that the return rate on the iq has been low was kinda what i was anticipating to see from the poll since we only see about 1 post every couple of weeks or so complaining of a broken iq i will give it some thought but right now i do not want to think about my surveys any more than i have to thanks for the offer though that really cool of you ,1,vaporents

dubblechrubble, my biggest issue with the vape is the little nether region between the herb chamber and flavor chamber i keep getting small herb particles in there and they collect and grow over time eventually this little cyst will ruin the taste and flavor of every load you vape so you need to be sure to clean this area pretty frequently like every dozen loads or so i have a screen in the bottom of the herb chamber and that helps a ton but it does not eliminate the problem completely just increases the time before it becomes a problem have you experienced anything like this too or what are your cleaning habits like and i totally agree the app definitely needs some work i personally have not had it crash on me but then again i barely use it most of the reviews on play store say they get frequent crashes so it probably a legit issue i set some smart paths during one session and i have not opened the app since this is probably in the 15 20 minutes i spent with the app here are the issues i faced 1 setting the smart paths is a painful and tedious process especially if you want to precisely fine tune your vaping experience ie you want to be on very specific temps you can move the sliders left and right and try to get where you want or you can take your chances with the graph section itself and hope that you can get close enough to where you want it so that you can finish fine tuning it with the slider bars some 1 and 1 buttons would make this easier or the ability to input temperature or time numbers directly would probably be the best solution 2 speaking of using smart paths for very specific temps whatever setting i create in the app will be about 2f degrees off from what i chose so if i set 390 the iq will display 388 for example i am not sure if the app is the problem or the iq display leds and so i am not all that comfortable letting smart paths take over and i will just use precision temp control with the side buttons on the iq 3 the way the smart paths work is a bit different than how i was led to believe in the reviews and in the manual i want to sit at one temp for a minute or two then move up to another temp for a min or so and so on until i have been at 3 or 4 different temps smart paths do not exactly do this if you set 2 temperatures it wants to gradually increase temperature until it reaches the target temperature at the target time you can kinda skirt this by creating 2 points of the same temperature spaced by the duration you want to be there and then set the 3rd temperature at the next temperature you want to be at but then you are stuck at that 3rd temperature for the remainder of the smart path that all complicated and fine tuning it to do what i want to do is a pain in the ass so i just set each smart path to sit at only one of each of my intended target temperatures then when i am vaping i can just turn on smart path 1 vape a bit then move to smart path 2 it easier than trying to scan through the range of temps to get the one i want but given the 2 complaint i just gave here the temps are not the same on the app as on the vape so i have even stopped using this little system and i just use the up down buttons to get the temps i want smart paths are cool in concept but are not powerful enough for me to automate my session whoa that got really ranty the smart paths and the app are not really that bad and i am only fussing about this stuff because so much else about this vape is done well i just thought i would take the opportunity to share a bit but i might have one upped the op with wall of text so i will just say sorry ,1,vaporents

dubblechrubble, here you go http imgur com a iogfo 4pc space case on the left 2pc spacecase in the middle and mffb on the right the amounts are not the same so do not judge the volume just the consistency of the grind with the 4pc i did not turn it upside down that just a normal grind with the 2pc i think there is definitely a limit to how fine a grind you can make after you have ground up your cannabis you can turn the grinder sideways to push all the ground herb to one side and continually grind it that helps a little bit but there definitely a point where your effort is not yielding any finer of a grind i kept cranking the grinder until there was very little resistance even on its side as you can see it indeed finer than the 4pc but not that much and then the mffb turns your ganj to dust i totally get where you are coming from with the quality complaints in my first 8 or 10 years of smoking i balked at the price of a space case but after owning cheapo grinders that broke on me in one way or another i said screw it and splurged on the space case i have used it for 13 years now well except for recently when i switched to vaping,2,vaporents
dubblechrubble,sorry to be the bearer of bad news frient for what it worth the space case without a doubt gives a finer grind than my 4 piece space case and from the sound of things probably finer than the 4pc scs you had i really just want to experiment with grinds inbetween the two grinders because it still feels too coarse with the space case and too fine with the mffg i can take some photos of the consistency of the grind in a little bit if you are interested and yeah i only use the mffg after running the herb through the 2pc space case first ,1,vaporents
dubblechrubble,i have one i am looking for a grinder,1,vaporents
dubblechrubble,638 thank you for this opportunity ,1,puffitup
dubblechrubble,i actually have a 4 piece space case that i did not mention in the op but i initially was using it upside down but it starting to gunk up really quickly so i bought the 2 piece space case which performs better than the upside down 4 yiece one i am on board with getting an scs but i am not really excited about using it upside down could i just get a 2 piece scs instead ,1,vaporents
dubblechrubble,i just took a quick look around the web and the mini mendos are hard to find did they only do a limited run of them or discontinue that line would just a small mendo work instead you think i am not sure how the grind consistency changes with different sized grinders or if there any change at all,2,vaporents
dubblechrubble,i heard the same advice for the vapes but i find that the magic flight grinder grinds fine enough that material comes all the way through the vape edit oops i mean the iq here that why i am trying to increase coarseness just a little for that one and if i can slightly reduce the coarseness for the firewood sake thanks for the rec on the mendo mulcher i will look into it a bit before i commit but i appreciate the suggestion,3,vaporents

dubblechrubble,i am starting to really wish i asked about the difficulty in dealing with customer service in my survey sorry vapor ents just from the responses i have so far the failure rate seems low but in the event you do have a problem unit it sounds like it going to be hell dealing with davinci maybe i will do another poll to ask this info as well to see just how bad it is but it probably too late to add to the current poll or should i add it anyways and just let the remaining users fill it out ,8,vaporents
dubblechrubble,i will make a new post here maybe next weekend i am going to wait a few more days for responses and once they stop trickling in then i will submit something later in the week i can ping you when i submit it if you would like ,1,vaporents
dubblechrubble,man you know i was debating including the time it took to deal with the customer service that why i was so specific with the turnaround time question that it only included the time you sent the vape to the time you received the replacement because i was thinking i would leave room to ask how long it took from the day the vape broke to the time the user had to mail it off it would have certainly given us an idea of what people have to deal with when their iqs do fail i am afraid i do not even have a good reason for omitting it and now that i hear your feedback i wish i had not decided against it sorry if it any consolation i probably would not have had enough data to make any conclusions about the time it takes to deal with customer service only 13 people have reported sending in a unit for repair not sure if that a big enough sample size to make any determinations although we would certainly have an idea of just how bad that side of things would be again sorry for that ,1,davincivaporizer

dubblechrubble,no sweat i should have explained that most questions were optional especially since others have made this point to me as well i have edited the question to include if applicable to the end hopefully this will prevent any future confusion the only reason i asked that was to see if different batches had differing levels of failure rates ,1,vaporents
dubblechrubble,i am most annoyed by how the long press delay does not work anymore i usually have it set to 200ms because it does not get any quicker than that but no changing of the setting with the latest versions has any impact other things that bug me when i try to swype an emoji like i want that to come up first i do not need to see the the android emojis just use the tracing tech to realize i do not actually mean lucky or kjellberg kjellberg really punctuation gestures swiping from to spacebar for example are activated so infrequently as well there other issues that i cannot recall at the moment each of them individually would have been just a minor inconvenience but all of the problems together severely impact my speed and efficiency with the keyboard very frustrating and annoying to have to fight with your keyboard to have it do what you want to do especially when it was relatively effortless before,3,androidapps
dubblechrubble,i am getting a lot of responses to the grasshopper survey so i am optimistic we will have some meaningful data ,2,GrassHopperVape
dubblechrubble,the january 25 update broke a lot of the app and there was even a january 26 hotfix which apparently did not fix much and certainly did not fix enough i rolled back the version to one that was released in july of last year their most recent update before the january one and i have been quite pleased with it but the update is so bad that if i did not have a backup available i would use a different keyboard and that coming from a die hard swype fan who has used it nearly exclusively since 2011 the latest update is seriously bad and i cannot believe they have gone almost a month and have not released a fix yet,12,androidapps
dubblechrubble,thanks for the feedback but i actually was aware of this it just the best way i could think of to see if later batches had lower rates of failure but i fear my sample size will not be large enough to make any conclusions about this aspect of the poll so it not a big deal in fact the primary purpose of this poll is to find out how many people have working hoppers vs the number of units that had to be repaired or replaced anything else that can be gained or gleaned is just a bonus that why i made every question optional to answer except for how long have you owned the vape and has the vape required warranty repairs replacement i am hoping i gave enough care to this poll ahead of time that the questions i do have wo not be a waste of the community time to answer and a waste of my time trying to make sense of the answers ,1,GrassHopperVape

dubblechrubble,oh man so you think the cracks in the herb chamber were not really cracks i saw some posts around here saying they had the same thing when i was shown this by a friend i looked in my herb chamber and saw 2 dark lines where the cracks were in other people photos you can kinda see them here http m imgur com a ib84u i thought it was just part of the heating element and that the stress from heating and cooling that specific spot on the ceramic weakened it but so it nice to hear that they may not have been cracks after all but the reason i asked about these lines you mentioned is because there a vertical scratch on the mouthpiece that i just noticed earlier this week after a month of owning the iq if you remove your mouthpiece and the rubber grommet with it i have a silver scratch between here the rubber connects to the hinged mouthpiece holder it not serious but i do not think i did that so i was just wondering if it was there on others too,1,vaporents
dubblechrubble,man did not you just post about receiving your pax back from warranty you are just not having great luck these days are you at least all of them are home again that must be a nice feeling for 2 that my experience as well i have not broken the pearl post yet but i realized how delicate it feels and so i retracted it and i do not touch it anymore the glass spacers from davinci are nice in this respect i put the spacer between the herb and the pearl so the pearl stays clean throughout usage also they are much better at reducing the chamber load as for 3 you did not really talk about this much but what lines are you talking about that you mistook for cracks and it interesting to hear about the dffference in build qualities i wonder if they sourced a new manufacturer or if they are just getting better at making them ,1,vaporents

dubblechrubble,ok i just had a thought what is the best way to ask how long someone has owned their vapes i am wanting a solution that can easily be turned into visualized data my options are to ask for the date it arrived but this seems like more effort i could ask how many weeks or months they have had it which is less precise but would be easier to turn into a graph i also could just leave it as an open field but then i d probably have more work than just asking the date since people could give their answers in days months or weeks and i am not sure how to normalize that with relative ease any ideas on this front ,1,vaporents

dubblechrubble,hey folks i was just trying to get an idea of how widespread the issues are with the grasshopper and the davinci iq too i suspect the people having issues are more vocal than those who have no issues at all and so i was trying to gauge just how bad the failure rate is it would help people who were looking to buy a grasshopper to better understand the associated risk of having to rma the vape and could also let current owners of the hopper get a better understanding of how likely or unlikely it is that their gh will fail on them but so i am asking the community to help me with what questions to ask so we can all have a good understanding of what going on you can comment here or in the ve thread either is fine thanks for any input you are willing to give me ,6,GrassHopperVape

dubblechrubble,oh hey sorry to keep blowing up your inbox lol your comment here gave me a thought when you said reverse hat screen in an earlier post did you mean to put the screen hat upside down in the chamber so that it does not contour with the edge of the chamber here an impressive drawing http i imgur com flerckn png i made showing what i mean that just the herb chamber as if it were being loaded so the iq is upside down etc this way it would leave a space under the screen further shrinking the herb chamber is that what you meant to begin with because i like this idea at least it worth trying lol and so you are thinking of putting a flat mesh screen under this as well is that right ,2,vaporents
dubblechrubble,hey thanks for chiming in i just started vaping a couple weeks ago and i m still experimenting with my grind i had not considered the idea of putting two different grinds in but that seems like a really good idea i still need to research grinders though i am just getting by with my 2 and 4 piece space cases you guys seem really creative in your solutions though i will have to try some of these options for sure i have some screens from an fw4 you think they would be worthwhile to stick in there or should i just get something like a milaana screen ,1,vaporents

dubblechrubble,i assumed the chart was a general reference chart and that it would apply to any vaporizer despite it being named volcano temp chart seems weird to draw attention to toxic vapor from a specific vape but not mention the vape i would like to know about this if you or anyone else knows more that they can share i was just explaining in another post that i find i get higher if i vape my weed through a wider range of temps but you say you can extract everything at once with the volcano in my short time with vapes i find that i am left wanting more if i only vape at higher temps maybe this is due to the difference in performance of a portable vape vs a volcano part of the motivation for posting were was to determine if i was still getting benefits of lower temp stuff if i just start vaping at a higher temperature if you can share a bit more here of your experiences i would really appreciate it thanks ,1,vaporents
dubblechrubble,ah makes sense i guess the wording just threw me off thanks,1,vaporents
dubblechrubble,hey thanks for responding ok so for most of these you have done a pretty good job of explaining enough to where i am satisfied but i do have a few follow up questions 1 what i ultimately meant was why are edible temps on a vaporization chart is decarboxylation considering vaporizing maybe it just an alternate to smoking temps despite the name 2 it never occurred to me to check the boiling temps of these compounds on my own but thanks for the idea yeah melting point is quite different than boiling point but the others seem to be on point it just confusing that they have edibles temps and vaporizing temps together 3 nothing to say here just wanted to say i never saw the word vapor in evaporate before but how cool 7 oh is yellow typically hotter i was using the light spectrum to determine that red was the hottest visible color but in fact i have it backwards red is the coolest color so i surely misinterpreted this lol 8 ah so you are saying that the thinner wispier parts of the weed will combust more easily is that what you mean by low enough auto ignition points i do not really know what else to ask right now but thanks replying also i did not mean to make anyone google for my answers so thanks for your effort here edit i lied i do know what else to ask what compelled me to make this post is because i have been experimenting with vaping a load at multiple temperatures starting low then going high i find my high is much more pronounced doing this and i was wondering the reasoning behind this it makes me feel like if i start at a high temperature that i am not getting many of the benefits of the lower temperatures is there truth to that or what could be the reasoning behind it ultimately i just want to better understand how cannabis is affected by temperatures and how to best deliver a dose so to speak ,1,vaporents
dubblechrubble,i am pretty new to vaping too and you are right that the high is different but what i have discovered is you get the fullest and richest high if you vape your weed through several temperatures https www reddit com r vaporents comments 5suv9h tailoring your high by temperature st izajz31s sh 36fb4fc2 before finishing with it at max heat if that your thing i typically start at about 310f take a few puffs move it up to 350f take a few more then finish out at 390 i am not a fan of the taste after 390 so i stop there but people routinely vape at 430 or 450 without issue if i am not mistaken the pax has an app you can use to set the temperature settings so maybe try changing the temp settings to give you a wider range of temps to vape from maybe 20f increments would be convenient you say you use 50 and 100 but i am assuming you are just using the default temp settings when you do this try to experiment with this some i think it could help edit quick look around the web makes it seem like the lowest temp on the pax is 360f so definitely try 360 then maybe 390 and then maybe max temp i dunno but i would definitely have an entry at 360 and around 390 some experimenting might be in order so you can see what the other two temperatures should be this is officially scientific research now so start vaping in the name of science ,1,vaporents

dubblechrubble,oh good tip with the qtips i tried just using the included brush after it had been dipped in alcohol and i thought i did a pretty good job of cleaning it but after like 2 sessions the tip of the flavor chamber is gunked up enough that it now sticks to the inside of the iq also i cleaned the vape so it would be ready for a new strain of weed i picked up so maybe the new strain puts off heavier vapor as for reverse hat screen i am totally lost i am guessing it a screen that is already shaped to resemble a hat presumably is this something that one would buy or would you have to take a flat screen and shape it yourself this seems like a nice solution but it just gave me an idea i have heard some people suggest using the glass spacer or organic cotton in the chamber so you would not have to put a full load in i am wondering if it would be feasible to just put cotton swabs in the chamber then follow it with herb so that the cotton would act as a filter or when people suggest using cotton as a spacer do they mean to put it in after the herb so that the cotton would be between the herb and the pearl ,2,vaporents

dubblechrubble,yeah i know i was having trouble deciding on the two i actually had my heart set on the fw4 but i was mistakenly under the impression that it took weeks to get new stock on the site most of the posts i saw were several months old and the prevailing wisdom was to get on the waitlist i learned there was stock on the site literally the day before i asked about it on this sub which was kind of a bummer so i resigned myself to the iq instead since i figured it would be a long time before the fw4 came back the iq had not even arrived yet and more fw4 came in stock so i said f it and just got it too to answer your second question it mostly because i just transitioned from smoking and i always smoked outside never inside so it just a habit that i carried over it a long story but my circumstances led me to need more light discipline when smoking the results i got from searching google or asking the community about stealth lighters were not inspiring at all so someone said why not vaping and so here i am i am still not real keen on partaking inside yet but maybe down the road i will be more open to the idea ,1,vaporents
dubblechrubble,yeah that definitely a bummer that it not getting more attention luckily this community knows about the fw4 and does a good job of hyping users up for it as that precisely what happened to me last week i am new here only been a couple weeks already own an iq and fw4 i have been really pleased with both of them and i really am excited to hear that the fw4 is one of the best portables at the moment this is something i have no frame of reference for and since it not getting reviewed by some of the bigger guys all i really have is the opinion of redditors to go by so thanks for yours,1,vaporents
dubblechrubble,oh man i love how the two are different from each other one feels heavily engineered and industrial with finer temperature control while the other feels more warm friendly charming welcoming etc with a kinda laid back whatever happens happens kinda vibe from the less specific temp control they are my only two vapes so far but i do like how they each bring something different to the table that was part of the purchasing decision in fact do you have other vapes maybe i could see how the iq might not seem as essential if you had other vapes that filled a similar role as it does on the subject of similar roles is it bad that i have been in the community for 2 weeks and i have already purchased 2 vapes for different purposes lol no one told me vas was so contagious ,3,vaporents
dubblechrubble,what do you mean by underrated because i have noticed there is a relative lack of fw4 reviews around the web i am pretty new to the community but is it because the fw4 is pretty new and also because supply slowly trickles in every so often i was curious why there was not much press on the fw4 maybe it just not hitting people radar ,1,vaporents

dubblechrubble, the fw4 continues to buzz occasionally while on and i have yet to determine what the buzzes mean definitively but i usually pause a little after each buzz and let the capsule heat up again whether there a rhyme or reason to that i do not know but it seems to be working thank goodness mine does this too i was wondering if it was a bug in the system but maybe it does mean that the heating element has cooled too much it just unnerving a bit since the manual says the first vibration indicates the fw4 knows that air is being drawn and to start heating up makes me worry that the sensor thinks i am not drawing the entire time,1,vaporents

dubblechrubble, you will be very happy with your iq that the plan lol it will be here tomorrow and your experience with these guys i am already cannot wait to see and use the vape though their cs rep here has been hyping up the iq in chat with me and that making the wait even harder lol poor me but thanks for chiming in it nice to see such good relations between businesses ,5,puffitup
dubblechrubble,marc said more will be online tonight i cannot wait lol thanks for chatting me up and helping the past couple days,1,vaporents
dubblechrubble,you have options check it out,1,pcgaming
dubblechrubble,and then use steam inventory helper to list them on the market all at once with just a few clicks ,3,pcgaming
dubblechrubble,yeah i am hearing from several people that i have just missed a batch by a day or so hopefully there will be more coming soon i am really excited about this vape as i suspect you are were judging by your title here,2,vaporents
dubblechrubble,oh the two i mentioned were just the first two that came to my mind that had batteries yeah i am pretty reviewed out at this point i think i have enough information to make a decision but i am just still hesitant to commit to any one there no perfect vape from what i have seen with each of them i will end up making some small sacrifice here or there i just do not know what inconvenience would be the best to deal with ,1,vaporents
dubblechrubble,yeah someone else just informed me that i missed my chance by just a day bummer i will keep an eye out though thanks for replying,2,vaporents
dubblechrubble,wow that prompt service your reputation really does precede you but i was not expecting this level of customer service lol pm inbound,5,puffitup
dubblechrubble,lol i cannot believe i missed the wax buff model by just a day i have already emailed the guy so i definitely have my heart set on that but since i am not officially committed to it let keep this going and so you have made a convincing argument for replaceable batteries is there anything like the crafty that has replaceable batteries maybe the cf hybrid or davinci iq i had not really given much thought to battery operated vapes so i will have to go back and redefine my standards since this is a pretty compelling reason to consider ones that use batteries ,1,vaporents
dubblechrubble,how long ago did you order i am in the market and trying to gauge if i should wait for the next batch of these or go for something a little more mass produced,1,vaporents
dubblechrubble,oh sorry i did not see the sources post thanks for that those maine guys have it made ,1,trees
dubblechrubble,what is so unique about maine laws ,3,trees
dubblechrubble,so i briefly looked up the firewood 4 and i see it out of stock and i also see this post https www reddit com r vaporents comments 5ckhxf where can you buy a firewood 4 online describing how it a one man operation and they are all hand crafted and how stock only comes back in every few weeks do you know anything about the next batch of firewood 4 units coming or is this something i should just email the guy about but reading about the firewood i do think i want to commit to this one it seems like it is pretty low maintenance and easy to use the quality of the crafty is totally what i want but one thing that makes me hesitate on it is that it seems to require a certain ritual to use it and if i am spending that kind of money i would prefer it to be as idiot proof as possible just load the oven and get to vapin that kind of stuff ,1,vaporents
dubblechrubble,i do not see any cases on the davinci site only their vapes and accessories for their vapes and some clothing stuff little help here ,1,vaporents
dubblechrubble,any more update ,1,vaporents
dubblechrubble,do you use the little herb loader for the crafty that process seems a bit high maintenance to me is it necessary to get a good pack load or can i just pour loose herb in there ,1,vaporents
dubblechrubble, sure there is a warranty but who wants to mess with shipping and waiting you sound like a r buyitforlife member they value quality craftsmanship over generous warranties which i also agree with how big of a deal is removeable batteries is it mostly so you can keep vaping on the go without having to stop and recharge i will probably be home most of the time and when i do use the vape out and about i would probably only use it sparingly so i am not expecting to be to be needing extra batteries to keep my sessions going any other benefit to the removeable battery firewood 4 is intriguing especially for its price i will have to look at it more later i am a little busy this afternoon but thanks for the input ,2,vaporents
dubblechrubble,hmm that sounds a lot like special technique to me and something that i know i do not want to deal with i think the gh might be off the table especially as others have recommended using it with glass too and i am not going to bother with additional glass at least not initially ,1,vaporents
dubblechrubble,you seem pretty knowledgable so let me ask this with many of these vapes they say it recommended to vape everything in the ovens my current smoking habit is pretty minimal i take maybe one or two hits in a span of a couple minutes and then go about my business and then i will do this again every hour to 90 minutes to maintain my high in the evening i am assuming that my habits are going to change with a vape is puffing away for 5 10 minutes straight going to make me obscenely high or is this what it takes to get a satisfactory high could i potenntially just do a half load in the crafty so that i do not feel obligated to clear it maybe this is something better suited for its own post but i think there still a lot i do not know that i am trying to account for before committing to a major purchase like the crafty or any of the vapes really do not want to get stuck with a dud or with one that does not actually fit me as well as i thought you know ,1,vaporents
dubblechrubble,it really seems promising but what are is your opinion on the hot mouthpiece debate i see some people say it not a big deal and others say it a deal breaker i will be by myself so it probably only going to be hit a few times per session would that still be enough to make the mouthpiece uncomfortably hot ,1,vaporents
dubblechrubble,yeah the crafty is one i might be willing to spend more on and it good to hear it gives a solid high it also does not seem as large as i thought maybe i was looking at a mighty instead i am still a bit hesistant on it though can you comment on how long it takes to get heated i could not find that in the couple reviews i looked at i did not mention it originally but i would also like to ideally have a vape heat within a minute or two and then i can vape and have a complete sesh in about 5 minutes or no more than 10 minutes if possible ,1,vaporents
dubblechrubble,i see no offense but you did not do a very good job of articulating that something like this would have driven the point a little better that alarmist trash half a million americans died in a bloody war and here we have attorneys sitting in airports working pro bono you cannot compare this although you are comparing a full fledged war and the bloodiest battle from that war to a pre war period where tensions are rising and most of the country is retreating into their ideological camps i think that all the guy was saying,2,LosAngeles
dubblechrubble,i am not sure what relevance how and where your ancestor died has on your argument it kinda just there ,29,LosAngeles
dubblechrubble, some people just prefer the old school feel of smoking that probably what it is they probably just are set in their ways i know a guy who been smoking for 30 years and he will only smoke joints i have all these nice glass pieces and i offer to smoke with him but he says he will only smoke joints it does not matter that i tell him that it gives him a better high or that it conserves pot compared to rolling a joint every time you want to smoke seriously this guy does not even put out his j and smoke the rest of it later some people are happy with how things are and no amount of showing how green the grass is on the other side will convince them ,5,vaporents
dubblechrubble,what are you using now ,1,vaporents
dubblechrubble,i have done similar i put up my hood to hide light going behind me then i put my bowl and my face in the wheel well of my car to prevent light from dissipating in front of me it makes me feel pathetic though,1,trees
dubblechrubble,yeah it sucks i am in maryland we only recently decrim would amounts under 10g that about as progressive as it gets paraphernalia is still illegal so get caught with a quarter and a bowl you will get a fine for the quarter and arrested for the bowl not sure what the laws are on actually smoking though but anyways even if what i am doing is illegal is trespassing and messing with my stuff an appropriate response maybe they know i have no recourse with the police so they just do whatever they want to me i dunno but it does suck quite a bit ,1,trees
dubblechrubble,i appreciate the tip at the end it something that i have discovered on my own but i still appreciate the effort thanks for namedropping that sub too i will take a look over at the other sub and see what the consensus is for vapes i think the best thing about this post is you and other users have directed me to other subs that could help me better you guys are alright lol ,1,trees
dubblechrubble,can you tell me more about a shield is it just a light shield and thanks for the sub rec i will take a look and ask them,1,trees
dubblechrubble,lol they never confront me they just watch me from their homes some of them are blatant about it like standing in front of a glass door all creepy like staring out into my yard i used to keep my bowl outside just to minimize the smell in my house but i have noticed the bowl has been moved a couple times so i am assuming my neighbors are going into my yard and tampering with it so i have stopped leaving anything outside of course but it a real oppressive environment and i have even considered quitting just for the sake of not dealing with these asshole neighbors ,1,trees
dubblechrubble,i have considered a vape but i am just worried about the quality of the high from it i have an mflb and it is not my cup of tea at all i suspect it my tolerance that ultimately leads me to not liking the mflb but i have also considered that maybe i simply do not like vaping or maybe the heating element was not heating evenly but maybe there a modern vape pen that can handle flowers instead of concentrates i honestly have not given serious consideration to a vape pen but i suppose i should not leave anything off the table when looking for stealth aside from mflb and pax any other recommendations i have heard of the arizer solo and arizer air and some of the atmos pens but i guess i will have to start researching this a bit thanks for this suggestion and i am never confronted by them which is fine i suppose so i never have to explain myself but it also really passive aggressive and creepy to see them peering through the windows when i go back in from a smoke ,1,trees

dubblechrubble, i am 23 when obama was elected eight years ago he seemed a giant now he seems a mouse can you elaborate a little bit i think it important to know what you were like as a 15 year old to know what kind of perspective you had at the time a lot of people saw him that way myself included i was about your age when he was elected and i only knew of the immense amounts of energy surrounding his campaign i also was really excited at the prospect of a black president i am saying this as a white guy if it makes any difference when i was 15 clinton was running against dole and i supported clinton because he was the incumbent when i was 10 i wanted bust to win against clinton for the same reason i just assume that all kids were as politically ignorant as i was but that also why i am interested to hear more about what made you think what you did thanks ,16,WayOfTheBern

dubblechrubble,you are right i should have voted hillary like the 1 7m whose hillary vote totally counts oh and my state voted more than 60 dem my bernie vote did nothing to affect the outcome but continue to blame others on the left i am sure we will all want to unite behind the a political machine that failed hillary twice and then blamed us for it yep 2016 repeat in 2020 here we come ,0,politics
dubblechrubble,fans of the establishment trying to further drive a wedge between liberals and progressives so they can repeat the 2016 election in 2020,3,politics
dubblechrubble,hi bernie voter here in a non swing state that has overwhelmingly voted democrat in the last 30 years my state went to hillary and i did not have to compromise my morals by voting for an unethical candidate tell me again about how it my fault that your side lost it was not my obligation to vote against trump it was your responsibility to convince me to vote hillary but you did not and you further entrench yourself in this position so much for stronger together eh lol you know what guy maybe instead of drawing a line in the sand and dividing liberals you should try to rally us together or else 2020 might look like 2 weeks ago with you having everyone in the world to blame but yourself,3,politics
dubblechrubble,this guy gets it i did not have a voice in my state unless my voice was hillary for president so whoever my vote was for meant nothing and i knew it even before the election ,1,AskReddit
dubblechrubble,it turned out fine my state did what they were supposed to and i did not have to vote for a criminal or a megalomaniac turns out i can depend on my community to do what is right what is everyone else excuse ,1,AskReddit
dubblechrubble,they did not my state voted just as i said they would thanks for your concern ,1,AskReddit
dubblechrubble,living in a non swing state that is already historically democrat i am comfortable writing in bernie name i am confident my state will vote hillary who i am actually ok with but i still get the satisfaction of not compromising my vote ,9,AskReddit
