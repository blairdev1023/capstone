DWShimoda, insane makes one wonder what sort of notch count the chads must be piling up depends on what they are counting as a notch does a quickie bj in the bathroom by a waitress count does it count the same as banging the grocery checkout chick back in the storeroom is even that the same as a ons and while i am saying that in a sarcastic joking manner in many cases its probably not far from the truth and may even be short of the mark now exactly what value one ascribes to such anonymous quasi sexual encounters with strangers which may not even result in orgasm for the guy imo it sort of akin to the pathetic kind of addiction similar to the alcoholic that takes or worse needs to take a quick swig from some hip flask and thinks that is somehow the equivalent of someone else enjoying a nice glass or bottle of wine on the veranda of a beach house ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, fucking gross i think a gross is actually 144 which is probably her true count if you include the quickie bj etc ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, you could eliminate easily 60 of the jobs at any major corporation but they cannot because those positions are all women a large portion of those jobs really only exist because of one or more regulatory compliance requirements or else other government programs often due to machinations documentation etc around various tax credits deductions eliminate those regulations and or alter the specific taxation systems and the value of need for many if not all of those jobs personnel just abracadabra magically disappears value in this case not having anything to do with increasing actual production but meaning literally that the company either recoups in terms of reduced taxes multiple times the paper pusher compliance personnel costs or else they are mitigating reducing other potential costs ie guarding against potential fines lawsuits other liabilities etc there are a whole shitload of very wasteful things that are due to this per example all of the paperwork and obfuscatory bullshit connected with the double irish with a dutch sandwich http www investopedia com terms d double irish with a dutch sandwich asp multinational corporate structure tax avoidance schemes all of which is little more than paper pushing and record keeping accounting book cooking shenanigans ,2,MGTOW
DWShimoda,i think it a matter of perspective and again as i noted exactly what one means when saying dark age or the spin interpretation someone thinks it means when reading it if one means age of obscurity ie lack of records of who what authority was in charge from when to when of what territories with what borders etc well that casts an altogether different meaning to dark age than the common and i think mistaken interpretation that dark age meant something akin to age of stupidity ignorance i can easily see people in the future and perhaps some already are mis re interpreting the information age and thus the decades century or more prior to it as being an age of ignorance as if somehow before the internet information as such was somehow non existent the south park phrase the before time the long long ago http www urbandictionary com define php term the 20before 20time joke is sort of a predictor of this as is the penchant for us old farts to jokingly make exaggerated satirical claims that yeah we had to carve our school assignments in stone with chisels etc it also probably depends on one position in time to wit for someone who was born and lived in the decades few centuries prior to the so called renaissance well for them the dark ages past era of obscurity would have been the roman greek eras because at that point in time the records aristotle plato homeric myths etc from those prior eras had not yet been recovered much less translated published discussed etc ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda,in some senses a big part of the problem with people perceptions is a result of misinterpreting terminology per example the so called dark ages that phrase has taken on an entirely different connotation in the latter half of the industrial modern era than it meant when it was first coined the original meaning or connotation of the dark was not evil or ignorance but rather obscurity obfuscation relative to a lack of record keeping per example there is the saeculum obscurum century of obscurity regarding papal records during the 10th century chiefly because there was a regime change or a series of them that sort of messed up the prior order of things and was not maintained or kept track of in the regime that eventually came out of it that era then subsequently 20 20 hindsight history revision writing whatever you want to call it got referred to as a dark era age with the dark referring merely to the fact that adequate records did not exist to shed light on what had happened history by definition is always written after the fact and most often is rewritten and re envisioned aka re vision in a manner that fits and aligns with the abstract narrative and arguably mythological propagandistic view of the world that the new regime wants to propogate subsequent generations of people then do their own re visions of the prior eras sometimes because additional information records have come to light and are of sufficient significance that they alter the way that past is viewed talked about other times the revision happens because of the opposite fewer records continue to exist ravages of time tend to do that so the ones that have been lost are later dismissed as having never really existed and a new version of events is created that fits with the ones that remain a specific example then is articles like the following the dark ages were a lot brighter than we give them credit for http www independent co uk voices our voices battle of ideas the dark ages were a lot brighter than we give them credit for 8215395 html which then corrects the mistake of the term even though of course the term itself was not a mistake it the mis interpretation and inappropriate connotations that were ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, that assuming money does not loose all value and a complete collapse doesnt occur well one should not merely save up money but rather invest in resources and actual capital things that have real world utility value that is not dependent upon the mere market price that third parties set despite the myths societies civilizations almost never completely collapse the organizational structures governmental legal order etc may collapse and disappear but at least some and in many cases even the majority of the underlying societal assets still remain in place to wit even with the collapse of the roman empire well especially outside of rome itself a significant part of the real world capital assets of that empire remained the roads the bridges the aqueducts and even a wide array of machinery such as it was at the time including things like grain grist mills granaries etc continued to exist and operate in provincial cities around europe all that changed in many cases was the ostensible ownership of those things ,3,MGTOW
DWShimoda, almost none of them actually have any real power this just as virtually none of them do any real work bureaucratic paper pushing enforcing regulations and approving overseeing the handouts from gummint service operations etc none of those thing are real work they are busywork and faux jobs the kinds of things that go poof and magically disappear back into the nothingness that they came from when a major crisis hits a society you can observe this on virtually any scale from businesses to volunteer organizations even small groups in classrooms or indeed even within families when some generally almost any major crisis happens by and large the women become flustered afraid even unhinged some man or even boy who rises to manhood in the moment has to step in step up and take charge and it is invariably men who then do the actual work involved in resolving whatever the problem is at hand ,2,MGTOW
DWShimoda, i was about half way through wonder woman when i came to this tragic realization i have been a little depressed since the future is female and that is very frightening the end stage of our civilization society that is to say the current iteration of western civ aka teo twawki just like pretty much every other prior iteration is yes alas going to be an even worse version of the present dysfunctional corrupt byzantine monstrous toxic shitfest but the future meaning what comes after that is potentially so bright and distinctly different it will be like the difference between night and day i know it hard to visualize but that kind of dramatic change has happened many many times before per example the contrast between the 1930 of the great depression versus the abundance affluence of the 1950 suggest you read some of the works of strauss howe most particularly the book entitled the fourth turning it will give you a much different perspective on and attitude towards the present state of things also do not despair unlike some of the 50 60 old farts around here like myself you are still young enough that you will almost certainly not only live through the crisis shitfest but you will overcome be able to prosper in and truly enjoy the other side of that the renewal reordered society that results from the implosion collapse of the present morass ,1,MGTOW

DWShimoda, people who are 21 and 22 are millennials still i thought 1995 to now are gen z the more conservative gen definition of the various generations is always rather ambiguous my understanding is that the general consensus defintion of millennials aka geny includes anyone who was born between 1980 1982 to 1999 2001 and that genz or whatever else it is called are those born in the new millennium ie after 2000 2001 so still technically minors ,3,MGTOW
DWShimoda, chicago is a pure democracy actually chicago is a kleptocracy ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, it like a different country arguably it is a different country one could almost say a different world and it not that there are not any liberals or cucks in that different world because there are it that the prevalence and the levels or degrees of the insanity are significantly lower than they are in the coastal cities and urban enclaves ,2,MGTOW
DWShimoda, it seems that more and more single mothers are having children with some type of developmental disorder autism emotional disorders brain injuries intellectually disabled etc some of it exactly how much is anyone guess is simply fake forced because you have to understand that the mothers of developmentally disabled crotch fruit aka special needs children get all kinds of extra benefits services from the state and btw the local schooling system gets more funds as well which means both women and schools are incentivized literally to create label children as such once you comprehend that the rapid exponential increase in the number of special needs children is not a surprise add in that developmental disabilities are frequently the result of things like shitty parenting as well as drug alcohol addictions both in utero as well post birth and you have a sort of perfect storm situation ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, holding frame http www serviziodipsicologia it wp content uploads narcissist holding frame jpg is critically important after all how else would you know how where to crop your selfies ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, i am assuming these poor sods have not got a half decent father between them they might most likely highest statistical probability is that they are estranged from their own fathers via divorce but rather than try to fix that relationship they resort to creating a fake experience of it apparently to them it is akin to hiring a clown just without the pay ,7,MGTOW
DWShimoda, i kind of feel sad for those guys but note what they are expecting and feel entitled to 1 they want a fake dad 2 they want him to do the grilling despite the fact that they claim they know how to dubious 3 they want him to reaffirm them with all kinds of faux sentimentality call them sport and champ and etc 4 they want him to do it for free worse even have him haul his grill over 5 and this is all about making them feel better and pseudo connected to a fake dad on father day pathetic yup in about a dozen different ways some laughable and some just sad but probably the most pathetic sad is that they all apparently have real dads ie their fathers are still living yet their first main concern is not for attempting to be or get in contact with or visit or even be remotely concerned about what those dads are experiencing on father day but rather on what they themselves will experience ,11,MGTOW
DWShimoda, 99 99 of the west depends on your definition of the west and the specific local population you are using as your sample base to draw conclusions from if you are located in some major especially coastal urban enclave aka the clinton archipelago then yes that 99 99 figure is probably only slightly exaggerated but if you get out of that and into the countryside then it no longer true while still probably a minority of the population at least a small percentage of the rural people are awake and aware and quite frankly never bought into any of the sjw and political correctness bullshit to begin with ,9,MGTOW
DWShimoda,this presumes that men either want or are ambiguous about indifferent to dating marrying a woman that is taller than they themselves are ime that is a base level assumption failure just as most women quite naturally prefer and seek a taller man so too do most men again naturally prefer and seek a shorter woman biologically speaking this should not be a problem in fact these two tendencies line up quite happily and harmoniously with the median average distribution of natural height differentials between men and women http i imgur com wowxy9q png alas the natural height distribution gets distorted or arguably even entirely discarded by the introduction of wholly unnatural artificial things like high heeled shoes and other modern trends fads fashions in the form of additional perceived height altering things like hair styles etc womens and mens to wit the present style for men to have very short hair reduces their perceived height by a good inch or more whereas presently fashionable hairstyles for women curled permed etc often increase their perceived height substantially by anywhere from 1 to several inches over that which a normal natural hair would create moreover these are additive cumulative 1 2 3 or more increase from womens hair is added to 1 2 3 or more increase via high heeled shoes particularly when opposed by things that reduce mens perceived height a virtual erasure inversion of the natural height differential ergo women perceive and portray display themselves as several inches taller than they actually naturally are and most men as shorter than they actually are on both a relative and absolute basis yet at the same time women retain the very natural and biologically ingrained desire for men who are half a head approx 5 to 6 or more taller than themselves which these days translates to the paucity of men who are multiple inches above 6 tall but generally speaking the present mens fashions are ironically and contradictorily for a combination of short hair especially on top of the head for relatively flat sole shoes sneakers as opposed to boots with significant height adding heels for certain hat styles esp baseball caps and other clothing that arguably reduces perceived height and in contrast to the current fashion is to entirely avoid hair styles shoes hats and other clothing that could add and in the past did to their visually perceived height ie a close fitting baseball cap compresses already short hair which the human eye then shortens even further because it creates a rounded skull appearance compared or contrasted with many older archaic hat styles bowler fedora stetson much less the stovepipe or top hat etc that added several inches especially in combination with height increasing boots and suits jackets coats that created emphasized an upward visual v torso shoulder broadening appearance versus say the rounding and arguably feminizing shortening effects of androgynous t shirts jeans and baggy loose hoodies etc but defying current clothing fads fashion trends is really not an option most men cannot simply plop on a top hat or a fedora wellington or riding boots much less a full suit coat with tails when such things are egregiously not in style for day to day clothing at least not unless they want to be perceived labeled as weird creepy if not a cartoonish parody either of which is arguably much worse than being perceived as short ,3,MGTOW
DWShimoda, no different than any boss perhaps in your experience industry that many men also do not do great things but rather take credit for the fact that others have does not negate the main point which is that in fact women never actually do great things ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, before 2005 i trained several bright talented women who went on to figure out how to get men to do great things and allow the women to take the credit ftfy ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, perhaps he has to re home way too many women the way a dog pound tries to find homes for unwanted cats if only he would spay them the way the pound does ,2,MGTOW
DWShimoda, i wonder what the demographic profile is of this glut of single godly women i am going to guess that for the most part they are overweight and way past their prime late 20 something to mid 30 single mothers often divorced but increasingly never married generally with multiple crotch spawn from multiple baby daddies the chief things that draw them to churches are a various child care services and programs ie drop the crotch fruit off then head to work and or out for the night with her girlfriends b via the former obtaining some access to temporary father figures for their crotch fruit and finally c the hopes to identify and pin down some hard working relatively well off beta bux sucker cuckold to marry and then a decade later divorce rape his ass to take his house car half his 401k etc ,6,MGTOW
DWShimoda, they may be single and they might be female but i can assure dale there is nothing godly about those harlots this the thing is this dale dipshit does not actually know the least thing about what is godly and i would venture that it largely because he does not care what is or is not actually godly his chief and only concern is very likely as with the majority of clergy is his career and thus materialism in one form or another likes on facebook seats in pews dollars in collection plates and or book video sales iow he corrupt and pandering ,6,MGTOW
DWShimoda, im no troll of course you are ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda,really this is blatant violation of the concern troll rule deserves banning ,5,MGTOW
DWShimoda, sorry no you are not it just seems 99 of the post on here is venting this what it seems to you because you are really not a part of the forum you are a superficial twat who has flown in seagull style flapped around a little bit made a lot of squaking noises and decided that your best contribution was to take a crap on everyone else again gfy ,8,MGTOW
DWShimoda, i think op is projecting he the one virtue signalling shaming dudes for venting in the one place they can consistently do so there is no think about it the post is 100 pure concern troll and it complete bullshit if op does not want to read rants then op can simply ignore them anything and everything else is virtue signalling and projection as well as sjw entryism playing white knight for all the poor little wimminz ,19,MGTOW
DWShimoda,some true sentiments within this but the entire context is that of concern troll the only proper response to which is go fuck yourself ,3,MGTOW
DWShimoda, it not like you stay attracted to your partner that long anyway i know it definitely can happen and can be a good beneficial thing when it does but it requires significant effort on the part of both spouses to maintain including maintaining their own attractiveness to their spouse the point is that even then desires of two individuals simply do not always line up and even men who are indeed factually not merely claiming to be happily married nevertheless still end up choking the chicken a significant amount whether they admit to doing it or not ,2,MGTOW
DWShimoda, it also a lack of understanding the place of animals in the human hirearchy human hierarchy and nature hierarchy nature does not give a crap about pain or suffering those are human and civilized concepts they are not people and they are partly bred to be docile and stupid and fundamentally out in nature everything is food for something else usually many other things humans want to reject that because the idea that we too might be food for worms etc is psychologically distasteful threatening to our psyche really when it comes down to it the human penchant for anthropomorphizing animals is a demonstration of rank hubris and arrogance albeit in defense of most modern urbanites they have been brainwashed and fed an almost endless stream of anthropomorphized bs about animals from the cradle on up and lacking any subsequent real world contact with nature it is rare and difficult for them to be able to disabuse themselves of the various ridiculous notions they been indoctrinated into ,3,MGTOW
DWShimoda, thanks for the long posts i am enjoying them i once wanted to go live in the woods it a common enough sentiment appeals to our sense of adventure of finding and conquering some frontier as well as to our sense of frustration regarding the various things imposed upon us not the least of which is the decade of quasi forced socialization with others often people we grow to profoundly despise if not hate and with whom we share little other than a proximity of birth dates and housing locations it took me about 20 years to realize that it was more about how i was inded different than other people and felt the need to live apart from them which can be done without having to move to some remote mountaintop or forest nothing wrong with enjoying the woods i happen to love going off on week long backwoods backpacking trips myself but it is not necessary to do that full time to minimize insulate yourself from the majority of interactions with idiots and from ignoring following my true passion and talent in life and learning to stop needing to feel normal and start a family like the rest of the world indeed the thing is and learning a bit more about history especially pre modern medicine family structure often helps one to realize that the modern incarnation of family is a fairly narrow and aberrational exception to what was actually the norm ie back when the mean average lifespan was perhaps 40 yrs mostly due to deaths of infants and children but with significant attrition during young middle age adult years as well few families survived intact for more than a decade or two thus it was quite common for extended family members to be rearranged into a new structure adoption of nephews younger cousins orphaned or not including sons of friends as ones own son by a successful man who own biological children did not survive etc was relatively common ergo while i am not exactly a fan of the modern build your own family meme there is precedent for something similar ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, although the percentage of women are still quite low it has increased dramatically in the last decade from virtually nobody to at least a few percentage points irrelevant just because people work in a field does not mean they are competent or have the least comprehension of what they are doing in my experience most women in it are not there on merit and the few who are competent again are not the type to go all unhinged schizoid in the fashion you are suggesting finally back to the main point being truly mgtow and keeping women off your property and outside of your home eliminates the vast majority of any remaining risk i would suggest that if you are concerned about women hacking your home security camera system regardless of it stucture then you are doing many other things entirely wrong ie you are choosing to play with fire ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda,awalt the degree level of egregious annoying behavior varies especially with those older women from prior generation particularly those born or who grew up during the great depression wwii years but the root behavior patterns ie feelings over thinking perception over reality are still there nevertheless ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, it an inevitability that these guys are gonna see the light one way or another through divorce rape a good male role model etc alas but i think you are overly optimistic ime most men even post nasty divorce rape end up right back on the plantation going for another round then another and another and another in fact most men never learn they may end up as more or less single bachelor mgtow but not by choice not by realization rather per force simply as a result of age exhaustion of resources etc but even then they still long to go back to the plantation and never cease trying to get there ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, women will read that feeling justified for not satisfying their man bingo you have now found the entire purpose and reason articles like this are published obvious propaganda is obvious does not matter women will eat this shit up and then spew it back out when convenient which again is the entire purpose ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, now they are dropping all pretense and lying to men that they will be happy even if they are in a sexless marriage where the wife cheats on them actually its worse than that what they are pushing now is the open marriage stuff aka full blown cuckoldry that men should happly jack off while watching their wife get fucked by some random chad former single mom with crotch spawn from one or more other dudes ,2,MGTOW
DWShimoda, is she getting laid yes that all that matters as a man you only have about 100x the sexual desire than she does fuck you and your problems go jack it in a sock cuck one of the critical truths i learned at a relatively young age was that most married men still jackoff and indeed typically or on average across their life including decades of being married have the majority of their orgasms via jacking off comprehending that and looking at it from a utilitarian context i thought of it in terms of hiring a live in full time cook that only makes one meal per month meaning you have to make the rest of your meals yourself well it seemed rather senseless certainly rather irrational and arguably insane i just did the math and said wtf that ai not worth the price i mean hell if 90 or more of my orgasms are gonna be via spanking the monkey who gives a shit about the rest in essence every guy is a perpetual wanker and so calling someone that as if it were an insult is just ridiculous my early teen years overheard several married guy conversations and then later on late teens early 20 confirmed by direct q a with some married guys as well as late night convo with divorced or separated men all talking about how rarely they had sex much less achieved any satisfying orgasm with their wives and how often they resorted to rosey palm and some penthouse playboy stash this was all decades before internet porn ,2,MGTOW
DWShimoda,personally i am in 100 agreement with you on the hard wired systems it what i installed myself albeit for a host of reasons not just women plus my system is analog signal rather that iot and is digital only at the dvr but not sure i agree with the following fear paranoia if the woman is actively targeting you for a false claim and has even a modicum of technical knowledge sorry but ime that is such an outlier a woman having the necessary sufficient technical knowledge to disrupt wifi is pretty much unicorn territory and moreover requires the kind degree of logical thinking ability that effectively preclude the whole unhinged schizoid victim false claim category of women besides i am a real mgtow and other than my geriatric mother i simply do not allow women to enter inside my home to begin with and keep the number that are ever even on the property driveway porch exterior of the house to a minimum as well and that latter minimizing virtually eliminating women on my property much less inside my home really is not very difficult to achieve since women by definition avoid all functional utility value jobs tradesmen package delivery etc there is essentially zero concern on a day to day basis only very rarely like less than once a year does any soliciting or governmental bureaucrat female come nosing around the steep driveway helps i think to much like work for the nosey neighborhood busybody types and they are easily kept on the exterior of the house under the direct coverage of the security cameras chiefly protection against both theft robbery i live in an area where about 1 2 the homes are vacation cottages and a few years back there was a spate of home break ins and just overall general liability ie mailman slips on ice sues kind of concerns security camera system was cheap insurance let be honest the vast majority of men who encounter false accusation situations and thus the lion share of the risk well those are 99 99 of the time arguably self inflicted or at least self created risk situations if you bring one or more known to be venomous sneks into your home as proverbial pets to play with you are more or less asking begging to be bitten or alternately play with fire and you are going to get burned personally i think the chief reason so many women do get away with false claims is that in general most men are idiots fools suckers patsies etc ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda,then you might try heading on over to some of the fantasy bullshit forums r futurology r socialism etc lol unibomber rotflmao dumbass ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, you are a condescending dick after all the typical and indeed entirely predictable response of the thoroughly indoctrinated but almost entirely ignorant modern urbanite you are blue pilled in so many different ways that it literally inevitable you will balk at factual reality at some point ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, but i do not have to see everything under the sun first hand to have a reasonably informed opinion on it aye but there the rub what constitutes reasonably informed opinion and what in the world does it have to do with objective reality answer nothing just an hour or two ago you were all excited about an off grid lifestyle even though you consider camping to be too much work etc of course they could be full of shit but if we go down that road we might as well not talk about anything that we do not have first hand knowledge of except we are not talking about some specific incident or location but rather an entire wide field of knowledge where you are essentially and previously self admittedly clueless not merely clueless about factory farms but about farming and indeed about wildlife in it entirety i understand not to take propaganda at face value but sometimes expos s are just that indeed and how much do you know about the various nature programs from which you draw what little you think you know about animal suffering yet again you are projecting your own anthropocentric modern western cushy industrial comfort based life perspective onto entire realms of which you know nothing no context can explain the horrors captured on much of them have you ever seen how wild animals actually die in nature your concept of horrors is puerile and naive again the whole or chief point of this is you need to stay in your artificial pampered little urban world where your fantasy delusions will not be horrified by the dirty bloody torture of actual natural reality maybe order some of that soylent powder drink mix stuff ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, so yeah such badass women am i right s exactly badass when they know they are 100 safe and or could milk the most trivial victimhood for a life of cushy comfort via some lawsuit or settlement the instant anything actually got real they would be ducking for cover behind the nearest white knight man they could find and if none of them were anywhere around then they would be hiding behind children or whoever whatever was at hand ,2,MGTOW
DWShimoda, but i have read a lot about factory farming methods indeed read a lot written by whom with what agenda ever actually been on a working farm much less a so called factory farm we are talking physically present in person yourself and not some carefully edited staged and highly dubious shakey cam video at least in the wild animals have a chance to behave in accordance with their biological programming but again what do you really know about this how much of what you think you know is complete and utter bullshit fiction crafted for you as entertainment by media companies with their own agenda ,4,MGTOW
DWShimoda, having a system with this level of sophistication which admittedly seems absurd for your own home pushes you over the hump from creep who recorded sex to responsible guy who been robbed before not absurd at all not these days and yeah on the robbed before or vandalized or whatever plus not very expensive or even difficult to implement multiple camera analog wired security camera systems anywhere from 4 to 16 cameras with a dedicated dvr 1 or 2 terabyte drive are pretty inexpensive these days we are talking few hundred dollars if you diy the install maybe a grand for a big high end system with some online backup chief hassle is running the wires mounting installing the cameras newer digital wireless wifi ip based systems are a bit more expensive and often seem like they will be easier to setup run ie as if wireless means no wires but of course you still have to get power to the cameras batteries are impractical so you need to run wires anyway the thing most people do not realize is that you probably do not need to cover the entire house that is you do not need to have creepy cameras in the bedrooms so long as you have covered all of the entries and exits and possibly additionally the main quasi public living room areas then you will probably be able to put the lie to the majority of the claims of domestic abuse because if on the date in question said victim princess is on video even without audio puttering around in the living room for 10 minutes and is obviously acting casual and normal as if nothing untoward happened before she departs and then furthermore she departs looking entirely unharmed and untroubled ie chatting or texting away on her smartphone rather than fleeing from said rapist abuser well how believable will the i wuz raped tortured gonna be system might even pay for itself and in more ways than one some insurance companies give discounts lower rates for homes that have security surveillance systems installed and that not even mentioning the peace of mind and or reduced level of costs should any bad event ever occur that the video will mitigate ie spend a couple hundred bucks even a grand now and save tens of thousands of dollars in legal costs later on to even try to fight some false accusation or allegation nor is it noting that the mere existence presence of the cameras whether they are actually all working recording or not may all by itself be sufficient to entirely prevent such an accusation allegation in the first place edit i will also note once you have the wires run cameras installed it generally a piece of cake to upgrade the system swap out the dvr for a higher capacity one bigger drive higher res processing better motion detection etc and or to change up the resolution of the cameras as well edit 2 finally a brief note on the whole illegal wiretapping and two party consent issue that has to do with taping the audio as in conversations spoken words generally speaking if all you are recording is the video and you are not recording in places of assumed privacy bedroom bathroom but merely common rooms like living room kitchen entry exit porch driveway etc then you are entirely free clear of any of the wiretapping bullshit add a sign anywhere on your property including sicker on screen door window regarding security surveillance cameras being in use and you are doubly covered in terms of having provided sufficient notice obtained consent to video you do not have to inform people about where all the cameras are merely that they may exist ,5,MGTOW
DWShimoda, i think cabin on the lake is the realistic compromise for a guy like me this be realistic about things and yes realistic means compromises because in one way or another there are going to be compromises you wanna go off grid then you trade off hard work versus degrees of luxury amenities creature comforts which includes things like electric light thermostatically controlled heat cooling and even ample fresh water on tap things we have become habituated to as necessities of life even though we have only had most of them for a handful of decades indeed to be truly off grid you would better get used to walking everywhere no cars no buses no trains no planes not even a bicycle is possible without modern infrastructure ergo your world will now be a radius or circuit of a few dozen miles the distance you can walk in a day or two anything else is imo to engage in hypocrisy the vast majority of so called off grid homes are hypocritical they are only off grid if someone euphemistically caveats it with inanities like saying that using propane does not count as grid power and we are talking substantial amounts of it https sustainablog org 2011 09 propane appliances off grid living except of course it does count propane or more properly lpg liquefied petroleum gas is a modern industrial product you do not grow propane by planting seeds nor can you just dig a well with a hand shovel to find a pool of the stuff propane only exists much less is widely available distributed via modern technology and infrastructure iow the grid just a different form of the grid trucks and highways to wit if someone told you they were off grid but powered their home or even just part of their home with a gasoline or diesel fueled electric generator you would call foul well the same is true of propane the fact that it delivered by tanker truck or hauled in out via smaller refillable tanks rather than via some lines wires pipes like grid electric or natural gas really just makes it less efficient and arguably less environmentally sound and btw that not a stretch at all since most fully off grid homes so called in fact have diesel backup generators that they run far more frequently than they care to admit also even this is debatable those animals have way better lives than the factory farmed animals i eat natural wild animals are not exactly frolicking around in the woods playing games you know they basically spend every waking hour of the day foraging for food trying to stay undercover attempting to avoid becoming food themselves and not only nor even chiefly from carnivorous predators but from insects other pests parasites either alternative of which usually means being eaten while still at least partially alive and then attempting to find a mate to reproduce enough offspring so that some of them might live long enough to reproduce again in turn there is no such thing as a humane death in nature ie humane quick relatively painless wild animals virtually never die of old age the quickest and probably least painful natural death for any wild animal is from some predator catching and relatively rapidly chomping on them if the prey is lucky snapping the neck or puncturing an artery the more likely alternative being via disease or parasites aka being slowly consumed eaten from within or again dying slowly from starvation dehydration or even freezing to death by contrast farm animals are generally disease parasite free have more than sufficient food provided to them with little or no effort have little or even no stress from or need to fear predators other than the farmer and their death is indeed humane that is quick relatively painless in talking about better lives you are engaging in an entirely fictitious and arguably delusional anthropomorphic projection of how you would feel in those circumstances but your standard of comparison is wholly false because you have never lived as a wild animal you have never had to forage continuously for food hide from predators while trying to drink from a stream had to to gnaw at your entire body of fur to rid your pelt of pests like ticks dozens even hundreds of them nor to try to run from hundred nay countless thousands of mosquitoes or biting flies and gnats much less find shelter daily from wind rain snow to find and huddle with family members just to stay warm at night your perspective is one of a wholly artificial human life modern industrial comfortable with ample free time for play pleasure to get even a trivial almost infinitesimal fraction of an understanding of what life is like for wild animals while also remaining safe and not ending up dead dead dead i would suggest you not only go camping but that you go on some week long deep woods backpacking trip one where you carry sufficient base nutrition so you wo not starve along with you where you carry a canteen so you wo not dehydrate that you can refill from lakes streams pumped filtered so you do not get intestinal parasites and where you have a modern lightweight sleeping bag plus other clothing with you so you do not die from exposure hypothermia at night but leave the nylon tent and the deet mosquito spray at home trust me after even just your first or second fleeing encounter with a flying mass of mosquitoes or black flies gnats midges etc you will very soon begin to pity wild animals fated to endure that on a daily basis likewise when it rains much less snows or frosts you will soon value the comforts of a proper shelter however crude tent like and will dream about fresh clean abundant water on tap and what is more at least if you have a logical mind that can extrapolate from that minimal discomfort you will probably go a long way towards ridding yourself of the enviro vegan cult imposed fictional fantasy guilt about the inhumane sic fate lives of farm animals ,3,MGTOW
DWShimoda, fair enough glad i asked the michael crichton quotes truly were apropos thank you there is beauty in actual nature but it a brutal beauty and a far far far different thing than the array of bullshit that is sold as nature via television shows and movies whether the animated disney crap or the so called real wildlife shows they are all equally fictional just in different ways to wit while so called wildlife program will often show exciting things like a deer or rabbit being hunted by a wolf or fox etc heavily edited and generally staged go google fake staged wildlife programs i double dog dare you now by contrast how often do they show you things like the images on this page http imgarcade com deer covered in ticks html yet animals dying from disease both external ones like the blood sucking ticks massive numbers of mosquitoes as well as internal ones bacterial viral plus worms assorted other intestinal parasites as well as the external internal ones larvae maggots of flies etc well that a very common thing as is death from starvation dehydration etc so called wildlife programs generally do not show those things because they do not fit the narrative there is no excitement or thrill or drama in showing a deer slowly starving to death or an anemic moose stumbling falling and succumbing to a massive infestation of ticks etc etc those things cannot be accompanied by a thrilling soundtrack or narrator opining about a hunt and escape and so on not to mention the fact that ratings would crash and the huge amount of complaints that would be received from viewers who were grossed out by the reality of open sores emaciated animals maggots consuming both the dead carcasses and animals that are still living the same quite frankly is true of the so called off grid lifestyle that you have been sold the plain fact of the matter is that in modern western nations there are only three types of people who have homes that are off grid 1 the rich for whom some off grid home is a temporary vacation property often one of several homes they maintain or rather have maintained for them and where the work expense of being off grid is really not an issue they have plenty of excess cash and other people do the work of implementing maintaining said off grid systems 2 the hardened inured types who are not only not afraid of a little hard work but are in fact accustomed to it and would be bored to tears without it and even in these cases it is more often a matter of inability to be on grid cost of getting electric grid power run to their home is impractical and only way for them to have electricity and all that it entails is some combination of solar wind and or micro hydro all of which are expensive and problematic and take a lot of work to maintain that is the basis for them being off grid 3 the fools nuts masochists who go out to prove it can be done quite often really only re proving just how impractical it actually is both via expending of funds which via their experiment they often have plenty as well as the fact that they rarely maintain it for more than an initial year or two iow while equipment is new and then moreover they usually return with a glorified and partially if not wholly fictionalized account minimizing glossing over or simply leaving out the dirty facts like the use of propane for heat cooking refrigeration or that they purchased firewood even had couple of cords of wood trucked in and so on or else simply lying about how shitty their lifestyle was how much work stress was involved how little free time they had etc the reality is that the cost impact of being on grid is far less than people exaggeratedly imagine it to be then even with that ask yourself what percentage of your actual annual expenses really goes to the grid and moreover how much of that expense is you simply being careless or wasteful in how you use it ie how many how long hot showers baths do you take in a day or week how often do you change wash clothes unnecessarily when they are really not dirty at all how many lights do you have leave turned on that do not need to be how high low do you have the thermostat turned on if you believe you have to keep your home within a few degrees of comfort zone then you are not ready for natural living etc not to mention how much media you consume tv radio internet ,5,MGTOW

DWShimoda, i love the idea of living off the grid lifestyle and am curious if you have thoughts on how one could best test the waters to avoid making a life change based on my fantasy version of it key words in the above are the idea you are in love with a fictional construct and given the sentence that follows just a few lines later for example i love nature but i hate camping always felt like too much work to drag everything out to the woods set it all up hang out for a few nights then break it all down based on that in and of itself i can pretty much tell already you right from the getgo that even some rural or farm life much less off grid is not for you period seriously if you think that camping lol involves too much work then you need to stay in whatever urban suburban enclave you are familiar with and keep your so called love of nature ie the discovery channel fantasy version of it as a wholly passive thing that you can watch on tv and continue to engage in fantasy dreaming infatuation about i wonder if there a place i could stay for a week or two at a time that would serve this purpose there is no need for you to do anything like this additional testing that camping test was really all that needed to be done i would say that a pair of quotes from michael crichton are pretty apropos here the romantic view of the natural world as a blissful eden is only held by people who have no actual experience of nature people who live in nature are not romantic about it at all they may hold spiritual beliefs about the world around them they may have a sense of the unity of nature or the aliveness of all things but they still kill the animals and uproot the plants in order to eat to live if they do not they will die and particularly this the truth is almost nobody wants to experience real nature what people want is to spend a week or two in a cabin in the woods with screens on the windows they want a simplified life for a while without all their stuff or a nice river rafting trip for a few days with somebody else doing the cooking nobody wants to go back to nature in any real way and nobody does it all talk and as the years go on and the world population grows increasingly urban it uninformed talk farmers know what they are talking about city people do not it all fantasy sorry but you have been sold a massive load of romantcized bullshit about off grid lifestyle the reality is that you would hate it and run screaming back to the city above crichton quotes from his environmentalism as religion speech pdf http www pe tamu edu dl program graduate seminar series documents michaelcrichton evironmentalism pdf ,5,MGTOW

DWShimoda, i personally would not say a farmer who keeps the fruit of his labor is being self centered i would say since he worked hard for it then he has a right to keep it you might not but the majority of other people would let alter the scenario a bit and say that the neighbor family is starving literally starving to death is the farmer self centered for not handing over via sale trade or otherwise charity taxation a large chunk of his harvest what if that neighbor family includes a couple dozen very young small children cute little ones with big soulful eyes https i ytimg com vi sqosreskaha maxresdefault jpg most people have been trained to believe that yes he should feed them not only that rather he must feed them that he is or should be obligated to do so to not do so or even to not force him to do so would be not only self centered but sinfully immorally unethically selfish and this is believed quite sincerely even by people who otherwise entirely reject the very notion of sin or morals or ethics after all such according to them such notions are simply social constructs and can should be readily set aside at least whenever it is convenient for to them to do so regarding their own needs wants desires but how much of his harvest should the farmer hand over should he hand over all of his stored foods grains including even his seed for the following year ah now we get to the crux of the matter if the farmer does that then everyone will starve the following year so the farmer must withhold a sufficient amount of seed more than that he himself cannot survive to plant that seed cultivate harvest it unless he saves sufficient amounts to feed himself his family other farm workers his beasts of burden horses mules oxen etc and or if he uses machinery to trade with others for fuel repair parts service to maintain that machinery in good working order through the following harvest and beyond you see all of that including the knowledge of how to properly use it maintain it is capital the stored food the seed corn the machinery working animals and indeed also beef cattle dairy cows etc which are mobile meat food lockers it is all necessary for survival much less growth those little children are an expansion of the population both in sheer numbers as well as demand for more food as they age there is no system that can survive without such capital it is really just a matter of who is in control of it who is in charge of designating how much shall be stored in what forms what locations under who supervision money even precious metals are only markers and tools of trade exchange increasing the amount of money via whatever means whether digital or printed paper or the mining of metals does not really increase the amount of actual capital that an economy has what foolish people diatribe against as capitalism which even you did in your initial comment to which i replied previously they are not really doing it with any concept of the foundational capital in mind what instead they are actually upset about angry about is either at best the system known as financial ism where those money markers are conjured up from nothing by some specially privileged group bankers and or politicians who arrogate to themselves backed up by force the right to engage in what would otherwise be considered fraud or counterfeiting at worst they are simply entitled little twats who believe call it whatever you want socialism or communism or ism that their own mere existence and or that of their children somehow creates a right to be fed clothed housed by the efforts work of others and without any requirement for any effort on their own part and that they need not be the ones truly responsible for the feeding of their own children ie that if their children starve it is not the fault of the farmer but of themselves for giving birth to children especially some large number of children without having made certain they would be able to provide sufficient necessities btw both marx and engels his sugar daddy school chum were in fact exactly that entitled little twats engels was the equivalent of what we would call a trust fund kid rich parents and marx was his parasitic friend neither one really ever worked in any major productive manner engels being gifted a salary position at his daddy factory does not really count during their entire lives they certainly never produced anything of real value selling bullshit texts newpapers books that pander to people irresponsibility is not productive activity it really more of a con scheme scam that is fundamentally no different than the shell game of a street corner co artist ,1,MGTOW

DWShimoda, actually i think its much much worse than that they are merely self centered the vast majority of people by and large are a net parasitic drain on society as a whole cf tragedy of the commons and are invariably also have a very short term mindset particularly when they act as part of a group or special interest often alternating as part of several different groups each with it own and thus overall disparate contradictory goals most people just do not get how their own normative because it is so common pervasive behavior patterns choices and attitudes mindsets are in fact highly detrimental to everyone often ultimately themselves as well it fairly obvious to them how say some punk vandal with a spray paint can creates a significant amount of waste and unnecessary work expense but what they do not see is that comparatively their own behaviors individually and as members of some group making a demand for something from other groups are often far far worse in terms of total cost negative impact per example times are good there are windfall tax revenues coming in so some group particularly organized group will leverage themselves into grasping the lion share of that which is bad enough in and of itself but worse they will usually do so in a way that commits the body politic to continuing to pay that amount into the future when the good times are over and the lean times occur most obvious of these are the public union pension schemes etc though they are far from the only such thing equally problematic are various edifice complex things where some vanity building project is constructed and paid for but really not paid for via some municipal bond basically the same thing encumbering the locale with future debt payments to some tax privileged bond holder or worse yet some public pension fund based on some ideal imaginary future revenue situation explaining exactly how bad costly destructive that can be takes a bit of doing one of the best most concise well defined plain english explanations i have run across is gonzalo lira democratic bankruptcy paradox theory http www financialsense com contributors gonzalo lira why democracies will always go bankrupt the complete text of which alas is no longer online or at least i cannot find it wherein he explains why he believes democratic entities will inevitably invariably go bankrupt in short simply because they can create future obligations ie ostensibly bind future generations and can create them without regard for future revenues invariably at some point in time they will do so often repeatedly and increasingly and especially since the doom is the negative consequences are in fact often delayed think time bomb the proverbial can has been kicked so far down the road that many believe it will be entirely avoided and besides someone else can deal with that as far as they are personally concerned they may in fact not have to suffer any negative consequences aka in the long run we are all dead per example any majority can vote for or against something thus any group of three people let say andy bob carol can readily vote in disparate ways andy bob may be in agreement that x is a bad idea and vote it down in opposition to carol but then bob switches sides and votes with carol to pass issue y and when issue z comes up to pay for y well bob wants to be responsible for his prior yes on y vote so he votes for z as well andy of course votes against z because it pays for y which he also voted against and carol well she voted for y but she votes with andy in opposition to z because she does not want to have to pay for the y thing personally if she could somehow force andy to pay the entire bill say via some zz proposal then she would vote for that as probably so would bob now as problematic as the scenario of andy bob carol is and of course they are just representative of groups a b c there is an additional factor and that is group d let refer to them as the darla see everyone does not have to vote and they definitely do not always vote and in fact they often do not vote so the constituency of the majority keeps changing moreover issues are not only not voted on merely once not even once in a lifetime but especially when they are voted down they often become like a hydra that comes up repeatedly and returns again with multiple heads ergo even if andy of the world consistently shows up and votes against all iterations of issue y well sooner or later an instance will come up when the bob have either flip flopped been convinced persuaded coerced or even tricked into it or even simply abstained themselves from the vote out of exhaustion not this again being absentee or really whatever reason motive or cause is irrelevant and then the carol and darla likewise the carol may be consistent like the andy but on the opposite side whereas the darla are in some ways more like the bob both inconsistent and unreliable in their voting pattern but tending more toward agreement with the carol on most issues and yet in other ways are unlike the bob who eventually get exhausted repeatedly voting no and give up instead showing up only for the later iteration ie attempt 9 to pass the y issue thus it is that it is the flighty fleeting and most likely least informed least responsible voters who end up setting the rules they are the most likely to show up eventually to vote for some largesse especially if they themselves expect to be a recipient of even some part of it and also the most likely to vote against taking responsibility for it particularly at any cost to themselves thus the easiest path is to vote oneself or one own group some benefit now and to push off the payment for it onto the future and or onto others which are the same thing really so it the inconsistent unreliable bob and the darla who are largely to blame not to entirely eliminate the responsibility of the consistently ir responsible carol types but it is only in combination with the b d that the c become a majority by comparison the kid with the can of spray paint his impact the damage he causes is trivial and superficial and yes i am using female names for the irresponsible types and for good reason but it should be noted that it is not only women who fit into those categories there are plenty of irresponsible men as well it just that overall it is far more likely for men to be more highly represented in the responsible groups and for women to be more in the irresponsible ones and arguably men are to blame for the latter after all every woman was once a daughter of some man and whenever some little princess has grown to become an irresponsible pussy pass woman it is largely due to her father influence training or his absence and lack thereof ,5,MGTOW

DWShimoda, i guessed how their wives left them and these wives had an instant husband after them and i told them that their wives had this replacement new hubbie before they even divorced them and they all either confirmed that it looks like this or actually testified that they have evidence of such things generally called a backup guy by women when they talk amongst themselves and virtually all women have one or at least they think sincerely believe that they do in the cases where a woman divorces hubby and does not immediately or almost immediately branch swing to some other backup guy it generally not because he does not exist that she did not have one or more than one pre selected and lined up it because the guy she did have or believed she had lined up turned out to not be as much of a sucker idiot as she thought note she may or may not have actually been banging this guy on the side prior to the divorce one should not confuse the chad and jody and various other cc ride ponies with a woman backup guy ie future next beta bux hubby candidate there are instances where they overlap but that is not a requirement note 2 also said backup guy often has other potential uses as well per example the recent thread here in r mgtow about the wife wanting trying for 10 years to have a baby but hubby secretly had a vasectomy chances are that woman would have long prior to the 10 year mark thought it probably mostly age of the woman dependent rather than sum total years of trying used or at least tried to use said backup guy as unwitting sperm donor note 3 and of course the backup guy probably is not just one specific guy certainly not the same one specific guy across a woman whole marriage quite commonly women have a whole list of potential men in mind and the one that is currently designated as the backup guy in her mind if nowhere else is just the guy who is currently at the top of the list and for whatever reason his location ease of access his career or career prospects perhaps he seems both attracted to her and desperate etc and this is simply fact work for any extended period of time even just a few weeks on contract in some large office among women especially some cubicle farm where people have an illusion of privacy but where even quiet conversations carry over the cubicle walls and you will invariably hear several different conversations between two or more women blatantly discussing all kinds of things of this nature about hubby and or boyfriends divorces divorce rape plans and yes indeed backup guys even with that kind of term although obviously the exact term used by any specific woman will vary from one locale to another divorce quite literally has a certain viral even epidemic aspect to it i have seen several different offices companies where the divorce bug can almost literally be seen heard being transmitted like an infectious disease from one woman to another where in an entire office of apparently purportedly happily married women some woman divorce rapes her husband and then 6 months to a year later the disease does have a certain latency before the infection manifests itself in it full blown acute outbreak form you see one or more other women do the same ff another 6 months to a year and it has spread exponentially usually it only takes about 2 to 3 years total for an outbreak to have run rife through an office and anywhere from 1 3 to 2 3 of the formerly happily married women have divorced with most of them moving on to or in with their backup guy one is tempted to use the term decimated but that only 1 10 and so far short of the mark ,2,MGTOW

DWShimoda, therapists governments and social relief agencies are ultimately composed of people women and manginas ftfy ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda,first of all overall good comment but to a couple of specific points the problem is simply this whenever a man has a problem nobody takes the man at his word that the problem is as the man says it is and there is a very simple reason for this those people the ones who do not accept what the man says are invariably disingenuous themselves or in plainer terms they are 100 certain that the man must be lying or deflecting or shifting blame misatributing cause etc because that is what they themselves do as a regular habit there is really no mystery liars believe that everyone else is a liar too that is in fact one of the ways that they justify their own lying finally the following the problem is that therapists governments women and social relief agencies either cannot or will not give men what they say they need on the assumption that the men as the irrational sociopathic tyrannic brutes they are claimed to be have no cause to need the things that they say they need what they really need is an education a training a talking to so that they can do the things we want them to do without having to give them anything this is a problematic paragraph to follow comprehend because there are just too many damned pronouns it would be better worded as something like the following the problem is that therapists governments women and social relief agencies either cannot or will not give men what men say they need on the assumption that the men as the irrational sociopathic tyrannic brutes they are claimed to be have no cause to need the things that they men say they need what they women etc believe that men really need is an education a training a talking to so that men can do the things women want men to do without women having to give men anything in short for therapists governments women and social relief agencies really you may as well just say women because that who those other entities largely consist of either actual women vagina equipped or else mangina parasitic types and who their real clients are well it really still all about them ie therapy government and all social relief agencies are all gynocentric period if and when men or children are the ostensible clients being served the organization entity is nevertheless still actually more about using men or children as the excuse to engage in parasitical behavior that is using men and children as a means or justification for tapping into the tax or insurance cash flow systems to draw salaries benefits and build a mini empire around the purported services why it is important to realize that is that there is zero incentive for them to actually solve the problems which they purportedly exist to serve solve and in fact there is every incentive for them to via various actions maintain and exacerbate the problems iow to make the situation worse bigger because that then leads to an even greater justification for them to be given more resources and to the argument that they have been ineffective they will always claim a lack of sufficient funds resources perfect example of the above the self serving nature of any all public entities is the public schooling system the typical public school in the us now expends something on the order of 12 296 per student per year https nces ed gov fastfacts display asp id 66 and actually since that was the 2012 2013 number you can be certain the current figure is significantly higher think about that for a minute 12 296 per student per year multiply that by a classroom of even just 20 students and you get a figure of 245 920 that enough money every year to buy build not just a classroom but an entire house and with enough left over to pay a generous salary across 12 years on behalf of that group of just 20 students or ostensibly on their behalf a grand total of 2 951 040 nearly 3 million dollars will be spent again that enough to pay 100k per year to a teacher 1 2 million total and still have nearly 2 million left to construct and heat light maintain the schoolhouse to serve those students yet what do we repeatedly hear from schools that the reason they are failing to perform even an adequate level of education is because they lack money resources which is of course bullshit the reason they fail is because if they succeeded if they actually did their job in a competently managed manner there would be no rationale for them to be able to demand moar ergo the system is always stretching and changing it supposed job tasks redefining it mission in such a way that it allows them to misallocate the money resources so that they invariably fail to achieve their previously stated goals it bureaucracy 101 otherwise known as parkinson law http www economist com node 14116121 and of course it is based on and perfectly matches the female mindset which is never satisfied never accountable and never able to actually perform anything of value that is even remotely worth the cost ,3,MGTOW

DWShimoda, it really is too bad this is not common sense to most people well common sense really is not very common and then add in the fact that for the most part the herd really has been managed to at least a certain extent throughout much of history along with the recent current systematic brainwashing of the young in the government schooling system and the entire population via mass media and to quote from men in black edwards why the big secret people are smart they can handle it kay a person is smart people are dumb panicky dangerous animals and you know it sauce http www imdb com title tt0119654 quotes item qt0997317 the chief original meaning and purpose behind the abstract concept of separation of church and state was to keep the government out of business of educating ie indoctrinating brainwashing the youth otherwise known as the next generation and particularly to prevent the federal national government from thus dictating and imposing a single theological philosophical worldview prevent a uniformity of thought and thus some redefined warped distorted and self serving state elite special interest serving version of morality at the time of the american revolution the formation of the united states and indeed for much of the century afterwards schooling up to and including colleges universities was essentially the job of the churches both the local community churches which among other things thus made continual use of the church building during the week as well as the collective denominations which founded operated the universities largely as seminaries to train clergy essentially all of the so called ivy league was established constructed and funded for that purpose and indeed the entire basic standard operating procedure for colleges the lecture hall model comes out of the pre printing press era seminary monastery system monks and initiates engaged in scribe activities copying out scriptures commentaries and catechisms that were being read from a lectern for all of the ironic facetious claims of diversity the real goal of the national schooling systems which are based on the prussian model designed to create a mass of obedient drones as military fodder has always been to create the opposite a uniform worldview mindset aka a purportedly educated but in fact dumbed down obedient obeisant and non thinking mass population there was in fact vastly more diversity in the independent of government influence control private church based model which also of course was funded via voluntary donations subscriptions rather than mandatory taxes and attendance was under the control at the behest of parents and the students themselves rather than being compulsory it is also quite notable that much like planned parenthood the biggest push for compulsory mandatory tax funded prolonged schooling came from the social darwinist openly racist eugenics crowd again the reality is that the system is still largely engaged in that it has simply changed gears away from promoting white prominence eugenic breeding culling training system to being a replace whites dysgenic breeding culling training system ie the idea apparently being to make the herd dumber genetically in order to better manage it ,1,MGTOW

DWShimoda, two years ago i would have looked at her and pined over her i would have sighed and said to myself my god what a beautiful creature i would do anything for the ancients had a name for such creatures they called them succubi or succubus singular https en wikipedia org wiki succubus today we call them gold digging whores or bimbos in essence they are a form of parasitic leech that seeks out attaches to anything with money and sucks that out of the host in this case the ultimate end result may prove more hilarious than sad as that dude is a type of puffball or puffer fish the money while real enough in the present will eventually go poof when his whole empire implodes collapses and is revealed as entirely bankrupt he running everything on bubblicious con game fumes ,5,MGTOW
DWShimoda,well next time you see your parent s you might want to think about saying a sincere thank you for giving you a normal generic white guy first name ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, lol tylenol i am black but sure grateful i have a normal white name helps on job applications they never know what is coming i would have to disagree on that last see i think your name particularly first name actually helps shape who you become iow when you have a normal name and by normal i do not just mean normal white name but normal to the majority culture you live in then it helps you fit in just in general but if you are stuck with some aberrant moniker particularly some ridiculously and often alas purposefully or perhaps worse unintentionally mis spelled variation of a somewhat normal name or some even more absurd construction and then especially if there is no real family heritage rationale for it ie grandpa was not named tylenol well it forces a kid into a sort of defiant position from an early age turns the kid into a square peg in a world of round holes and that then has an impact on his psychology his world view his attitude towards others not saying you are not unique in your own way it just that stereotypes exist for a reason and it because they are largely true or more often prove true than not so to speak to wit i am certain it possible for a young female named brittany to not be a narcissistic bitch but you know as well as i do that she would be an outlier an exception part of that may be cause effect noted above of the name itself but another part of it is that the very choice of that name is illustrative of the parents view of the child iow parents choose names for their children that are reflective of their own attitudes towards the world attitudes they are likely to imbue the child with and one of the reasons they choose such a name i used to joke that if i ever had married and had daughter s i could easily ensure that they would either never get any dates in school or that dating would be delayed simply by naming them something like hepesiba or brunhilda point being if you have a normal white name then well it not an accident it means your parents wanted you to be normal and to fit in rather than be different and for the most part stereotype statistically speaking you are probably fairly stable and normal in how you interact with people you could even say that the expectations around the name sort of become self fulfilling the really sad thing imo is how few parents seem to comprehend this in a sense the worst motive of many parents are those who choose an abnormal name because they want their child to be different and special not realizing not thinking or perhaps not caring that it also means their child will be essentially cursed in a way a way not of their choosing and that without adding in the fact that children are cruel and adults often as well only difference is that children tend to be cruel to your face and adults behind your back ergo poor little tylenol is going to be burdened with a shitload of jokes around his name what a royal pain he is lol not that there is actually anything wrong per se with either name in and of themselves mind you hepesiba is hebrew for she is my delight and brunhilda is nordic teutonic for noble fighter but at least absent any family heritage that can be used to induce defiant pride in the name like honey we named you after your grandmother she too was named hepesiba and was a great woman the root meanings of those words is irrelevant the colloquial stereotype would interpret them to mean witch on a broom or amazon woman and the thing is there is really a easy way to resolve this if the parent really wants to give the child some weird abnormal name for whatever family or even some freaky reason well they should just make it an extra middle name and give the kid a normal first name that way it up to the kid if john thaddeus jaxxon smith wants to go by jaxxon or even god bless him thad well he certainly can do so but much more likely he can will choose to just be plain old normal john smith or lol he can even go by the cool nickname of tj if he wants ie from john t j smith and no one ever needs to know what the t j stand for unless he chooses to tell them ,6,MGTOW
DWShimoda,btw that is also the reason they both have multiple chins the fact that she burns everything she cooks means for virtually every meal they either eat out at restaurants or else get take away plus i would be willing to bet that she especially favors those smorgasbord buffet style restaurants you know the kind where you sample a little of this a little of that a little of the other thing over there and do not really have to commit to any particular dish and then for desserts well she particularly likes that cream covered coffee colored flavored brown cock erm i meant brown cake stuff what is it called again tear a miss you or something like that also little bit of humorous trivia as a side note tiramisu is italian that literally translates to pick me up ,2,MGTOW
DWShimoda, this guy has to be ultra fucking dumb to be showing up on maury to find out that the obvious mud cuck babies are not his in his defense she pretty much burns everything she cooks so just sayin ,28,MGTOW
DWShimoda, the part that is almost impossible to nail down though which i alluded to in my previous post is what generates the feelz is ever changing so not something static one can look at logically true you can never know for certain what a woman actually feelz about something because first of all what she says she feels is not necessarily what she is actually feeling and secondly because even it if was in fact what she was actually feeling at the moment her brain instructed her vocal cords to make the statement well in even the very brief ethereal moment it takes for that to occur her feelings may very well have changed and no there is no logical or rational basis from which to determine or discern any of that the only thing you can know for certain is that f actual reality is irrelevant to the equation ,2,MGTOW
DWShimoda, but 800 for a single person no probably only about 200 for a single adult woman but then another 200 to 300 per child and she has kids plural so that at least 2 kids probably 3 or 4 and possibly more ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, she also gets 800 00 a month in foodstamps and sells at least 600 of them plus she gets energy assistance that already pays at least half that light bill you know the other bill she suckered him into paying ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, no she thinks knows she can pull the same con on the next guy ftfy note how she stated helping with the kids plural meaning more than one kid and you can be pretty sure that those kids have more than one baby daddy ergo this fool is just yet another in a long line of such fools one after another she not only thinks she can pull the same or a similar con on the next guy she knows from past experience that she almost certainly can do so her only chief problem is dealing with the gaps in between such fools ,2,MGTOW
DWShimoda, one cannot explain female logic actually one can explain it it is simply necessary to comprehend the full implications that female logic is based on the principle of feelz over realz that is so long as something feels real to a female it trumps f actual reality ergo for this woman it feeeeeelz to her like she paying the full 1 200 even if she personally is not paying the entire 1200 therefore her felt perception of it overrides and is more true than the f actual reality that she was only paying 407 but i guarantee the wimminz reading that will all be horrified at how he is abusing her and oppressing her well of course they will and of course from their felt perspective he is abusing oppressing her and he violated her rights by reading the actual rent bill stuff again feelz over realz that as a co renter he has a right to see the actual rent bill just as in agreeing to pay the utility bill he has a right to see that as well and of course also see what she is getting in energy assistance because oh yeah she did not tell him about that either to her that is all just irrelevant f actual stuff and it irrelevant because it ignores how she feeeeeeelz and if she feeeelz violated then per feminine logic and feminist dogma now ensconced in law via things like the duluth model nouveau consent rape laws etc then she has been violated in fact he been effectively raping her see that is the logic feelz over realz that is on display and revealed in things like the line that hilliary clinton stated women have always been the primary victims of war women lose their husbands their fathers their sons in combat that whole line is comprehensible only when you get that it is entirely about feelz over realz see dead men not only tell no tales they no longer feeeeel anything besides they are men therefore their feelings would not count anyway only vagina possessors can feeeel anything that matters ergo the important part to women is what they themselves feeeeel f actual reality that the real victims of war are well everyone the soldiers themselves their children and to a degree their wives girlfriends mothers other family that gets dismissed trivialized because especially to wimminz like hilliary clit on their own feeels even if said feelings are only imaginary are the only thing that matter are all that they really care about any other caring stated or otherwise expressed is simply for manipulation purposes to wit hilliary has never lost anyone to war in fact she never had any relatives or boyfriends etc that were even in the military much less in any war much less have they died in combat but is there any doubt that she nevertheless imagined herself to be among the primary victims of war she was talking about when she made that statement and it was true to her because she felt it should be true in fact one can argue that was the entire basis of her husband appeal to people remember how slick willy stated he could feeeel your pain well now obviously he was not f actually experiencing other peoples pain what he was stating that he was imagining that he knew what it was like or what he thought it might would be like iow policy based on a claim of empathy which in reality was nothing more than solipsistic fiction ,5,MGTOW
DWShimoda, he was in complete shit being in that situation but went out of it like a roaring lion just great he was a complete idiot cuck for having placed himself in it for 10 years the most honest and profound line in the whole piece was the statement he made at the dinner at this point in my life i feel i owe a debt of gratitude to bride and groom because they have opened my eyes to something very important they have showed me that my position in this family is not what i once thought it was it seems instead that i hold the position of an atm good for a stream of money but not much else even then at least at that point in time he was still short of the full mark in his understanding with the not much else at the end because in reality his position was and nothing else period all that he ever was was a sugar daddy atm a patsy sucker who opened his wallet on demand ,22,MGTOW
DWShimoda, he was so fucking smart not to marry into that family yes and yet no i do not think it was intelligence that led him to not marry the mother i think it was simply that the woman saw no need to pressure him to marry i mean seriously why bother with that when he had proved he was a complete and total cuck paying for daughter college buying daughter a car etc and obviously doing that and more for the girlfriend mother as well i mean hell the fact that he had established a joint bank account with the girlfriend well that alone demonstrates massive levels of stupidity although i admit i do not know how he could have thought he was a patriarch in her family without being married to her or having kids he walked right into being the family atm also let be brutally honest here he was simply engaged in self delusion in labeling himself as step dad he was never actually his girlfriend daughter step dad he never legally adopted the daughter and as you note was not even married to the girl mother all that he ever really was to the girl was mommy new ugar daddy atm boyfriend aka beta bux sucker that let them live off him in a parasitic manner no doubt he also delusionally believed that he was uber alpha that by being the rich atm dude he was proving how superior he was to deadbeat chad in reality he was just another cuck sucker and it was his house he could not even pack his shit and make a clean break he had to wait for them to move out and i am sure they dragged their feet and stole his shit to the point where police could get involved actually i do not think he fully realizes just how lucky he was in that regard and side note proof of theft of readily moveable physical goods is very difficult to prove relative to quasi family domicile residents they can and nearly always do simply claim the items were gifts a claim that is nearly impossible to disprove refute the girlfriend mother and or daughter could have easily made a 911 phone call dv accusation etc granted the fact that he had quasi publicly in front of the future in laws created the breakup gave him some at least potential witnesses that the breakup pre dated the accusations and so provide evidence that any such an accusation was false and simply motivated by revenge and or for money but still the gf daughter could have made his life a literal living hell for a good couple of months also legally married or not his action of i transferred the money out of our joint account last night was arguably actionable ie if his gf was more legally savvy she could have really fucked him over on that likewise with the whole this morning i called all the vendors i had written checks to for deposits to refund my money which he may or may not have actually had the legal authority to do depends on whether or not he and he alone had been the one to actually sign the contracts with the vendors iow the contracts were solely with him and not with the gf daughter in fact the total lack of any substantial follow up on the story and that the account has been dead virtually ever since beyond the brief note 6 days later that they had moved out leads me to believe the story is either completely fictional or that he faced some more significant blowback than he anticipated ie lawsuits over the joint bank account money issues canceling of those vendor contracts etc real lesson to be learned here is do not cohabitate and of course do not ever delude yourself regarding women especially single divorced mothers their crotch spawn ,20,MGTOW
DWShimoda,imo most interesting thing about data in that graph http cdn cnsnews com styles content 100p s3 census chart sc 1 jpg is actually less the bit about young people living with parents increase of 8 2 million from 14 7m to 22 9m nor the bit about young people living with spouses decrease of 20 million from 31 9m to 19 9m which is much less dramatic once you look at the unmarried partner increase by 8 5 million from 0 7m to 9 2m it the fact that the 20 million decrease in with spouse did not all shift to the parents home instead i find it interesting to note that the alone category nearly doubled from 3 1m to 5 9m which btw refutes the economic explanation at least as some pervasive cause nationwide and the other category almost tripled from 6 1m to 15 6m with that latter being the largest increase of 9 4 million to me that last speaks to a lot of broken families ie other is defined as living with relatives other than spouse or parents siblings or grandparents and non relative roommates it would be interesting to see the breakdown of this on a more granular level state by state or urban vs suburban vs rural etc ,2,MGTOW
DWShimoda,i disagree i think most of civilization is a gift from mgtow historically bachelors to mankind the vast majority of innovations discoveries and inventions including in the social political spheres was done by single and generally young men betas then accept that gift copy it do the grunt work to spread it expand it and maintain it often in a mediocre if not shitty manner but they rarely actually create much of anything in part because when they are young they are too preoccupied with trying to lock down some piece of pussy and then as they get older they are too exhausted working to try to feed otherwise satisfy the needs wants of the possessor of said pussy and take care of the crotch fruit that come from it ,20,MGTOW
DWShimoda, because cost of living is outrageous and the economy is in the shitter there also no jobs thanks baby boomers not saying your wrong but there are other factors internet smartphones etc seem to be a much bigger part of people lives and so one can communicate and interact with other people individuals and groups your own age mixture of ages and do so without having to leave the house something that really was not possible for previous generations why is that so important well probably one of the chief drivers or motivations for getting your own place years ago even if it was a some tiny shithole you would not let your best friend see was so that you could entirely avoid the dreaded interrogation if when you came in late at night ie where were you who were you with what were you doing why were you out so late and of course then the massive guilt trip of lines like it 3am do you know how worried we were all we could do was imagine your car in some ditch with you dead or dying inside etc etc etc go through that routine half a dozen times especially when you were doing nothing bad simply being with friends talking etc ergo you could not wait to move out from the are nts house so that they would not know at all what you were doing when where or with who and what they do not know cannot hurt them plus they cannot guilt trip you about it anywhere near as much they could try but they had to use paranoid speculation lol they had no solid evidence point is that now with internet smartphones etc well you can chat and otherwise interact with friends anytime and pretty much anywhere 2am in the morning you can do facetime with multiple people if you want and so long as you do so relatively quietly no one is the wiser also families are smaller and houses are often larger one result of that is kids tend not always but often to have their own and fairly sizable bedroom that is a room of their own all to themselves and not shared with some younger older siblings ,3,MGTOW
DWShimoda, in general red pill is just knowledge awareness of the actual reality of something in the world rather than the politically correct propaganda fantasy fictional indoctrination explanations views regarding it so for example red pill awareness of the way banking money credit operate involves really understanding all of the mechanisms especially the privileged status of certain government chartered entities like banks behind the creation of new money via debt iow future debt repayment obligations either personally individually or else on behalf of others ie corporations essentially mortgaging shareholder assets or else government burdening assets incomes of present future generations etc to wit rejecting and alternately both laughing groaning at bemoaning the bs about fractional reserve banking or the array of money multiplier myths including proper understanding of inflation deflation how supply vs demand actually operate including supply demand of credit money etc but what someone does with such knowledge such an awareness that is an altogether different matter one path is to still play the game in essence to beat the game beat the odds to attempt to use the awareness to play the system so to speak to go into the casino with full knowledge not only that the odds are stacked in favor of the house but the specifics of how they are stacked and then generally with some dubious risky plan to work around them other possible paths in many ways the direct opposite are more in the line of the realization playing the game is unlikely to ever result in a real final win and that therefore the best option the only way to truly win is not to play iow to stay out of the proverbial casino altogether or as much as is practical and one can debate or argue the degree to which this is possible or practicable in real life depending on the specific red pill topic issue in the main the vast majority of people play the game without any level of awareness or knowledge of what is really actually going on this is arguably still also very true of many people who claim to have red pill understanding which claim is either partial ie exaggerated or else false lacking or misunderstood ie they may have intellectual understanding of certain aspects but have not fully realized the implications relative to their own choices behavior patterns ,3,MGTOW
DWShimoda, mgtow is not radical or edgy it is simply logical except that when logic and reason and perception of reality have all been cast aside by the mainstream then mgtow by being logical is nevertheless both radical and edgy ,8,MGTOW
DWShimoda,chiefly imo by starting to give a fuck about other things to care substantially more about them instead meaning you have ditched one sort of pre programmed indoctrinated fantasy ideal goal in life the whole blue pill prince finds princess sets up suburban mini mcmansion with white picket fence 2 5 kids presumably one is a midget and a dog well imo you need to replace that with some other fantasy ideal goal in life one that you choose and then aim re program yourself towards maybe it buying building some hunting cabin in the backwoods or the not so back woods but with a drool over workshop multi car garage private forest aka big backyard possibly with some private library home theater and or well whatever it is you are interested in building having doing maybe it has nothing to do with owning a home or castle of your own maybe instead it getting a pilot license and building owning flying experimental ie diy kit aircraft or maybe instead it getting a sailboat or even small yacht and sailing solo around the carribbean crossing the atlantic cruising the pacific or even sailing around the world or instead well again whatever it is that interests you ,3,MGTOW
DWShimoda, yelling about my terminology rotflmao clueless entirely fucking idiotically ignorantly clueless ,2,MGTOW
DWShimoda, if you eat the green kind that is very low carbs lol there is no such thing as a low carb vege or fruit everything labeled low carb really just means that particular vege or fruit ie things like celery is chiefly composed of water and fibers ie cellulose that are non digestible by humans yes even if you are as fat as and people call you a cow and you have a tendency to chew your cud in a metaphorical sense well you still cannot digest cellulose and what that means is that there is essentially zero food value to eating them they are just roughage you may as well eat a sponge or a pile of sawdust soaked in water of course in bad mental flux ooooh bad mental flux cannot that be cured though by flower essences or maybe crystals or sitting and meditating inside of some pyramid maybe you just need to get one of those flux capacitor thingees ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, believe as you wish sorry junior but you cannot magically transform veggies fruit into anything other than carbs just because you want to believe that they are something else because point of fact that what they are ergo your 2 3 veggies and fruits is in fact the very thing a high carb diet which in the previous sentence you stated was bad it will be pointless to argue with you obviously and absolutely because reality is not part of your statements or belief and in fact it entirely refutes your nonsense as i noted you are clueless ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, you have too many things in your life that you do not want to do so you avoid doing them by doing trivial things instead this sounds like op really is not all that interested passionate about things like hard cardio or studying for a certification exam or with latter more likely is he really does not want the certification or possibly even to continue to work or obtain work in the field that requires it he may want the money the work certification supplies but he does not like want the work or skill itself instead most likely those are all things he believes he should do but which he really does not want to do ie the motivation drive for getting them done just is not there not on any internal basis it all external now to be sure there are many things in life particularly life as a full adult that simply have to be done regardless of how passionate or non passionate we feel about the specific task itself but invariably the motivation drive is still an internal one because the tasks are some means to an end some larger goal that we really really do want to achieve to wit even mundane things like doing the laundry or cleaning the bathroom tasks which generally speaking no one really ever wants to do but what they do want is the end result having clean clothes a clean bathroom etc and thus there is satisfaction from doing them and doing them well ,5,MGTOW

DWShimoda, or there is always a simple i tried but no woman would take me tearjerker never hurts to play a victim ie something they can relate to lol i have to admit that on occasion when i really have not felt like answering explaining my single never married status to people that i think of as nosey mother fuckers especially strangers in some scenario i will be unlikely to ever encounter again well sometimes i just decide to fuck with their mind say relatively vague things that insinuate mislead them things like well when you get would ivorce raped in your early 20 you sort of learn your lesson which implies but does not really actually state that that happened to me which it did not but it is pretty much sufficient to end further discussion inquiries and if it does not i can just state somewhat angrily i do not want to talk about that which is a true statement lol or especially n response to the you just have to find the right woman line say something like yeah and then shit happens you find the right one and she dies in a fucking car accident a couple of months before the wedding or just when the relationship starts getting serious from which especially if i add a morose or depressed look to my face or embellish with a sniffle or two around the statement they infer that said tragedy happened to me even though it did not but regardless it effectively and perfectly ends any further questioning and in fact they immediately change the subject often even beg forgiveness and walk away etc there another sort of humorous bonus revelation aspect to this technique and that is you often find out just how much people gossip with each other and or how connected people are ala 6 degrees of kevin bacon https en wikipedia org wiki six degrees of kevin bacon because a few days weeks or months later the story of me being divorced fiancee widowed tragic accident etc gets back to me invariably in some hugely distorted version cf chinese whispers telephone https en wikipedia org wiki chinese whispers so distorted that i can safely honestly say i have no idea how they got that notion i never told anyone anything like that which fucking with them is a highly entertaining thing to do and again since this is with nosey mofo people digging into your personal private affairs w o any real reason well imho they deserve it ,1,MGTOW

DWShimoda, this kinda falls under do not piss off someone with a weapon society has issued many weapons to women and well they get pissed off from time to time add in that on a pretty regular monthly basis women go through rather significant biological hormonally driven mood swings aka pms and rather unpredictable in some cases highly volatile rapid and seemingly inexplicable mood behavior changes as a result those basic monthly mood swings are in most women most of the time somewhat mitigated altered when a woman is on birth control pills but since those pills are themselves mostly just artificial hormones which essentially trick the body into thinking it is already pregnant well the exact total reaction of any specific female to them is more than a bit variable and unpredictable there are a host of side effects http www everydayhealth com news 6 strange side effects birth control pill which include ironically enough even stronger mood swings as well as migraines and depression etc ie which translates into a person on the edge volatile personality likely to get pissed off for any reason or indeed no apparent reason at all and then that to compensate for those unwanted side effects many women are often on one or more other psychoactive medications various anti depressants anti anxiety mood stabilizers etc plus of course both prescription and generic otc pain other medications all of which create a highly unpredictable stew or cocktail of chemicals with complicated interactions that can go awry in any of several different ways at any given moment especially if when she skips a day on any of them and or then doubles down on some subsequent day changing the ingredient ratios of the stew cocktail rather dramatically in a matter of hours even minutes and in a delayed time bomb fashion then of course for the final kicker with most women you can add in a bit and sometimes more than a bit of alcohol of one type or another often with other chemicals as well not to mention still other recreational drugs into the mix and yet more side effects can occur end result is that particularly in western first world nations the typical young woman single married or otherwise is a highly volatile creature not only naturally biologically hormonally due to menstruation which is at least somewhat predictable explicable but also artificially medically pharmacologically which is much less predictable explicable in many cases it probably would not be an exaggeration to state that the inmates of a psychiatric institution are probably on fewer mood altering medications than the typical late teen 20 or 30 something female everything from high and variable doses of caffeine to occasional intermittent use of nicotine pot marijuana and or synthetic cannabinoids like k2 spice to other drugs like ecstasy mdma plus possibly meth cocaine various amphetamines opiates etc often with the women really not even knowing what it is they are ingesting much less the least clue or concern as to the side effects contraindications complications etc because hey they are just partying you know why are you being such a spoil sport who of course will swear that she really not on any many drugs at all she only takes her daily birth control pill well usually daily except when she forgets and then of course her add adhd meds plus for the past few weeks the pills to help take care of that std she picked up a while back oh and that thing the doctor gave them to take care of their acne and the other one to help them not be so depressed plus occasionally some headache pills and every now and then a sleeping pill that one the doctor gave them a prescription for and which really works because the generic ones she was buying just were not working right now to be sure the same kind of array spectrum mixture happens with men too there are increasingly a lot of young men who are taking a large number of medications as well about which they too are generally clueless and that too is not without it bad negative side effects and complications including mood swings unpredictable behavior etc but the base hormonal biology is different in males with men boys there simply is not a natural ovarian hormonal monthly cycle going on underneath which then also changes over time as they age as their body changes diet changes activity level changes etc in short men are hormonally chemically significantly different creatures from women and despite the fact that political correctness is in denial of those differences well that does not alter the actual reality that women are significantly more volatile period pun intended cf http www webmd com add adhd news 20150701 are too many young americans getting antipsychotics for adhd

DWShimoda,well the opening question is almost spot on overwhelmingly this question is posed by women discussed by women and answered by women i say almost because even the question is not posed to men but to other women also this ironically is an essential reason for these so called man deserts men are simply not being asked to contribute their opinions and perspectives and the good men themselves are increasingly less likely to offer their point of view for many reasons that the bold line of course really is not true most of us have not been silent about our point of view ever it just that women quelle surprise do not listen and the media does not want to highlight the point of view of actual good men it does not fit the narrative the one dictated by feminists manginas it really just comes down to something simple i will not date nor marry and absolutely refuse to settle down much less have children with some bitchy insufferable used up slut ho and thanks to feminism manginas and the policies resulting from the narrative that is unfortunately what essentially all modern women have become good men have not gone anywhere it everyone else and society in general that has moved changed ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, he could have visited them i can easily give you half a dozen scenarios where that would not have been true first and simplest is that in the immediate aftermath of kicking him to the curb the wife probably obtained some restraining order against the husband father secondly if the process of doing that involved some accusation of domestic violence and or child abuse well hubby could very easily have simply been sitting in jail as well as having a restraining order against him moreover then had he attempted to visit well the child would not necessarily be aware of it and if there were a restraining no contact order from a court could very easily get him arrested locked up again then the combination of both being locked up plus the negative emotional psychological effects of being removed from his home losing contact with his family undergoing divorce etc well it not uncommon for that to affect a man job performance and or employment situation in fact simply missing a few days from work in jail on a dv charge or violation of a no contact order might have resulted in him losing his job that then can lead to a situation of financial desperation one where his only option is to move some substantial distance away back to his parents assuming they are still living to some siblings or old friends home in another city or state or likewise employment may have made visiting opportunities again at least initially few and far between other explanations regarding the long term reason for him not visiting are along the same lines perhaps she obtained full custody and with accusations of child abuse managed to prevent him from even obtaining visitation rights that actually used to be far more common than it is now then one can add in that a woman who lies especially so substantially to her child about their father is equally capable of lying to the father about the child to wit no dave i do not think you should come to visit johnny janey are still very upset about the divorce and they blame you i know that not fair and i am trying to get them to understand it not your fault buy they just do not accept that and yes they have read your letters they are still angry and well just give them some more time okay all of which would sound reasonable contains a host of lies large and small but is entirely plausible indeed even probable for a woman who has already constructed a web of lies probably not only to children and hubby either also to friends family police courts etc a dad this loving would have fought for his children and how do you know that he did not at least to the extent that it was financially legally possible for him to try all we have here is the viewpoint of and a very limited account of events as seen from a child one who was apparently very young and naive innocent trusting of mother when the breakup divorce initial aftermath occurred ,7,MGTOW
DWShimoda, this happening for real is probably very rare but certainly believable depends on what you mean by very rare primary custody parents alienating their children from their ex and misleading in many cases effectively gas lighting them in regards to factors around marital problems causes of divorce is actually fairly common widespread enough that parental alienation https en wikipedia org wiki parental alienation is a meme among family counseling and other professionals but than again so too is parental alienation syndrome https en wikipedia org wiki parental alienation syndrome which is a substantially different version of the same kind of thing pas is where the child particularly if young when the family breakup occurs misconstrues the situation possibly mis interpets statements to mean something much more and much different than what was actually said per example in this instance it is entirely possible that the child was told some cynical hypothetical like daddy will probably get a new wife new family by the mother and then interpreted understood that to mean their father already had done so now to be sure the mother withholding hiding years worth of t he father letters and presumably birthday cards etc from the child is both a bit extreme and certainly an indictment of the mother motives as is her not correcting her child wrongful understanding of the situation and it also a bit implausible ie letters as the only attempted means of communication but than again we do not really know the totality of the circumstances here was there at least initially some no contact restraining order against him did she accuse the father of child abuse during the divorce that is incredibly common and could easily create a no contact situation or did the financial circumstances force the father to relocate at least initially some substantial distance away ie another state possibly another country and were other forms of communication difficult or prohibitively expensive to that last by default we think in terms of present day cheap pervasive things like cell phones skype email etc but we really do not know when this ostensibly occurred and thus whether those were even available ,11,MGTOW
DWShimoda, there are many reasons to go mgtow but being paranoid of having an oops baby should not be one of them the notion that one should fear having sex because it could result in child support seems like one of those extreme rationalizations which we do not need to justify going our own way ah the youthful immortal it cannot happen to me ,2,MGTOW
DWShimoda,moreover note who or rather what they actually end up marrying in most cases it a used up near wall mediocre at best looking bar fly club princess who herself is simply tired of riding the cc and quite probably has or soon will have baby rabies not surprising really since that majority of the pussy they were pursuing and picking up and then of course wait and see what happens to them 5 years out 7 years 10 years indeed even 20 years chances are majority of them are in store for major problems at various points along those longer timelines and statistically speaking at least half of them will end up being divorce raped and most likely paying chilimony for 10 years with the majority of the remaining half being borderline and probably dead bedroom etc with only a fraction still claiming somewhat dubiously to be happily married all the bs about holding frame is fundamentally irrelevant ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, spinning plates spinning child support payments for sure and in many cases a multi year trail of aborted children as well seriously young guys like many young women may think that wo not come back to haunt them but chances are if they live long enough it will oh to be sure the haunting will be both good bad both the whew instead of paying child support to 1 woman for 1 kid i could have been paying money to 5 women for 5 kids sort of relief but also the inevitable i wonder what those kids would have been like the latter will likely be even more haunting in the cases of guys who are stuck paying for a daughter or two and who will realize that they probably aborted or allowed enabled to be aborted the kid that would have been their son ,6,MGTOW

DWShimoda,1 note the extreme degree of hypocrisy both relative to gender and to race so much for the decades of bullshit that race was irrelevant and that the two genders were equal much less the past farcical decade or so of gender ambiguity fluidity and to the root concept of democracy 2 dumbass bitches like the author of that pile of steaming tripe still have not digested the real lesson of 2016 that their reign of bullshit is over and that any attempt to push their crap further will be met with an even bigger loss 3 they are actually so incredibly stupid that they believe they would fare better under non white men rotflmao 4 it proves that they do not have a clue where all of the affluence which they live in and enjoy actually comes from they are like children whi think if they could only kick the parents out of the home they could eat cookies ice cream forever that there a magic machine which just provides an endless supply but all that said we should welcome even more of these kinds of articles let them reel out the rope with which they themselves can will hang from until dead dead dead because you see by re opening the debate about who should be allowed to vote and moreover by positing arbitrary criteria and better still of both gender and race they have abandoned all pretense to the argument being based on some universal egalitarianism or equality it simply empowers and enables nay it fully justifies an opposing backlash then ending of voting for women or non whites ,2,MGTOW
DWShimoda, yes it is a potential hassel because saying something like that to a woman can create undesirable concequences lol again junior you have already admitted that while i am talking from experience you have also admitted that you are talking from a complete lack of any experience iow you do not know your ass from a hole in the ground if you want the no bullshit approach you cut call ties and be gone you have just received a serious threat and your entire response is to slink yes junior not walk but slink away with your tail tucked between your legs that is going to create undesirable consequences what you suggest by saying something like if you ever hit me etc is throwing gasoline on the fire no dipshit it is not again you have shitty reading comprehension skills worse even than your spelling this is a hypothetical that is being discussed in a chat conversation form what my action is verifying is that her shit tests mean shit to me no what it is verifying demonstrating is that your a complete wuss she will probably kick you in the ass as you depart just because she knows she can note my response does not indicate whether i would or would not hit her back oh it a given you are entirely incapable of it if she hit you you would crumple into a little ball crying off in some corner you are extremely argumentative and confrontational in your verbiage are you trying to make up for something lol junior shove your neurotic projection crap back up your own ass pull the but plug dildo out first then reinsert it afterwards ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, i should have added a biased experienced perspective and explained more while not impossible it is difficult to learn from the experience of others without experiencing our own version of it no junior i am laughing my ass off at the ridiculous notion you seem to have contrived or been fed that objectivity is distinct or separate from experience and that it objectivity can be attained somehow sans experience does not work like that what also does not work is you expressing that someone a person fundamentally without experience can somehow assert with any validity whatsoever that something is hard or difficult by definition they cannot they have no experiential standard to judge against to such a non experienced person everything will be hard difficult such an individual will cry loudly continually while taking a shit or at the least rumble of hunger or even unfamiliar sensation the dropping of a pin so to speak or be in terror over monsters under the bed etc such an individual would of course be a child an infant and that really what we are talking about here is not it an infantile response versus an adult response what we have in the current era is an entire generation of quasi adult infants people who emotionally psychologically and experientially are little more than children even though they inhabit physically adult bodies ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, not really yes really you are talking about actions in real life i was referring to creating psychological impressions around some hypothetical the scenario here is of people bf gf chatting about what would he do if she not actually testing this out physically she positing it as a question verbally textually women are not worth that kind of hassel what hassle again the scenario is a conversation verbal or text with someone you are going to be responding somehow and some whisper in the ear of sweetie if you ever hit me you will learn what real pain feels like is no hassle at all and egads paired with your response from the other thread as to what you think pain suffering are wow you have obviously led the life of a boy in a bubble has your obviously single mommy actually physically clothed you with multiple layers of bubble wrap or did she just do so metaphorically moreover in that scenario walking away without first responding in kind verbally and creating a very real fear a sensory image of significant physical pain suffering within her mind well you are going to have actually increased the chances that she going to someday not only physically assault you herself but you have also increased the likelihood that she will see you as an easy mark for anything else including police why because she envisions zero cost or consequence to herself you have just responded to her shit test by verifying she will suffer no harm regardless of what she does op by stating even just minimally that yes he would hit her back has effectively deflected that iow you are probably created more hassles for yourself in the future especially if this becomes your default response well you have virtually guaranteed yourself more hassles ,1,MGTOW

DWShimoda, once you hit a girl she calls the cops so while she getting banged by dudes this is an entirely mistaken understanding of how it actually works in reality she calls the cops when and only when she wants to hit you by proxy via the police dv charge it an action that is akin to swatting https en wikipedia org wiki swatting and it is not generally done in reaction to actual domestic violence in fact it can be and very often is done when the accused has done nothing at all ie your walk away scenario all she has to do is say you hit her or grabbed her in a violent manner if she wants and or has decided to seriously create evidence then she can quite easily bruise herself in a manner that will be considered plausible evidence of her story ergo walking away is no guarantee of anything at all it certainly no guarantee against a dv charge better alternative is that when presented with this kind of a hypothetical if i were to hit you line you convince her and leave her with zero doubt that in such a scenario she would suffer significantly greater pain from your reaction than she could possibly inflict on you ie if she were ever to hit or slap you you will respond with an overwhelmingly larger reactive defensive return force you will smack her down period you must not forget that women are about feeelings and one of the chief things they feel and fear is real physical pain moreover the psychology of the bully and or mean gurl same thing is such that they fully expect you to do nothing and they only respect the potential of greater force see the line of thought that if and only if i hit her back then she will call the police and i will then go to jail that is a logical rational line of thinking but women do not use that method they use feeling past feelings present feelings projections of feelings possible probable future feelings etc they are extremely self centered animals they do not see the world as some logical rational cause and effect but rather as how can i make the world accommodate my feelings ergo the use of police the domestic violence one phone call that is not something she does as some actual victim in response to some singular hit hit back scenario instead it a weapon tool she holds in reserve to use for her own purposes and generally only when it suits her on her timing not yours ,3,MGTOW

DWShimoda, it all sounds very attention seeking and i cannot but feel guilt when asking for someone who is genuinely interested in helping to get me what i need on a spiritual physical and emotional level yes it sounds attention seeking actually affection seeking and it entirely natural normal human beings like all primates higher lower and indeed like most mammals higher lower are social animals that is we are sort of biologically genetically programmed to live in groups to give and receive physical even intimate contact with others of our own species our own family and or tribe note intimate contact does not only refer to sexual contact it can and does include an entire spectrum or array of activities from grooming physical body grooming especially of areas out of one personal reach ie your hair particularly on the back of your head your literal back spine area even feet etc and keep in mind here we are talking about things that were the norm in pre modern life everything from helping to examine remove ticks to cutting hair prior to the existence of commercial barbers doctors etc to trimming nails to treating wounds removing thorns splinters etc it is our modern actually post modern society that is entirely fucked up in this regard a big part of the blame lies with freudian psychology and the implication by from it that everything is sexual including the notion which would previously have been seen as absurd that human sexuality is dichotomic that is the concept stemming only from the late 19th century and taking about 60 to 80 years before it became accepted across all classes pervasive in western culture that people are either heterosexual or homosexual and the combination of that notion the hetero homo divide then with the freudian idea that everything is sexual which is why any all same sex relationships have become suspect under the sickening insinuation that they are really latently or subconsciously homo sexual in underlying motive iow once you are past puberty and these days with the push to force sexual education indoctrination down onto younger and younger age kids even prior to that any and all physical contact especially anything affectionate is interpreted as being sexual the end result is the ridiculous aspect that men or indeed even boys cannot hold hands with each other cannot give or receive any physical touch from another except in very rare instances ie in the aftermath of some traumatic event funerals accidents etc or else say encountering some friend you have not seen in years you are allowed to engage in a brief hug but of course it even then in those rare exception circumstances per the cultural norm it has to be kept brief and even arguably cut short a quick hug back pat accompanied by some explicating explanatory verbal statement like man good to see you again or sorry for your loss etc you are not allowed by the absurd cultural norms to sit together hold hands to truly offer comfort much less hug for some extended time cry on the other shoulder and still less be able to fall asleep in some other man arms etc to do so even to feel some need toward that is taboo or else an admission that aha we knew it you are gay queer it was not always so this modern taboo is not the historical norm it is this modern or again post modern viewpoint that is the aberration one of the highly unfortunate results of it is that all affection get focused by society onto the sexual relationships activities it just about the only accepted means venue especially for boys men to attempt to satiate the larger need for human touch even things like getting a massage even if when entirely platonic and non sexual by intent agreement are sadly seen as insinuated as being sexual but again from a historical perspective that is not the norm prior to the 19th 20th century psychobabble bullshit and one can add in modern affluence technology in terms of homes heating bedding etc it was quite common for example for people both related and or simply companions to sleep together simply for warmth safety and sleep together was not a euphemism for sex likewise with the other aforementioned activities grooming etc there was a real natural normal need for friends family to physically care for one another in ways that necessitated touch including rubbing caressing per example scrubbing someone else back in a bath etc moreover you can proof this for yourself in how other creatures dogs cats respond so positively to having their spine and or belly rubbed an activity that also has a calming soothing even affectionate touch need satiating effect on you as the petter yet is entirely non sexual at least unless you are really weird you are not going to get a hard on petting some dog or cat alas knowing this while it helps ie you understand that there is nothing wrong with your internal need for affectionate touch etc you are not crazy and your need is not entirely sexual also you can ditch the guilt nevertheless all that said it does not really and certainly not entirely fully alleviate the problem you are still stuck in a society that has entirely fucked up taboos about this stuff and so you are unlikely to be able to just shrug off those taboos and even less likely to encounter anyone else who is able to equally shrug them off in a similar manner and unfortunately things like this seldom get resolved or changed in anything like the kind of time that you we need they are things that take a generation or more to change just as the freudian bullshit took nearly a generation or more to become the norm and keep in mind that sigmund freud was well to be blunt about it he was fucked in the head not only was he a massive drug addict cocaine etc but he had a whole shitload of mommy and daddy issues as well as sibling friend problems basically all of his theories had absolutely nothing to do with normal humans much less normal sexuality and normal intimacy affection but instead were a projection of his own fucked up family personal relations and those of the equally abnormal little cliques he grew up among etc the same with many of his associates and chosen colleagues and then followers disciples etc btw you want to talk about fucked up absurd bullshit look no further than freud buddy wilhelm fliess and his nasogenital reflex theory that right that the nose and sinuses were sexual organs etc and no not just in the sense of smell or even pheromones but in truly fucked and absurdly idiotic abstract ways ie blowing nose taking snuff etc were

DWShimoda, sat in a wal mart parking lot last week for 30 minutes in that short time i witnessed this type of exchange happen 7 times must have been the time of day friday around 5pm in each instance the mother would stay in the vehicle that the kids would enthusiastically rush out of can confirm i have seen this exact kind of thing many many times over the years and in many different locations ie each locale i have lived in and a few that i was only visiting on contract work nearly always friday afternoons evenings and nearly always at some prominent chain store restaurant like mcdonalds or walmart but also at like large truck stop type gas station restaurant things right near a freeway exit it painfully obvious that there is little love or else at least that familiarity breeds contempt between the kids and the mom because it not just that the kids do not hang around to give goodbye hug to mom it that she does not seem to care one way or another certainly makes no motion effort to demonstrate it the conclusion i have reached based only partly on this but nevertheless confirmed by it is that the kids and this mandatory exchange are really little more than a resource leverage for her to extract her monthly checks from the ex they are a meal ticket it also painfully obvious that the location was is chosen for her convenience iow least possible effort for her in finding reaching the location ie big high huge sign that can be seen from a mile away now granted selecting some prominent landmark location for a meetup is a common enough thing with people who are total strangers to each other and or the locale and i also get that he probably on his way home from work and so those locations are possibly more convenient for him as well it made me want to design a specific location store for child exchanges no longer will parents have to decide debate on meeting their ex at wal mart the bank or mcdonalds now everyone can just head to it my weekend it my weekend features a gift shop for those dads so determined to buy back their kids affection every imw will also feature a starbucks so those ultra sexy busy moms can grab a latte on their way to chads imw come standard with always on audio and video monitoring every parking space so no more he said she said your honor fears it my weekend coming soon to a city near you i think that a valid business idea except it can probably be improved in several ways chief among then to provide features services so that both parents need not be present at the same time including 1 a sort of a secure holding area ie surveillance cameras controlled entry exit etc where the kids can be dropped off in advance hang around for an hour or two etc 2 obviously some sort date timestamped receipt system for the parents both when they dropped off when they picked up etc this could probably be an app on a smartphone 3 some amenity to keep the kids happy complacent while they wait which these days all you would probably need provide would be sodapop wifi and the ability to plug in recharge their smart phones phablets tablets 4 in addition to the gift shop you could probably have some basic necessity supplies toothpaste toothbrush etc in fact rather than sell individual items it would probably be even more profitable to simply sell them as pre configured kits and this could even include things like underwear sleepwear packages possibly even seasonal clothing brand name nike nfl team etc logos for the high end packages generic stuff for the low end 5 could probably even add on some kind of a pharmacy as well perhaps an instore mini walgreens counter possibly even an automatic vending machine after all a substantial number of kids are on one type of meds or another and iirc the rate is far higher for kids from divorced families and i can easily see that like toothpaste undergarments the kids meds might easily be forgotten oh and as for the name something like kid swap tm or perhaps parent exchange tm would be catchier than the rather ambiguous it my weekend ,4,MGTOW

DWShimoda, over 50 no hope for old men i was taking about men in thier 30s lol except they did not start the behavior pattern of feeding the parasites at age 50 most of them started that long before in their 30 or even 20 often all that changes post first divorce whether at 35 or 45 is the specific group of parasites being fed well that and the amounts they can do squander on them usually much higher which is largely a function of time because with the exception of the dot com billion dollar unicorn startup things most wealthy successful men get that way via either having made really good investments the gains from which continue to multiply and generally do so faster and faster at least as long as they are not spending down all the gains or tapping the core investment or else via some involvement expansion of a family business usually as second generation owners which they often do not really inherit the wealth from nor gain full ownership control over until late 40 or 50 ie when their parents the first founding generation of the business passes on at age 75 or so give or take a decade so i suppose its rather understandable that given the order of magnitude or more increase in their net worth they tend to me a lot more generous with the second set of parasites than they were with the first set and it even possible that on a relative basis versus say a tenfold or more increase in net worth income that say a 5 fold increase in what they squander on the second set of parasites is in fact still being somewhat of a tight wad to wit a 35 or 40 year old guy who works hard to make 100 k a year is likely to view a 20k car for his kid to be extravagant enough whereas someone 50 who has multiple millions coming in each year especially if passive capital gains even a 100k car is not really all that extravagant the former being somewhat of sacrifice relative to income net worth and the latter being almost trivial pocket change by comparison ,2,MGTOW
DWShimoda, i know very few successful men taking care of parasites these days perhaps you need to get out about more seriously i know several very successful men ie wealthy even despite having been divorce raped by wife 1 who are in fact taking care of parasites ie divorced woman wife 2 or live in girlfriend and her crotch spawn they literally seem to glory in it often in several rather sickening ways spending insane amounts of money on the new wife gf and step kids who very often are not really wife or step kids in that they have not legally married the mom much less adopted the kids whereas they were tight wads with their own biological children which obviously pisses the latter off to no end so alas more the pity ime it not a myth in fact i would say about 3 4 of the truly wealthy over 50 guys i know are now in that exact kind of feed the parasites scenario ,3,MGTOW
DWShimoda, almost all the women i know will be either alone banging less desirable men for attention or a single mother once they pass 30 ftfy i see serious changes coming over the next 5 10 years in society see previous btw it already been happening on a steady upward curve see the unbelievable rise of single motherhood in america over the last 50 years https www washingtonpost com news wonk wp 2014 12 18 the unbelievable rise of single motherhood in america over the last 50 years and note the date on that 2014 why note the date because a while back ok at the turn of the millennium a whole host of articles like this one the rise and fall of single parent families http www prb org publications articles 2001 theriseandfallofsingleparentfamilies aspx attempted to claim that we would already seen peak single mommy but as the graph https img washingtonpost com wp apps imrs php src https img washingtonpost com blogs wonkblog files 2014 12 ednext xv 2 mclanahan fig02 small jpg w 480 from the 2014 article revealed no such peak was reached unless you are looking only at the black demographic ie at around 70 of kids give or take a percentage point or two that approx 70 of kids born to unwed mothers is where all of the demographic groups are headed hispanics have nearly reached it already and whites are not far behind note also that is the mother marital status at time of the child birth it is not including divorcee nor is including cucked guys ie beta bux sucker cuckolds who man up and marry some single mom whore and help raise her child ren fathered by other men for that you need to look at this graph https img washingtonpost com wp apps imrs php src https img washingtonpost com blogs wonkblog files 2014 12 ednext xv 2 mclanahan fig01 small jpg w 480 and then try to suss out the implications from the previous graph basically what it comes down to is that about 3 out of every 4 kids will be illegitimate aka bastards and 2 out of those 3 and thus 2 out of every 4 total or 50 of kids will never have a dad not even a step dad moreover it also means that the remaining 1 out of the 3 plus the remaining 1 out of the other 4 the 2 who will have a dad well at least half and probably more like 2 3 or 70 of those dads will not be the biological fathers of the kids but will instead either be beta bux cucks or else guys who marry divorcee and in many cases are probably themselves divorced from a previous wife now you can see why the media is trying to normalize cuckoldry because it becoming the norm also about a decade or so from now all of that significantly higher percentage of never married single moms and it going to reach about 50 total in all demographics just as it has among blacks is going to be putting a massive strain on the welfare system right about the same time that the biggest strain is also being placed on things like social security and medicare etc because the number of guys that go mgtow is not going to change the ability of women to get pregnant it just going to change who they get pregnant by ie who the baby daddy is all of that again together with the mass strain of en masse baby boom generation retirement sucking entitlements not to mention the likely still very large mass of immigrants doing likewise is going to collapse the welfare state in one way or another exactly what happens then is anyone guess but personally i figure the most likely end result of the scenarios for the united states and after some interim chaos will be something akin to the breakup of the soviet union various states or groups of states in certain regions splitting off into their own entities in some form or another chiefly because politicos will see the ability to tax lay tariffs on commerce between states will be their financial solution probably wo not actually work but it will be something they can pitch and ride into power what that implies then is that in terms of what changes will happen in society ie social mores etc there is not likely to be a single result rather the various new independent states regions hunger game districts will probably end up going along significantly different paths depending on what the racial ethnic demographic makeup of the state region consists of to wit california or at least southern middle california and possibly other sw states will likely end up similar to mexico other hispanic majority nation states regions texas will split off and or attempt to create some region extending north into oklahoma kansas other great plains states and become some authoritarian bible region country so called anyway the deep south will be a mixed mess and the midwest great lakes area aka farmland usa as well as the northeast new england well who the hell knows chief take home point here is that there very likely wo not be just some singular culture change rather there will be several disparate distinctly different cultures also same kind of breakup is likely going to happen to other large federated regions the eu ai not going to survive it going to break up and probably in a fairly nasty fashion good chance that the same will happen with canada and even possibly australia etc basically lots of boundary redraws which of course really is not anything new it the kind of thing that has been happening all throughout history national borders are historically speaking rather ephemeral things ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, i would have thought that this would be one of the last products to be sold with sex and yet they found a way note that the female is already sold on the idea and that the male has to be persuaded that may be a lesson here for all of us you are right but it does so many other things beyond using sex to sell a diarrhea cure that i actually overlooked that part instead i noted that 1 it literally portrays men as piles of shit something that realistically makes zero sense relative to diarrhea and in terms of factual reality i cannot say that i have ever seen any excrement human or otherwise come out looking like that type of a chocolate soft serve ice cream spiral shape that just one more example of how unreal ignorant avoidant of actual reality the mainstream is it cannot even envision or conceptualize much less portray a turd as anything but an farcical unreal even cartoonish caricature 2 it portrays a woman women as the cure to what ails men those piles of shit men 3 and then ironically humorously the other woman is portrayed as essentially a hole or a doughnut shape surrounding a hole ,4,MGTOW
DWShimoda, yawn i simply noted that the winning lottery ticket you believe you have obtained is far more rare and much more a matter of luck than you imagine junior i am not the one who is of small experience nor close minded in fact quite the opposite so you can shove your petulant insults right back up the aboral orifice that they seem to have eminated from ,0,financialindependence

DWShimoda, there are plenty of married fi couples who have posted on here the ones who had the same experience as me in finding a spouse with same goals 1 you seem to not understand that the term plenty is statistically irrelevant 2 your reading comprehension skills are apparently in need of some remedial work you are just discounting it as a possibility because it does not fit your worldview actually junior that what you are doing i was speaking to probabilities and likelihoods both across broad populations and broad time periods i am happy for you for your lottery wins ie both your luck in finding a mate that at least apparently and so far seems to share your life goals and behavior patterns as well as your luck and it is luck in having been born into both the us and living in an era where the present wholly inordinately strong dollar lets you bounce around the world and play raj for a pittance to say nothing of the federal reserve qe driven wealth effect on your investments also good luck with all of those in the future ,0,financialindependence
DWShimoda, your gender stereotyping is cute and all yawn delude yourself all you want stereotypes exist for a reason reality is what it is period my wife and i lived in a simple 2br townhome that was no bigger than what i would have owned if i was single i did not use paper plates before i married her we still used towels multiple times after married etc we retired in our 40s and enjoying traveling the world full time ayah sure thing sorry i do not buy any of that and even if it were or is true well there are rare and sometimes even just lucky exceptions to everything some people might even only have ever bought one lottery ticket and won some big prize does not alter the fact that buying lottery tickets is a fool game ,-1,financialindependence
DWShimoda, so how do i distance myself from these people and find more conservative friends i often get nervous to put myself out there in case they think i am a muslim and immediately pull back any suggestions you could buy start wearing one of those red maga hats that probably the easiest fastest and most succinct way of shutting liberals up and basically advertising that you are want conservative friends ,1,MGTOW

DWShimoda,well einstein was simply looking for a really big number ie fast speed he apparently considered using the speed of a woman ability to change her mind but unlike the speed of light that was apparently so fast that they were incapable of measuring it with any known apparatus plus of course there with women there was the uncertainty factor of determining exactly what the woman believed at any point in time apparently it akin to trying to determine the position and the speed of an electron iow by the time you have determined what a woman thinks chances are she already changed her mind yet again ,4,MGTOW
DWShimoda, but two people do not double cost of living they should not and certainly do not have to but the reality is that they all too often do double the cost of living and sometimes more than double it housing food utilities are all cheaper for a couple versus onex2 you would think so but again in reality it seldom works out that way especially for men single men generally have minimal low housing costs do not really give a shit about the homes curb appeal or the areas trendy aspects much less do they worry about being in a good school district several times higher property taxes per 100k valuation married couples are an entirely different story wife generally wants all of those curb appeal trendy location good school district even if only on the chance of kids in the future so instead of some small 100k house they purchase a 300 k mcmansion and instead of paying the place off in 10 years the mortgage gets carried out 30 years and very likely with a refinance upscale sale purchase in between extending it out even further then instead of monthly utilities of under 100 smaller home not only less sq footage but significantly less cubic volume to heat light etc well said mcmansion cathedral ceilings extra unoccupied bedrooms additional baths etc is likely to have monthly utilities of 200 300 even 400 or more per month nor is it space alone that is the difference bachelor lifestyle paper plates instead of dishwasher use towels multiple times before washing etc versus married lifestyle dishwasher more than 2x laundry probably 3x or 4x plus did you take a shower tonight with of course fresh towels etc not to mention married with kids well it all adds up ,3,financialindependence
DWShimoda, holy shit this is scary his before plan is exactly mine right now 10 more years until fi and im in it too well it not exactly some unique plan around a decade give or take a few years of working saving investing and paying off mortgage etc is actually about all that any single guy really requires presuming he stays single and childless and lives fairly frugally but add in a wife and or children and just as a general rule of thumb you can tack on an additional decade or so of work for each extra person in his household it really should not be that much more it arguably does not have to be that much more after all each person does not require a full house nor even the equivalent cost of one but in the main that how it works out because cost of home is usually not simply a factor of tacking on an extra bedroom or two but rather becomes far more grandiose and likewise with other costs most of which are wants rather than actual needs ,2,MGTOW
DWShimoda, what is even more terrifying is the blatant downplay of his commitment to a handful of extra years yes 22 years is just a handful yeah his plan went from retire after 10 years of working to retire after 32 years of working he more than tripled the length of his indenture yes 22 years is just a handful i suppose it depends perhaps he has 22 fingers on each hand also highly unlikely he will actually be retiring at 57 that the best case scenario if everything works out tick tock like clockwork since he was not able to stick to his original plan despite it being only 10 years well what do you think the chances are of his sticking to the revised plan for another 17 years ie that is of course the latest revision because no doubt there were several other revised plans in between all of which he broke screwed up like the buying of the house at the peak of the bubble oops not to mention the kids and those lavish vacations with the kids etc etc and as i noted in another thread his plan is entirely assuming that no major bad things happen no stock market crash no undermining changing of the gummint pension program and 17 years from now well let just say that not a guarantee i would want to bet on and of course it presuming that wifey does not divorce rape his arse and burden him with alimony chilimony to take allthemoney while she goes off to take a couple of vacations on the cock carousel not to mention a host of other fairly probable things daughter gets preggers son gets some chick preggers one of the kids gets some drink drug or other criminal case and of course tons of money wasted on college etc which he probably still at least a decade away from even being fully aware of and with zero idea what the cost will be but to be sure if wifey has convinced him that lavish vacations multiple per year every year are necessary for the family then is there any doubt that she will likewise demand he fully fund 4 5 even 6 or 7 years of schooling each for little princess and or princeling most likely outcome for this guy is that he retires at 68 and keels over a year or two later so maybe it is a good thing he taking vacations now because he unlikely to be able to do so in retirement ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda,marriage is only part of his problem despite claims of frugality he doing the keep up with the joneses routine to wit then i got married bought a house at the peak of the bubble and had kids you can betch your bottom that the house he bought was a swankly mcmansion with great curbside appeal ie a fugly faux facade and purportedly high resale value iow a new subdivision that was trendy hot in demand waaaaay overpriced also chances are if he bought at near the peak of the bubble he not only waaaaay overpaid but he probably did not put diddly squat down as a downpayment iow he does not have anything for equity in the place even 10 years later not that he learned any lessons from that because one side of the dichotomy is about having as many fulfilling experiences as possible i take full advantage of the 26 paid vacation days i get per year we take no less than 3 full vacations combined with some mini vacations like an amusement park road trip to end summer break translations fulfilling experiences and full vacations means flying the whole gang to some expensive and trendy fashionable tourist resort spot and apparently during the peak of the summer season when prices for such things are at their highest also if the mini vacations are amusement park road trips well those in and of themselves are not cheap these days usually a 50 per person single day ticket in his case x 4 200 but that pretty much revalidates those full vacations a big dollar vacations he blowing a good couple of grand on each one possibly a grand or more per person per trip then time 3 each year i have no doubt he is thoroughly convinced and no doubt wifey plays a part in that that those multiple annual full vacations no doubt to some disney destination the hawaiian islands and or cruises to europe the med caribbean etc are all the only and entirely necessary way to build so called quality memories with his kids what he really doing with them though is turning them into entitled spoiled brats and in the end not really spending much actual quality time with the kids i mean standing in line for yet another bullshit disney ride is not really quality time with dad though i guess it depends on your definition of quality i also noted one other thing in response to someone else who stated they take lavish vacations he replied the people who are envious about me going on another cruise ergo basically he engaged in not only conspicuous consumption but his primary motive seems to be to specifically create envy ie invidious consumption iow he wants to pretend to be the joneses that everyone else is envious of my prediction his revised plan retire at 57 17 years in the future will have to be revised pushed back again and again and in fact since he a gummint employee i would be willing to bet that despite the claim of plenty of other assets the chief thing he is relying upon for that retirement is the gummint pension good luck with that 17 years from now assuming it even still exists likewise the investing savvy of an individual who bought a home at the peak of the housing bubble well pardon me if i rather doubt it really all that savvy seems to me more likely to be the type that would invest in enron or it present day counterpart tsla and then spend the wealth effect before actually realizing the gains ie selling the stock market crash and or enron style fraud reveal and poof all of those imputed purported gains can vanish in the blink of an eye and of course all of that is assuming his wife does not get tired of and divorce rape his arse in the next decade or so not to mention the college for the kiddies etc ,3,MGTOW

DWShimoda, i also find it somewhat interesting that the two youngest justices dissented on roe v wade interesting indeed to me it is very revealing even more so about what the likely underlying real reasons for the decision of the other seven actually was by actually i do not mean the stated published reasoning humans most often make decisions come to conclusions about things relatively subconsciously and then they try to justify those decisions as rehnquist noted speaking about the other seven justices rationale justification to reach its result the court necessarily has had to find within the scope of the fourteenth amendment a right that was apparently completely unknown to the drafters of the amendment as early as 1821 the first state law dealing directly with abortion was enacted by the connecticut legislature by the time of the adoption of the fourteenth amendment in 1868 there were at least 36 laws enacted by state or territorial legislatures limiting abortion while many states have amended or updated their laws 21 of the laws on the books in 1868 remain in effect today from this historical record rehnquist concluded there apparently was no question concerning the validity of this provision or of any of the other state statutes when the fourteenth amendment was adopted therefore in his view the drafters did not intend to have the fourteenth amendment withdraw from the states the power to legislate with respect to this matter this kind of contortionistic rationalization justification well it prime evidence of ex post facto reasoning ie first they came to a conclusion decision then they went in search of some semi plausible basis for it and it is here that i think the ages of the justices is so revealing see the two younger justices being born in 1917 white and 1924 rehnquist well they did not reach adulthood or attend college or finish law school until the late 1930 white or post wwii rehnquist era what is important about that in the run up to and during wwii in largely due to the propaganda against nazi germany there had been a sort of sea change or paradigm shift regarding race and particularly eugenics and both white and rehnquist legal education careers were in that post new deal post wwii environment prior to that something that has long since been effectively dropped down the memory hole of history the prevailing mood or sentiment shall we say of the elite east coast establishment and thus the legal profession was of social darwinism including the belief in eugenics dysgenics and the practice of sterilization of lower classes morons etc much like the real reasoning behind lbj so called great society welfare programs which was actually to undermine the minority communities and make them trap them into being dependents upon a paternalistic state and voting democrat lbj and the democratic party had not stopped being racist they simply changed tactics strategies in the execution of their racism well i think likewise the real reasoning possibly even subconsciously of the seven justices who wrote roe v wade was actually a continued belief in eugenics sterilization etc and this is much less of a stretch than people nowadays might imagine after all the entire foundational purpose of planned parenthood and the previously well known beliefs of it founder margaret sanger were to reduce the number of negroes and other lower class children that the procreation of specific groups of people should be stopped and to do so chiefly via foeticide infanticide euphemistically referred to as aborting a pregnancy but as so often happens when people engage in such significant dishonesty and duplicity including self deception they end up choosing doing things that have entirely unexpected and unintended consequences and in this case creating or distorting corrupting an entire society a society that is then subsequently fundamentally built on lies ie a shitload of euphemisms and false rationales justifications for it policies not only fraudulent but farcical iow it backfires on them as should not be surprising because when you engage in faulty even faux reasoning again ex post facto justifications you get a distorted faulty world view it like creating a ridiculously contorted equation to justify a current numerical value is it any wonder then that the future projections based on that falsely contrived equation will be gradually then with each subsequent iteration more and more horrendously off ,1,MGTOW

DWShimoda, same deal with youtube the way people waste their lives being miserable and passive envious cucks on facebook and social media sickens me yeah i mean i can see that both youtube and fakebook have their place there are valid solid even positive things that they can be used for but alas as with any tool they are all too frequently misused abused with youtube as i have noted it really can be a major positive in the ability to show see information that really cannot be conveyed in any other format visual moving images but that a vastly different thing than the typical and all too pervasive talking bobbing head things those are mostly just time sinks and ego boosting resource redistributing for to pretty people etc and then with facebook well it one thing to keep in touch with or even keep up with happenings with friends family especially distant but it quite another the way fakebook is too frequently being used and obviously what is being pushed basically stalking and gossip and bragging and so driving a lot of not only karma whoring but invidious consumption that is consumption purchases made strictly only to create envy in others http www aspiarh com invidious consumption to an extent that imo that stuff has become so prevalent that for many people well the detrimental aspects far outweigh the beneficial ones worse people no longer even seem to make any effort to communicate privately one to one they simply expect that posting something to fakebook is sufficient to the point that the ignore other forms of communication email regular mail regular phone calls etc ,2,MGTOW
DWShimoda,here a couple of other simple things to change your mind attitude and to get r dun most people tend to blow things up out of proportion that is we make some job bigger in our minds so big that we cannot hope to complete it in some conversely shrunk period of time and then we use that combination as an excuse to do nothing instead we do it with both time and money per example people will rationalize with a valid basis that even if i were able to save my entire paycheck this whole year i would never be able to buy a house with it which is a true statement for 99 9999 of people but of course you cannot swallow an elephant whole so to speak yet you can in fact eat a whole elephant if you do it a little bit at a time couple of pounds of meat per day ergo instead of allowing your brain to oversize the task and to undersize the amount of time you need to do the opposite you need to chop up the task into manage portions portions that you can realistically devour achieve in a reasonable amount of time so instead of envisioning buying a house with a single year salary you set the goal to be save up a downpayment and on a small modest sized aka cheap home and you set the timeframe to be a couple of years then you further reduce that to saving a portion of a down payment this year even if it only 10 of a 10 downpayment it makes it doable especially if you divide it down further into some trivial amount to be set aside each week or each paycheck even just 20 a week an amount many people blow at starbucks or mcd x 50 weeks in a year is 1 000 that not going to buy a house but it a good start on saving up a small downpayment on a starter home the same thing when it comes to even more mundane things say the kitchen sink has gotten full of dishes a week or more worth we avoid doing them especially washing by hand because we dread spending an hour or two doing nothing but dishes but if you set your goal to be just washing the utensils the forks knives spoons well that probably is not multiple hours it maybe 15 minutes worth and of course you can conveniently subdivide that into 5 minutes of a goal of washing the forks then the next trip through the kitchen another 5 minutes of washing the knives then the spoons then you move onto the cups glasses plates etc several little 5 minute things at a time and you will soon have the big dreaded task cut down to the point where you can see the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel and you will probably be motivated enough to clean up the rest and as absurd as that statement sounds i have heard exactly that and variations of it about buying a car even buying a computer or some other tool project etc the specific timeframe of earning is always pre selected so as to be absurd impractical relative to the goal ergo house vs annual income car vs summer 3 to 6 months of paychecks computer versus single paycheck etc yet of course these same people have zero problem managing to come up with some means of buying a smartphone and or new fad fashion clothes not to mention drinks drugs club hopping fast food etc and of course an alternate reason for the i cannot save pay cash is that it rationalizes the use of the credit card made even worse with so called rewards cards ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, also get the fuck out of social media fb twitter snapchat etc it eats time out of your day like you would not believe and it makes it hard to focus on anything when your phone is providing an infinite amount of distractions 24 7 what are these fakebook and twatter and snatchit things you speak of seriously i have adopted three means of entirely avoiding that crap 1 i have blocked those domains at my wifi dsl router level 2 i do not use my smartphone small screen super cheap burner prepaid type not the latest greatest for surfing ever it for phone calls brief useful text messaging 3 i try to get as much of my content in text form that is reading and or scanning through rather than viewing listening while text too can be addicting it vastly more efficient than video or even audio i would almost go so far as to say block youtube too except that youtube does have it place at least when you use it to view things where video conveys solid info about things that cannot really be conveyed by any other means regarding that last if you are watching some talking head babble on or perhaps even worse listening to someone essentially read talk shit to you you are probably squandering insane amounts of time though i get that there are or at least can be exceptions if you are stuck in some passive place ie commuting via train or even car whatever then i get that listening to radio recorded stuff is probably much more doable and thus a multi tasking use of time i am talking about squandering time at home watching crap whether it the tv boob tube or the internet based youtube because at home it a shitty inefficient way to get info more entertainment than anything substantive and of course majority of the way people waste time on fakebook twatter snatchit etc is spent looking at the almost endless collections of pictures videos which on a day to day basis is pretty vain vapid ,2,MGTOW
DWShimoda, he fucking won because his median voter was making 70k a year and was not getting anything from the aca except for constantly rising health care costs so they voted trump to try and make it stop that a part of the equation but really only a part and a rather small part as well many other issues factors went into the mix 538 did some good reporting on that lol not really nate silver is as clueless as ever he was clueless and entirely wrong before the election clueless and entirely wrong during the election and he still clueless and largely wrong after the election the typical middle class voter was keeping their head down throughout obama presidency and the people getting a good deal from obamacare were assuming everybody else was getting a good deal too they were not people who did not qualify for subsidies saw their insurance rates go crazy and their deductible skyrocket actually for a lot of people esp small business owners farmers other independent and self employed people it been even worse than that for many of them their old catastrophic hospitalization insurance plans which were relatively affordable and were real insurance plans ie insurance is not to pay for your everyday needs it a hedge spreading of risk of abnormal expenses those plans all entirely disappeared poof and they were gone meaning they were left with a hobson choice go full bore expensive hmo style bullshit or go without any health insurance many of then were essentially forced to do the latter these little jerks have found somebody they can blame hate and shit on it makes them feel powerful it helps them dodge responsibility and supports the fiction that nobody they know was pulling the lever for the donald no it has to be those shitty hillbillies fuck the working class hooray somebody i can abuse without consequences actually they are correct when they state that nobody they know voted for trump because they live in the beltway bubble aka the clinton archipelago and the people they know are all likewise a literal echo chamber and the primary problem with them is that they by default view the entire rest of the country as those shitty hillbillies that actually nothing all that new of a phenom new york city and d c politicos and other elites have always held most of the rest of the nation in disdain but in recent decades and even more so recent years with qe money fueling it that echo chamber region has expanded outwards and encompasses a huge portion of the boston to virginia beltway and of course the high tech left coast as well ,1,bestof
DWShimoda,riiight blame people who were not even born yet for multiple decades of changes that undermined overturned distorted all of the traditional laws and institutions and even cultural norms morals etc blame them for the world they were simply born into the world their parents grandparents great grandparents generations fucked up not seriously marriage and the patriarchal family structure was in fact killed off by the people who are now the oldest or even deceased generations the baby boom generation the silent generation the so called greatest generation and indeed arguably even the prior flapper lost generations because they were the ones in charge and in control over the courts and legislatures state houses when things like abortion on demand and affirmative action and no fault divorce things were granted the official imprimatur the younger generations are not killing marriage they are realizing it already dead that it has become little more than a trap for fools per example the supreme court that made the roe v wade ruling consisted of chief justice warren burger born 1907 justices william o douglas b 1898 william j brennan jr b 1906 potter stewart b 1915 byron white b 1917 thurgood marshall b 1908 harry blackmun b 1908 lewis f powell jr b 1907 and william rehnquist b 1924 and btw it was only the two youngest justices white rehnquist that dissented likewise with no fault divorce and affirmative action and feminism etc the former was first signed into law in california by governor and quelle surprise divorcee ronald reagan b 1911 and affirmative action and welfare and title vii and title ix etc were all pushed into and signed into law by people like lyndon b johnson b 1908 and richard m nixon b 1913 ergo the shaky foundation for all of modern identity politics and the undermining of traditional gender roles responsibilities well the younger generation s are just the inheritors of that whole morass and the ones who have to try to figure out how to deal with the shitstorm it has created and that without even mentioning that the aforementioned generations are also the teachers of the younger generations and are in fact still in power holding virtually all of the political positions and indeed controlling directly or indirectly the vast majority of the resources of our society which alas they warp to their own corrupt benefit only paying lip service to concerns about the future ,38,MGTOW

DWShimoda, she started being a slut somewhere puberty or before and in this specific case with op note he stated we exchanged virginities ergo she was already a slut at after that point in time if not earlier and likewise the remainder of the time they were together he just mistakenly thought she was exclusively his slut when in reality she was simply a slut that gave him a turn the whole virginity thing may or may not have been true but in all likelihood op was in fact not her first and was probably also not her only even while they were in a relationship op just never understood he was being lied to manipulated ,15,MGTOW

DWShimoda, i am sure that most people just live in a dream and highly exaggerate their lives when writing on a shitty forum on the internet probably true but i am reading hundreds of stories of men in theri 50s that say tyey pick up 18 year old chicks and they fuck them all they want and they spin plates and yada yada as a 50 year old guy with other friends in their 40 and 50 i can tell you that seriously it really does not take all that much to get some young bar slut to drool all over some guys and for them to take her off for a quickie somewhere basically all you need is to be somewhat decent looking drive a fairly hot looking vehicle ie red or import sports car convertible motorcycle etc and probably most important of all be willing to both flash a wad of cash couple 100 bills in the wallet and then demonstrate that you are willing to splurge spend it in part on her drinks etc in a fairly free manner the implication being that you have plenty more where that came from and she might be able to tap it repeatedly etc the chief thing that is likely really being exaggerated is both the number frequency and above all the quality hotness of the so called 18 year old chicks to begin with they are not picking up that many of them nor that often and secondly they are generally not actually 18 years old the chick may claim that the guy may think that but try more like mid to late 20 something even into 30 ages and they are really not all that hawt more like skanky they just look that way to 50 something dudes wearing beer goggles iow the so called high smv is generally just some makedup caked easy lay bar floozy iow relatively low smv some of them are actually more like borderline whores basically they just get paid in drinks dinner or drugs casino chips etc instead of cash fee for services it interesting to be the sane sober ie mgtow designated driver for a group of such guys you end up seeing very clearly just how deluded delusional alcohol can make men how quickly the typical guy will turn into a sucker for a woman women that manipulate them via flirting we are talking that if he were to see her the following morning sans makeup the line of thought not be wow what a hottie but rather would more likely be akin to oh jeez she is one ugly fucking slut cannot believe i actually screwed that damned i must have been plastered ,1,MGTOW

DWShimoda,does not surprise me in the least years ago ok shit i guess it decades ago now damned i am getting old back in the early 1990 i led a boy youth group like boy scouts but different org and we took an annual week long backwoods hiking backpacking trip second year we did it one of the mom wife of one of the leaders in the younger cub scout age groups and her 17 year old daughter asserted that they wanted to come along i said fine but but they both the mom and the girl would have to pass the same readiness test that i made the younger boys ie 12 to 14 years old in the group pass before i would agree to have them on the trip 1 need to demonstrate prove that they knew how to properly setup their pup tent unassisted 2 need to hoist and carry a backpack filled stuffed weighing 60 lbs from the church out to the road and back and do it in less than 5 minutes a distance of less than 1 4 mile mind you 3 need to demonstrate they knew how to properly hoist secure a bear bag start bank put out a campfire and how to dig a personal hole see below further they needed to know that on the trip no one else would ever be giving them a break and carrying their pack for them under any circumstances no bullshit i caaaaaa not carrrrry it aaaany further would be tolerated even if some accident and it would have to be a real injury some sprained ankle broken leg etc occurred to anyone on the trip if when that happened the trip would be over for everyone we would have to split the group day hike carry the wounded person out to assistance on a makeshift litter this was back in the day before cell phones and i doubt cell phones would have worked where we were going anyway and then return for the remaining equipment iow everyone would be hugely pissed off and finally where we were going there were no shelters and no latrines toilets crapping consisted of take you shovel take a walk then dig squat shit wipe cover return and again no one else was going to help ever at all i am glad that i made the first two conditions the tent backpack because i never had to bother with the other stuff with them the daughter surprisingly actually managed to get the tent up the mom failed both of them failed to be able to carry the backpack daughter did not even make it out to the road she went about a block and quit mom almost made it out to the road but then could not make it back that was enough at that point in time to prove even to them that they were not ready equipped for such a trip btw and ironically i rarely had any of the boys fail iirc only one kid failed a 12 year old who was a bit small for his age grade and he was able to actually do everything including carry the pack but he was obviously struggling sooo much that he agreed he might be better off waiting until the following year once he would grown a big bigger stronger which he did and he thoroughly enjoyed the trip then whereas i am certain he would have hated it the prior year it would have been too much like torture for him i am sure these days i would not even be able to assert that test in which case quite frankly i would not even agree to lead such a trip because it would be a fucking disaster ,1,MGTOW

DWShimoda, when i look at my parents generation they watch an insane amount of tv like 8 hours a day i have a hard time saying video games are more addictive than that cannot say i disagree and to be sure there is an artificiality to that as well there will always be people who are happy to be complacent and just waste time until they die then their are do ers if anything technology has just made the two sides farther apart yes exactly and the passive complacent seem to be increasing in number whereas the do ers seem to be a dying breed at least that what i have been seeing with a lot of young guys they have been so helicopter parented both at home and in school in addition to combination with the console life including not only gaming but crap like facebook etc that their contextual knowledge of the real i suppose i would say adult world is just entirely warped and almost completely missing on the vr thing i think we are a long way out from truly realistic vr well yeah but current crop wow halo gta etc are a far cry more immersively quasi realistic than say donkey kong and on this we are far from that i am not so certain yes i would agree we are far from real relative to those of us who have actual wide experience of reality but i think it a bit more dubious for those who whole life experience has consisted of living in an artificial urban environment increasingly isolated insulated from the wild world of true nature and worse spending the vast majority of it in little boxes home apartment school vehicle and moreover almost continually plugged in to one screen or another one form of audio visual media or another and with an increasing amount of that being either literal cgi or else content created by others living in similar little boxes often likewise with little to no experience of the wild nature reality themselves aka the blind leaning the blind ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, i hear what you are saying but i think you misinterpreted my hyperbole as literal well you may have intended it as hyperbole but the reality lol or virtual reality i am seeing with a lot of young guys well it not hyperbole they literally are that insulated isolated even addicted for what it worth i do think video games are an absolute waste of time like many things the danger lies in the dosage if when it used as some occasional entertainment or even escape which is often not only necessary but a net positive allowing one to recharge re engage with life later on then i see absolutely no problem with video games they are no different no more less waste of time than any other kind of entertainment escape activity and arguably in some ways as you have noted versus bar hopping drinking partying probably much better certainly safer in the immediate risk physical sense but my concern and what i am seeing is that they are very often so addictive and pervasive too frequently and too obsessively engaging that many young men are in fact missing out on real life they are coming away with a rather distorted view of the world and i am not talking about the whole violence trope rather even for all of it overly hyped realism the pervasive artificiality even superficiality of the entire overall experience the chief detriment is that they are not obtaining actual real world experiences ,1,MGTOW

DWShimoda,to paraphrase shakespeare the ladies doth protest too much methinks as even wikipedia notes on the phrase https en wikipedia org wiki the lady doth protest too much 2c methinks quotation from the c 1600 play hamlet by william shakespeare it has been used as a figure of speech in various phrasings to describe someone overly frequent and vehement attempts to convince others of some matter of which the opposite is true thereby making themselves appear defensive and insincere in rhetorical terms the phrase can be thought of as indicating an unintentional apophasis where the speaker who protests too much in favor of some assertion puts into others minds the idea that the assertion is false something that they may not have considered before and there is more general and fairly solid understanding that is longstanding and goes back to ancient times the more stridently someone insists on something esp promising swearing that they are telling the truth etc the more likely the reality is the opposite ie they are lying misleading by telling partial truths a colored version of the story etc ,2,MGTOW

DWShimoda,also suggest you read the following http www jobhuntersbible com articles view how do you explain your life and remember that really regardless of your profession there is a relatively limited subset of companies organizations where you are primarily likely to be employed ie places that employ the majority of people with your skillset with a sort of secondary tertiary circle of other possible companies to wit if you are a cook chef well rather obviously the primary places that are likely to hire the majority of people in your field will be the restaurant industry and or restaurant like things such as catering services or craft services etc but there will be secondary places things like institutions schools prisons etc and even tertiary places that many might not initially think of like say corporate hq cafeteria same with say an electrician most likely primary employers will be electrical contractors of some type but various institutional operations including factories and the like will often or at least occasionally have an electrician on site on staff and those can be relatively sweet jobs or again some auto vehicle mechanic the first primary place of employment will be the obvious auto dealerships and auto repair shops but those definitely are not the only places vehicle mechanics are employed often large institutions have their own fleet repair maintenance shops and likewise with companies that are heavily dependent upon equipment construction etc they too often have their own mechanics now to be sure a lot of it is outsourced but generally that is then to some specialized firm that does not deal with the general consumer public vehicle repairs point is the same will be true of whatever type of engineering you are doing structural civil etc there will be some primary set of employers that will hire the vast majority of your specific type of engineers but there will also be secondary tertiary employers of the same thus in looking for and trying to find a job associated with your profession well sometimes you are better off going where the mass of your colleagues other engineers are probably not looking themselves they are going to focus on those primary employers not realizing that so is every other engineer ergo your resume application gets lost in the big pile beside everyone elses much harder to stand out there if you instead go after the secondary tertiary possibilities well you are much more likely to stand out get hired it really the same supply demand concept just reapplied to the job sector rather than rentals hope that helps ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, good read thanks for the info i learned a lot problem is that with my work type its hard to find a job anywhere engineering well most people hunt for jobs in a bass ackwards fashion that is they tend to focus on and expend the most time effort on the seemingly easiest methods that are nevertheless the least likely to lead to actually success ie getting the job and moreover getting a job that really fits them and pays a good salary etc this inverted pyramid graphic http www jobhuntingu com wp content uploads 2014 03 untitled 122 png helps explain that the red numbers text from the top down are the preferential ways that many most employers prefer to hire conversely the gray numbers from the bottom up tend to be the way most job hunters look for jobs basically the cattle call of searching open position help wanted advertisements well it sort of the last resort of the employer at least of the savvy intelligent busy working manager types but it the the first and default main thing that job hunters think of and do part of the problem here is that just about no one really teaches young people even college graduates this stuff if they are taught anything about how to get a job it usually some nonsense about using online job listing search engines and some rather vague ambiguous but poorly explained allusion to networking in no small part i think this is because the teachers professors themselves do not comprehend the job hunt and how it actually goes on out in private industry academia itself is an abnormal system largely akin to government if not actually part of government that follows formal bureaucratic processes procedures such as that every open position gets listed or at least ostensibly does and filled from one of the applicants via that process the reality of course is that probably well over 50 of the time the position is already filled ie some favorite already has the inside track on the job before the listing even appears the blunt reality is that probably somewhere around 80 to 90 of jobs either never get a job opening ad listing at all ever that is the job is created filled via some internal promotion someone picked from the hiring employer social colleague network someone recruited by a head hunter etc and so no help wanted thing is ever created the remaining 10 to 20 of jobs the ones that do get listings are very often the low entry level grunt positions aka mcjobs where there is high turnover or generic commodity type positions like janitor where probably no one really cares who gets hired etc the point is the better jobs including those engineering positions yeah the vast majority of those get filled w o job listings or if there is a listing required it often likely to be a formality and a waste of time see below need to add a caveat in there especially with large corporate employers ones where the hr department may insist on putting out a formal listing and soliciting applications resumes before anyone is allowed to be hired there is an age old farce dance around that though say dept manager smith has already identified and want to hire mr jones hr insists a job description w qualifications be posted etc so manager smith simply creates a description that perfectly fits mr jones rather unique combination of qualifications experience and which virtually no one else will have hr personnel being essentially clueless about the specifics simply use those specs to arrive at the same conclusion manager smith wants that mr jones is the ideal perfect and possibly sole qualifying candidate tada mr jones gets hired ,1,MGTOW

DWShimoda, i believe barnaby was telling us all to move to charleville was not he surprised that not on there article was not noted necessarily for current state of things i think that was written circa 2014 more for the general concept idea that even in a country that is supposedly in a nation wide housing bubble well there are still probably many areas regions where a smart savvy contrarian can live on the cheap imagine a fair few of those are former mining towns or formerly booming remember 8 odd years ago looking at a job in mackay and you could not rent a dump for less than 800 a week yeah when places start booming well housing is generally a delayed catchup thing iow when the booms happen there a big demand for units to buy rent so other people businesses start building which ironically enough then sometimes actually makes the housing situation even tighter pricier because the workers building the additional housing have to live sleep somewhere and of course then when the boom bursts or even peaks falls off slightly well a lot of times housing has been overbuilt so there suddenly a reverse situation lots of extra housing available excess supply and fewer less desperate people on the demand side of the equation really it often remarkable how little of a change is actually needed but when you think about it with housing being a necessity well when you have 12 people for every 10 units they are obviously going to be bidding against each other and driving the prices up even more so if when work wages are booming as well ie lots of overtime signing bonuses etc things that tend to occur during the early mid part of any boom in no small part because housing is sparse expensive whereas once things even out say addition units have been built so that there are now 12 units for every 12 workers and then the boom peaks dips so there are only 10 workers per 12 units of housing well suddenly the supply demand situation is inverted and landlords have vacancies causing them to be desperate for clients renters and of course they are not the only ones especially when it comes to things like mining and oil fields and things of that nature where the boom location is generally not near some large city but instead out in the middle of no where well the workers in those lines tend to also create an expanded need for not only housing but also things like restaurants grocery laundry services even auto repair etc so there usually an influx of people to staff up those secondary tertiary boom related businesses as well to meet the higher local demand for their products services and the people that work in those well they too need somewhere to live sleep ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, is it possible to work one job and still afford to live alone in australia http www news com au finance real estate where are the cheapest places to rent in australia news story e75cad4ae2450952c89a517f9ef25e9e keep in mind that all prices including residential rents are always based on what people are willing able to pay what that means is any booming economy and especially any booming region within that economy will experience ridiculously high pricing meaning any location where there are lots of jobs including some high salary jobs and thus especially any location where lots of people want to live move to on the chance of getting in on that you want cheap rent go where masses of other people are not wanting to live move to better yet go to the regions they are moving away from the problem then and in those locations is generally finding work or more specifically finding something that generates sufficient income that the real key and why finding some profession or form of work that can be done either entirely or at least partially remotely ie online and or with minimal commuting to wit you may have to drive 2 hours to do one day a week in office or some occasional on site work but the remainder of your work can be done at from a cheaper less in demand location i know that sounds kind of vague but what the point of it is is that you are probably better off living somewhere that rent is say 600 a month 7 200 a year and making only 20k net after tax versus living somewhere with rents at 450 a week 23 400 a year and making 40k a year again net after tax because even though the latter technically leaves you with more non rent money 16 600 vs 12 300 chances are the higher salary will sort of fool you into spending more and very likely the higher rental base cost will mean that other things even food etc will also be more expensive in that location meaning in the end the person making the lower figure will be so long as they are frugal potentially better off that becomes doubly true in my experience for people just getting started in the working world because high income tends to create high spending in a habitual fashion that is in your early working years you more or less establish a sort of base in terms of what you expect to pay for things it is much easier to maintain a frugal habit going from a low income to some higher income than it is for someone of high income to readjust their lifestyle spending habits if when they experience a reduction to some low income ,4,MGTOW

DWShimoda, can someone explain the try hard thing to me generally speaking it a colloquial shorthand slang phrase for someone who is try ing too hard at something they are obviously almost certainly never going to succeed at in other words they do not know when to quit because they are extraordinary efforts are just being wasted and would probably be better spent on something else the sort of classic example who has alas ironically been transformed into a folk hero is the main character in the film rudy https en wikipedia org wiki rudy 28film 29 plot now the character in that film and the real life guy it was based on technically succeeded at his childhood teen twenty something dream aim goal and many years of extraordinary sacrifices of suiting up and playing in an actual game on the notre dame football team i say technically he succeeded because yeah he play in one game and for a grand total of probably less than one a half of a minute of actual game time right near the end and iirc in the last game of the season when nd was in the lead by 21 points over georgia tech his wikipedia entry notes that ruettiger actually played for three plays the first play was a kickoff the second play was an incomplete pass and on the third and final play he rudy ruettiger sacked technically one of a couple of nd players to sack georgia tech quarterback rudy allen point being he spent years for a relatively short and singular moment of glory his teammates made it a lot more glorious by lifting him on their shoulders and in a first ever for an nd player carried him off the field as a hero not so much because his performance in those plays was that heroic or even notable by itself he made a good play but somewhat irrelevant in that nd would have won regardless but rather because they had watched and knew just how long hard he had worked for even that minimal opportunity a thing that was really out of his league reach they respected his tenacity and that when he did have the chance he gave it all that he had again even though it probably really was not needed was irrelevant the whole thing was really mostly notable for that the carry off the field part had his teammates not done that well it would not have been anywhere near the compelling story movie that it was subsequently turned into nearly 20 years later and of course after the movie success well the real life rudy managed to leverage that belated fame in multiple ways as a motivational speaker book author co author etc note some people would and probably will take offense at referring to the guy as a try hard but the plain truth of the matter is that had the movie not been made then everything about rudy and the whole first nd player to be carried off the field in glory bit probably would have been almost entirely forgotten or at most would have been some trivia footnote that only die hard notre dame fans would care about because during the nearly 20 years in between well rudy really did not do anything else of note in or with his life and so the whole motivational speaker and rudy tips for success in life etc are really rather farcical i say alas here because i think this is one of those blue pill myth stories that contributes to a lot of rather well rather stupid behavior by a lot of people especially young guys and particularly in a sort of sunk cost fallacy pursuing either ridiculously unlikely athletic dreams or even worse tenacity at trying to win the girl had rudy or others who similarly pursue things that are highly improbable taken all of the energy effort drive and tenacity that he they plowed into some brief moment of fame glory and instead channeled it into something else something more productive and lasting well really it hard to imagine that the overall outcome would not have probably been much more likely to succeed ie more of a certainly and less of a lottery ticket win that took 20 years to really pay off and which almost did not pay off at all at least not in a substantive way rudy is the fat awkward ugly kid who inhabits r theredpill and spends his life trying to become something worthy of dating some specific singular female they have a crush on ie oneitis and then believing they have gained success when they actually after years of reshaping themselves etc get to take her out on one date but sans sex sans bj even sans handjob probably a jizz in his pants moment and then forever after tries to relive the glory of that moment something that ironically enough is probably even more common with women than men cf alpha widows who had some date one night stand with their fantasy uber chad and then desperately cling to the hope that he will come back to her for the rest of her life mgtow of course is the anti or opposite of rudy mgtow is a philosophy that says fuck that crap and proceeds to put the effort into other more worthy and more likely to be successful and less frustrating things ,3,MGTOW

DWShimoda, red pills from 200 years ago women have not changed still the same and even longer ago than that while schopenhauer was ostensibly building a new atheistic philosophy he was really doing so based on within the context of a society that still has the ancient cultural religious knowledge knowledge that rather ironically he helped purposefully undermine one wonders what view he would take if he were dropped into the modern post modern context that we have to deal with as a result they should teach this in schools they used to but that was back when ancient cultural religious mytho logical scriptures were used as one of the primary texts and basis of instruction and notably instruction was chiefly of boys men in a sex segregated system before the modern post modern coed secular atheistic psychobabble replaced it btw interesting word mythology comes from joining logy ie study of with mythos and that latter while taking a greek form is really not a word from ancient greek rather it was a relatively modern invention first recorded use 1753 to the ancient greeks they did not have a mythology and would not have comprehended the word they simply had story based knowledge from the past one should also note that terms like legend which is french from latin and really simply means story or lore which is from german lehre which means a teaching or a doctrine and of course doctrine simply means body of teachings knowledge and to indoctrinate is to teach some that body of knowledge worldview which is where the doctoral comes from relative to professor teachers the various denigratory ie disreputable fantasy connotations that we associate with legend and lore are actually more of a snide modern post modern bias attitude and are not really present in the original use of the words iow the ancient greeks and likewise other ancient cultures did not hold those mythological stories in disdain in the rather sneering manner that most people now do have been trained indeed often ironic as it may seem indoctrinated to do we of course have our own rather ridiculous mythologies not the least of which are the combined mythos of progressivism and scientism etc very often equally fictitious contrived often outright falsified erasing or modifying the telling of any all things that might prove embarrassing or even contradictory to the story of the straight steady forward march of progress and that is not to mention the plethora of romantic mythological nonsense that are used to indoctrinate children long before their critical faculties are able to discern what they are being fed all of the disney and other films to say nothing of the assorted other children programming yet another interesting word there programming but i think i have digressed enough for one comment i will leave contemplation of the implications of that as a free exercise for the reader ,5,MGTOW

DWShimoda, annnnnnnnd my kids are going to private school that no panacea either seriously the teachers at those private schools are products of the very same system that produces the teachers at the public schools ,1,Conservative
DWShimoda, i have not taken the ny test but you seem to be making a point that it is just a basic literacy test this is how the article and the system are characterizing it i have since taken a look at snippets of the test and rather obviously this is not a literacy test not in any way shape or form the entire thing is a fraud and a farce and not just because the test is inadequate and poorly contrived versus the ostensible purpose it is because the test obviously is designed for entirely different purposes altogether that even worse ,10,Conservative
DWShimoda, did you look at the test here is an example question seems like a bunch of bs to me if that a sample of the content then it a shit test in about a thousand different ways first of all wtf is a literacy test doing using ridiculous pile of paragraphs about gertrude stein second the samples selected are quite frankly shitty writing this sentence for example it was a well rounded prosperous comfortable beginning one intended to produce a well rounded prosperous life with all the usual accoutrements of family stability and friends good gawd that is a steaming pile of crap my personal answer to the first question 1 in paragraph 1 the repetition of the phrase well rounded prosperous emphasizes a the sophistication of stein family b the predictability of the life stein rejected c the flowering of stein creative powers d the contempt for convention stein embodied would be option e none of the above it emphasizes the fact that the author sucks at writing this is not a literacy test it an are you properly indoctrinated into the feminist ideology test along with have you taken women studies so that you will be familiar with gertrude stein and the politically correct answers that we expect it a shit test used by a shit system that does not know nor actually care about hiring teachers who are fluent in english much less qualified to teach it they rather obviously have other priorities ,10,Conservative
DWShimoda, but if one test is serving as a barrier for 33 55 of new teaching candidates it might be a good indicator to revise the test as with any assessment a passing rate this incredibly low usually indicates problems on both sides of the assessment test takers and test givers this right here is actually the root of the problem the mentality philosophy that there should be some normative pass rate for a test and idea that if the pass rate is lower high then the test should be rejiggered until the pass fail rate reaches some predetermined acceptable number you have either done a good job of creating a test or exam system versus the reality of what you are ostensibly testing for or you have not and if you have not then you are in the wrong damned line of work but you do not fuck with the test just because you do not like the results yet of course that is what the entire educational system does on a regular basis and in a dozen nay a hundred even a thousand different ways from grading on a curve to throwing in trick questions to re norming to test prep quizzing and cramming and specific tutoring the entire educational industry has long ago lost its way gotten caught up in its own bullshittery tests like these are big bucks for testing companies like pearson and do not have a lot of accountability to checking skills actually necessary to good teaching of course they are and the entire purpose of those tests is so that the people in school administration can entirely avoid accountability themselves via so called standardized tests they get to shift the entire responsibility and the blame off onto someone else it the bullshit gee how was i to know that mr smith was illiterate he passed the test he had his degree and all of his certifications and etc yada yada blah blah and assorted other nonsense the whole set of shenanigans is a system rigged to pass the buck as well as to cover up both incompetence as well as willful disregard for actual quality skill and merit all of this this crapfest well it nothing new either it has been going on in one form or another for multiple decades already 40 years ago i had english teachers who from all apparent evidence including their own testimony could not do maths and basic stuff like addition subtraction of 2 and 3 digit numbers but who excused it by claiming that math was not their specialty and conversely math and science teachers who could not write a coherent paragraph or even a grammatically correct sentence and could not spell worth a damn either yet again excused with a self deprecating rationalization joke that english was not their major in college lol oh so funny right nope in fact all of the kids at least the smarter ones thought it was pathetic and we were right to think so likewise with rare exceptions essentially every teacher in virtually every class even more pathetic of course was that in reality the vast majority of them were not masters or even mediocrities when it came to the subject that purportedly was their specialty oh and this was in what was according to all of the metrics supposedly one of the top schools in the state my personal favorite of course were the english literature teachers who would in class repeatedly disparage certain authors as poor writers only to find out under informal questioning by me years later that they had never even attempted to read the works by those authors they were merely repeating regurgitating the opinions of their own instructors and or classmates in college pathetic pathetic ,16,Conservative
DWShimoda, because black and hispanic applicants were scoring lower and being disqualified from teaching jobs they just decided to throw out the standards test because equality yeah diversity is more important to this school district than the quality of teachers let that sink in for a minute well read a little further down just 41 percent of black teaching candidates and 46 percent of hispanics passed the test 1 on their first try compared to 2 64 percent of white candidates the 3 multiple choice exam is meant to 4 ensure high standards among prospective teachers which many 5 teaching preparation programs have struggled to do so while your point is entirely valid and it is obvious the primary reason they have decided to ditch this exam there are a host of other things that this article reveals 1 first try seriously why would you need more than one try you either are functionally literate at the level needed to teach or you are not this is not something that you want people to remedially cram for in order to simply barely obtain a passing grade on an exam and remember these candidates are all purportedly college graduates how can you graduate college much less obtain an education degree if you are functionally illiterate moreover how long a period of time is required before they can try again is it a day a week a month 6 months a year 5 years if the former the system was obviously already designed to be gamed that is it was not designed to test for the actual skill but rather for a mechanistic test taking approach to create the impression perception of a skill rather than determine the reality of mastery of it 2 64 percent of white candidates let that sink in it less than 2 3 and remember here too this is not some ridiculously high bar it is not some translate caesar on the fly while standing on one leg exam it an exam in reading and writing in the vernacular that less than 2 3 of candidates of any group manage to pass and to pass such a low bar exam see below reveals that the system itself has massively deteriorated it beyond even being a joke and has become a farcical parody 3 multiple choice exam or as students all over the world call it a multiple guess exam usually from a standard array of 4 possible answers 1 or 2 of which are obviously blatantly incorrect choices it is a given that even selecting answers at random gives you a probability of getting 25 correct having even a partial clue ought to raise it to well over 50 just how illiterate do you have to be to obtain a failing grade on this exam and indeed what constitutes a passing grade does the exam require 80 correct or 75 or is 70 perhaps even 65 considered good enough realistically no one that is truly literate especially literate enough to teach should obtain less than say 95 correct and that figure would be presuming that somewhere around 10 of the questions are disingenuous trick questions designed to trip up even fully literate individuals why 10 because again even just by random chance 50 ought to get those answers correct also not how horridly incompetent the system is to begin with in that it resorts to a multiple choice exam for a skill that would much more readily be discernable via just about any other method ie read a random paragraph and being given a blank piece of paper and a pen or pencil have them write a brief example what is written about does not really matter it can be a nonsensical story of a pink elephant taking a ride on the subway all that matters is whether the sentences are properly constructed punctuated etc 4 ensure high standards rotflmao gimme a frigging break here this is not rocket science this is a base level skill that ought to have been mastered in elementary aka grammar school as a skill requirement for a teacher it is fundamentally akin to are you capable of dressing yourself that not a high standard it a bare minimum baseline if you cannot read or write you cannot teach period 5 teaching preparation programs have struggled to do get that teaching preparation programs have struggled with basic literacy well if your system of teaching teachers is so abysmal they they remain functionally illiterate guess what the end result is going to be when those teachers are placed in charge of classrooms and people wonder why children are illiterate ,141,Conservative

DWShimoda, lol exacty lol is the only correct or sane response but do you begin to understand because there is nothing in my prior comment that is any more absurd than this i mean for example say nigerians and ethiopians decide they no longer want to use the term african for whatever reason or the same with latin or asian if we do not use the term white what term would we use a han chinese person is han chinese but he also asian and it would be harder to understand the world if we removed the term asian and did not replace it with anything which you actually posited as if you were serious ignoring that chinese and japanese and vietnamese and hmong and etc ad nauseum in fact do take offense at being called asian much less yellow why be offended by a color term if white is applicable and determined to be non offensive because the person using it did not intend to cause offense then me referring to asians as yellow should be given the same pass perhaps i intended no offense and why stop with yellow black brown red these too are simply colors and yet more since the phrase people of color is apparently afaik still considered a politically correct acceptable phrase then how in the hell can it be offensive to inquire which color or likewise to use some color term that is somewhat close and if white is to be used under the auspices of close enough to refer to people of european ancestral ethnic heritage when they are obviously nowhere near being white then yellow red brown black or negro niger which are just non english terms meaning black well they too are close enough are they not moreover how dare someone impugn someone else intent can you read minds no if not then you cannot actually know someone else intent you are merely speculating based on your own subjective biased and probably ignorant viewpoint let go back to another line you tried this particular steaming pile of bs white people call themselves white i mean i get what you are saying but white is a generally accepted term and pretty much all the white people i know use it to refer to themselves and do so in a casual way i have never seen someone say it offensive before i know several black people who refer to themselves and other black people as niggas and actually let cut the bullshit with that euphemistic misspelling they are verbally saying niggers gasp we have just accepted a bullshit pseudo misspelling for various idiotic reasons does that mean i can should then go around using the term nigga nigger for any all black people erm oops excuse me i meant colored people dangit i should have said african americans or people of color and nevermind the utter inanity of that ambiguous phrase as to that last line that you have never seen someone say white people offensive before then quite frankly you need to get out about a bit more because plenty of people of european ancestral ethnic heritage actually do take offense at being called white or whitey etc and they get offended in the same way that a han chinese gets offended when referred to as yellow thus the only proper responses to the entire collection of i am offended is to say go fuck yourself likewise with the attempt to selectively deflect via the intent bullshit you cannot have it both ways sweetheart ergo the whole point of this little reducto ad absurdium exercise is that op can fuck off he she it is trying to play the hypocritical sjw bullshit game of white guilt ie any all white pride or even any statements about race made by white people are racist bigotry which is not any different than the feminist bullshit all men are rapists i am not falling for it but the fact that i am not falling for it nor the fact that i recognize there are in fact differences distinctions of race which is simple physical reality does not mean i hold any inherent hatred for humans of other ethnic heritage that differs from my own it also does not mean i am going to kiss their non lily white asses which is unquestionably part of what op was trolling for get the picture ,1,MGTOW

DWShimoda, that is some genius level stuff shimoda thank you that explains a lot the chief solid aspect is again probably simply subjective perception versus the population as a whole assuming you are in the higher intelligence ranges even the upper portions of the middle group say 110 you are going to probably pretty accurately perceive the lion share of the population as dumber or at least less intelligent than yourself end result is that even if malice evil were uniformly distributed or in fact even if it were higher in the higher intelligence ranges in your daily life you would still likely encounter more malicious evil people below you on the intelligence range just because most of the people around you will in fact be in that group the effect might even be exaggerated beyond that depending on the average intelligence of the local population you are located within as a social or work group which depending on the profession environment may be substantially lower than the aggregate average overall and in fact the converse perception could just as easily be true say a person was of average intelligence a straight 100 iq but they were working as a janitor at cal tech they might easily come to the conclusion that high iq people the student population at cal tech tend to include a lot more malicious evil people than the general population and that simply because they would be surrounded by people who by and large had higher iq ergo again assuming you are of slightly better than above average intelligence you may as well ask why are so many dumb people taller than me or conversely why are taller people so often dumber than me because statistically speaking you are probably of average height and while there is a slight correlation of height with iq it not a direct linear relationship many posit that it chiefly more of a reverse correlation to do with nutrition health ie poor nutrition will likely stunt both physical height and mental abilities and your perception could be true and yet nothing more than the fact that there a big bulge of the population in the ranges of iq lower than your own so there are going to be lots of taller people in that range as well as shorter people fatter people skinnier people etc basically everyone of every quality or feature is going to be encountered far more frequently simply because of demographics and the higher your own iq the more rare you will encounter anyone with a higher iq ergo you will be a lot less inclined to lump them together into generalizations and or you will do so with even less validity if you do ie you are working from a much smaller sample group as for the rest i really do not think it genius rather it just an extrapolation highly speculative of basic human psychological responses that is to say most of it is simply a logical extension of how people react to their position within the range a lot of it is not only as i noted speculative but would in fact be also highly variable subjective relative to the person own experience and probably experience mainly during character formative years the metaphor big fish in little pond is an apt analogy to wit someone of only moderately high intelligence say again iq 110 if they grow up in a local population that is either very small say some tiny rural school district where they only have a dozen age mate classmates and so unlikely to have many or indeed any individuals with even higher iq they will come away with a valid experience of having been among the smarter and possibly the smartest kids in their class by contrast another child even though possessing a higher level of intelligence say iq 120 but attending some significantly larger school with perhaps 200 age classmates may find that there are several kids more intelligent than them and so come away with a much different experience of that intelligence you see much the same kind of phenomenon with say height and sports skills abilities a child who attends some relatively small rural or private elementary junior high school with small overall class sizes may come away with a falsely high perception of their athletic capabilities abilities that is they have always been the person picked first for basketball teams and having a height advantage over their small sample of classmates play more often and score more often yet once they enter a much larger public high school they suddenly find themselves warming the bench and unable to keep up with or perhaps even score at all against their new classmates teammates and opposing schools some of whom are probably taller but many of whom might even be shorter yet because they have been more competitively challenged have developed higher levels of skills same thing then tends to occur at the next stage if when the kid attends college and attempts to play at the collegiate level he suddenly finds that his game well it ai not all that so to speak it can be quite a rude awakening and very deflating to the ego to have that happen the visions of an nba or nfl or other pro sports career more or less vanish very disconcerting so the point is while i do not have data to really back up that array of speculations regarding the causes of malice evil i think it a fairly logical conclusion that behavioral patterns cheating malice evil similar to that are more likely to occur in the middle and lower intelligence populations and quite frankly i think further that it can be almost directly be attributed to the formal schooling system which also creates a host of other inherently

DWShimoda, 1 full loners monks these are a group of mgtow men i will refer to as island men they have totally disengaged from all forms of social interactions they derive their true happiness from solitude and are also totally indifferent to society they care less whether society will fall tomorrow today or even now some literally live at the fringe parts and outskirts of society mountainous area forests monasteries etc while others though they still coexist among society choose to ignore every social signal around them even some do not use any social media outlets or watch mainstream news on tv and some do not at all talk to women for any reason except out of great need or necessity hey i resemble that remark but i have to correct a couple of rather significant errors on your part i am not totally disengaged from all forms of social interactions just in control of my social interactions they either happen on my terms or they do not happen rather than allowing others to control me and likewise am also not totally indifferent to society and i do not care less whether society will fall tomorrow today or even now only partially so and with a limited degree of care more or less prepared for the fact that society is crumbling and turning to shit and could in fact collapse into a chaotic mess any day or year now though i really do not expect it to entirely implode for at least another decade or more and probably not even within my lifetime and i both realize and benefit from society in a number of different ways smart enough to realize that life would be much harder entirely on my own and so there is a small amount of care and even concern also do not know that i would call it the fringe or outskirts of society though i do not suppose that too inaccurate i rather prefer to think of my location status as a sort of lagrangian point https en wikipedia org wiki lagrangian point a naturally stable orbital position relative to the various gravitational forces of our society civilization one that can be maintained with minimal effort optimal conservation of resources maximal enjoyment of life also i think there some overlap here since the following essentially applies as well 10 natural since birth from the time their power of reason began to work they immediately discerned and saw through all the societal illusions and lies they knew all along they were being lied to it is as if this group had a strange red pill awakening in the womb for nine months and when they were mature enough to be given birth to they swallowed the mgtow pill right after birth for this group they had inherent desire not to marry or form any relationship at all with women because for them gtow is a natural thing for them they are one of the most rational and logical group amongst all other mgtow groups of men not sure if since birth is really true but certainly prior to the the onset of puberty also did not prevent me from form ing any relationship at all with women just was never really at risk for any problems from them because i would learned how to be entirely in control of myself and therefore of the relationships as well edit finally despite the snarky response of some here itt i think there good value here everyone who posts comments here is most definitely not on the same page as everyone else and having some sort of categorization however crude helps in identifying the different viewpoints that are here i am almost inclined to say this ought to be refined and either stickied or possibly even sidebarred might be useful as a future reference answer to the people who want to lump everyone here into one of the above types of categories ie that everyone here is some incel etc u 801735 you know i love you man but you are missing the point ,3,MGTOW

DWShimoda,despite what you have been told racial realism is not about hating non whites it about supporting one own ancestral ethnic group s rather than undermining them iow it a reaction reversal of the bullshit hatred of white people so called white privilege and assorted other bullshit that we are currently having foisted upon us how would you feel if the groups you so callously and offensively label as whites decided that they really ought to invade ignoring all of your nation borders all of it laws etc overtake your ethnic group breed your people entirely out of existence etc just as one example all of the inanity against white people regarding cultural appropriation i mean really do you really wanna go there because as a white and specifically a german swabian i would be more than fine with that you can keep whatever little frigging cultural bullshit your specific ethic group has contrived so long as my ethnic group swabians can preclude you all of the rest of humanity from culturally appropriating the things created by the members of our specific little ethnic group things that would include the carburetor and arguably both the internal combustion engines and diesel engines and even the automobile by the way how dare you call me white and moreover how dare you lump me in with a whole range of other ethnic groups based solely on your rather abysmal perception of a skin tone the various western european scandinavian ethnic groups of people are not white at all i mean just how shitty is your ability to perceive and label colors we are not all the same and we are most definitely not the color of chalk the skin tone varies significantly but if anything it more of a creamy pinkish color ,0,MGTOW

DWShimoda, would be the hammer with which to finally weaken usa males well guess what still could happen but ai not guaranteed anymore does not matter whether they have weakened men or not they have succeeded anyway because they have entirely undermined destroyed the family structure men as fathers authority have been entirely usurped supplanted replaced by the state even under capitalism when a man rejects 10k years of tradcon conditioning teachings etc he is very powerful indeed yes and no yes an mgtow is powerful in regards to himself but what he is power less to do is to protect the next generation mgtow is a defensive tactic and a very effective one akin to say castling in chess but it essentially irrelevant in terms of being an offensive strategy it does not lead to checkmate and it does not protect any of the other pieces on the board populism as labelled by the globalist elite is only the beginning of what shall transpire indeed it is only the beginning and alas while an important first step it really a rather tenuous uncertain even ambiguous one in terms of it effect much less ability to roll back or repair the damage that has already been done populism even nationalism is not sufficient to and even if successful rather highly unlikely to re establish a proper patriarchal family structure to society in fact it very likely to simply perpetuate the status quo it going to take something much more other pressures forces that cause major sociological changes things that are an inherent existential threat to the current promiscuous licentious society personally i think about the only thing that can will cause that kind of thing is a literal force of nature namely disease specifically rampant epidemic and resistant incurable rapidly debilitating disease that quickly spreads via promiscuity and thus for which the only defense will be a society wide sexual behavioral change and for anyone who thinks that nuts that will never happen well we already had one shot across the bow like that from nature with aids and after a temporary all too brief backpedaling our society chose to dismiss ignore the warning and to rather arrogantly double down on the promiscuity even extend and promote both perversion and licentiousness in manifold new ways cf tinder grinder etc not to mention vawa and more recent things that would have been considered absurdly unimaginable and most definitely not acceptable in the pre aids era society ,4,MGTOW

DWShimoda, well by my calculations this happened to him in 2014 the 80s was when he was still being fooled by the blue pill this is the shit of it he got married under one system a sort of social contract alas with three parties the husband the wife and the state and the terms of that contract the underlying principles on which it was based were arbitrarily entirely and unilaterally changed by one party the state in the middle and changed without either of the other parties really agreeing to them much less being given the option to opt out or cancel the contract or indeed even being given formal notice of the changes hence the author of op piece being naive and not believing or even properly recognizing the threat for what it was and so not prepping for the inevitable in any way shape or form much less getting out asap which he could have done and so at least reduced some of the risk damage ,3,MGTOW

DWShimoda, if a man has money most girls would love to be your company for free and such a girl is just as likely to make a damnable fool of herself and her companion at any sophisticated event so why an expensive wife for these events correction much much cheaper than an actual wife over the long run picture a 50 something guy business executive possibly divorced or even twice divorced make 7 maybe even 8 or 9 figures in gross annual income job industry expects virtually requires that he appear at certain events charity balls industry parties political fundraising events etc yeah he can go stag and probably get away with that at least for a while post divorce but eventually that becomes problematic in several ways ie what is wrong with him why cannot he get keep a woman is he not alpha enough to bag a decent chick is he gay not that anyone cares but if so where the boy toy etc those events are still setup with the expectation that attendees will be couples ie men are expected to have a companion and the lack of one causes problems with the socializing at events if he goes the route of trying to get a real girlfriend well they are not only flighty unreliable likely not all that experienced at blending in and being an appropriate accessory for such functions but there always the risk that she will be an embarrassment likewise recruiting an actual wife well shit that likely to be a lot more expensive in the long run so what he doing is hiring something akin to an executive assistant but specifically for social events a professional to play a role be at his side to perform certain tasks including look act in certain ways in exchange for a preset and to him relatively trivial contractual salary arrangement plus possibly certain little performance bonuses ie her gift wishlist ergo it really no different than hiring a receptionist or a housemaid or even a staff cook the role uniform duties are different to be sure and it probably requires a higher degree of trust and companionability since what is essentially being performed is the public social wife role but than again housemaid laundry household cooking those too are wife roles and no one looks askance at someone who hires a professional for those ,1,MGTOW

DWShimoda, ok twenty one year old without a kid d it was 20 something so 20 21 22 25 probably even 26 29 year old or in fact possibly even older yet with or without a kid the typical 20 something chicks especially younger ones just are not going to have what it takes to make a descent escort escort this woman at least looks superficially subject to later validation like she had enough experience of the world ie she been around the block a few times to have learned how to behave in certain situations that might again the caveat make her suitable for that kind of well lets call it what it is that kind of work see despite the idea that escort is simply only a euphemism for whore or prostitute and that the only duty is to engage in kinky sex that just is not true and likewise with mistress or even often enough paramour when you get into uhnw territory the kind of old rich guys who not only can but likely will fund the base living of a chick like this to the tune of 6 figures a year the job of the escort ie high class escort is really more akin to playing the role of attractive mate spouse wife out in public a woman filling that position is literally a type of status accessory like a rolex watch or diamond cufflinks or a bespoke suit tuxedo her existence and attractiveness have to be sufficient to validate the perception that he an alpha male but at the same time it is not merely and certainly not only beauty youth that counts there also has to be a certain degree of cosmopolitan sophistication polish so that she can properly play the role at certain social events ie she cannot be some classless gutter trash whore and she cannot be so young that she freaks out and goes into some omg omg omg girlish scream mode if when the event evening includes mingling with celebrities or other public figures because yes such events do exist in some cities and especially around certain professions industries social circles they are common affairs weekly sometimes multiple dinner events per week of varying sizes men in positions like that generally do not want to be seen as going through a rapid series of bimbos but they also do not want to appear dateless nor do they necessarily want either an actual wife nor a real girlfriend mistress with all of the risk and drama that attach to those much more preferable will be some consistent woman that is regularly available to be at his side as needed and whom he can readily introduce in some casually formal manner like and you remember by friend leslie with some validity because yes yes they do remember leslie she been accompanying him to events for the past 6 months 2 years etc everyone just accepts assumes she is his paramour mistress particularly if they never see her with anyone else and no stigma attaches to that not anymore the sexual side of it well if she is indeed companionable would be a nice little bonus may even help enhance the act but probably is not all that important in terms of it primary purpose as i noted elsewhere to a uhnw man 7 or 8 or 9 figure annual income or more having a kept woman like that on some long term lease leash and available on call on an as needed semi regular basis at a cost of 100k a year is peanuts in fact it probably a bargain and much much cheaper than a wife probably cheaper certainly more reliable dependable durable arrangement than an actual mistress girlfriend who is far more likely to be a risky grasping gold digger and far less likely to be suitable to the task at hand how do i know this because i have seen it go on among other instances i have a couple of fairly wealthy friends who i either know because they have flat out admitted it told me have arrangements something like this or who post divorce have a woman who fits the bill in virtually every way that is she appears at their side regularly consistently at various social political business functions and events as if she were their girlfriend ltr fiancee and yet she is notably absent from other aspects of their life to wit she has her own residence she was not at recent close family funeral wake and she notably did not accompany them on a purely for pleasure european vacation etc and also when in private they do not talk about her as if she were their spouse mate so you do the math ,1,MGTOW

DWShimoda,depends on your definition of stupidity if you are talking on a relative or an absolute scale because really truly dumb people we are talking low end iq mentally challenged etc or to use the non pc words retarded people those who have difficulty say dressing themselves much less mastering anything more complex than addition subtraction they actually tend to not be evil and instead are if anything overly trusting and naive likewise but probably to a lesser extent people in the upper reaches of iq also tend to not be evil and often enough are similarly innocent and naive at least for longer than most it within the group of people in the middle ranges of intelligence iq 100 1 sd where the vast majority of evil people will be found or at least where from you are most likely to frequently encounter them why well one reason would simply be that those in that middle range constitute the vast majority of the population seriously 2 3 or 68 of the population is within the 85 to 115 iq range http www homeofbob com math dataprob standarddeviation1 jpg the remaining 1 3 33 of the population is split fairly equally 1 6 16 5 either above that smart people as well as the scattering of geniuses or below that dumb people most of whom are somewhat able to function independently as well as the minority who are utterly permanently dependent on others another reason a bit more speculative would be that the people in the people in that vast middle are smart enough to know what it is they need want but not necessarily intelligent enough to figure out how to acquire them in a legal legitimate fashion that is they see have a limited number of options among which are things like theft fraud which chiefly depend on social skills con artists do not have to be geniuses they just have to be convincing by contrast those in the outer regions have either fewer opportunities access to control over resources low iq are often akin to children literally prevented from gaining control of things and so have to ask beg from others or they those with higher intelligence can see and are likely to have many more options available to them as well as tending to be more risk averse due to thinking probably overthinking things through more extensively etc there is also the possibility that those in the middle perhaps especially those on the lower end of that middle are likely to have experienced both resentment and anger towards others both those smarter more intelligent than them as well as those dumber less intelligent than them what i mean is that they will come to resent be envious jealous of and be angry at those who are smarter because of the humbling aspect of feeling excluded from that group and yet also resent and be angry at those who are dumber because they hate being included with the latter that can then manifest itself in malice towards those in either of those groups as well as those within their own middle group because evil is often seen as a path even short cut to being smarter superior more devious putting one over on feeling more powerful than etc than others it becomes a means of compensating for that previous sense of humiliation also one could posit that in some ways people in the mediocre middle again especially on the lower end of it are sort of trained even arguably enabled into a mindset of cheating gaming the system to wit in school and especially in regards to things like tests exams well those who are smarter more intelligent have little or no reason to cheat since they have probably well outpaced the material classwork particularly when not really challenged within a system like the public school system where they are grouped in by age with less intelligent less advanced kids and those at the other tail end well they might be inclined to cheat but are more likely to be caught and so be averse to trying it again ergo it is those in the middle who are essentially rewarded incentivized into it to them the risk of getting caught is probably fairly low certainly less than those dumber than them the value they seek is chiefly the grade status and not knowledge for the sake of knowledge nor can they necessarily see the long term future abstract application of knowledge thus the common refrain why do we need to learn this shit etc some would argue i know of and can even point to several noted academics who have and do argue that the educational system more or less colludes in the above textbooks and teachers who literally instruct students in mechanistic or rote ways to answer test questions particularly multiple choice tests or even mechanistic rote ways to perform other intellectual tasks which then mask the lack of understanding of the subject and favor or reward simple regurgitation mimicry and therefore also cramming and any other techniques that elevate mere passing the test over and above mastering the subject again those who are smarter more intelligent and thus for whom the subject either comes easily or who value mastery over mere perception grade are less likely to engage in such practices and likewise they will probably be of little or no value to those at the bottom of the intelligence range ergo they are most likely to be adopted by those in the middle and even more so by those on the lower end of that middle thus teaching them habituating them that the perceptual end justifies the means and whatever means are taken are therefore equivocal iow cheating or malice are just fine so long as you get what you want ,2,MGTOW

DWShimoda, best answer hello dear woman no it is not that you can find a husband you are looking for what never exist it is called love please stop looking for it look for care someone who will care for you and your daughter and you will see yourself as queen as a single male and parent i understood so please forget the verb love lol she already knows that women do not actually care about love they care about resources but they know that men fall for all of the loooove crap so that the game that they play that the worm they slide onto the hook that they troll with if she blatantly and openly stated that she was rejecting love and that she only wanted the care aka the opportunity to tap into the wallet paycheck of a beta bux fool well then she would not even get the chance to go on any dates at all ,9,MGTOW
DWShimoda, i never ever in my wildest dreams believed it could be this bad it making me resent my child and she has done nothing wrong notice she does not resent herself they never take responsibility for their behavior and they cannot seem to or will not connect cause with effect nor do they ever anticipate any negative fallout from their own behavior or choices remember all of that crap about a woman choice and pro choice etc ayah note how quick how she even admits a sort of default slide into blaming resenting the child she knows that is not valid but who else is there in her life to shift the blame onto she can vaguely blame men in general and most women of course do she can attempt to blame the men who are now rejecting her but that does not work very well either so i guarantee you she not only will end up resenting but in one way or another she will load the blame onto her child ,16,MGTOW
DWShimoda, when women talk about how the role of housewife was a time filled with days of unending drudgery they are correct insofar as these tasks are drudgery actually they used to be drudgery real drudgery back in the days before automatic washers dryers automatic dishwashing machines before electric stoves ovens microwaves refrigerators freezers and other electric kitchen appliances before indoor plumbing and gas electric hot water heaters here what modern laundry was like when the first semi automatic washing machines came out https www youtube com watch v ezyva3khdme and if in watching that you think that was drudgery and you chuckle at the woman being pleased with and happy to dream about that insane collection of gadgetry well here is what typical laundry was without that set of semi automatic gadgets https www youtube com watch v ezyva3khdme but really even that was not the drudgery that it had been before when among other things the water itself had to be carried to the washing machine from some outside or community well pump https www youtube com watch v e3grrqrylj4 or of course before that some river so when anyone complains about the drudgery of doing laundry with modern automated machinery well seriously it rather laughable absurd really which of course is the real reason that women have to keep up and even increase the whinging bitching about it because if they ever stopped the incessant whinging bitching men might actually realize that it really not all that much drudgery after all that it merely a chore that needs to have time set aside to passively watch over more than a major task to actively do that it only seems like drudgery if when one is forced to do it after a full day working at some other job and even then ,4,MGTOW

DWShimoda,it just a bullshit promotional campaign for some singer rap artist crap https www youtube com watch v hsprtm4a8j8 t 0m0s the whole point of the billboard is to get you to go to the website and the whole point of the website is to get you to listen to the doin me song then apparently you are supposed to become a fan and try to hunt down is album or something so if you found him he would be more likely to try to sell you a cd or tickets to some concert or some shit edit btw relative to the topic at hand the us government maintains a website of it most wanted deadbeat dads https oig hhs gov fraud child support enforcement and the key point there is that the guy with the highest total owed is prominently listed as j stroup 559k a while back there had been one or two guys with over 1 million cs alimoney interest penalties and in at least one case decades worth of evasion from payments for multiple kids from multiple marriages divorces but they have apparently been found etc ,32,MGTOW

DWShimoda, either that or the guy has 8 kids and skipped out on all of them most likely this and in one of a couple different scenarios either a dude going around getting chicks pregnant one after another spreading his seed far wide or else he was some high flyer making a big income via some means or another presumably legitimate reported income so finance or real estate or etc at the time of the judgements and thus some major lifestyle entitlement level child support for multiple kids possibly even with more than one woman and then not paying anything for a decade or even two decades plus keep in mind while they show that photo and a dollar total which btw might even be canadian as opposed to uss they do not give any additional data how many kids how many years ago the photo was taken how many years of cs are owed etc it could simply be back debt to government that has compounded ridiculously ,4,MGTOW
DWShimoda,multiply it times several different children with several different baby mommas and i suppose you could potentially total that amount up especially if some kind of alimony and maximum interest ie 12 apr compounding and non or late penalties were attached as well the problem here is that you are thinking this guy was some normal salary joe schmo and that he just only had some single ie 1 divorced wife with a kid or two and i think that highly unlikely edit this guy for example http www cnn com 2013 02 22 justice new york child support index html apparently one of the highest total unpaid cs at 1 2 million but that because he was a a high salary status guy in new york long i land b that the amount that totaled up over a full decade of zero payments by him so interest compounding etc c the cs was for three kids ages unstated and finally d they were in two separate families ie 2 distinct marriages divorces not sure if they were concurrent or edit 2 found a bit more on the above guy via a circa dec 2012 nytimes article on him archive is link http archive is hvqhh for mr sand 50 the huge debt dates to 1995 when a nassau county judge ordered him to pay ms sand 750 per week an amount the court later raised to 995 per week to account for cost of living increases the couple had been married for nearly 10 years living well on mr sand s 500 000 to 600 000 yearly earnings from the car auction business according to court documents mr sand paid 87 000 a little more than two years worth before he stopped making payments without explanation their daughters are now 25 and 22 ms sand supported them with a job in retail sales mr sand married another woman and moved to florida in 1997 but that couple after having one child also divorced leaving mr sand with an additional obligation of 625 per week in child support as his debts accumulated in 2000 the nassau county family court issued a warrant for his arrest and he fled the country soon afterward a federal arrest warrant was issued in 2002 so 995 625 1 620 per week x 52 84 240 per year x 12 years 1 010 880 base amount owed tack on interest and or penalties and well quite frankly i am surprised the total they would claim he owed was not multiple times higher compounding could would easily do that ,6,MGTOW
DWShimoda, what kind of logic is i got scared slashed myself and claimed a hate crime it provided several solid results 1 it furthered the narrative actually multiple narratives 2 it allowed her to get her revenge against others via a 3rd party ie whoever she tagged as offender was doubtless put through a proverbial grinder by authorities and 3 it elevated her status in her social circles as a victim that a win win win from a feminist logic perspective btw note that regardless of what happens now she has still successfully achieved all 3 of the above her confession that it was all a fraud does not lessen any of them presumably the prerequisite for women lit does not involve being articulate or sane what is this prerequisite thing you are referring to s,6,MGTOW

DWShimoda, i think a lot of what you are alluding to are the affects of testosterone no not at all in fact if there is a hormone at play here i think it far more likely to be estrogen related both in the younger and the older men largely because of a sort of toxic combination of both body fat http www news medical net news 20130328 study indicates link between estrogen and body fat storage aspx and many aspects of the modern diet particularly fast food so called healthy chicken http www cbc ca news business marketplace chicken fast food 1 3993967 and of course largely sedentary behavior does not help and alas all too often doing the gym and lifting does not either because quite commonly that ends up including even more soy laden products not to mention steroids these men who hate being mgtow are not able to control its impact on them they do not hate being mgtow because they are not mgtow and it is not that they hate being celibate because many of them effectively have been celibate for years in a dead bedroom marriage and will be again in their subsequent marriage partnerships what they cannot cope with is the empty silence of a home with no one else in it with being free and no longer under the yoke and oversight of a marital partner master many of them exhibit the same kind of behavior pattern in another sphere of their life work absent a job to go to on a daily basis most men are directionless absent a boss of one type or another either literally in the form of another human or else at least some assigned role or task some to do list they lack the ingrained self discipline or internal drive to accomplish anything being mgtow is very hard on younger men especially this is absurd you are positing a claim that is as if no previous generation of young men have ever struggled with post pubertal hormonal drives or that they were ever inhibited from satiating them ,1,MGTOW

DWShimoda, i like to think of married with children as one big cautionary tale oh absolutely i mean the show itself is seems like it ought to be an mgtow recruiting tool especially if when it watched by young guys and slips into their deep psyche and gut level understanding view of the world i mean what man in his right mind imagines his future self as al bundy and thinks yeah that what i want to be good gawd if you knew for certain that that was your fate decades of slave labor as a proverbial if not literal women shoe salesmen with a shrewish bimbo wifeoid and kids that did not respect you well if you u understood that you would probably off yourself https upload wikimedia org wikipedia en b b8 al bundy jpg right after your last touchdown in your last hs football game but of course the guys who are actually like al bundy they do not see that at all not even when a program like m w c is right in front of their face they are too caught up in the moment glorying in those last touchdowns http manteresting com sites default files field image nail 2016 apr 22 al bundy jpg thinking that dating fucking ostensibly high smv peggy wanker was like scoring yet another big touchdown and foolishly thinking that it a further step on the ladder to later major success in life which it might be but only for something like 0 01 of all high school football stars because even those who make it thru college and into the nfl do not always get some big payoff and of those who do the vast majority still end up destitute in one way or another career cut short by injury or other screwup divorce raped bad investments etc so in the end it does not work because the guys who will go mgtow well they were never really like the young al bundy to begin with and those who are are blinded to the reality of it ,2,MGTOW

DWShimoda,slow cookers are definitely great but really a host of other ways of cooking are really just as easy and with just a bit of forethought planning well grilling even thick steaks chops are a matter of maybe 10 to 20 minutes and if you want to avoid the hassles of charcoal then get a little portable electric hibachi thing they heat up fast give you a really good grilled meat quality taste of which will be mostly dependent on cut quality age of the animal get to know your local butcher and you wo not regret it else things like marinade etc can help too pair it up with a microwaved baked potato and you can sit down to a hearty meal in less time less frustration effort than you will spend going through a fast food drive through regular oven here too things like roasts beef pork or ribs or whole chickens etc probably take an hour or two give or take to fully cook which may seem like a long time but it really is not if you have prepped properly ahead of time ie thawed the meat out the day night prior morning prepped in a pan with potato vege alongside left in the fridge during the day and then turned the oven on plopped the bird in as soon as you got home or else if you make them on some weekend ie stick the thing in the oven at 10am and by noon or 1pm you have got the full meal it a matter of perspective and prep really planning more than anything having stuff on hand knowing what you are going to cook tomorrow most men have just bought into the female lie that cooking is some big deal when it really is not btw baking is the same even things like making cookies from scratch shit nothing could be easier sugar butter with a little vanilla and smidgen of baking powder add in an egg and the flour mix together into dough we are talking 5 minutes of mixing in a bowl with a fork for a half batch then spoon drop a bunch of dough piles onto a baking sheet and into the oven for maybe 7 to 10 minutes time mainly dependent on temperature ie 325 f to 375 f voila a good dozen or more fresh homemade cookies and exactly what kind of cookies really just depends on the ratio of sugar to flour and or what other ingredients you add brown sugar molasses chocolate chips or chunks etc it all just minor variations on the same theme other than overcooking undercooking chiefly a result of not using a timer you really almost cannot screw it up ,2,MGTOW

DWShimoda, ok so what happened to self validation see that is what mgtow is about it what mgtow is about but the vast majority of men including many who label themselves mgtow well it really is not what they are about most men are really really deeply blue pill on the inside they may claim to have taken even swallowed the proverbial red pill and intellectually rhetorically they can talk about espouse awalt etc but when it really comes down to it they cannot stand actually living as an mgtow and so sooner or later they head back to the plantation they need that validation and they often miss the drama games chaos etc seriously they do that just the reality and come here to rant shitpost claim that they have sworn off those horrible women forever etc iow the majority of the threads here this is particularly true of most not all but most divorced men the vast majority something like 2 3 end up remarried formally legally re married within 5 years of the finalization of their previous divorce and many of the rest that other 1 3 well they either remarry slightly later year 6 7 10 post divorce or they cohabit shack up move in together have an ltr whatever you want to call it the number or percentage of men who divorce and then actually become solidly permanently comfortable living alone well i would be willing to bet it no more than 5 of the total most just cannot wo not do not choose that path and whatever they stated immediately following the divorce well that irrelevant it was a reactionary phase it this place is really just like a variation on the kind of late night phone calls that permanent bachelors are used to getting from their married separated divorced friends they call us at 2am in the morning after some drunken cry in the beer jag because they know we are the only ones that will endure their bitching about women well at least to a certain extent we endure it sometimes it gets to gets to be a bit much and we get brutal truth with them not that that matters either because the next day or week they will forget all about it and r mgtow likewise is about the only place left for them to bitch rant about their ex as if she is some uniquely evil creature as opposed to just one more in a long line of nearly identical such women yawn sadly then we the real mgtow lifelong bachelors get accused of being them which is rather ironically hilarious in a lot of ways ,2,MGTOW

DWShimoda,if you have never lived anywhere but the city ie urban suburban major metro and you are talking about moving out to some boonies location somewhere out in the middle between no and where then i highly suggest you go first as a visit that is locate some area you think you would like to move to and find some short term rental thing in near that area whether it some lakeside cottage or some cabin in the woods or even if necessary some b b operation or a series of motel room and or campgrounds ie tent sleeping bag then schedule a couple of weeks or a month or more of vacation and give it a test run also even though it a vacation kind of scenario try to not eat every meal at some restaurant in fact depending on where you are staying see if you cannot have multiple days where you cook your own meals and or do not leave the place you are staying one of the things about country life especially out in the boonies is that you are not going to be driving into town much less some city every frigging day and that means you need to plan and stock up for things like food meals for days if not weeks etc and yes there are commuters who ostensibly live in the country and yet drive to town every day these are not really residents of the country life they are wannabes and commuters lol there is a difference a big difference conversely and i suppose probably somewhat counter intuitively even though you are going to be doing it as a vacation and even though i have just talked about planning well do not do not take that to mean you should plan out that whole timeframe as a series of touristy places to visit or sights to see day after day because you should not plan to be a tourist that not the point if you want to learn what life will be like living there as a resident and not passing through as a tourist then that means weird as it may seem sort of milling around and becoming bored with the place something that wo not happen if you are heading off in a different direction every day on some new adventure you need to see how the place is going to wear as in getting used to a pair of old dirty boring comfortable shoes do they fit why why all the rent and why do it long enough to be bored because in a lot of ways that what the slower pace of life is all about and not everyone can really handle that despite the fact that they claim to desire it for some people it drives them nuts it like hell on earth to be stuck somewhere where there lol nothing to do all day after the first day they say i am starting to like this the second day they say this is the life the third fourth day they begin to fidget by the end of a week or two they are climbing the walls and cannot wait to get back to the city for other people well it our idea of heaven on earth to have yet another day when we do not have to be somewhere go somewhere do something but instead can putter around and work on what we like what we want which is not really in activity and also is not lazy it is in fact the fruit of long hard labor and diligent thoughtful planning preparation which kind are you dunno that why you have to sort of try it on see if it fits you see if you fit in fit it or not ,6,MGTOW

DWShimoda, with each passing day i grow wiser yet more apathetic and saddened by reality i am more so saddened by those who live in a false reality the future of my generation i am 21 looks bleak in my opinion this too shall pass making predictions especially about the future is a very difficult thing to do the world is a very dynamic and chaotic place about the best we can do is look at the past and see how things fared during the lifetimes of other people let say you were about the same age 21 ish but instead of the current year being 2017 it was 1929 what would your future be like well shit the next decade is known as the great depression for a reason economically a lot of things really sucked just getting by just having a place to live food to eat was a major struggle for a lot of people then even worse following that was wwii the most brutal war ever and not exactly a picnic for people even people safe in the us who were too young old and so not in the armed forces either but just a few years later that war was over the rebuilding began and 1949 turned to the 1950 60 and onward if you were 21 in 1929 then the next 21 years and i know that sounds like an insanely long time to a 21 year old but it really is not you will be 30 then 40 sooner than you can imagine well by the time 1950 came around you would be 42 older yet yes but still essentially in the prime of your life and the next 21 years would be times of amazing changes as well and despite how your history classes textbooks may have characterized them a couple of decades of the most positive changes any generation has experienced so what will the world look like 21 years from now i can guarantee you one thing the world will look and be substantially different than it is right now and no probably not in some zombie apocalypse way exactly what changes are going to happen no one really knows and whatever else they try to predict well based on how successful past predictions have been not i would not waste too much time with anyone bullshit ideas of what will be keep in mind while the depression is painted as thoroughly gloomy that is not how a lot of people who lived through it even perhaps especially kids growing up during it actually remember it both of my parents were kids during the depression that is virtually all of their childhood years were during the great depression and while they remember that things like money were tight and that the adults always seemed to be troubled about one thing or another well overall they thought life was grand they still had friends they still had adventures played games with each other etc the point of that life is often what you choose to make of it how you choose to view it a family being homeless and on the move can be a horrendous thing but from a kids perspective it can also be viewed as a sort of adventure unlike any other there always something new to see new places new people it sort of like a big long camping trip and yes i purposefully chose 1929 as an example it is probably the bleakest year the bleakest ilong period of time within the past century or more that i could have possibly chosen as the starting point for someone your age and doubtless the ensuing 20 years were no picnic for people aged 21 around 1929 but if you look at the sum total of life for those who endured it and what they also experienced for positives both during those years and after well overall that would have been an amazing life would it not you would have gone from barely rarely ever seeing some rickety biplane to jet airliners from wondering whether everyone would starve to an era of plenty when you would be watching men go into space then land on the frigging moon and watching it on a color television from the comfort of your living room you would have gone from walking everywhere you went possibly w o shoes because if you had shoes you would do your best to save them make them last for fear when you needed them they might be worn out to riding around in some very comfortable car you owned possibly more than one unbelievable wealth compared to what you thought was in store when you were 21 ,2,MGTOW
DWShimoda,trp principles what women really want not what they say they want iow reshape yourself into the perfect bad boy toy dildo spend money time to build maintain the physique women and many gay men drool over buy lots of product go into debt to purchase things that would isplay wealth then work yourself to death to try to pay it off lol no thanks junior butt hay you go right ahead and do that ,1,MGTOW

DWShimoda, i suspect that it manager was fucking one of her superiors close i somewhat suspected that but afaik no that was not the case her superior indirect anyway basically the guy who promoted her to that spot wanted to fuck a different chick in the same department which in fact he later did even ended up marrying that one i think it was more an emotional linkup basically he felt sorry for her was playing beta boss white knight assorted other nonsense but hell who knows you may be right truth is oten stranger than you can imagine she probably got a nice exit package out of it too afaik a definite no on that one she was fired after some major screwup for cause and per the grapevine the break was apparently somewhat nasty oh and white knight former boss was already gone by then regardless my point to the president of the company was that she was either actually the president and truly in charge of operations or she was not bitching about the situation to me as an outside vendor and somehow expecting me esp as a single man shop doing partial limited time consulting to compensate for an inept it department which at the time had somewhere around a dozen employees all but 3 of them software support was more than a bit ridiculous all too often the ineptitude goes right to the top pretty much exactly my point ineptitude incompetence or corruption of one type or another has to pretty much exist all the way up the ladder to some degree ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, and that is the crux of the issue we can yell at bitch and moan about the 9 5 crowd but it the person signing their paychecks at the end of the pay period we really ought to blame i cannot be fucked in my busy day to kiss the ass of a boss or make them coffee or socialize with them aka being there all the time trying to impress i have bigger fish to fry to keep money coming in for everyone on board if the boss cannot understand that or does not value it then they can find someone else simple exactly i fired a consulting client contract because they people they had placed in charge of it were just such a royal pita to work with or even try to work around we are talking beyond simply incompetent rather actively subversive the president of the company personally begged and i do mean begged as in pleaded with me in person and via multiple phone calls to me to reconsider claiming they desperately had to have my services because they could not get anything they needed from their it own people i just responded with a question and a statement the question does the it department head not report directly to you hint yes she you got it she did well then i stated seems you have a problem that you as management have created allowed to fester and need to take care of that is not my problem and you are not paying me enough to bother with the problems that result from your failure to deal with your problem it was a lucrative contract but the ahem screwups of their internal it people were making it increasingly more and more difficult and frustrating for me to get any of the projects done much less maintain them despite the fact that they would been working fine for months prior some of the problems i suspected am 100 certain were active subversion intentionally designed to undermine me cause my systems to be based on bad incomplete obsolete data etc and this was stuff on legacy systems that they really had zero reason to even be touching at that point in time oh they did eventually clean house about a year and a half later they finally fired her and there was zero excuse for such a delay company was 100 privately owned no government contract eeoc stuff really applied or anything like that plus the president of the company was herself a woman and likewise the head of the accounting cost accounting departments the ones that were my real clients inside the company were women as well point being some wrongful termination due to discrimination claim was highly unlikely to gain any traction i think it took them over another year because they were just shitty at managing and despite policies did not really have a good system in place to document negative performance as cause for termination absurd really ,1,MGTOW

DWShimoda, not necesarily dying out but definetly reducing it of the world population against arabs and africans and so what just look at the birth rates man it not so hard to project that in 3 5 generations white people will be a minority in their own countries but that is not a problem of birth rates it a problem of bringing them into those countries it like placing several pairs of snakes into a nursery with a bunch of children and then feeding the snakes making them nice and cozy and claiming the problem of the snakes eventually killing the children is somehow the childrens fault that they are not maturing and reproducing fast enough to outbreed outlast the snakes the notion is mistaken it is not only bad logic it is absurdly stupid the relative birth rates are not the problem and are not the solution the alt right is trying to change the trends by creating a movement a culture an ideology well to begin with the alt right is a whole mixture of things which you have poorly illogically shittily reduced down to an anecdotal accusation you are the idiot who is pushing the moar white babies meme not me i am merely refuting your idiocy ,2,MGTOW
DWShimoda, i suppose there will always be a place for those of us who pursue the brass tacks of the profession but those places will become few and far between it becoming a thing in washington and elsewhere to make it the new assembly line career path for people who have been out of work for a long time that fine but it changes the job in a way i am not interested in agreed among other things well in my experience what the end result to ends to be is that the talented skilled end up running around having to fix all of the manyfold screwups of the 9 to 5 group which is indeed an apropos label for them and in more ways than one one of the easiest ways in my experience to identify who is likely to be a mediocrity in it is whether when what their first experience with computers programming engineering etc actually was if it was only in some formal school setting as part of some degree career path and there was never any prior self directed interest or learning discovery then i know they are likely to engage in only the most banal rote practices code or other work performance is likely to be superficial mechanistic and generally fairly mindless and without comprehension of deeper or wider impacts such people seek out a methodology to adopt not in the interests of actually improving the quality of their work but rather as a means of cover or excuse for continuing to produce crap quality blame can then be shifted either to the methodology itself or more likely to some claim that it has not been followed in a methodical or true faith manner the resulting quagmire well really it just becomes a shitfest meanwhile someone has to play superman in the background just to keep things running and the talented programmers engineers are then transformed into captain save an idiot worse yet when they inevitably miss something or make some error themselves well the blame descends upon that with a vengeance so ayah i agree it time to head off for the margins and just try to insulate yourself from the negative effects at least as much as possible or practical let the idiots fuck shit up and fuck with each other all they want yeah it squanders and burns up resources and how but really well the vast majority of people cannot actually be expected to do more particularly when he leadership is itself idiotic wasteful and or corrupt ,2,MGTOW
DWShimoda, that is completely true there is always going to be risk no such thing as safe sex bullshit there is no such thing as safe promiscuity big difference huge difference the fact that you cannot really see that but instead fall back onto the false mantra of condoms and regular testing oy vey however being responsible by using condoms will mitigate the risk nope condoms do not mitigate the impact at all they lower the probability of infection but they do nothing at all to mitigate the effects of any actual infection that occurs whether the probability is only slightly or significantly or dramatically lowered depends upon a host of other factor as well chiefly including what behaviors are engaged in sans prophylactic of spread which she evidently did not use as it is a very effective barrier against hiv unless it breaks which happens 1 of the time condom breaks are far from the only problem source of failure and getting tests regularly would help prevent you from spreading it to others and help get you treatment sooner for anything you have contracted this part is probably the worst of the safe sex lies how regularly are you getting tested and then more specifically what activities are you engaging in during the latency period you see infections with many sti do not instantly show up on testing there is a latency period between the initial exposure infection and the point in time where the effect that the test is looking for usually the presence of one or more antibodies in the blood reaches a level high enough to show as a positive each sti has it own latency period and there is a fairly wide variation or range even within a given sti category or labeled disease as there are various types strains of each point being that especially with hiv getting tested today is not going to tell you squat about whether you were infected the prior weekend in fact it may not show up as positive on testing until anywhere from 2 weeks to several months later then of course there is the entire problem of which type of test both the accuracy and the precision and the resulting false positives and false negatives readings of them etc hiv does have symptoms headaches lethargy swollen lymph nodes rash ulcers or joint pain but not everyone get them at the acute stage and they are very easy to miss or presume to be something else not always and as you noted symptoms are not always distinguishable from other causes especially during certain times of the year when they are even more likely to simply be dismissed even by medical personnel as flu it is also entirely possible she avoided getting a test because he might see the outgoings for a doctor visit and inquire about it again how often is testing anticipated to occur and at what point after some risky behavior see here the root problem there is not any single answer to that question woman or man has sex with someone other than their spouse and sex can constitute things other than vaginal penetration not to mention the whole but he wore a condom rationalization when should they be tested and how often 2 weeks later every week for the entire following 3 months in the meantime are they entirely abstaining from sex with their spouse what about sex with others again and have those other sexual partners themselves engaged in sexual acts with still others is everyone in this equation possibly a significantly exponentially expanding circle being tested every week every month every 6 months or only every year if that and then informed by those problematic aspects of the testing when exactly does legal criminal culpability ensue what timeline specifically constitutes avoiding being tested and how other than being some rather arbitrary consensus interval ie once a year is that truly justified see therein lies the big problem with the entire notion of legal culpability especially in a situation like the one we are talking about because while the law is no doubt of a good intent it functionally useless in all but the most egregious cases ie someone who is infected knows they are infected infectious and proceeds to blatantly premeditatively with malice aforethought or malicious intent proceeds to infect mutiple other people ala typhoid mary i strongly believe that at fault divorce is important as it requires people to be accountable for their fuck ups anyone who divorces without evidence of cheating or abuse should not be entitled to any payments from the other partner and in the case of children they should remain with the person who does not initiate except again in the case of cheating or abuse they should remain with the partner who remained faithful or the the one who did not commit the abuse because quite frankly if you cannot control yourself you are not fit to raise a child well that too is not the best solution it sounds definitive and clean line in the sane but things like evidence of cheating or abuse are often highly subjective and more than somewhat dubious prone to both manufacture and denial keep in mind the present system even though ostensibly no fault is nevertheless rife with accusations many simply strategic of abuse as well as infidelity as both an argument of unsuitable parental character as well as risk to the children and of course counter accusations as well which is valid the accusation or the counter accusation is it merely a matter of who takes the first proverbial swing in the melee what exactly constitutes evidence of either abuse or cheating again i am not trying to be argumentative here myself i am rather pointing out that the situation is one that is fraught with the tendency to just such argumentativeness to dishonest strategy and legal maneuvering nor is the problem anything new humanity has dealt with these issues going back to ancient times and virtually all civilizations societies ended up with very much the same structure as a result the patriarchal default a system that was never claimed to be perfect and most definitely not perfectly just or fair that was never the goal or standard instead it became the default because it was simply the optimal place for the overall society to draw the lines our present era in it arrogance it obliviousness it determination to create a fairer system disregarding the subjectivity of that the biases in it the problems that ensue has ditched all of that hence we are again going through the same trials and errors that almost certainly occurred in pre historical times and which then created the patriachal default as a result we are like a generation of children that disbelieves discards any and all parental warnings precautions about playing with fire and so the only way we are going to learn to not do that is to be burned ,3,MGTOW
DWShimoda, because every racist wants his ingroup to survive and given the falling birth rates you must procreate sure because the white race is dying out riiiight despite the fact that there are in fact more white people on the planet than ever before in human history and me personally impregnating a white female or two with a child or two maybe even three or four but at least two total well that will be sufficient to turn the tide fer sure lol prime example of logic fail ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, do you actually think this passes for critical thought you have not presented anything here that supports your position junior believe it or not despite your apparent mode of operating everything and everyone is not constantly engaged in some proselytizing argumentation trying to push some cultic belief onto others or prove their own stance to be correct sometimes we just stand back and laugh at the idiocy of others as to this well i suppose it good you are here at least your chances of infecting the gene pool are significantly diminished well your first sentence serves as the rebuttal do you actually think this passes for critical thought lol,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, that pretty fucked because then he does not have much legal recourse sadly yes though quite frankly even if she did know for some time before informing him in the us legal system he really would not have any legal recourse the system simply does not allow for that women are simply never held accountable for any such thing the most he would be able to do would be to divorce her and to claim 50 of the marital assets and then of course whether he would end up paying her alimony would probably also not be affected by this but rather more on whether she had been working during he marriage etc that is just one of the many many problem scenarios that have been created by the advent of the no fault divorce system and knowing people she probably neglected sexual health until it was too late and they were exhibiting symptoms well the whole idea that sexual health can be maintained while also being promiscuous is a bit dubious at best and i doubt that either of them are exhibiting symptoms at all hiv does not really have any other than full blown aids which usually manifests as a host of other things diseases the immune system would normally be able to fight off keep in check in fact the most likely scenario is that she or possibly even he first found out via a normal blood screen std panel at some annual checkup or else even due to some blood donation drive etc ,4,MGTOW
DWShimoda, however if you are a white racist you really should not be a mgtow you should be on tinder looking for a white woman who you can marry and then breed like crazy bzzzt wrong you failed logic class and have fallen into the trap of buying the line that person a that identifies according to superficial aspect x thinks this way believes y therefore everyone else that identifies with aspect x must think the same way and believe y also which simply is not true ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, i agree retiring before 40 is hella risky it is but of course a lot depends on specific situation how well you have been able to minimize expenses etc and also what one definition of retirement actually is that is whether it full blown retirement living only off investments returns or if it semi retirement where one simply backs waaaay off on working to some part time consulting hobby side business etc ie no longer trying to make big bucks to pay off major purchases or debts or even trying to add more to one savings but instead merely making enough to live on cover basic necessities and possibly a few extras so that you do not tap into your investments and yeah he better pull his money out before the next market crash once boomers retire yeah most people really can be too easily fooled into thinking that some x year bull run especially if that is all they have ever experienced will continue unabated long term that never happens there is a major market correction recession every decade or so and generally speaking at least one major market crash every lifetime we are long overdue for that people who think the 2008 2009 financial disruption was somehow equivalent to the 1929 crash really do not now what they are talking about 2008 2009 was much more like the 1920 21 recession and that too was followed by a sort of qe style credit expansion and a high flying stock market including a lot of stock scam firms with insanely high greater fool valuations that lasted nearly a decade before the big crash and the ensuing great depression which granted was deepened and prolonged by fdr shenanigans most of which we are still stuck with today exactly what will trigger it when and then how deep long traumatic the next one is going to be is anyone guess but from everything i am seeing it likely to be a frigging doozy and a lot of paper assets are going to be revealed as inherently worthless the underlying companies not really having any substance at all and quite probably a lot of accounting fraud as well as gross egregious exaggerations of things like user base and other metrics and then well it not so much just boomers retiring but rather boomers dying both dying off literally meaning most of their holdings having to be sold off just to settle their estates divvy up the proceeds to the heirs as well as the process of dying bidding against each other for slots in senior housing then nursing homes hospices etc but probably having to sell down assets to pay for it as well even now when it chiefly the smaller silent generation the prices for senior assisted living are insane we are talking 10k 20k per month and that in the middle of flyover land it gonna be a yuge chaotic clusterfuck just based on that stuff alone to say nothing of pension funds going belly up probably a lot of cities declaring bankruptcy defaulting on bonds etc ,2,MGTOW

DWShimoda, what a selfish fucking march i hope march 9th becomes day without a job day for those cunts not gonna happen and you know it what probably should happen though is that men should skip work too after all they could claim they were supporting women or even that on that particular day the felt internally as if they were a woman lol and they too should not be able to be fired because if they are well unless that same business fired all of the personnel who were absentees on that day regardless of gender they would definitely have a legal basis for a sex gender discrimination lawsuit just because some hyped up day has been promoted and unofficially labeled as a woman day off by some feminist organization entities does not grant them legal cover nor does it grant employers a legal basis for disparate treatment based solely on biological sex gender also all of this day without x bullshit well they are really almost begging for men particularly white men to respond in kind are not they can you imagine day without men or even day without white hetero men everything would grind to a halt ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda,worse the single men studies shelf which is really only the rightmost 1 2 of the shelf what appears to be a sum total of 14 books includes such titles as iron john a three decade old piece of crap manning up a book by kay hymowitz that claims to be defending men but does so chiefly by insinuating than men are no longer men and also no longer needed iow it basically more feminist bullshit meanwhile the other left half of the supposed men studies shelf is full of other titles like what women want seriously the beauty myth by naomi wolf nuff said the essential ellen a posthumous collection of essays by radical lefty feminist ellen willis,2,MGTOW
DWShimoda,i think he more than a bit too optimistic in terms of the annual returns he expects on his investments 15 year over year in perpetuity is way too high for long term calculations and quite frankly he in store for a very rude awakening on that with the next crash or even a relatively minor correction sadly the past several years since circa 2009 have provided abnormally high returns returns that are highly unlikely to be sustained over the long run of decades but that said i also think he exaggerates the annual inflation rate i agree with him that the government figures are grossly understated but at the same time the real inflation figures have probably been more on the order of 6 to 8 per year rather than the 12 he cites and on the good side at least he properly emphasizes frugality in terms of expenses because that the real key not getting caught up in a debt financed lifestyle ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, it a criminal offence in most developed countries to lie about hiv status but that presupposes she knew she was infected prior to infecting him chances are he was already infected before she even learned she was poz granted she should have then informed him immediately as soon as she learned so that he could get tested and possibly she did op story does not give enough details on that but it may have been too late and he simply found out he was positive too that actually tends to be what happens with most sti and couples and it one reason why adultery used to be so stigmatized ,5,MGTOW

DWShimoda, also i do not think every white man is racist i even accept that some healthy pride for your own is not racism i do not like tribalisms because they make people easy to control but it just not fair that most ethnicities are allowed to feel pride and celebrate their heritage but whites are instantly called out for racism exactly what is wrong with racism and why is it that every other race or ethnic group is allowed to be racist without being called that why are only white people and then generally specifically white men denigrated by that it utter bullshit and imo the best way to defeat that kind of bullshit is to not be offended by the label call me racist and i will say yeah so what what else you got i mean you expect me to cower in fear or supplicate and prostrate myself and do whatever you want in order to try to get you to not call me that fuck that shit ,3,MGTOW

DWShimoda, i would not consider the code on the left to be good normal code the actual code on the left is very good what it lacks is any explanatory comment a simple comment line near the top stating fast inverse square root and probably a second comment that says do not fuck with this if you do not fully understand it it above your pay grade just trust that it works would be a vast improvement plenty of complex code exists that cannot practically speaking be anywhere near fully explained in comments within the code itself but that no excuse for not at least giving a succinct summary of the purpose of the function and possibly a reference to some explanation that exists elsewhere ,5,MGTOW
DWShimoda,the funniest part is that the chick is entirely clueless what a fool she has proven herself to be ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda,they would be better off with no tutorial ,3,MGTOW
DWShimoda, female coding style is a myth it does not exist not true the most common form of female coding style is to copypasta someone else code and then as in the example above fuck it up and add ridiculous amounts of worthless comments while claiming it as their own oh and as others have noted when it does not work properly cry some crocodile tears and get one of the guys in the group to fix it for her then she bitches about the fact that he changed all kinds of things in her code that she does not understand or did not think needed to be changed as if she would have a clue no respect anymore because any monkey can code in an equivalent way to any monkey can type out a play lots of people claim to be coding but what they are really doing is nothing of the kind they are frequently just patching together crap code that they have pulled from elsewhere they are definitely not writing shakespeare ,6,MGTOW
DWShimoda,to be honest as examples both are bad just for different reasons the guy code is lacking any documentation comments no idea who wrote it or when and no summary desc line of what the function is supposed to do yeah in this case it a short function but that not the point as another coder i should not have to guess the function purpose from the function name nor should i have to parse through every fucking one of your functions and play mr computer to try figure out what they do you code like this fuck you i mean seriously would it have killed you to add a single comment line saying fast inverse square root the girl code is in many ways far worse even ignoring the sheer idiocy of returning a 5 shitloads of comments nearly all of then entirely unnecessary apparently karlie kloss gets paid to code by the line or perhaps has some departmental lines of code metric that rewards higher quantities or more comment lines sadly what this demonstrates is that proper documentation of code is still something of an art and virtually no one gets it ,2,MGTOW
DWShimoda, imo even young men raised in large families should live alone for at least a year i agree wholeheartedly albeit mainly for different reasons chiefly learning the cost of things learning to cook ones own food do one own laundry dishes cleaning etc as well as things like budgeting meal planning learning how to having necessities on hand and in stock in the larder or cupboards closets etc as opposed to living in manner where all of that is seen as being somehow someone else parent or wife responsibility the former leads to a long term thinking planning saving preparation mindset which lead to contentment whereas the latter leads to an impulsive entitlement fire station mentality that is seldom satisfied but rather bouncing from one unexpected disaster to another but regarding the comfort level of being alone i think the habituated ability to enjoy peace and quiet and be content that way versus having a deep seated need for company noise is well it embedded into the psyche at much much younger ages so they can realize solitude is not the big boogyman they have been told it is on the contrary once they work through the initial unwarranted loneliness and initially maddening silence they may well grow to crave healthy solitude i suppose this is possible and i will grant you that some people i know grew up to have a reactionary attitude versus their childhood home and by that i mean in both ways that is some people who grew up in very quiet serene or silent homes envied friends noisy busy chaotic homes and sought it out whereas others who grew up in those same noisy homes could not wait to get away and gain some solitude and that in contrast to their own siblings who grew up desiring environments that matched what they grew up in ie quiet or noisy respectively the you will die alone meme while unfortunately effective is such a complete crock of shit indeed especially since pairing off and or having children really does not alter that probably about 1 3 of people are fortunate enough to actually die in their sleep and so the presence absence of others is fundamentally irrelevant in terms of their actual last hours minutes of life but even for those who do not well if you are married there a 50 50 chance that your spouse will predecease you assuming you stay married until death and when it comes to children it impossible to predict how they will end up they too can predecease you much less where often too distant to be nearby very often in your later years and it a rather chancy thing especially given modern hospitals etc whether they will be around right at near the end nor in a lot of ways do i think one would necessarily want that all too often rather than allowing someone to pass peaceably relatives particularly adult children will demand that something more be done leading to vain but painful surgery complications etc unfortunately i have seen that far more often than i would like ie some bypass or other surgery medical intervention usually with a very low probability of full recovery success given the patient age condition which then leads to things like liver kidney failure and a much more painful last few days or worse weeks all to really achieve little more than assuage someone else feelings often i think guilt based that everything possible was tried almost guaranteed with many of the substances that are used in things like the pre op diagnosis stage for example the contrast dyes used with heart surgery or chemo after cancer surgery etc those substances are difficult for a healthy person body to process much less for people in the 70 or 80 age category end result is that the patient may survive the surgery but not much beyond because the burden of that kind of trauma and those various substances is just too much ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, unless you are a lurker or managed to get banned from the mgtow community on another account which is highly unlikely unless you were trolling you are likely talking out of your ass good guesses but woefully incomplete in terms of the available possibilities which of course brings us back to not too bright are you ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, it actually surprises me why more men are not mgtow since i never set out to become mgtow but simply reached here by applying heavy doses of logic to circumstances and your circumstances were such that you could transition through to become mgtow as to why more men do not i posit 3 main reasons 1 they are still enslaved to their hormones that is the dick overrides the brain lust vetoes logic and often even precludes prevents the logic from even being done that is the hormones get their first this tends to be more true of younger guys than older ones but age is far from the only factor involved 2 a lot of men are already tied down by wife and or kids sometimes by choice but probably just as often ostensibly by accident ie wife gf just got pregnant go figure now it probably really was not an accident at all but they have been told it was believed it was so from their perspective it was accidental at least in terms that they did not specifically plan it and regardless of which way it happened and whether they regret it or not they are more or less stuck at least for the present and near future upwards to 2 decades 3 not all men can handle living alone for whatever reason most likely early home life habituation many people end up with an emotional psychological need to be surrounded by other people and or noise drama etc with some men being alone actually rises to a level of semi paranoid anxiety that makes it impossible for them to function that is they cannot sleep properly without medication unless there is someone else near that is some other human within the same building etc you can call this the fear of things that go bump in the night and laugh about it but for some people it a very real thing moreover it is not necessarily just during sleeping hours for some the awareness of the absence of other humans within their home for any extended period of time ie more than a few hours causes them get a kind of cabin fever and freak out in other neurotic complex manners ,11,MGTOW
DWShimoda,i am not junior you are this whole thread is full of lots of little special snowflake millennial guys like yourself engaged in trigglypuff style outrage here it actually rather sad and yet hilarious at the same time you guys are bitching and whining like a bunch of women about being emasculated which is sort of a q e d that you actually are emasculated ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, does the queen just knight people from her favourite tv shows not sure what he does otherwise if someone can enlighten me nah she really does not have much of anything to do with picking who gets what that all been done by various committees and underneath that various industry subcommittees and assorted other crapfest stuff including behind the scenes maneuvering posturing probably even bribery direct or indirect and other shenanigans http www cnbc com 2014 06 13 psst wanna buy a knighthood html about the most she might be able to do is raise an objection to someone that was named and then one supposes if she was really opposed to it could technically refuse to perform the ceremony for some individual but in the case of lizzie ii that highly unlikely she hates the very idea of creating unnecessary public drama and pretty much just goes along to get along i would be willing to bet that she has not a clue who 90 of the people are ,1,pics
DWShimoda, but if he actually becomes an american citizen he will be giving up his titles which is why he wo not actually go through with becoming a us citizen seriously he was just doing his part to manufacture outrage by saying that he was seriously considering it the goal was merely to generate the headline fart for the current news cycle he does not have to follow through on it and if anyone even ever cares to check back x months years from now he will simply give any of a dozen different excuses as to why he did not ,1,pics
DWShimoda, no i mean she probably wanted a man to take it to the tire shop for her wait for the repair then pay for it she may have but it would be quite a leap to reinterpret her rather ambiguous statement to mean that ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, it made perfect sense to me in a single instant but i actually can derive context from words no you just jumped to leaped at the same trigglypuff conclusion that op did and you did it without context sorry let me explain that in more simple terms you can understand me read good me know words me have best words rotflmao you really are a smarmy little twat go back to your r thecryopodtohell already ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, no it full of 12 year olds which is where you belong sorry unlike you i am not interested in 12 year olds ,-1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, what you guys are failing to grasp and what op is trying to convey is that her comment was just rude no it really was not op chose to be a special snowflake and be triggered by it chose to interpret it in a way that he would be offended by this is really sort of the same kind of thing except inverted that happens when women bitch about mansplaining and create an imaginary offense except in this case dude takes a comment that really was not referring to him and yet he imagines that it was so that he can be all offended it would be like me going to my general practitioner who is a woman and making an awalt statement implying that all women are worthless no that would be not only rude but an entirely different statement in this case the woman the op was dealing with made a comment to another man implying that all men are worthless she did nothing of the kind you do not make comments like this to people even if you are paying them it just rude and shows this woman lack of common etiquette and manners nope op and you need to pull your head out of your arse women are rude and make plenty of inappropriate even offensive statements but that not what happened in this case also a lack of brain cells since everybody and their dog has a smartphone anymore and there always seems to be an app for that i guess people just cannot be assed enough to use it i agree but that an entirely separate issue one men especially young men are just as guilty of ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda,nah something tells me it full of still wet behind the ears pea brains like yourself ,-2,MGTOW
DWShimoda, no offense but how exactly have you in particular been expecting it for a few years now when your reddit account is not even half a year old not too bright are you ,0,MGTOW
DWShimoda, well that would be due to your own stupidity no it would be due to the fact that op posted a shitty and ambiguous little meme picture as i already explained not that your little pea brain would comprehend that ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda,go fuck yourself oops i meant go fuck yourself also gee golly whiz it a brand new troll account created just to post this one comment and then ironically in reply to a comment of mine where i did not bold anything lol what a complete fuckwad ,-12,MGTOW
DWShimoda,oh stfu already junior ,-12,MGTOW
DWShimoda, that why i added it if i asked why would any man do it well there billions of beta examples true ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, he was speaking to her sense of entitlement that men in her life should automatically do it for her and that would be a conclusion jumped to which ironically enough is not even supported by the conversation as op related it she did not state that she does not have a man in her life to do it for her as op typed it she lamented that she did not have men to learn things like this from which i would presume to mean a father or brother more than men in general because rather obviously unless she is a nun in some convent there are men in the world around her but apparently she does not feel she is entitled to burden them again there are plenty of examples and how of instances and things in which women reveal a ridiculous sense of female entitlement this instance is simply not one of them ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, and why would any sane man want to do that in the first place key word there being sane when it comes to doing things for women most men are not ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda,do you need a fencepost crammed up your aboral orifice ,-18,MGTOW
DWShimoda, but she wants someone to pay for it well if she did op failed to mention that part of the story women engage in plenty of ridiculous entitlement things but going to a tire repair shop and expecting the people working there to perform an aspect that is directly related to their job ie identifying a tire size so as to sell her the right replacement well that really not one of them and of course that really is not how op told the story be makes no mention that this was a customer nor that work is a tire repair shop he merely states chick came into work which is ridiculously vague i entirely misunderstood this to be some coworker who expected her male coworker to go out to the company parking lot and help her identify what size tires she needed and if op did that then he was simply being a tool but if it part of his job then he is just being a whiny little bitch ,2,MGTOW
DWShimoda, thus if she did ask for help checking her tire size he cannot just brush her off he would probably get fired his issue was not that she did not know how to check it but that she was saying no men are available in her life to do it for her which if he works at a place that sells tires is a ridiculously inane thing for him to complain about or even take note of ,0,MGTOW
DWShimoda, what she meant was i do not care about the tire size i just want someone to put a new tire on my car for me which if she went to a tire shop or other repair shop that sells tires service she is perfectly correct in doing so and if that the case i cannot really see what op is bitching about ,7,MGTOW
DWShimoda,then wtf are you bitching about i mean did you need some cheese with that whine do you expect every customer to pat you on the head and say attaboy did you not comprehend that like u whiskeybandit67 noted she meant she does not have any men to do things like take her car to the shop for her and you simply misunderstood ,-52,MGTOW
DWShimoda,bzzzzt wrong there is zero indication that this is a customer op wrote so i had this chick walk into work today i presume from that choice of wording that this is a coworker and not a customer and that op is likewise just a coworker and so is not a service tech or a mechanic or a desk clerk at a vehicle repair tire shop because 1 if op intended to convey that he was talking about a customer business situation ie it a tire shop hint why would a tire shop tell someone to go find a local tire shop then he should have written that so i had this female customer come into our tire shop repair shop today and and 2 if he simply doing his job then wtf is he bitching about lots of people these days men and women are clueless about how to find a tire size and in addition the chick comment could simply have meant that she did not have any non professional men that would help her find that info out ie no daddy no brothers etc and imo that would be exactly what it would mean if op situation is a tire shop thing ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda,ok now here how it should have gone edit this is presuming said chick is just some coworker or other woman at a workplace that is not tire shop car repair business her i have a bad flat tire on my car you wow that probably sucks her i know gee i could really use some help finding a new one you i think there a tire place in town you should call them then you turn away walk away put headphones on etc also you need to go read at least the first part of the book the manipulated man http commons wikimannia org images esther vilar the manipulated man pdf to start to get a clue as to what a complete cuck you are being she walked you right into that and then took a steaming crap right on your head and you stood there like a deer in headlights get a clue ,3,MGTOW
DWShimoda,love it but instead of the menarefucked org well at the bottom there should be some pseudo semi official looking line something like please do not remove posting mandated by the federated department of bathroom interiors in compliance with regulation maf 1892 3 a that will probably be enough to help keep it up for an extra couple of days possibly longer keep in mind that cleaning people are unlikely to have been informed about some idiotic posting like that and the phrasing federated which makes it look official but is nonsense of course will likely mean they probably wo not question it or even mention it to anyone assuming they can even actually read it also even better if you can find some little eagle like logo symbol or something to put in front of the word federated keep it small subtle makes it look more real plus if you put them up with some removable tackback adhesive that does not even leave a reside or else laminated and with those thin self adhesive magnet things which would work great for back of individual metal shitter stall doors and note that most cleaning people do not even look at the backs of those then even if caught you really cannot be accused of vandalism ,12,MGTOW

DWShimoda, i am the only guy on the regular employee level besides the executives at this point i am looking to get out but i want to make waves if it benefits me or can show the people who run this dump the mistake they are making of allowing this shit about the only chance you might have would be if it some major corporation and you could file a complaint with the head office which may not have any idea what is happening down at the local level but doing that well there a pretty good chance it going to backfire and while the local hr seeking revenge against you for filing a complaint is technically even more illegal chances are they would get away with it unless you have got the resources for and are wanting to engage in some long drawn out multi year uphill battle with only a smidgen of a chance of success and again eve then likely only if you are some gbltq protected critter then it best to just let the crap go do not fuck over your life and career over something as trivial as this after all it not like they are handing out pre ipo stock worth millions to everyone but you it a frigging baby shower and a female social gathering that is so sickeningly insipid you would not want to be there anyway besides what damages could you really claim that you were bereft of some single shit sandwich lunch net value of what 5 10 at the most not fucking worth it ,1,MGTOW

DWShimoda, oh yeah what you wrote is all true times were very different now it so easy to communicate with people online and even though that kind of communication cannot replace irl contact i am finding myself skyping almost as much as talking to people irl exactly for better or worse and i think it debatable these days you probably engage in most interaction with your array of friends via some electronic internet based thing whether it smartphone or computer or console based whether it online gaming or chatting or skype text voice video etc that just the reality heck arguably even doing the netflix chill even if done while physically in the same room well it may as well not be because the focus is still the device media rather than the direct interaction with each other years ago and i mean not really all that long long ago much less far far away that literally was not possible the only means of remote communication was a telephone and it was a corded landline usually only one in the entire household so if when you wanted to interact with other people whether chat or play any kind of games together much less anything else well it had to be done in person and that meant leaving the house and going of to distant unknown uncertain locations and so that usually meant either them coming to your place or you going to theirs or else meeting at some public venue chief point being that if you were living with parents then all kinds of questions concerns would ensue about the hours you were keeping who you were with where you had been what you were doing chief concerns being and not incorrectly mind you given the main venue to meet friends probably was some bar tavern because coffee shops like starbucks were not a thing yet what activities you were engaged in drinking smoking possibly doing drugs but and if you moved out and had a place of your own well what the parents did not know did not cause them as much concern they might have general overall anxiety over the area you lived in but they basically had to just shutup and deal with that they usually got over it basically most young people who moved out at least while single did it largely to just get away from the nagging of the parental police or in the worst scenarios having to even ask permission to leave as if you were still a small child and that crap was just really irritating since you can now meet chat interact with friends without leaving the house well parents tend to be a lot less anxious about that kind of stuff since they know you are physical location is a supposedly safe one heck you are right there in your bedroom or down in the basement etc personally i think the pendulum has swung way too far people particularly younger people are actually becoming very a social ie anti social and i do not think it really healthy at all neither physically nor emotionally psychologically healthy because it not just that everyone is doing everything through media software it that they are virtually locking themselves up and not going out to experience much of the real world and then in some senses even worse when they do go out it seems the main goal is to create more fodder for online bullshit ie the look at where i went selfie crap rather than really being in the moment and experiencing the world for the sake of experiencing it instead it like everyone is trying to be the star of their own little quasi reality show in some cases literally the whole youtube star thing ,1,MGTOW

DWShimoda, i was thinking of just giving money throw in 1 seriously just a dollar no less but also no more than that that way they cannot claim you are not participating and the reality is that a trivial amount like that is all that many of the women will be donating to the gift and yeah it a form of harassment even arguably extortion in the form of demanding a donation otherwise forbidding signing of the card which means there is a stigma and a mechanism of identifying who does does not donate but this shit goes on all the time and unfortunately the people who should be putting a stop to it hr are the ones who are running it ,2,MGTOW
DWShimoda, is this technically a form of harassment and discrimination to say those who did not contribute money to a gift will not be allowed to have food which is paid for on company dime yes technically it is a hostile environment and since the benefit here is essentially sex gender based it is technically a kind of illegal discrimination but since it is because of and related to vagina there is no way that you you privileged cis hetero creep filing any claim relative to that even ostensibly anonymous is going to do you any good and it is very likely to result in a significant backlash about the only way you could possibly win some lawsuit is if you did it on the basis of being a member of a protected identity group iow you would have to be gay or trans or something or another if you are the only guy in the office well duh they are going to know it was you ,3,MGTOW
DWShimoda, standard advice when doing financial planning is to assume you will get 50 of what the gov t promises anything above that is sweet gravy even that is probably an overly generous assumption but there is one other thing to realize about that and that is generally speaking prices of most common goods particularly things everyone needs on a regular basis are set not by actual costs but by how much the locals are both willing and able to pay which is one of the main reasons why rent and shit is so ridiculously expensive in economically booming places like the sf bay area i know it counterintuitive to most people thinking but the truth is that costs invariably rise to match the prices people can pay the marketplace really is a sort of slow auction where people bid against each other to buy things and if when no one bids especially if no one can bid then prices drop so the point is if when the government pension payment schemes collapse a partial shtf scenario well its going to affect lots of people some those who are more dependent upon that government pension money much more than others it ends up like the metaphor of being chased by a bear you do not necessarily need to outrun the bear you just need to outrun your companion s well likewise you do not need to be super rich you just need to be better off more independent from the system than most other people and financially or even more specifically resource wise that being better off than most will mean frugality in the forms of 1 having few or no contracted payments most particularly debts 2 having few or no dependents ie other mouths to try to feed 3 having some means of growing obtaining food fuel something other than buying with cash currency and possibly finally 4 having other independent non financial assets that you can use to get people to pay you either in coin or in kind say some extra room to rent out or equipment tools supplies and the skills knowledge of how to use them that other people will be in need of particularly repair skills because if when that kind of a scenario happens well especially since taxation tends to become a ridiculous burden things will very often revert back at least temporarily during a crisis period which can be months or even years long to a sort of barter trade economy even if only to avoid the taxation not to mention because people will still have time labor to trade more than they will have government scrip things like minimum wage laws much less payroll withholding taxes well all of that shit is irrelevant if when the alternative for people is to starve freeze ,2,MGTOW

DWShimoda, here the way i think about it neglect is one of the many forms of parental abuse and i guess abuse in general blindly pleasing your child is a form of neglect you are depriving your children of the opportunity both to learn from being wrong and to learn how to cope with being wrong i think that parents who blindly please their children refuse on some level to accept that they are blindly pleasing their children yes neglect can take the form of smothering the child from failing to discipline them or overprotecting them isolating and preventing them from experiencing any adversity or the slightest harm or even having any wants or desires go unmet learning that you cannot always get what you want and that what you want may be very often is a harmful thing is a very critical part of becoming a functional adult far too many modern parents especially in western nations have entirely failed their children in those regards ,2,MensRights

DWShimoda, i even had a genuine interest in the stem field but obviously that out of the picture iq tests are not necessarily the be all and end all of that the tests are not perfect by any means and they can give false results relative to stem how are your math abilities did you struggle painfully trying and often failing to comprehend algebra or geometry or did the stuff just make total sense and seem to come to you naturally and in response to those questions above you have to be brutally honest with yourself no bullshitting about managing to pass the class or get good grades etc the stuff either really made sense or you struggled with it and maybe learned how to do it in a mechanical methodical way but without it ever actually clicking iow if you never had a moment when your brain lit up and you went aha i totally get it now this means that which means etc if that never happened then stem is not for you you will just be torturing yourself if it did happen and you not only got algebra geometry but thought it was cool and you went off on your own tangent and got into things like logarithms and etc then the iq test is simply wrong edit another way to tell relative to your stated claimed genuine interest in stem what exactly are you talking about 1 was your interest along the lines of gee would not it be super cool to be a game designer or become rich by doing some techy startup well that is not a genuine interest in actual stem work it a genuine interest in being cool and or becoming super rich which is an entirely different thing altogether 2 a real genuine interest in stem fields because it a whole array of different things it is not a single field as you named it that would be revealed by things like you having already outside of school taught yourself at least some rudimentary programming some html web page scripting at the very least and or you would have demonstrated some passion for engineering by tearing things apart to learn how they worked and then putting them back together making certain they still worked or fixing them if they had not been working and obsessing over the thing until you did get it working and thoroughly understood it again you have to be brutally honest about it no bullshitting yourself your so called genuine interest is either of type number 1 above or type number 2 and there is no type number 3 because there just is not ,3,MGTOW
DWShimoda, yeah but i think one of the hardest things to do as a loving caring parent is to let your kids struggle with their insecurities what you have gotta remember is that everyone has insecurities and parents have to do two seemingly conflicting things let their kids struggle with those insecurities and provide an environment in which their kids feel safe about their insecurities here the thing parenting is supposed to be about preparing the child to become an adult part of being an adult is dealing with adversity insulate and protect your child too much or allow them to manipulate you so that they come to believe that they can continue to get their way via tantrums etc and you are not only failing to properly prepare them to become adults you are actually undermining and preventing them from doing so so i will repeat what i stated before long before a child reaches the age of 10 that kind of infantile ie terrible twos behavior should no longer be effective and the child should have already learned that years prior if they have reached age 10 and are still engaged in regularly throwing tantrums or engaging in crying jags then the parenting has been an utter failure in fact i will go even further the parenting has been dis abling it been a form of abuse ,2,MensRights
DWShimoda, mgtow has more chance to pick up some momentum because of the forums and youtube videos except it really not a matter of momentum it a matter of what people are capable of doing in terms of living arrangements most specifically i am referring to the general inability of most people to go it on their own alone and particularly to live in the silence that then ensues seriously most people are habituated to some degree of noise chaos and while they may seem indifferent to it they nevertheless become inured to it and semi dependent upon it for their sense of time place purpose then if when it is entirely absent well they start experiencing all kinds of anxiety climbing the walls hearing voices etc presently and in the near future i think what we are likely to see and likely already are seeing is a lot more young guys extending the years that they stay in their parents home instead of moving out at 18 or 20 they move back in post college or else continue living with the are nts well into late 20 early 30 and beyond some mooching off of them at least to some degree while unemployed or under employed others perhaps simply banking most of what they earn or else squandering it on cars motorcycles and other toys and in many cases well that will possibly probably become a permanent scenario that is either until their parents die or else retire and possibly go off on cruises vacations and eventually nursing home etc leaving the boy as the caretaker of the family home what happens then when a decade or so out that situation inevitably ends as it must whether the boy will have actually learned to truly function alone if not really on his own is anyone guess but i would be willing to bet that not a small percentage of those guys will eventually just become prime candidates to be beta bux cucks that take in some woman crotch spawn ie insta family if only to have someone else in around the house to assuage the feelings fears anxieties of being entirely alone ,3,MGTOW
DWShimoda,well i think it was always a more prevalent thing in europe and i suppose obviously catholic countries most of the us was and always had been protestant and protestants do not have convents or monasteries ,3,MGTOW
DWShimoda, the point that people did not consider was when you push a woman age of marriage back far enough you eventually push it past a woman attractive years yup in 1976 only a small fraction of the population was expected to go to college and the percentage of young women who went was even less than young men more than that it was still somewhat common ie not unheard of and not entirely denigrated for young people to not even finish high school young guys would drop out at around age 16 in favor of farm and or trade or factory work where training was basically on the job and there was still an expectation of long term employment young women still often enough dropped out in order to get married usually to a guy a few years older and start a family before they even reached 18 granted it was often a rather quickly planned wedding complete with a double barrel sawedoff inthe hands of her daddy but still or at least that was the general state of things in most of the us and i would imagine it was much the same down under ,9,MGTOW
DWShimoda, in the 1950s unwed mothers were sent to convents actually the whole convent thing was long over in the 1950 unwed pregnant girls presuming shotgun marriage was not considered practical were sent off to visit help with some supposedly sick relative usually an older aunt living several states away for several months the kid would be born and quickly instantly handed over to either an adoption agency and or orphanage then a few weeks later the girl would return to her home town and sent to some low end vo tech school secretary etc ,9,MGTOW
DWShimoda, what she really mean i want you to marry me buy a house for me to move into and then adopt my bastard child so i can then divorce you keep the house for myself while kicking your ass to the curb via a dv charge and receive alimony and child support from you my sweet dumb ass men ftfy ,15,MGTOW
DWShimoda, 1950s mindset so she thinks her son is an illegitimate bastard if she actually had a 1950 mindset she would know that there was no such thing as a single mom there were only young girls who got pregnant accidentally but their family concealed that fact and sent her off to visit help her ahem ick aunt sara for about 6 months after which they would return home before attending secretarial school and entirely coincidentally right around the end of her visit was ending probably about 2 to 3 weeks before she returned home the local orphanage the one near aunt sara would gain a new baby that just magically appeared on its doorstep and was available for adoption ,39,MGTOW
DWShimoda, would like to be a stay at home mom until he goes to school so basically she looking for a cucked beta bux provider guy that she wants to be married to for a grand total of about 4 to 5 years then she will divorce rape his ass sounds like a sweet deal ,18,MGTOW
DWShimoda,re roasties just stumbled across this increase in labiaplasty as women strive for normal look http www usatoday com story news nation now 2017 03 02 increase labiaplasty women strive normal vaginas what does normal vagina look like surgery 98629662 have you ever wondered if your nether regions are normal many women have and new data shows they may be going under the knife in a quest for what they believe are more aesthetically pleasing genitals data released wednesday by the american society of plastic surgeons found a 39 increase in labiaplasty surgeries in 2016 with more than 12 000 procedures the procedure can range from 2500 to upwards of 6000 and involves lifting or trimming the labia or injecting fat or filler into the area people used to not really see their parts down there but nowadays with so many women waxing and shaving they are just much more aware of what they look like and so sometimes they feel self conscious she said rotflmao especially when you think of it in light of all the hullaballoo over fgm ,5,MGTOW

DWShimoda, of course when you build yourself up using bricks that are all lies adding up to a whole that is one big lie you will become even more sick and depressed i think very few people are so sick they truly believe their own lies occasionally they look in the mirror and see themselves as they really are they do but then in order to go about their normal day which btw they cannot always bring themselves to do sometimes the impact of that reality lays them low for 24 48 hours at a time cf emma watson well since their only stock in trade is their superficial fake appearance they are engaged in a constant cognitive dissonance battle pretending to be happy pretty etc while harboring and trying to ignore deny the knowledge that they are not in fact all that and more there is a similar really virtually identical thing that is quite common when it comes to intellect skills referred to as imposter syndrome https en wikipedia org wiki impostor syndrome and one of t he interesting things to note about that is that it really only came into existence in any large way after things like affirmative action came into being ie promotion based not on actual merit but i found out over time that there is a you and a perception of you it is not hard at all to put in work to change the latter do that over the years and you will certainly get somewhere but you will still be the same underneath whatever paint you manage to put on yes but there is an inherent and insidious trap in the whole perception reality aka fake it til you make it changing the superficial externals is not problematic in and of itself so long as work is also being done to change the underlying internal reality but doing the former while not doing the latter leads to an inevitable disconnect to wit there is a difference between putting in a lot of time studying until one understands a subject so that one can get a good grade on an exam and mere cramming to the end of gaming an exam to obtain a good grade the former is concerned with both reality and perception the latter elevates the perception while cheating on the actual reality people start to see through the paint and see you eventually yes or at least there is a perpetual fear that they will unfortunately rather than address the source of the fear the lack of actual knowledge or skill ability etc rather than seek to obtain the knowledge master the skill acquire the ability which takes work the vast majority will double down on the perception that is they will seek to attend some class or obtain some degree or certification or other credential to create some further appearance of competence adequacy basically trying to obtain some kind of external validation from others and sadly even in the cases where they may start out attending classes with the concept of really truly mastering the subject well they all to often slip back into previous behavior patterns ie gaming the system in one fashion or another cf the cramming prior to exam the tutoring in how to improve sat scores even the flirt with the teacher technique etc and worse the educational system itself colludes with that in multiple ways some intentional and some unwitting the end result is all kinds of rather ridiculous denial of reality scenarios the how dare you insinuate that the work of person x is unacceptable or has any errors etc they have a degree certification credential in english or ms office or and you do not therefore you cannot possibly judge them and such statements will occur even in the face of blatantly obvious and massive errors instead some other scapegoat will be sought to blame for the problem and of course rather than be corrected the problem itself will typically be papered over or otherwise covered up as long and as far as it can be the same kind of thing of course happens with physical appearance the disparity discrepancy between the perceived versus the reality when the superficial perception does not work then some other cause some scapegoat is chosen to shift the blame onto and maintain the farce i think most people have gone through this issue but it seems to a lot in particular women they do not have the realization that they must put in the hard work to change themselves or more correctly in the past altering the superficial perception has seemed to be sufficient iow it always worked before and it a mistake to think that doing that altering the perception doing the makeup and so on does not take work ie time effort skill because it does it just that that kind of work is the kind that they have developed skills at they have mastered the tools equipment and are able to perform that work and perform it well but changing the underlying reality they have no experience or skills at that in fact most of them would not know where to even begin and again habit intrudes even if they do make an honest attempt at it at the first crisis there will always be the temptation to revert to prior behaviors to game the system and of course once they have done that well the resolve to not do it again in the subsequent crises tends to die even quicker ultimately such people revert right back to the superficial ie impress others with superficial aspects credentials overt display of status symbols of success etc obtain validation from those other people and then use that internally to try to overrule to again ignore deny the underlying reality and not just in the manner of their appearance but the sum of things that make them them so many lies so many things that are purely constructed perception on a foundation of lies like appearing well read or intelligent by having all your life looked for complicated words or jargon to recite at opportune moments the list of things to do in order to construct a perception of you over the real you is endless when you do that all your life it must be uncomfortable unbearable even indeed think for a moment a life multiple decades built up as a series of lies essentially fraud you can only keep that up for so long before little cracks begin appearing external success and witness the needs of the neurotic for repeated instances of validation of it that really one of the things that lies at the root of most awards things even real world success is insufficient to silence the internal demons of the fraudster hence they need that additional external validation the applause the awards etc but of course inevitably that comes to an end and what is left tends to be a hollow shell of a person consumed in the inside by the demons of doubt that gnaw away at the mind like virtual maggots end result is a retreat or escape into booze drugs prescription or illicit and or anything else to numb the pain ,7,MGTOW
DWShimoda, it really sad that women have such a hard time being honest now now women really do not have a hard time being honest that simply a lie an urban myth that they have created the real problem is that they have no difficulty whatsoever being entirely dishonest and they are not only dishonest with others but they are dishonest even with themselves and in a host of ways even ones that we do not usually think of as being self deception to wit the woman in the article this rachet cow erm i meant rachel gow take a look at that face and or go do a google search for other images of her notice anything i did the face is painted on and that broad smile ayah that not a happy smile it a fake smile the kind that people in certain professions like health care admins and used car sales train themselves to put on then there is her body quite frankly she borderline emaciated now maybe that partly due to the psychiatric meds she was undoubtedly on or maybe one of the reasons she depressed and on the meds is because she been binging purging in bulemic fashion since she was a short fat teen point is strip all of the makeup jewelry off and see her in the morning mirror as she is oops was forced to do every day and her actual appearance is well to be blunt she a skinny flat chested dog faced chick quite probably with acne pocked cheeks etc hence the thick coat of foundation blush shiny cheeks in her photos the point of which is that deep down she like so many other women who do the makeup transformation has not only been lying to everyone else about how beautiful she is she also been lying to herself trying to anyway oh and something else note her stated dread that he boyfriend was going to breakup with her yeah now mix that in with the tweet that been snapshot there she projecting she wants to believe pretend that she 10 beautiful and that she is the one rejecting the dog nice guys but i think the reality was the opposite i think seen in person she came off as not only fake but her personality was a moody bitch bulemia low internal self esteem psychiatric meds will do that so bad in other words that even beta orbiter nice guys probably rejected her again deep down she knew that which is why she feared being unable to find anyone and killed herself that the consequence of lying seriously think about it you have seen the before after photos you think those women do not know how ugly they really are underneath the paint think it does not affect their psyche guarantee you it does these women are not comfortable in their own real skin and frankly they are not really all that comfortable in their fake painted skin either same goes with the triggly puffs and lesbi dykes that go off he deep end in the opposite direction with the body mods etc and here i do not mean ugly as a person i mean ugly versus the standard of beauty that they themselves have established bought into because what they think is beautiful is not a healthy normal human appearance but rather a fake barbie doll one same thing has been increasingly happening to men by the way the swole physique is not about actual strength but a certain appearance of it ,18,MGTOW
DWShimoda, that really is the key luckily we men are pretty low maintenance animals once we stop collecting treasures for the ladies indeed but hedonic adaptation ie habit is a very real thing along with as my friend neighbor story illustrates is overconfidence that a real guy by the way not some fictional construct he really had retired with multiple millions and he really did lose all of it and virtually everything else as well and he is by no means a dumb guy in fact i would say he among a handful of the most competent and generally speaking even well grounded people that i have ever met unfortunately the lure of gaining even more and especially as easy money leveraged to maximize returns well alas it proved to be just too tempting for him fed off of his intelligence and a bit of a smugness regarding his own financial savvy as such financial manias often do it very nearly ruined him he really did have it all and had plenty that had he just not been greedy for more but instead had learned to conserve and live a but more modestly he could have had far more than just that one blowout decade end result of course is that he now been forced back into not only the proverbial rat race but back again into living a far more modest and even constrained frugal lifestyle with his eventual standard old age retirement now looking a lot less golden ,2,MGTOW
DWShimoda, you are asking alot from these sluts thots out here i ask you what are they supposed to do with their natural craving for many cocks no in exchange for all they are receiving very little is being asked in return as to what women are supposed to do with their natural craving for multiple cocks they are supposed to suppress it period in the same manner that men are supposed to suppress their own natural animalistic urge to not give a shit about consent and to instead merely take fuck any woman they can catch overpower using the inherent physical advantages that nature has endowed them with to do exactly that this is the definition of a decent sentient civilized society one that by definition to exist continue existing has a moral standard and imposes it upon those who want to be remain members of it it is an exchange one receives the benefits of that society with the burden of suppressing one uncivilized tendencies the corollary consequence to the cock carousel is the rape culture the two go hand in hand they are like the two sides of the same coin the second is simply the natural result of the first there is no fundamental difference between a society having and imposing enforcing moral standards regarding sexuality and that same society having and imposing enforcing other moral standards regarding things like property fighting murder etc it is after all entirely natural to simply take whatever you want including to take food from and or to attack wound disable and eat after dead or indeed even while still partially alive any other creature one encounters the very notion of humane killing of animals ie quick dispatch so that they do not suffer versus cruelty even literally playing with and exhausting one prey is by definition a human thing animals do not care in fact since they often want warm food but cannot harness fire to cook it much less preserve it in any fashion many animals actually prefer to consume their prey while it is still alive the vast majority of the little furry forest friends are not friends at all the majority of them are omnivorous and they are insatiably perpetually hungry virtually nothing in nature dies peacefully or of old age nearly everything in nature ends up dying being killed prematurely and generally speaking are consumed while alive either by some other carnivore omnivore or else by some external and or internal parasites the most likely natural death of bambi is not the quick dispatch via gunshot or even arrow rather it is either a being taken down by a pack of wolves or other predator and having it entrails consumed while it is still breathing having it haunches gnawed off while it is gasping at the pain or b being desanguinated by a host of bloodsucking ticks and then having it flesh consumed from the inside by an array of intestinal worms bacteria and other parasites while it muscles serve as a smorgasbord for a variety of maggots from fly eggs and thumper probably does not fare all that much better albeit being smaller he was probably eaten much more quickly and thus had a faster ending you see the disney catalogue is not only guilty of creating the every gurl is a princess tripe it is actually far more insidious in terms of the blatant lies that it teaches about life and the world at large ,2,MGTOW
DWShimoda, i noticed that as well and if you ask me this situation was building up for quite some time it hardly was only a matter of her asking for open relationship chances are the guy noticed other problems as well and when she decided to cross over that line he just said to himself enough is enough oh guaranteed she even admits as much made multiple statements about how she been reading about scenarios like this about open relationships moreover she even admits that she has been actively fantasizing about having sex with multiple different specific individuals and it is obvious that the combination of the two has been stewing and brewing within her little brain for quite some time moreover she has long since begun scheming and planning for how to make her fantasy into what she believes is the reality that she has been reading about moreover there is little doubt in my mind that she has already previously decided to test the waters to sample that forbidden fantasy fruit and to determine whether or not she likes the taste of it because really why risk her perfect relationship for that something more if she was not already convinced 100 certain that she was not only going to but did indeed like the taste of it ergo she has already fucked at least one and probably two or more other men during the days weeks and probably months prior to her broaching the subject with her boyfriend she already cheated period and if he is truly smart as he seems to be he will go and get tested for every possible sti because there no telling what she already contracted and probably already also passed onto him she almost certainly has at least chlamydia and probably several variant types of hpv the only real question is whether or not her infection s had reached the stage of being contagious and or whether she had already infected him in turn edit and what is more the men she has sucked fucked have probably not been the men she has been fantasizing about those guys are all part of her their social circle and she would have feared doing that right away might risk exposure again shes not yet sure she wants this regularly so when she decided to get a tasty sample she more likely did so via some entirely random stranger hookup with some guy off of say craigslist and probably for a quickie suck fuck in a bathroom stall at a shopping mall or equally obscure random location where she could remain anonymous and her hookup would have no knowledge of her name car etc ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda,i completely comprehend your almost perfectly stated ideological positions http i0 kym cdn com photos images newsfeed 000 614 631 54b gif here the problem they are perfect only in theory but relative to reality they are naive as all fuck and while you claimed to hold to the conditionals at the top you very much did violate them almost immediately within the rest of your statements worse you violated them in what you believe to be a morally superior position and as a white knight on behalf of others the gynocentric programming is deep deeper than your libertarian philosophy even worse you then proceeded to be entirely inconsistent with those same white knight views to wit hence those being raped deserve being rescued no matter how debased or chaste their existence is 1 the word deserve does not mean what you think it does quite frankly you sound very much like the feminists that demand to be respected claim that they deserve to be respected regardless of not only having done nothing to have earned that but even despite the fact that they themselves do not respect anything 2 the no matter how debased here again one wonders whether you actually comprehend the meaning of the word used 3 worse yet your white knighting cannot resist the urge to go even further with this faux moral superiority posturing you could not stop with the statement of no matter in from of the how debased you felt you had to throw in that additional little zinger of or chaste why well to prove how perfectly uperior your moral posturing can be here the thing you cannot be morally superior when you have no moral standard thus we also come to the next part of the violation and quelle surprise it comes in the very next paragraph that what a decent sentient of a civilized society does for their fellows no matter how much they may disagree about particular choices they may have in living their lives you even conveniently added the emphasis on decent and civilized society oh and i love the extra little tidbits of sentient and their fellows as well as the fact that you slipped in the little particular choices at the end there here the thing though you have already entirely undermined the basic fundamental notion of a society much less a civilized society you have categorically rejected and denied the applicability of any social contract or any moral standard you have in fact staked your claim proclaimed your right to be free of all social societal constraints as free as any animal of the forest or field you have in fact established that you are outside of above beyond unconstrained by any moral law you cannot do that and simultaneously lay claims to being a member fellow of that society to pass judgement on whether it is decent or not you have no standard of decency remember you rejected the very notion of it you also cannot lay claim to being either civilized nor sentient the former civilized by definition places demands and constraints upon you such as agreement upon behavior what is and what is not allowable or decent ie a moral standard and the latter sentient also by definition requires an awareness of the possibility of misbehavior and misbehavior again requires a moral standard and the negative consequences thereof the animals of the forest field you see the creatures you want nay demand to be as free from constrain as they are neither civilized nor sentient and have zero notions of decency the very ability to conceive some abstract moral standard regarding behavior is not in their vocabulary despite what you children cartoons may have fed you for foolish notions about our little fuzzy forest friends frolicking in the fields the animals of the field and forest do not rescue their fellows if they come upon a vulnerable fellow they either take whatever they have and or they eat them raw and while still living animals have no moral standard and do not behave in any moral manner at all period when it comes to interactions with their fellows the only metric that matters to the fully free animals of the field are 1 am i hungry or bored and then relative to that can i kill it will it be edible and then 2 am i horny and then relative to that can i overpower it can i fuck it there is no 3 should i rescue help it that notion that animals behave with human like morality and mercy only exists in fictional fantasy cartoons where among other things animals are anthropomorphized with all sorts of sentient civilized behaviors they do not engage in everything from sitting as if they were humans to using tools and furniture as if they were humans to having quite extensive conversations again as if they had human language but all of that is a lie there is no concept of rape or murder in the entirely free animal world there is zero concept of property rather merely might makes right or even right to be safe in one body that last is a laughable notion to anyone who knows the reality of wildlife ergo you want to live a wild life free from all societal constraints with no moral standard oppressing you or even limiting your behavior in any way then you are wildlife you are regressing to an animal state of being and having done so you no longer have any claim to being a fellow of a decent sentient civilized society because it is a club you have left that you have rejected membership in it and you are no longer entitled to any of it benefits period if another of the wild life creatures somehow violates you they are horny and deem you both weaker and fuckable well that is none of civilized society business it is none of our concern another of the wild life creatures is hungry or perhaps even just bored and deems you to be a suitable form of prey and possibly food if that critter injures you and then decides to slowly consume you while you are still squeeking and living and feeling the pain again none of that is any of civilized society business it is outside of our concern because you are not a member you wanted a wild life and to live as free as wildlife that freedom includes starvation disease homelesness and becoming prey to whatever can catch and eat you or whatever else they want to do with you sorry sweetheart but you cannot have it both ways you cannot make demands on decent sentient civilized society while disclaiming all of the things that make it such ,2,MGTOW

DWShimoda,it never entirely goes away but it does become less of a concern less of an immediate felt need and i suppose you could say less painful as time passes and there are ways to have a generally contented satisfied life without the wife children this becomes even more so as you grow older and you reach the age stage where most of your friends marriages and families have proven as alas so many of them do to be more of a grief than a blessing or even when the kids mature leave the home and the parents face the empty nest syndrome of what now a form stage of life that is often very much akin to not having a family and which most of them really do not know how to deal with in part because they were to preoccupied by the children to properly plan for it generally speaking they then seek to have round two in the form of being grandparents not permanently it may however disappear for quite a long period of time but invariably at least some slight aspect of it will crop back up again later on some would doubtless call that a sort of regret but the fallacy is the belief that any life even the best most ideal and seemingly fulfilling life will not have at least some regret in it from time to time and what i mean by that last well those who have many children may very well regret that they did not have fewer and perhaps therefore have been able to better spend time with each or to more generously provide for them rather than having to spread time limited resources across so many conversely those who have few children may regret not having had more humans are seldom truly entirely completely satisfied with the way things turn out it is always easy to engage in the what if game and so to construct wholly imaginary negatives versus some fantasy ideal and that will be true of whatever choices you make ,4,MGTOW

DWShimoda, thanks to feminism and sex positivity i do not think women realize asking a man for an open relationship is the ultimate insult they also do not realize that the only value that can really justify a man being a provider protector for them for a man to work sacrifice and gift women his resources is exclusive commitment on the woman part if women want to and are going to be fucking anyone and everyone with no commitment or fidelity to a specific man well we have a series of names for women in those roles sluts whores etc you do not buy those you do not commmit your resources to them you rent those by the hour and or you use discard them you treat them as objects not loved ones they are not wives and you sure as hell do not want them to be the mothers of your someone children that you then have to provide for ,30,MGTOW
DWShimoda, clearly only cares about status money actually most obviously she only cares about herself about her wants needs desires imo the most telling comment in that thread was this one https www reddit com r relationships comments 1q2vo8 i 26f asked my boyfriend 27m of five years to cd98kp2 seakelpmagee 23 points 3 years ago i am trying to find some of op replies mentioning how she thinks he must be feeling how devastated and upset he must be feeling no thought not me me me me he right not once did she even consider that she might have hurt devastated him the very idea that he could be hurt or that his feelings or his wants needs desires are deserving of consideration simply never occurs to her he is simply only a resource provider an object or a slave servant and not someone she loves or cares about in short she does not see him as human her only concern is herself and her only concern that is even remotely about him or his feelings are in the form of why did he leave me me me me ,24,MGTOW
DWShimoda, i do wish you would not fall back on relatively meaningless and incendiary epithets like cuckservative and overly broad generalized categories of bad guy liberals but other than that they are not meaningless at all in fact they are very meaningful which is why they are triggering to you why you call them incendiary talk about a ridiculous epithet and why you would prefer they not be used your third option sounds like setting the stage for some game of thrones shit it also been the kind of thing that was common for virtually all of human history game of thrones is not so much fiction as it is a fictionalized retelling of actual human history well if you leave out the actual dragons and ice zombies iow not sure i actually want to live in a world like that but it fun terrifying to imagine as a hypothetical you do live in a world like that you just happen to live in a little window of time in which the world temporarily is not like that which sadly is something most people do not properly appreciate our world and lives may not be perfect but it is has been a helluva lot better than how most of humanity has live across most nearly all of history same thing by the way in terms of other aspects like the biological war between parasitic critters ie bacteria etc that use humans as food territory our nice little era of do not have to worry about infections because of antibiotics etc well that too is likely coming to an end and reverting back to the norm if we are lucky not until after we are gone ,2,dataisbeautiful
DWShimoda, she says something so small as an open relationship are women just dumb are women just dumb and or brainwashed indoctrinated into a number of fallacious dogmatic beliefs yes to wit they have nearly all swallowed the my body my choice mantra and not just in regards to abortion aka i have a right to kill my own children regardless of what their biological father wants but feminism has literally extended that to a full blown license to be well licentious and in any way shape or form that they want any man be he father boyfriend or husband or indeed any other person regardless of gender or relationship to them who even suggests that there might be some limits or even potential negative consequences to their entirely uninhibited expression of their sexuality aka to engage in whatever activity or fetish they desire with whoever or whatever they want at any given time well that person is just being an oppressive misogynist it really has gone that far seriously if you suggest or hint that they might want to consider limiting their cock carousel riding even just to avoid disease well how dare you ,33,MGTOW
DWShimoda, let me caution those who believe they can live off social security or pensions same caution warning really extends to the notion of entirely living off just compound interest or really complete dependence on any specific dividend or even gains from some paper based asset stock markets crash companies go bankrupt banks may pay next to nothing in interest and these days negative interest is an actual thing or alternately some guaranteed bond or other interest payment may be made and yet because of even higher monetary inflation aka devaluation etc not be sufficient to even maintain the actual real value of the investment much less make it grow in terms of real wealth which is why truly wise people not only diversify and in ways that are far beyond what the financial industry calls diversification to wit buying total market index funds may be good for averaging returns from hedging against potential problems in specific stocks or industries but it does not do diddly squat to protect you from a major market crash correction and those do tend to reoccur fairly often and typically more than once in the average person lifespan no if you want to retire early and therefore expect to live in retirement or even semi retirement for multiple decades you need diversify in much broader ways you also need to learn probably even more important than diversification how to be in control of your actual spending that is to be frugal especially regarding your base necessities of life in a manner that dramatically minimizes your risk of being screwed even if all of your much vaunted investments go sour either for some multi year span of time and or even permanently that diversification then should also include some manner of actually earning a living and or even growing your own food making something of value that is tradable etc and doing so via your own labor physical and or mental skills abilities independent of various third parties other than customers what i mean is that while it may sound great to be some real estate magnate who owns a wide array of rental properties i have seen that fail and how in rather dramatic fashion usually because of either unanticipated vacancies unexpected renter damage and or the fact that some economic downturn or another just leads a significant portion of your client renters to not pay and whether they simply break walk away from a lease and there are not new renters to replace them or they stay in place and force you to evict them well the negative effects on your cash flow can all too quickly turn disatrous case in point a friend neighbor of mine was able to cash out of the dot com bubble and entirely retire back in 2000 retire as a mult millionaire mind you and we are talking actual liquid cash in the bank as well as a diversified portfolio of stocks this was not just some imputed valuation of stock he could not sell he took that money and decided to invest in all kinds of rental properties sounds smart right well yes and no he also decided to be really financially savvy and leveraged himself into an even larger array of properties what is not to love right renters pay the mortgages off for you plus the value of the houses increased by leaps bounds which of course allowed him to take equity out and leverage himself into even more properties w00t long story short the housing bubble collapsed on him he burned through virtually all of his remaining liquid assets the stuff he had left after living high on the hog for years owning multiple personal homes condos traveling hither and yon regardless of cost etc hey as long as cash flow was positive and his assets were appreciating in value he was getting richer right trying to salvage his little real estate empire fast forward to circa 2011 and he is borderline bankrupt at age 50 and less than a decade after retiring with fuck you money that should have been sufficient to keep him alive comfortable for a century much less the rest of his life all he had left for assets that were not foreclosed on or sold off was a small 1 bedroom vacation cottage and he had to mortgage that in order to get enough cash to be able to live on while going back to school to obtain a cpa degree his dot com fortune had been more of a fluke lottery win right place right time than they were to do with any tech skills and besides what skills he had were a decade out of date end result is that in his mid 50 he now back to working full time new less lucrative career as a cpa and trying to rebuild anything even remotely resembling a retirement fund oh and did i mention he gay yeah no divorce rape and so no ex wife and no kids to blame and here we are talking about reducing your general operating costs aka eliminating wasteful spending that really does not have any functional utility in your life such as owning an overly large house ie impressive mansion etc with a lot of empty extra rooms all that does is increase your base annual expenses not only in things like interest if you have financed and not yet paid it off but also your exposure to size valuation based property taxes increased heating cooling costs all that extra square footage cannot effectively be closed off even if you are not using it you still have to heat cool maintain circulation through it as well as far larger maintenance bills the bigger more complex fancy the roof the more likely it is to be damaged and the more it going to cost to repair replace was one of the guys who told me pre housing bubble bust that i was a complete idiot for paying off my home that i was missing out on the fortunes i could have made by leveraging my house as an atm and getting into house flipping renting etc btw ten years later and he back to the rat race working full time overtime etc meanwhile i am still comfy cozy in my lazy semi retirement so who exactly was the idiot ayah ,8,MGTOW

DWShimoda, it really interesting to me that russia spends less than saudi arabia 1 russian labor is significantly cheaper than saudi 2 russia has a lot of natural resources beyond just oil and it has built up it own manufacturing industry 3 russia is also largely able to feed itself and power itself does not have to import either food or energy saudi arabia has to import a shit ton of it food 4 a huge portion of the saudi military is to be honest expensive toys for the extended saudi royal family various members of whom want to be top gun style fighter jet pilots etc and they expend a huge amount on that shit with little actual military justification for it ,1,dataisbeautiful
DWShimoda, because much of it goes to stupid shit poorly managed and inordinately expensive projects like the the f 35 or the navy new carrier which are both 100s of billions of wasted spending ah but a big part of the waste of programs like that is that we then sell a significant amount of that kind of equipment to other allied countries and we do so below cost meaning we are effectively subsidizing the military equipment of those other countries and oh no doubt they hoot and howl about how how they are forced to buy from the us nevermind that developing the tech and then also sourcing creating their own equipment entirely independently would often be far more expensive oh and of course we also often loan them the money to purchase said equipment and then via either foreign aid and or debt forgiveness end up paying off the loan for them now the thing is this is one of the things trump and before him people like ron paul was trying to talk about how for example all of the nato countries really do not carry the burden of their own defense hell they do not and for decades have not even been making the relatively trivial so called contributions to things like nato that they have agreed to make as part of the entire treaty the end effect is that much of the funding for the social programs of european nations including by the way nations that are not officially even part of nato but are nonetheless protected under it umbrella all of the ballyhooed nationalized free healthcare programs and etc are really only made possible by the fact that those same nations do not have to fully fund their own military and overall defense this makes them essentially free riders or less generously parasites so yeah we could pull back cut back on a lot of that spending we could eliminate the us bases in say germany we could go back to the pre wwii foreign policy of just using the atlantic pacific as our moats fuck europe let them fend for themselves against russia etc screw japan south korea and the philippines even australia etc let them all fend for themselves vs china north korea and so on likewise with israel saudi arabia kuwait etc let them deal with their own shit vs iran iow go back to america first the george washington thomas jefferson james madison recommended stance which served us very well for 150 years but oh how the liberals and cuckservatives would hoot and holler that would be gasp isolationism and it would probably almost certainly mean an end to globalization and so called free sic trade because if the us pulls all the way back removes all those bases from europe korea etc then who is going to keep the strait of malacca open and free from pirates and who is going to make sure that the oil can continue to flow through straits of hormuz very little of which ever comes to the us by the way most middle east oil goes to europe not the us or who will prevent china from turning the china sea into their own private lake and only allow chinese ships to transit of course that the above would also mean the usa bringing back it own industry pulling it corporations and technology expertise skills capital back out of all of those foreign countries and ending foreign aid as well sorry folks no more free food and no more food delivered onto your doorstep under us protection oh you wanna buy some of our excess wheat corn etc well tell you what bring gold or something else of solid value to pay for it and you can pick it up f o b some usa port and then once you are out in international waters well you are on your own getting it back to your home port good luck with that by the way personally i think the usa taking over the global ocean policing from the british empire was a huge mistake i also think that it unsustainable and that sooner or later the usa will have no choice but to pull back ergo better to do it intentionally and with a purposeful design and largely albeit not necessarily entirely for our own benefit rather than have the whole works collapse in an unplanned and chaotic fashion complete with piracy and competing empires etc edit of course you know there is a third option instead of either isolationism or being the global policeman the us could start being much more like traditional historical empires and instead of funding all of the global policing ourselves we could start extracting tribute and or protection money from various nations ie oh you say you want us fleet protection you want your various trade ships importing or exporting we really do not care to be able to transit some major global shipping routes pinch points entirely unmolested port to port by various pirates or other foreign military well then pony up with the cash oh and by the way we intend this to be a profitable endeavor so it gonna cost you pretty dearly ,2,dataisbeautiful
DWShimoda, everything costs more in the us than in places like china or india everything from soldiers pay to their healthcare to their equipment since almost all of it is required by law to be made in the united states where labor is more expensive this means that every soldier put in the field and every ship put to sea is more expensive than a soldier or ship from china leaving aside the issue of quality for a moment indeed and often not just direct labor virtually everything costs more because labor is a significant component part of all of it some private or in the case of china quasi private factory producing say an army truck pays its workers the going wage in the nation and the component parts that factory purchases from other suppliers likewise then there are other non labor or even more indirect labor costs like the price of land cost of constructing the building and paying the laborers who do that etc while somewhat crude ie imprecise what needs to be done is to place those totals into at least some form of economic cost context via something like the purchasing power parity https en wikipedia org wiki purchasing power parity cite ref 16 or even to divide those figures by say the average per capita annual income or the per capita gdp https en wikipedia org wiki list of countries by gdp 28ppp 29 per capita when you do that the picture changes rather dramatically the united states subsidizes foreign militaries both directly and indirectly direct subsidies are straightforward and involve cash and materiel transfers to places like saudi arabia and iraq on this chart germany france the uk and italy are all members of nato and therefor have to spend less money on defense than they might otherwise since they know that they exist under the us security umbrella japan and south korea both host sizable american garrisons and enjoy bilateral defense treaties which oblige the us to defend them in case of attack australia also shares defense agreements with the us there is another aspect of this that you are not hitting on all of those america bases in other countries they channel us dollars into the local economies and thus also national economy of those host countries in a large number of ways including everything from lease payments on the land the base is located to of course the money used to purchase local supplies of all kinds to the money that is spent into the local economy near those bases by the men and their families located at them moreover that is money that is then not spent back in the us economy so it more or less directly boosts the economies of the host countries and it drains money from the us economy the usa is in fact probably the weirdest empire ever in the history of humanity instead of collecting extracting some form of tribute from an array of imperial colony countries that host it military bases the usa more or less pays tribute money to it quasi colony countries which then largely retain their sovereignty and spend that reverse tribute in whatever manner their governments desire which quite often is to the contrary of the interests of the usa when you view it in that fashion it truly perverse and even more perverse are the accusations that the usa is somehow an oppressive empire not the the usa is perfect or entirely aintlike on an objective basis but than again on a relative basis compared to the oppressive extractive nature of virtually all of the former empires of those same nations whether european or asian etc well that a different matter ,1,dataisbeautiful
DWShimoda,that was sort of the intent but in other ways my version of it is also seriously a lot closer to the truth to wit i do not know how many ostensibly happily married guys i know who think they are somehow experts on dating and women in general even though their main experience is just with one particular prison camp warden and the last time they actually asked a chick out was well in many cases for senior prom in high school and she became his steady girlfriend then she got pregnant they got married or sometimes vice versa ie he got caught behind enemy lines surrendered and has been in the pow work camp ever since but somehow that one purported success is apparently supposed to constitute vastly more experience with women than the multiple years decades that the late twentysomething or the thirtysomething or even 40 year old single guy has the guy who has typically approached and asked out dozens if not hundreds of different women and then dated or even been in some str ltr with several as a result but managed to dodge the bullets and to escape every single time you wanna talk battle fatigue ayah riiiight ,1,MGTOW

DWShimoda, i wonder if africa will take over you wonder if africa will take over what the many african nations cannot even properly govern their own territories nor effectively harness their own natural resources they are not going to take over anything they are certainly not going to overwhelm china 1 4 billion nor india 1 3 billion they are not going to swim across the atlantic and take over the usa with our 350 million nor brazil with it 200 million nor indonesia 260 million nor the rest of se asia much less pakistan or bangladesh with their close to 200 million each the vast majority of africans are not going anywhere they will live and die by one means or another on the african continent and probably mostly in near the place they were born there is no means or mechanism for them to do anything different not en masse as the guy with the gumballs visually demonstrates https www youtube com watch v ubgzbj59 xs immigration to the west is not actually about alleviating poverty much less reducing the impact of population growth in their native countries it not about that it about affecting domestic policies politics ie controlling subverting existing domestic western nation populations and that bullshit is just about played out remember 2 1 is replacement level this is fundamentally irrelevant there is a notion that a slightly smaller population will lead to a downward death spiral but there is no logical rational reason to hold that position anymore than to believe that exponential increase will continue unabated into infinity certainly not as some absolute rule that is applicable to all population at all stages there are in fact more people of white western european extract alive today than ever before in history they may be a smaller percentage of the total world population than in recent decades and centuries but that is a different thing the same is true of say japan there are many more nipponese alive now than during japan expansionary empire years now to be sure their total population apparently peaked in circa 2008 at an estimated 128 083 960 and has been and is expected to continue to decline slightly year over year for the next few decades but you have to keep in mind that japan was just fine in circa 1900 with a population of under 50 million notions that if present trends continue unabated like for instance the prediction that japan population will keep declining which will leave japan with a population of 42 million in 2110 are ridiculous because populations are dynamic things if when a declining population opens up more resources then assuming the younger people have not been stupidly forcibly over burdened with being slaves to rich elders a condition by the way that is itself unsustainable the inherited wealth is likely to engender a resurgence in births the relative population thing is a different sort of creature the main concern there being major population differences between adjacent nations regions on an essentially contiguous land mass the vast mass of african population is most certainly not going to hop across the atlantic and the reality is that they are not going to be crossing the mediterranean either the trickle of so called refugees that have been migrating across the mediterranean recently while a sizable number are not the mass of the african population nor even a tiny fraction thereof and they are only doing so because a they fully expect to not be opposed in their crossing and b to find free resources when they arrive in europe change either of those conditions and even the trickle will stop moreover you need to remember that warfare is no longer a matter of simple numbers of people and certainly not merely having a larger number of people on one side versus a slightly smaller number on the other especially when the smaller one controls vastly more resources and more sophisticated ones we have ways of forcibly turning back and or killing people en masse and while distasteful and possibly a last resort is nevertheless still an option and as other options fail or are abandoned such use of force becomes increasingly more likely ,3,MGTOW
DWShimoda, no most people in africa do not live to reproduce many people will have many children most of those children wo not live past childhood historically that was true then circa 1950 the west decided to step in with the newly minted antibiotics vaccines and lots and lots and lots of cheap food america ag sector had been industrialized and pushed into mass export mode before during wwii and that persisted after wwii with relief efforts to bombed over europe once europe had recovered well the stuff had to go somewhere and using it as foreign aid including a significant amount that was ostensibly profitable commercial export but paid for by money loaned to third world nations money which they never had the means to pay back which not coincidentally was then a mechanism tool for cold war shenanigans etc result of that has been that more and more of those children survive to adulthood and live long enough to reproduce and that has led to an exponential increase in population now you are correct in that eventually things are going to return to that previous state the growth rate is not sustainable under any food production system and most definitely not on their own domestic production likewise antibiotics do not work forever eventually the vulnerable strains will be largely gone and only the resistant or entirely immune because calling them resistant is an understatement strains will be left and they will run rampant particularly if when malnourishment becomes the norm and or when other disruptions to supply take place natural disaster wars etc actually arguably it started earlier around the beginning of the 20th century the british began efforts to as absurd as it now seems to purposefully increase the population of many of their colonies particularly in africa to wit http www historyworkingpapers org page id 195 until the late 1930s british officials and population experts viewed africa as an underpopulated continent 3 this belief which dated back to the work of malthus in the early 19th century rested on the presumed limitations of the african environment and the backwardness of its economy as well the impact of slavery warfare and social customs such as polygamy and prolonged breast feeding 4 the british like other colonial powers in africa believed that small unhealthy populations inhibited the development of africa s resources 5 ironically the reliance of colonial regimes upon forced labor as a solution exacerbated the problem 6 during the inter war years british officials called for new public health measures and expanded agricultural production to increase the size and efficiency of african populations 7 given the limited resources of colonial governments made worse by the great depression these programs made little impact on african populations before the second world war 8 ,2,MGTOW

DWShimoda, president trump said saturday that he will not attend the white house correspondents association dinner imo there should not even be an entity like the white house correspondents association the very idea is essentially that of a royal court a group of privileged apparatchiks that have special access special privileges and serve as a sort of anointed priesthood to interpret the statements of some divine oracle or else prevent the words of the oracle from getting out imo best easiest way to kill off that particular collection of alligators would be relatively simple a kind of term limit or rotation of reporters allowed into press briefings say 6 months max and they are credentials are revoked they are out done and their company needs to send someone new or else 3 months and then not allowed to return until a year later alas i know that kind of thing is not going to happen in part because the wh staff foolishly think they are developing a relationship with the reporters as if they are coworkers and on the same team which of course is the whole problem they are not and should not be a team neither the same team nor opposing teams the press giving an administration a pass or cover as they did with obama is at least as much a part of the problem as the present attack the administration on everything bullshit neither one is honest neither one is the press actually doing it job it was arguably bad enough the way that it started a century ago basically just an after hours get a couple of drinks together compare notes kind of thing the drinks part fine the compare share notes not fine that the beginning of a cabal but what it has morphed into over the century since is far far worse ,4,MGTOW

DWShimoda, even if we would cut off the funds we would not kill academia oh you might be surprised the source of power of academia is not in the salaries the endowments and the assets get rid of it all and it would still be just as powerful as it is now perhaps even more powerful as it would not have anything left to constrain its excesses the true source of power is their presumption of authority based on their own internal culture that demonstrates that authority is it is it really or more properly is it really true anymore i would move that it is not proof well this for one http www straitstimes com opinion prof no one is reading you see also this commentary http www garynorth com public 15853 cfm on that linked piece fortunately they are weak there too perhaps weaker than they have ever been this academia has grown it has grown fat and lazy and it has expanded it reach so far and so wide and so deep that it has fundamentally destroyed it own value it has so undermined and rendered it so called expertise so trivial and so obfuscated that no one really gives a shit anymore currently virtually no one actually goes to the academic world for knowledge instead they go solely for the credential a credential that is quickly proving to be entirely worthless a farce a fraud a con game we live in a time when one bright literate and charismatic guy can debunk and defrock a distinguished professor lifetime of work with just a pc a blog and a youtube account when the great unwashed show themselves wiser than the peers academia loses the mystery of its process which is far more devastating to it than a loss of mere finances exactly but you cannot forget that the typical academic minus the glorious institution which not only needs a ever increasing amount of money to operate but is deeply mired in debt and hovering on bankrupcty minus that they are just babbling fools talking nonsense may as well be the insane homeless guy bag lady that lives under a bridge and remember that the vast majority of them have zero real life skills and no desire ability to obtain them nor to do real work that more or less the hallmark of the modern academic a disdain of actual work those who do it and it is why they are in academia to begin with pull the proverbial rug out from under them remove the taxpayer financing and the government guaranteed loans and the whole thing collapse and one way or another on purpose or perforce that is going to begin happening ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, if you knew you may live not 40 but only 5 10 years more would you still care about women and their issues there something else there as well especially for young ish guys in say their late teens and twenties you know how you have a tendency to think that someone who is say 60 or 50 or possibly even 40 something is really old or at least pretty old do you remember how probably just a few years ago you thought someone age 30 was really old or at least pretty old or indeed a few years before that how even high school or college aged kids were old including people who were younger than you are now but at the same time while in one sense it seemed like it was taking forever for you to get to become an adult on the other hand it really kind of took place faster than you thought ie you were never going to get out of junior high but then suddenly holy shit just like that you realized you were graduating from high school well the old cliche that time seems to move faster as you get older has an element of truth and before you know it you too will be turning 30 then 35 then suddenly you will be 40 45 50 and so on whether you realize it or not you are already one of the old guys to some group of younger guys and you are well on your way to becoming one of the really old guys ok you say gee thanks for that depressing thought you old fart what is your point my point is that i think you need to look back at say your high school days how much of that four years relatively short period of time of your life was squandered wasted even ruined by girls with their petty little bullshit games or if not by actual girls then by your own pointless anxiety frustration and concern about them and or worse yet what they might be thinking saying about you now switch gears what else might you have achieved during those four years and i am not talking about school crap i mean life skills experiences had you been either less concerned with them or better yet entirely or almost entirely oblivious to them and their petty bullshit and i am not even saying that you would have had to entirely ignore girls but rather that you just not be all that concerned school dance ask a girl or two to go but if they say no well it really not the end of the world is it go anyway or do not go it really does not did not matter did it the point is the next decade of your life yes decade is going to go by pretty much as fast as those 4 years of high school did before you know it you are going to be thirty do you want to look back on that decade and see the same pattern the same pointless games or do you want to be able to look back and see that decade as a series of achievements accomplishments that moved you towards your goals in life that you went out and starting learning the skills and having the experiences that you dreamed about back when you were younger go skiing or sailing travel europe or asia or some pacific island learn to ride a horse take lessons to how to fly a small plane maybe jump out of a perfectly good one on purpose learn a solid trade make some money with it start a business fail start another one and succeed save up invest cash out some of it so that you can own a cabin near hunting land or by a lake for fishing or well hell there an almost limitless number of things you used to dream about right maybe you still do so do them do not just dream while you fester fuss over some bullshit txt messages from some tinderella because before you know it in the blink of an eye you are going to be this guy https www youtube com watch v u18vki0udxe t 1m36s or lol at least you are going to be as old as he is assuming of course as op noted that you are even still alive ,19,MGTOW

DWShimoda,to my mind one of the biggest problems with it is the one that so seldom gets discussed and that is how it has become so destructive of actual real world socializing i do not simply mean the ridiculously banal vanity of the selfies and such but rather that many people have ceased to actually communicate with friends relatives there is an expectation that because they have posted pictures and updates etc you will have been following any all of that online an activity that to me always seems to have a creepy stalker or even voyeuristic feel to it that i abhor and as a result there is no need to touch base with other people in a more direct manner and worse yet then if when you do get in touch with them there is almost a sort of petulant offense that you have not been following seen all of their photos etc which i have not because i do not use facebook at all as in i have literally blocked all of fb domains or at least the major ones at my router level because i simply do not see any reason to allow the bastard to be tracking my moves around the internet in any way shape or form iow fuckzuck ,9,MGTOW

DWShimoda, nobody is stopping anybody from creating these positive submissions they could be doing it instead of complaining about the lack if it generally speaking such threads require more effort and in several ways which makes them fewer in number to begin with then they just do not get upvoted very much and as a result do not really hang around long enough to get much noticed a big part of that is simply inherent in the nature design structure of reddit itself new content is supposed to drive out old and alas one very natural result of that is that shallow snarky fast easy to consume content tends to get more votes and gain higher prominence in no small part because shallow participation is allowed including voting from lurkers and non subscribers and are given equal value to those of the deeper more involved participants add in that the majority demographic of reddit overall is rather young ignorant relatively shallow and well in a word puerile in short that majority gets what it wants and it wants likes shallow snarky crap also being puerile that same majority loves to whine complain and often in a self contradictory manner ,4,MGTOW

DWShimoda,i asked what breakthrough do you believe he einstein made and what were the results both inside and outside academia what came of him re engaging in academia you replied maybe we can have a beer sometime and talk about it nope you made a claim that einstein changed our view of the world as a your prime example ergo you have some kind of understanding of the view of the world that was changed and how it was changed or perhaps you at least believe that you do and so you should be capable of giving something for a fairly succinct answer because otherwise that statement einstein changed our view of the world instead of being the compelling example you think it is would be an example of what a complete fraud you are btw your reticence to state anything at all is in and of itself a q e d proof of the incompetence impotence of academia and it is not surprising to me in fact it was one of the several pat answer responses i expected basically you were taught that einstein as a great cientist changed our view of the world but you were either taught that without any context and or you failed to actually learn anything further about it oh and the tidbit about working part time in a patent office is an entirely irrelevant pretentious pedantic flourish and unironically one that also happens to be false side note and no bitching about the complexities of einstein theory are allowed as a reason for your failure to answer the questions first because you chose einstein as your example you could have chosen copernicus or edison or tesla or the wright brothers or any of a dozen others but you did not you chose einstein so presumably you would have some concept of why secondly i did not ask you to fully explain his theory nor really even the least part of it merely to note what the breakthrough of it was and then since this was your chief point use of it what effect he and his work his papers had on our view of the world even allowing you to distinguish inside academia from the rest of the world ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda,addendum to the above especially regarding this but i am getting the vibe that you and i need to get comfortable with disagreeing on this topic i really see zero compelling need nor really even any reason at all for me to get comfortable with you at all in any way shape or form after posting the above reply and just for s g i went and took a look at op comment history and without having to dig very far in fact the comment posted immediately before this thread to find this little gem https np reddit com r purplepilldebate comments 5w2kb7 women of ppd you do not represent the majority of de6zv7h which i quote in its entirety below rreliable 9 hours ago you do not want anecdotal data and you want something objective and measurable i am your guy just look how many rattle on about how hard it is to get laid even a handful of times or how female standards are impossible to meet that is not the norm but because trp is an echo chamber of men who have had difficulty with women they think it is last time i checked the national health and social life survey nhsls http www lehmiller com blog 2014 5 30 sex question friday how many sexual partners have most people had with over 3 000 people sampled said 67 of men had between 0 and 10 partners in a lifetime and 91 of women reported the same 10 partners per lifetime means only three new lovers per decade let imagine a guy ambition is to reach 10 so every saturday night he puts on his snazzy outfit and approaches women in order to score an average number of times he will be nexted 155 156 that a success rate of less than 1 and only 33 of men are more successful than that according to the study so it looks like you are totally wrong factually the levels and multiple degrees of illiteracy innumeracy and wider incompetence even idiocy on display in that single short little comment ayah pretty much says all that needs to be said about u rreliable does not it ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, well i have to say that i cannot fully agree quit with the weaseling academia may indeed be overrated but i do not agree that it an fairly be described as impotent well it is http www straitstimes com opinion prof no one is reading you see also this commentary http www garynorth com public 15853 cfm on that linked piece i even have my own little relevant to this thread and op q e d to proof the general impotence of academia see below the ivory tower is achieving its aims lol yes and no the chief real aim of people in academia is as it always has been to pad their own nest to do so via as little actual work as possible and to protect itself from external control and at that yes they have been fairly successful as they ever and always were but that success has been derived entirely again as always as a parasite on a growing and healthy host akin to a tumor or cyst draining ever more and more health away from the host but really not becoming healthy itself and as the parasite has once again grown beyond the capacity of the host to sustain it is gradually destroying the host health and will eventually kill the host and itself but also no in the larger sense academia has not been successful in either it stated goals nor its hidden goals the succeeding generation of students have not remained faithful to the narrative beliefs that their instructors held and taught nor in fact did they really learn their catechismals in anything other than a rote mairzy doats fashion lacking anything even remotely akin to a full much less clear comprehension not surprisingly since in fact academia itself has at beast a largely farcical pretense of understanding of most things again see the q e d below and the multi generational transfer as such is akin to a game of chinese telephone and if you disagree with those aims then it is valuable to introduce dissension into the ivory tower rotflmao the ivory tower always has been and always will be filled with dissension factions debate and arguments over trivial inanities this is one of the chief aspects of its impotence exhausting oneself attempting to infiltrate academia merely to add yet another trivial inane aspect of dissension wo not achieve anything of value to wit you noted in your original post some nonsense about einstein which really more proves my point than your but nevertheless serves as a most excellent example of academia incompetence and impotence in all regards what is more that this provides the opportunity for a very simple q e d all i need to do is ask you to tell me what specifically you think einstein achieved what breakthrough do you believe he einstein made and what were the results both inside and outside academia what came of him re engaging in academia and try to be as succinct as possible it should in fact be possible to be very succinct but i am getting the vibe that you and i need to get comfortable with disagreeing on this topic i really see zero compelling need nor really even any reason at all for me to get comfortable with you at all in any way shape or form ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda,academia per se has never really created anything of durable importance or value let me repeat that with emphasis academia per se has never really created anything of durable importance or value theoretical work writing etc all fine and well but do not waste your time trying to push it into and thru academia academia is and always has been a formal mechanism for the systematic indoctrination of naive idiots and useful fools as useful tools into a dogmatic belief system colleges and universities have ever and always been seminaries and have always been about creating priests to engage in a form of conning and thieving and pillaging of the society itself most of the disciples then drink deep swallow whole and regurgitate it on demand generally in a mechanical and uncomprehending manner because comprehension was never part of the program only acceptance and regurgitation and they generally do so in exchange for petty benefits the perpetuation of the system itself and sale of various indulgences of one form or another which belief system whatever is prevalent and or trending in certain segments sections of the larger society as a system of change academia is itself vastly overrated and largely impotent to be sure it preaches a mythology and expounds a narrative but in reality it only does so in a type of feedback manner academicians pride themselves that they are the leaders of the parade but invariably what they actually do is run out in front of an already forming up mass and thereafter pretend that they are the ones who formed and led the collective but it is ever and only and always a pretence a farce fraud real change always comes from elsewhere ,4,MGTOW
DWShimoda, it important at all times to reserve the option to yourself to leave the relationship flat out without looking back it important to keep in your mind and remind yourself if you have to that you have that option and ability indeed i suppose i should have noted that the advice technique i am talking about comes from a pre vawa era and also a time when the whole regret revenge false accusation of rape stuff was not really a thing these days you try that technique with the wrong psycho chick and well you better be wearing a body cam recording audio and video just to cover your ass and it was by definition something to be used when the relationship is in it early stages that is dating courting and prior to any cohabiting stuff to say nothing of married with children dating is when you absolutely do have the the option to simply breakup leave and probably should if you stay time and time again after she throws fit after fit she probably cannot learn and you will end up wasting your time and energy on a lost cause you have to be prepared to walk out no questions asked yes this part cannot be overemphasized even though i used the dog training metaphor analogy that actually not what is going on here you are really not training them into some wholly new or unique behavior pattern and if you are well god help you with that in most cases yes even entitled snowflake princesses they do already know how to interact with people in a fairly adult civilized manner and in fact it probably is their default mode with strangers so what you they are doing is finding out which behavior patterns will work within this relationship with on you fairly early in the relationship there will be a sort of which buttons do what stage let see if i press button a for anger how does he respond press b for bitch mode how does he react press c for cute cuddly etc ergo guys who cave to tears sobbing are reinforcing that behavior pattern as being a functional useful one within this relationship iow just as dr frankenstein created his own monster well guys with monster gfs wives did the same her parents may have created certain tendencies but within the relationship the couple created their own patterns of interaction worse some guys essentially unwittingly teach that women that pushing the t tears button harder and multiple times is the way to make it work and get what they want within that relationship sure he will ignore the initial sniffle he will sometimes even reject the increased sobb cry but then he will always cave in to the full drama display well guess what he is going to get in that relationship in the future that right lots and lots of full drama displays whenever she deems it applicable to get what she wants trying to reverse that to remedially train it back out of someone much later in a relationship well it like you have suddenly decided you wanted to change swap around the gas brake and clutch pedal placement on the floor of the car that shit was memorized automatized a long time ago gas is on the right brake is in the middle clutch is on the left once you have learned to drive you do not even think about that anymore you just use it someone moves the gas to the middle the clutch to the right and the brake on the left disaster worse yet only sometimes is it the new arrangement and sometimes it still the old one step on the right pedal and it might be the clutch but do it multiple times in quick succession then mash it down hard and tada it magically changes back to the old gas pedal tears do not work try again try moar tears try full blown drama sobbing crying tears and would o not you love me begging dang did not work try again aha now that time it worked again ie he came back he caved he gave in to what she wanted etc once an initial pattern has been established then intermittent reinforcement which is what all too often happens with attempts at remedial corrective change in relational behavior patterns actually creates a stronger effect because the reward comes after multiple attempts and generally speaking more effort within the brain the end result is much the same as if the reward had increased with each iteration the only way to end to extinguish the established behavioral pattern again within that relationship is for multiple iterations of that escalation cycle to be exhausted and end in failure every single time at every level within each cycle and across multiple iterations of the cycle attempts how many iterations depends on how deeply ingrained the pattern has become how many weeks months years has it worked the old way to go back to the car floor pedal metaphor if the pedals get permanently swapped you will eventually learn that the right pedal no longer ever works as a gas pedal if it never functions that way again and even then at some random point in the future you might inadvertently think attempt the old pattern again before quickly correcting yourself in mid applicaton but they have to always work that way they cannot ever go back to the old pattern ,1,MensRights
DWShimoda,i would go even further if a society does not do all that it can to make certain its best young men men of intellect resources productivity restraint responsibility are treated fairly respected allowed to control resources which they themselves produce and that they are the enabled encouraged even incentivized to reproduce and then properly supervise raise mentor a subsequent generation in turn and instead that society enables facilitates the exponential reproduction of it worst and most irresponsible young men aka bad boy players criminals etc then such a society has no reason to complain when the subsequent generation either burns it to the ground or merely stands around like a bunch of morons watching it all crumble nor indeed should they expect anything different actions and choices have consequences for societies as well as individuals ,2,MGTOW
DWShimoda, mgtow also fits this proverb because opting out of society ensures its collapse it the passive aggressive approach to burning down the village i tend to think of it more as moving to high ground well in advance of a storm driven flood or tsunami we are not actually doing anything to actively contribute to the oncoming disaster certainly not ensuring it collapse we are just doing what we can to save our own asses usually after trying and failing to warn others others get militant but we just remove our services that would otherwise maintain the infrastructure and government revenues i have to say i disagree with this analogy as well we are far too small in numbers to actually maintain the infrastructure we are just not willing to engage in much less exhaust ourselves in entirely unappreciated and ultimately vain sacrificial superhuman feats to attempt to reverse the active sabotaging of the system that the feminists and others are engaged in if they want to go around punching holes in the proverbial dykes and dams that are holding back the floodwaters well they are going to suffer the consequences we are not going stand there all night long like some cucked little dutch boy with our finger stuck into the hole nor are we going to chase around after the saboteurs trying to patch the dam things back up again like i said previously we are heading for high ground instead fuck em let em drown ,1,MGTOW

DWShimoda, i definitely get the state county town village from local pd friends to my cousin being state trooper yeah good chunk of what i know if based on some similar things i too have a fairly close relative that is a state trooper and years back i had a roommate that was going through my state trooper academy and when he came home on weekends well he had a shitload of books manuals he needed to study through and sort of used me as his study partner quiz buddy to help him review shit and to do that of course i had to sort of go through and read learn quite a bit of it myself so in a rather crude way and here you have to realize i read and write blazingly fast and have really good comprehension skills rather wide technical knowledge etc well i sort of went through the paperwork information side of the trooper training myself over the course of those several months lol granted this was almost 3 decades ago and i have forgotten most of the trivial minutiae but the general gist of the overall breadth and depth of what they were trained in regarding the law and the procedures policies at least as they were back then has more or less stuck with me plus i also know a couple of people who are county deputies and others who are were local town city cops and i can tell you for certain that the training they get well it varies but is not anywhere near as intense or comprehensive as the state guys get at least in my state as a sort of crude metaphor analogy the relative training is akin to say the difference between elementary vs high school vs college the difference in knowledge as you say appears to be vast it really is not that experience over time does not change that in certain regards but that a really hit miss kind of spotty collection of information to expand the crude analogy i sort of started above town city cops are at best the elementary school kids whose math science class teaches them that 2 2 4 and that there are 9 erm excuse me 8 planets and they revolve around the sun we live on a planet called earth and it the 3rd planet etc and sadly some of them do not even get that depending size budget of the local police force well seriously some of them get something that comparatively in our little analogy here more akin to kindergarten or preschool we are talking bare minimum rudimentary stuff here how to tie your shoes button your shirt pick up sticks etc county sheriff deputies well they are more like high school students getting algebra probably a review of newtons laws of physics and then maybe some chemistry biology state troopers by comparison they go through not only all of the above but get the comparative equivalent of calculus and basic to fairly moderately advanced physics ie bachelor degree type stuff but still waaaaay short of say grad school ms much less phd level stuff and if when you actually get to see it in operation it can almost be comical to wit some local townie cop stumbles across shows up at some accident scene and starts playing all important official and etc then a deputy sheriff rolls up and well it like watching a balloon deflate as the townie becomes all deferential even though in all probability the deputy is not that much more qualified knowledgeable than the town cop but then assuming this is some state highway or interstate etc the trooper pulls onto the scene and the entire thing changes all over again oh shit the state guy is here of course it is not always that clean the outward respect deference is also sort of accompanied by an internal resentment especially among the guys who tried and for various reasons failed to qualify for the state trooper academy and that true of a lot of the people who end up as local cops though with the amount of money available to municipalities for training has increased probably considerably in illinois and across the nation but as i noted a lot of that ends up going to pay for what is really just forms formalities ie updating then on how to use the new in vehicle computer system again these are not rocket scientists we are talking about with many most of them you cannot just toss them a manual and say learn it they often need step by step tutorial instructions and probably a couple of hours of hands on practice merely on how to fill out the newly revised version of the computerized traffic or other citation entries not to mention the information lookup systems credit card swipe pay on the spot systems etc etc iow a lot of seemingly trivial technical things but which they nevertheless do need remedial training on does not help that the systems are not necessarily that well designed else they can create major snafu i mean sure they will probably get the hang of the system over time but you cannot just toss it at them and say here figure it out local pd sending officers to swat special weapons exercises yeah unfortunately there probably a bit too much of that too though usually there only a small fraction of the local force that gets that kind of intense special training but it seems more rare to see them going to informational classes or city meetings and the likes to help officers stay on top of their game well you do not necessarily see that because there not really all that much to see at least as far as the informational meetings that stuff is integrated into their regular duty rotation schedule and often done in small groups and or at some other facility as far as city meetings and the like well for the most part that would be a huge waste of time the local town commission debating back and forth about some new fence or sign ordinance is really a rather a lot of pedantic bikeshedding nonsense the majority of what gets bandied about usually ends up being irrelevant to the final piece anyway which has to get reviewed by the city attorneys etc and invariably they wipe out modify probably 90 of what they tried to stick in no sorry councilman but you cannot pass an ordinance entirely outlawing the display of political campaign signs for the republican party candidates in fact you cannot really pass any ordinances regarding campaign candidate signs having and paying local police to be anywhere near that well it would just be a complete waste ,1,MensRights
DWShimoda, it is obvious when someone physically assaults someone else no it is not people see what they want to see and the view it within a context that they have been trained to view it and when they see a woman actually attacking a man with physical violence they do not see it as assault instead they are programmed to view it as funny ie harmless slapstick comedy stuff in point of fact your own comment is really full proof of that the factual reality on the ground is that women physically assault men and children far more often than the reverse period ,2,MensRights
DWShimoda, how do we have a world where anyone would see the need to write something so obvious in a word feminism seriously that how it is a very specifically and intentionally distorted view of the world based on a whole host of flawed assumptions is it any surprise that the result is a massively distorted even perverse society how do we teach girls so that they would think strength or empowerment means hurting men this too is relatively simple you teach them that they are inherently oppressed by men both historically as a group and then specifically as individuals especially via crapola like microagressions then you teach them that to rebalance things the society must swing the pendulum to the opposite extreme that is to say you teach them that it is not sufficient to achieve equality under the law but that some ambiguous and never truly defined equality of outcome is required as well that then leads to the effect whether you intended to create it or not and there is plenty of evidence that many have intended this but intention is irrelevant to result of what is called reparations but is in effect revenge retribution and it is done on a group identity basis which is how you end up with absurdities like claims of some 1 4 african american demanding reparations ostensibly on behalf of some of his ancestors having been slaves from someone who is classified as white even though the former was never a slave and the latter never owned slaves nor in fact did any of his ancestors own any either and likewise little miss sjw snowflake declares that because in some fictional fantasy view of history she believes her grandmother may have been oppressed and possibly abused by her grandfather note that she a descendant of the supposed abuser as well as the supposed victim that she is now therefore entitled to oppress some young male descendent of an entirely unrelated set of ancestors and to abuse him in turn because he as a member of the group identity known as human males and more specifically the subgroup of white cis gendered hetero males has it coming deserves to be punished revenged upon etc because obviously two wrongs is how you make things right why the subgroup simple expediency ie aka alliances of convenience aka divide conquer or ganging up instead of simply males by specifying white they gain the alliances of other non white ethnicities and by specifying cis gendered and hetero they gain the alliance of the currently demonstrably socio politically powerful and particularly in certain areas like media influential gbltq factions also while the above subgroup tactic may not actually given them true numerical superiority it does create the perception of consensus or a majority rule in the sense of multiple groups on one side versus one group on the other then to actually achieve numerical superiority you focus on a subgroup of that subgroup ie you do not really go after all of the white cis gendered hetero males but rather only a certain relatively small age range to wit in one instance you ignore the married guys and go after the young single college age guys in another instance you switch modes and demonize the married guys instead in each case the you also seek the opposite subgroup within the subgroup as your allies vs enemies ie you get the young single college age guys to deplore the behavior of the ostensible domestic violence of the married guys and then when the focus changes you get those married guys who feel betrayed by the smart arse kids to get revenge by deploring the date rape of the young single college age guys who of course return the revenge favor in the next iteration etc ,1,MensRights

DWShimoda, the last bit you touched on i have been repeatedly yelled at for video taping cops arresting people when i worked for bars telling me it illegal to record them must be just part of their shpeel to just cover their ass and get you to stop the thing most people fail to understand is that the vast majority of cops particularly local town city police are largely clueless about the vast majority of the law they are not attorneys not by a long shot the very idea is actually laughable and generally speaking their training and knowledge is very very limited when it comes to the law what the vast majority of them know is an extremely limited amount generally related to the local town city ordinances and then a few other odd specific things like of course the state traffic laws domestic violence laws and things around property crimes breaking entering vandalism possibly state local firearm drug enforcement laws etc basically the things that they hand out tickets citations for and which their department has a policy manual on which they have received rudimentary and fairly superficial training on we are talking a couple of half day summary refresher sessions maybe once or twice a year or so if even and majority of that training probably had to do with process procedure technicalities about properly filling out forms using the new computer system etc also keep in mind that while not exactly morons the general average intelligence of the typical local police officer is well it average or mediocre ie we are talking an aggregate average of iq 100 at best with a few rare exceptions being more than a few points higher and quite a few being slightly below literally any randomized selection of the general population would have a higher iq average than the typical local police officer no offense intended but it generally not the kind of job that attracts geniuses and the more intelligent better educated ones well if they go into police work it generally into county state and or federal work not the local traffic cop or beat cop now all that said that obviously does not stop them from pretentiously and arrogantly bullshitting people about their expertise and authority both of which are invariably a lot lower different than they not only claim in which case often they are aware they are lying bullshitting but even than they sincerely believe ie they are entirely mistaken about a lot of things generally speaking though again this varies the county sheriff and or deputies are substantially more knowledgeable and or better more thoroughly trained and state police ie troopers are typically an order of magnitude higher yet but even they are nevertheless far from a definitive authority on the vast majority of the law as their training education invariably focuses on and emphasizes quite understandably he kinds of things they are likely to come into contact with on a daily or weekly or even monthly basis and of course again a huge part of that training is policy procedure forms processing court systems etc point is that there is no point in asking some police officer about say business contract law much less the nuances of intellectual property laws ie copyright etc including publishing photos videos and so on because they have almost certainly never received any training in any of that at all possibly presuming that they even went to college they might have had some part of a course in college that dealt with it in a superficial summary manner but that was likely years and more ago and it was not in depth and might not have even been current at the time that they took the class and even some of what they have received training on well it was not necessarily entirely correct as it was presented much less as they understood it and even that well even attorney knowledge of the law is going to be limited and probably specialized the local lawyer that handles real estate stuff the occasional basic will testament stuff possibly handles local misdemeanor and even the occasional felony charge well again they did receive some overview summary instruction regarding the overall laws and statutes and regulations of their state back in the day years and possibly decades ago when they were in law school and since then they probably learned a lot more about and kept reasonably up to date concerning things that they encounter in their regular practice but said local attorney is probably not a very good source of information regarding anything else no point in getting advice from that local criminal defense lawyer on how to obtain a patent on your invention or copyright law or etc you will learn far more and far more up to date info from some patents copyrights for dummies book and then if you have specific questions well you need to go to an attorney that specializes in ip law and probably one that has a particular practice focus on the kind of ip you are dealing with iow some patent attorney who usually works with software companies on software copyrights patents is probably not the best guy to help you with your new power wrench invention he just does not know the art involved and you are going to pay out the ass to have him learn on your time billing and while it may seem a bit absurd to reference things like that patents copyrights well the point is that those things are actually a lot more common for some local lawyer to say nothing of local police officer than cases involving wiretapping recording laws i would be willing to bet you that out of 1 000 attorneys in any city or county that on average probably not more than one of that 1 000 has ever in their entire career practice history been directly involved in any case having to deal with wiretapping or surreptitious recording oh to be sure a few more of them may have given some general legal guidance to a client about recording phone conversations especially around divorce child custody other family law cases or possibly advised some local business owner a decade ago about where he can cannot place surveillance cameras and or microphones in his store ie not in bathroom stalls and that video is ok but audio is generally not yet imo that really does not qualify as direct case experience those business owners could have gotten the same info from a book or online reference which is probably what those attorneys did it just gains the business owner a bit more good faith cover and creates an officer of the court reference about the inquiry if he actually consulted an attorney which courts count far higher than i read a book law especially around these kinds of things where it not only contentious socially politically but where technology is changing rapidly is a lot more complicated than people imagine and on many issues again especially those outside of an attorney normal everyday practice area you could ask a dozen lawyers get a good half dozen entirely different opinions especially if given verbally off the cuff off the record and without diligent research and yet none of that half dozen may actually prove correct you may as well ask a dozen bartenders their opinion and ironically one of them might actually know more lol ,3,MensRights

DWShimoda,by the author of 30 something and over it what happens when you wake up and do not want to go to work ever again and 30 something and the clock is ticking what happens when you can no longer ignore the baby issue and now that she hit 40 guilt trip my quest to leave the baggage behind the description for which is now in her forties kasey reflects on how being a woman often feels like a test one she flunks from her body to her mothering skills relationships and career kasey has managed to feel guilty about just about everything and let s not even mention the epidural elective caesarean and baby formula probably because she sucks at all of it and she a fucked up mess inside her head as well as outside of it also can pretty much guarantee you that as a result of that combination say 10 to 15 years from now her kids will be coming out with their own horror stories about mommie dearest she paranoid about others abusing her kids my ass she been abusing them herself since the day they were born in fact probably since before they were born arguably given the whole baby issue book crap even years before they were ever conceived she a control freak obsessive narcissistic basketcase those kids were screwed before they were born p s also apparently her husband is a complete cuck and i mean that literally he is apparently not the bio dad of her kids the 30 something baby issue book talks about her anguish over being infertile undergoing ivf and wait for it buying sperm off the internet now given she has a penchant for exaggerating satire maybe that all just supposed to be humorous bs but somehow given the whole she feels guilty about just about everything it probably all too real mind you infertile at 30 yrs old so guess what feminist mommy here was doing during her 20 ,4,MGTOW

DWShimoda, it did take a bit longer to arrive but boy is it worth it the book is in excellent like new condition and you were absolute right about the pictures and paper being very high quality just from looking at the first 40 pages or so i know i like the look of stone on the outside and a lot of light stained wood on the inside beautiful yeah the quality of the publication is high and like i said the photography is top notch too that not always true but the part that i really like is the breadth and i would say almost comprehensive array of architectural and structural styles even materials which are generally purposeful and not merely an artificial facade slapped on a generic box that the selection of houses includes you really get the feel that each of these houses would offer a different sort of life that the building itself would add it own unique and honest real flavor to your experience of living in them iow entirely the opposite of the bog standard subdivision 3br 2ba ranch home with attached garage postage stamp backyard or their bloated overpriced ticky tacky mcmansion descendents mpai most people are idiots exactly my friend has not asked her out yet i asked why and he said something like there are one or two problems right now that he was going to let play out while i am not quite sure my best guess is she has a boyfriend or something i have met this girl once or twice briefly a few months back and she is attractive without makeup cute and thin so no problem attracting a guy at any time whatever as i said before i wish him the best rotflmao that too does not surprise me want another prediction more of a guess really the one or two problems yeah she kinda sorta has a boyfriend if that is you count the guy she living with and has been in an ltr with and cohabiting with for 3 years as her boyfriend in reality she basically married just without the license but of course they have been fighting recently and so she might break up with him etc she actually just been toying with your friend playing flirty mind games and really has no interest at all in actually fucking him though she might try to make use of him to make her hubby jealous but no there is no way for you to warn him about that he wo not listen anyway he would simply tell you that you do not know her etc as if he does lol in fact you will probably never really learn what happens though if he shows up someday with a broken nose or a couple of bruises well i have got a couple things to say and ask about optimism pessimism regarding people and about living for oneself but i probably wo not be around much until the weekend until then cheers no prob btw keep your optimism in as many ways as you can you need it while you are young just allow yourself to gradually temper it with a bit of cynicism ie experience awareness of reality particularly when you make the big choices in life you can wait for the pessimism to set in after you at least pass age 50 or so cheers in the meantime enjoy the book the text is good too ,1,MGTOW

DWShimoda,actual archive is link https archive is dqdva article itself is ridiculous bullshit but the overall homeownership rate has fallen from a peak of 69 percent in 2004 to approximately 63 7 percent in 2015 a 5 3 percent decline that peak was the result of the early to mid stage housing bubble it was never a sustainable percentage which is why it was in fact a peak one that quickly reverted and given that a significant fraction of those so called home own ers purchased their homes with zero equity and then later on negative equity not to mention the many others who literally cashed equity out of homes via refinance deals well using the term homeowner is dubious at best and it probably more appropriate to call it misleading and even purposefully disingenuous aka an intentional fraud a lie in point of fact the so called home ownership rate broadly defined as privately titled homes with or without mortgages ie anywhere from 0 to 100 equity is still near the long term historical highs https dqydj com wp content uploads 2014 11 historical homeownership 1890 present usa png ie the artificially high rates of new deal style titled indenture stemming from the government backing of 30 yr mortgages for more info behind that graph click here https dqydj com historical homeownership rate in the united states 1890 present moreover while it bemoans the delayed household formation of younger generations it also ignores the fact that the older now retiring generation aka baby boomers holds title to an unprecedented shitload of real estate not only primary residences but secondary sun belt ones skiing chalets hunting cabins lakeside seaside cottages condos etc etc as that generation grows older and or begins dying off en mass there is going to come a rather dramatic change in the ownership of all of those properties and quite probably a significant crash is prices as well because old people in need of cash to pay for nursing homes etc as well as estate settlements are going to not only create a supply flood of homes for sale but the sales will be distressed motivated putting significant additional downward pressure on prices at that point in time probably within the next decade it going to be a literal bargain hunters bonanza and a buyer market for a good couple of years for those in the younger generation who have sufficient savings and or credit along with a desire to purchase basically if you are young you should be looking to save up against that and keeping your proverbial financial powder dry and at the ready if you use a tighter definition of home ownership ie 100 equity non mortgaged residences then that rate is essentially stable as about 1 4 25 of private residence households the figure appears to fluctuate up down and is often cited as about 1 3 of homeowners http archive is kln7u not so much because the rate of people who have unmortgaged homes changes but rather because of the opposite the total number of mortgage laden nominal titular homeowners quote unquote goes up and down and the x of homeowners then seems to change relative to that total ,2,MGTOW

DWShimoda, herpes is a disgusting disease and so prevalent in modern degenerate society there are blogs out there advocating do not ask do not tell policy about stds especially herpes yuck and i did not even hit on the causal connections of cmv and the other herpes and various other especially viral virus sti with things like cancers cancers of all kinds during the past 30 to 40 years an increasingly massive amount has been learned about that and from what has been learned well nearly all of the common and many of the heretofore uncommon cancers that have known direct causes as opposed to risk factors are in fact caused by infections usually viral and generally only transmitted via sexual intimate contact bodily fluid exchange oral sex juicy kissing etc researchers know this evidence is piling up to the point that it virtually irrefutable as direct cause the medical profession are gradually learning it at least the younger doctors and or those who actually do try to stay abreast of developments but of course they are simultaneously being fed pc sjw crap but for the most part the general public is still entirely clueless and arguably being treated like mushrooms ie kept in the dark and fed bullshit via the media combination of silence and obfuscating noise while continuing to promote the 60 ideology of sexual liberation and the sjw politically correct agenda and instead the general public by and large truly believes as they were taught indoctrinated that sti are not a real problem aka no big deal just wear a condom get tested once a year and the doctor will cure whatever ails you with some prescription virtually zero major summary reports on the causal links between sti and cancer certainly nothing that is at all comparative to the decades long tirade against tobacco which it ends up is probably more of a contributory factor and less of an actual cause by obfuscating noise i mean the regular almost incessant rotation of what i think of as idiot cience articles ie does coffee cure cancer new study says it might and then a few days later research links coffee to cancerous tumor growths in snails or oysters or and then a week after that well you get the idea but the sum total effect is to make the public effectively ignore and or roll their eyes at some other story like oral sex hpv causes of growing throat cancer epidemic in young adults etc which then gets dismisses as old people just do not want young people to have fun sex and so on imagine something far worse than some 40 year old transgender freak using the little girls room imagine that even worse than him zher it molesting some little girl and causing psychological trauma imagine said trans pzherson and or any other pedo type infecting probably unwittingly in that they are not aware they are carriers one or several young girls boys with half a dozen long fuse sti diseases like cmv various other herpes strains other sti etc and then 10 years later one of those kids grows up to becomes infertile and or another has an inexplicable cancer some brain tumor that just inexplicably appeared http www med wisc edu news events new evidence links virus to brain cancer 32922 and for no reason i mean that does not make any sense how could they possibly have a brain tumor they never smoked do not drink they even recycle http www imdb com title tt1306980 quotes item qt1565775 heck they are probably even vegan well mostly kind of they try to be anyway and refuse to eat eggs or drink milk except soy milk etc ,1,MGTOW

DWShimoda, the worst part is playboys are considered a positive role model in today society while a marcus aurelius reborn will be shat on and booed and ignored terrible times we live in indeed i have heard many people posit the introduction of birth control pills as the primary cause and others that roe v wade the legalization of abortion others yet the no fault divorce laws the advent of chilimony but i think all of those are barking up the wrong tree and never mind that bcp contradicts abortion both of which more or less contradict divorce chilimony instead i think the main cause is actually antibiotics and the reduction mitigation of the negative consequences of sti particularly syphilis and gonorrhea the thing is when you eliminate one pestilence like that you often create the conditions for the flowering of yet others and i am not simply referring to the development of resistant strains of the aforementioned but rather the rise of a host of others that are not targeted and were probably more difficult to spread in the past like chlamydia as well as the non bacterial virus things like hiv the array of hpv the several types of herpes etc these not only become more widespread due to promiscuity but they are allowed to increase in virulence harmfulness as well and people are presently largely almost entirely ignorant of the effects just ran across a random thing sorry link lost this evening about how amazing it was that an infant was able hear it mother speak for the first time because of some new advancement in hearing aids we are supposed to laud and weep sentimentally at how touching the infants response was my reaction was the opposite disgust why because the reason the kid suffers from deafness among a host of other problems including lesions inside the brain is because he was born with congenital cytomegalovirus gee such a random tragedy right well that depends on how you look at it you see cmv or hcmv or hhv5 is a herpes virus hhv5 aka human herpes virus 5 ayah you got it now cdc will tell you that cmv is a common virus that infects people of all ages over half of adults by age 40 have been infected with cmv https www cdc gov cmv index html what they do not tell you is how they got infected cmv is not transmitted by casual contact but only via direct contact with certain specific bodily fluids of an infected contagious stage individual chiefly saliva the urogenital fluids vaginal discharges semen urine etc so adults contract it via intimate contact and again only with another infected contagious stage individual children typically infants get infected either from mommy or else from direct contact with or quick indirect temporary superficial carrier of fluids from other recently infected kids iow daycare settings so what is the cause of the spread of this promiscuity the modern feminist family structure which includes dropping your infant off to have contact with dozens hundreds of other random infants being taken care of by a handful of busy poor hygiene caretakers but the cdc wo not tell people that it would be politically incorrect besides the cdc tells you that most people so long as their immune systems have not been weakened do not suffer any symptoms or short term harm from the infection riiiight well except for poor kid who then suffers from brain lesions and deafness because guess what mommy had but pshaw that not a real problem right http bmcpublichealth biomedcentral com articles 10 1186 1471 2458 5 70 i mean it not like say down syndrome or anything http i imgur com h5k4rmj jpg oops see nature does not reward ridiculous levels of promiscuity it takes advantage of that as a disease vector and so it like planting a whole shitload of time bombs ticking away inside of people because guess what rears it head when other modern miracle medicine happens you know things like organ replacement with immune suppression meds or chemo to kill cancer which likewise weakens the immune system gee that cmv lurking in the background suddenly is not lurking anymore ooops thus eventually nature itself will correct discipline humanity out of it little temporary free for all orgy of promiscuous sex it may take another couple of generations and the lesson may be very painful but eventually thing is here this is a rather naked assumption first of all because the majority of adult cmv infectees are asymptomatic ie no symptoms and thus never get tested or become aware that they are were infected second there never been any widespread random testing to determine the real incidence rate much less the trend of infections over long historical time decades generations ergo the statement a dubiously calculated guesstimate that over half of adults by age 40 have been infected with cmv is more than a bit disingenuous as is the claim that it is common and therefore ostensibly mostly harmless truth is we really have no idea how widespread it is now and we have even less info on how widespread it was say back in the pre promiscuity era much less the pre antibiotic era about the only indicator we do have is that the incidence rate of babies born with it aka congenetal cmv has gone up rather dramatically in the past two decades that would seem to indicate it was not all that common decades ago edit well along with modern transportation cars and interstate highways and more recently cheap pervasive mass air travel and of course the internet smartphones apps to connect hookup with people the natural limitations on number of people one could be in contact with the sort of inhibiting wall of the fact that everyone natural radius of travel on foot horseback etc created has been breached and really almost entirely disassembled virtually everyone potential radius has expanded and become so overlapping that the limits inhibitions walls are essentially no longer there thus social inhibitions should actually be even more important but the imo temporary illusory mitigation reduction of negative consequences by things like antibiotics have overwhelmed that ergo despite the fact that modern transport facilitates promiscuity on a much more vast scale i think antibiotics are still the more critical factor because that really what has led to the dropping of the social inhibitions i also think it going to backfire and in a major way but as i noted above and in replies below i also think it going to take multiple generations before that is realized ,4,MGTOW

DWShimoda, well guess what ahem i believe i already did my buddy friend 1 in this hypothetical scenario swings by work today during lunch break which is not all that uncommon because he works less than a mile away he dressed up all spiffy is wearing cologne fresh haircut smv a couple points higher he found out through the grapevine that a girl he had a crush on for the past year kinda sorta likes him he said he out has not even asked her out on a date yet and is willing to discard a potential bro partnership now i know where he stands and honestly i wish key word here him all the happiness and love a normal relationship has to offer ayah an elegant q e d a bit faster than i expected predicted but than again i cannot say it really surprises me but see say this had occurred a year or two from now maybe even x months after you had bought the property if you would bought it with him as a co owner with n count other guys you would have a fucking mess on your hands if he wants out who buys his share at what price the price you paid x months previously what if property values have changed maybe they went up maybe they crashed not to mention he got x months of housing and x months of property taxes have accumulated if not yet billed due plus you would just started some remodeling how much if any of that does he owe or did he buy supplies and you owe him and then what if he does not like the price offered or what if y all cannot come up with the cash can he force the sale of the whole property fuck that shit conversely if you had bought as sole owner and he was simply a renter of a room well you would be a bit inconvenienced but you would be able to refer back to the rental agreement he would either finish out the 12 months or else break the lease settle up as you had previously agreed in a binding written contract much much simpler also first scenario co owners would almost certainly have destroyed the friendship the second would let you part amicably as you noted honestly sincerely wishing each other the best as you go your separate ways do you ever get tired of being right all the time master dwshimoda lol sigh well it kinda sorta goes with the whole territory job lifetime of being a master if you know what i mean and yes the account name was obviously intentional not that i expect many will get the reference btw did you get your copy of the new cottage home book yet i know you said you ordered it i would anticipate that you received it by now ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, did you see tfm last video he states that we cannot control our dominant instinct only redirect it though i personally dont agree with that quite a range of thoughts 1 first i really do not watch listen to many of the so called mgtow video guys so no i did not see it and moreover see no need to because this is an age old puerile claim 2 i do not really give a shit about someone else subjective experience then opinions conclusions about things that contradict what i am certain that i already know differently based on solid personal life experience and btw i believe that is decades of life longer than tfm supplemented supported by the testimony of men across the ages seems to me that while he might be saying we cannot control what he is really saying is that he believes that he cannot control the use of the we is either an assumption projection or an attempt at generalization to the abstract gross 3 i would say that redirecting something by definition implies admits and requires and therefore is a rather significant degree of control over it if tfm has only been able to control via redirecting then i posit that he is like a little boy who while he has perhaps learned how to hold his penis to redirect his flow of piss has not yet learned how to control his bladder in other ways 4 it sounds to me like tfm is probably making the alas all to common mistake confusing control with repress or eliminate or end and worse believing that control means totally repress and entirely end but per example the fact that my bodily systems require that i urinate every day does not mean that i cannot be in control over my urination nor is my control over it limited to redirecting it and yet my ability to control it also does not mean nor require that i permanently plug up my urethra and cease urinating forever 5 to call it our or the dominant instinct is imo a double or triple misnomer first i would dispute that humans even have instincts or that the term is truly applicable to humans same thing really in anything like the manner that we apply it to animals second to call it the dominant one is beg the question by both prematurely admit defeat submitting to it as well as to artificially inflate it importance and role in life finally it ignore denies that there are a host of other bodily drives and system that are typically commonly of significantly higher priority including the aforementioned urination but also defecation their counterparts of hunger thirst as well as the desire to stay warm dry or cool dry etc i suppose you could say that i too personally disagree but i do not think it just or only personal since i do not believe tfm is any authority on the matter obviously this is not really dispositive in and of itself nor in either any direction everyone subjective claims about themselves and their own experience are both unique and also somewhat dubious ie they may be lying to us they may be lying to themselves they may be doing so unwittingly or purposefully and along that same line the testimony of 1 or 1 000 or 1 million is similarly problematic numbers of people who agree or disagree be they high or low do not really settle the matter when each person experience is somewhat unique i regard to this subject there is a plethora of evidence that many men across the ages have been able to successfully control their sexual drive there is also evidence of many who tried failed as well as many who did not try or who perhaps even chose to not control but to give in to it and finally a few who claimed to be unable to control but who may simply be lying to us and or even to themselves as with many terms of science cf feynman on magnets magnetism https www youtube com watch v 3d2radvkyly the word instinct is a facile and arguably even fatuous but definitely superficial pretense it a way of saying we do not know but without admitting that why or how do birds know what drives them to migrate with the seasons answer instinct tada except that really a non answer it just a label for that kind of non answer that says we really do not know why or how we just know they do it and they do not seem to have to learn it and when it comes to human sexual drive to say it is an instinct is to use that label in a false way because unlike birds humans ask learn why how and we do know a bit more about the why how of our sexual drive we know at least a bit about the hormonal mechanisms we know the why or at least most of us do we comprehend the purposeful link between sex and pregnancy reproduction we understand that there is a pleasure reward system inside of us that interacts with that etc and moreover unlike most other mammals that we have observed we humans or at least most of us do not just immediately uncontrollably instinctively seek to mount or submit to being mounted with every member of the opposite sex of our species that we happen to encounter we choose ergo we exercise control therefore the term instinct is really not applicable to wit if you are horny but also hungry thirsty feel you need to both shit and piss but are standing in the rain or under a hot sun and thus shivering or sweating and there is some naked woman spreading her legs in front of you saying please fuck me now well which urge or need or drive are you going to be deal with first are you going to shit piss or fuck and if the former once relieved in those regards will you next thought be to get out of the rain sun to eat drink or to fuck which urge drive is dominant that actually a trick question but one which proves the point the answer will vary depending on circumstance and degree how hot or cold are you are we talking 100 degrees f outside in a dry dusty sandstorm or 20 below zero f and you naked in some blizzard or are you warm cozy in front of a fire sitting on a porch feeling a cool evening breeze just how hungry and or thirsty are you how pressing is the need to defecate urinate and only finally last and perhaps least of the list just how horny are you ,5,MGTOW

DWShimoda, the problem is that society tells us men and even some women that sex is really really important actually there are two problems our biology is pushing us to procreate not really for our sake mind you and to procreate we need to have sex with a member of the opposite sex granted sometimes that bit of wiring programming apparently gets screwed up or fucked with but in the main for 90 of people it true and for the remainder well the object of their biological urge drive may be different but the urge drive is still there the thing is that drive is not really sated by having sex especially not condom wrapped or sex with a woman on the pill or well it just is not sated by the sex act itself there are some indications that it can be sated to a degree and at least temporarily by being in a household with a woman and the infant toddler children that certainly true of human females and seems to also be true of human males but again it not permanent then as you noted the problem is that society tells us men and even some women that sex is really really important if you are a man and you are not getting laid then you are technically not even alive your bp chad male friends will look down upon you women will think you are not worthy of the tink hole therefore you are defunct all because of societal programming to make men work harder and feel bad about themselves i have always even back when i was a teen laughed my ass off at that notion that you are not a man until you have spasmed within a vagina and ironically at least at that age apparently once is sufficient for this magical transformation regardless of whether you successfully impregnated the bitch or not in fact even pulling out and cumming on her back is considered sufficient lol to me that rotflmao level inane because quite literally any old dog has and can do that does not make a dog into a man and as you note once you have been there done that a few times well yawn or cat or mouse rabbit squirrel skunk opossum etc really the irony of the whole thing is that what separates men from dogs cats etc is that real men should have the ability to control and master their urges it is the lower animals that are the ones who are enslaved to it by instinct and generally do not have the ability to even understand what they are doing much less why ,6,MGTOW
DWShimoda,indeed key word there is control the big brain one between your ears in charge of and able to overrule veto reign in the little brain one between your legs far too many men unwittingly give jr control over their lives and that little fucker invariably screws it all up why would not he after all fucking screwing is all jr knows other than taking the occasional piss it his entire goal in life and reason for existing note that it his goal reason to exist it does not have to be your goal reason to exist also regarding sex more specifically the orgasm and more specifically yet the satisfying extremely pleasurable part of the orgasm is not the physical muscle spasm the true la petite mort aka the little death https en wikipedia org wiki la petite mort as the french call the really good orgasm well it an endorphin flood that takes place within the brain the physical crap ie actual sex is just the sensory input part of the equation and in reality it is not that big of a part of it the majority of the the whole equation the anticipation excitement buildup etc that cause that ie the whole is she hawt parts are entirely mental psychological you could literally be fucking the ugliest land whale on the planet but so long as somehow your brain thought you were screwing some hot chick the resulting orgasm would be amazing that why wet dreams happen that why porn works that why people have funky fetishes ie some chick in a catholic school girl uniform gets some guy way more excited than the exact same chick in ugly yoga pants and it why sometimes porn can actually more pleasurable because it actually all about the little fantasy story that playing out in your mind that what triggers or does not trigger the endorphin flood the la petite mort that puts you to sleep like a dead man btw the same is true for women doubtless size does matter and technique foreplay do too but in the end whether or not she fully orgasms is going to really mostly if not entirely be about the little fantasy movie she got playing in her head ,25,MGTOW

DWShimoda, the thing i never see people mention is the cost of batteries are not they only good for 5 6 years and they usually need to be replaced would not the upkeep of batteries every 5 years make the system cost way more over it life battery lifetime is actually mostly a matter of charge discharge cycles and is significantly dependent upon both the chemistry ie type of battery as well as the depth and rate of discharge recharge and the conditions environment that happens in temperature etc iow actual real world lifetimes can vary all over the map you get much longer life from a system that is oversized and which wo not be as deeply discharged ie you barely tap the cells and they get topped off again via some trickle charge but of course oversized also means that you have got bought a system with a much much bigger battery than you probably need general opinion from all of the battery experts that i know is that tesla claims for it lithium based batteries are all based on an almost perfect best use case scenario given that it rather doubtful they are going to go the distance in more typical prime time scenarios also the claims of warranties well warranties are sales tools not actual guarantees of anything you have to look at the fine print in nearly all cases what they inevitably come down to is that the product lifetime is pro rated and not necessarily on a linear scale across physical time it quite common for claims to be at best entitled to get some discount credit off of a replacement point is that if your unit dies at year 8 on a 10 year warranty you might only get some 5 or 10 credit against the purchase of a new unit that is of course assuming that you get any credit at all and they do not deem the products premature failure to be due to abnormal use what is abnormal use basically whatever the company wants to classify as such and sort of the big problem also feature with lithium cells is that they do not slowly degrade the way other rechargable chemistries do instead they do what is known as a cliff dive at the end of their lifespan that is they will be working just fine just fine just fine just fine almost just fine and then one day hmm seems to be a problem then a day or three later wha happan this thing is dead as a doornail wo not take a charge at all ,2,technology
DWShimoda, vid title promise of snack silences little girl tears oh boy this kind of behavior gets subtler insidious over time if the toddler does not get proper parenting exactly i watched the video but really i did not need to because the title told me virtually all i needed to know about the only thing the video added was a more specific indication of the child age little girl being a bit ambiguous now a single instance of that would be potentially problematic enough given that we are talking root level toddler aged autonomous programming of human interactions here ie deep psyche conditioned responses expectations but add in that the parent feels it worked yay kid stopped crying you can be sure that this is going to be repeated and probably become s o p to the point that mommy will always have treats at hand probably even start carrying some in her purse and worse they wo not be used to train the child out of crying ie now honey i need you to be quiet while mommy is cooking dinner so if you do not cry then you get a treat but if you do cry you get nothing instead the bad behavior pattern is being reinforced the lesson being learned taught here is cry esp w visible tears and you get treats rewards guess what that little girl is going to grow up to be like in her teen and adult years and really bar some major traumatic experience she never going to unlearn that conditioning instead far more likely is that it will be reinforced and supplemented with additional layers she will later learn that crying is not necessarily the best way to emotionally manipulate others into giving her rewards she will learn an entire array of them especially with this mother parenting style but she will keep reserve it as her nuclear option ie that when all else fails she can still win by producing tears the irony of course is that sjw love to chatter on about social constructs and yet their own behavioral patterns are a prime example of a social construct they have been programed conditioned into acting the way that they do the entitlement and play the victim mentality is one that would never develop in the natural world it can only exist in an entirely unnatural aka perverse affluent artificial environment ,2,MGTOW

DWShimoda, yeah with the way things are developing i would not be surprised if it the whole thing goes back to being just a business deal again in time i would say another generation or two personally i think probably one of the chief drivers will be a combination of the end of the antibiotic era the window of the ability to treat most sti along with the growing realization that while the immediate acute deleterious effects sti can be treated there are still major long term negative consequences that are untouched ie cancer infertility of and that the latter infertility while it can be ameliorated by things like ivf there are nasty negative consequences of that as well ie down autism and a host of other genetic defects due in no small part to the age of the mother the problem is this will probably go on forever even if we are now waking up to the truth the coming generations after us will probably romantisize the whole thing again which sets the stage for yet another awakening like the one we are experiencing now rince and repeat forever people tend to raise their kids the way their own parents did not possibly it a meta cycle thing the pendulum swings tend to take multiple generations to occur and alas multiple more afterwards to resolve but cf the above antibiotics etc there a sort of unique confluence of things that have happened to facilitate the present extreme perversity i also think we are probably headed for a major malthusian crash of worldwide population most of the third world is already running on fumes so to speak or teetering on a knife edge or whatever other mixed metaphor you want by which i mean heavily dependent upon food imported from first world nations and really any large scale disruption of that ie any cause be it the next financial crash or some other major global political event wars etc or natural disaster big volcano ala mt tambora 1816 year without a summer or major disruptive earthquake tsunami or even another carrington event ala 1859 and or then epidemic disease and again cf antibiotic resistance is likely to cause massive malnutrition starvation other opportunistic disease etc basically whatever the trigger we are talking about pandemic that will make the 14th century black death seem trivial by comparison the kind of society civilization that emerges on the other side of that well it impossible to say exactly what it will be but i think there no question that it will involve a return to a hetero patriarchal family system based on or virtually identical to the tao of virtually all historical civilizations complete with what i would call biologically normative gender roles the present nonsense is not only non sustainable it literally dysgenic and self destructive that is despite all of the technology and the so called education system the vast mass of people are actually reverting regressing to a pre civilization illiterate innumerate nonproductive and reproductively animalistic state and it not just behavioral choice we are talking inevitably leading to major average iq drop of 1 or 2 standard deviations in and of itself that will eventually become an underlying cause of one of the aforementioned triggers and a subsequent collapse and ensuing pandemic mass death ,1,MGTOW

DWShimoda, sounds like she was never taught about the birds and bees properly ahem you also missed one other rather critical point in there she would probably have an iq of 70 the idea that such a level of ignorance stupidity can be remedied by more and more and more explicit repeated redundant formal instruction well it delusional i guarantee you that this particular woman would also have difficulty with other things like making change by which i mean doing relative basic math of the kind an average mediocre intelligence elementary school child should have mastered and that despite multiple years of formal and even remedial instruction and it a functional level of stupidity quite literally you could take something that was normally priced at say 20 cents each and hand her a coupon to be able to buy two for a dollar and moreover she would use that coupon and would probably be quite proud of it worse yelling at her afterwards well it serves no purpose because she did not make a mistake and btw you can forget about trying to teach her anything more abstract than that more instruction wo not work i mean that in the technical sense not just the insult colloquial sense this would be a retarded or mentally challenged individual ie cognitively impaired period iow this would not be just ignorance obviously she is lacking in the specific knowledge understanding but it is not simply or only the fact that the information has not been properly presented to her she really would not have the mental capacity to comprehend and she really will not fully comprehend no matter how much instruction you give her or how many times and ways you try to explain it you may eventually delude yourself by successfully getting her to parrot back the right answers but it really not going to click inside of her brain there will be no epiphany moment where she says oh i get it now oh wow but that means and yes that is truly scary to think about especially when you realize that despite this being a joke women like this really do exist and they are not that rare moreover they will be treated as full adults voting driving shopping etc they generally will become mothers in charge of not only tending to children probably multiple children but she will likely end up in charge of and responsible for a whole household with no oversight i would link to the somebody gots to pay for all dese childurnz video but i am certain everyone here has seen it already we are not talking about precocious genius kids either because kids who are even just slightly above average intelligence can figure out how to make change by age 4 or 5 that is well before they even have any formal schooling or instruction in formal math something i have found with women often times for them the line between social constructs and reality is blurred they do not understand the difference indeed the world that many of these people live in that is the world as they see and understand it well it filled with things that are mysterious and magical just about everything is a black box which they have no clue how it performs the things that it does as to the incredulity of it the question but then how in the heck do they get by in our modern machine world well you ever see those videos of pigeon or rat etc that has ahem figured out how to use some machine mechanism to obtain food well those animals have not really figured out how the machine operates they do not gain an understanding of nor even generally have any curiosity about the under the hood mechanism they simply learn operant conditioning style that pressing red button means food well that how they operate the world around them machines and other people it not an overtly conscious mental intellectual technique it more of a ritual superstition operation do x in situation y and z happens ie dress slutty flirt eyes at bad boy in bar and he comes over buys you drinks etc and yes they get trained into it daddy and mommy and other family really do train them unwittingly engage in operant conditioning with the result that princess learns she gets rewarded with special treatment when she does x especially in situation y she gets z regardless of what she did before ie should could have been setting the cat on fire if she looks cute puts on puppy dog eyes maybe pouty lips cries a bit she will get hugs a cookie and daddy will tell her she still his special little princess and that he loves her etc there was actually a really well done albeit tongue in cheek dramatization of this on the big bang show https www youtube com watch v mt4n9gsbomi and while played for laughs well it not far from the truth the key mistake that most men make and which ironically the sheldon character does not make is that they believe correcting altering behavior involves thinking reasoning and so try to come up with long term consequences positive negative but at the operant conditioning level it does not work that way the training is done via instant response that is to say what is the immediate regular ideally consistent result of behavior x what z result happens right after it in scenario y so daughter does something mean bad hits little brother whatever daddy sees yells or otherwise demonstrates disapproval of both kids daughter tries the look cute cry routine daddy sweeps her up hugs her tells her she princess etc tada reward and then wastes oxygen explaining that she should not hit little brother or else in he future there might be some bad punishment time out grounded whatever thinking he has done a good job of instructing his daughter in a logical rational manner but what he actually done is train her into a emotional manipulation ritual his threat of potential future punishment is worthless and entirely wasted on the female mind his rewarding of the social emotional manipulation ritual is far more powerful in part because it immediate and real daughter will grow up and be taught that daddy subsequent mansplaining was his manner of patriarchal oppression male privilege attempting to assert control over female behavior in an authoritarian manner etc and not surprisingly her manipulation of him will never even be touched on much less explored or analyzed to even broach that would be misogynistic ,4,MGTOW

DWShimoda, you breakdown just highlights one more problem with the tone policing language redefining everybody but me is evil bullshit shoved down our throats there was a time when gdp was value sold produced goods contrasted with value sold of imported goods but now it all feel good metrics altered to make some jackass politico like odumbo look swell when he bragged about his historic low unemployment by ignoring or refusing to count everyone who was actually unemployed well except it was not called gdp see there were two actually three reasons why fdr needed and seized on established that gdp ie monetary movement metric and needed it as a replacement for the prior reporting of things like tons of wheat or coal and raw numbers of cars etc first because part of fdr new deal was copying and extending hoover fubar program instituting controls on the production of agricultural goods what is now known as the farm bill and or farm policy that literally involved paying farmers to slaughter and then dispose even just bury pigs cattle milk cows etc that reduced actual output likewise so did the controls on grain production farmers were paid to not plant and if you do not plant then you do not harvest if you do not harvest then the total production goes down so how do you get people to swallow the idea that you are producing more when you are actually producing less simple you count the dollars not the actual physical goods better yet since you devalued the money the figures are going to naturally rise plus pump more money into the economy printed borrowed whatever and voila instant gdp increase keep doing it and it keeps increasing now of course eventually people caught onto that so you needed to do the inflation adjustment but that too is a nice little place you can engage in shenanigans and of course that exactly what subsequent governments have done i fucking hate fdr and wilson those two commies did irreparable harm to the nation and the economic structure which still plagues america today oh absolutely ever read garret garet the revolution was http www freerepublic com focus f news 929392 posts he really just about the only author that truly gets what fdr actually did building of course on the fubar would foundation of ww which was end the american republic and transform it into well really into a fascist country which is to say a quasi socialist crony corporatist financialist operation the parallels to mussolini hitler other facist states well they are both deeply and superficially obvious when you truly understand what to look for ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda,lol depends on how you measure gdp believe it or not the way gdp is currently measured actually tallied or totaled up would be a more accurate term because despite the terminology it really does not have anything at all to do with product or production it is an aggregation of currency units spent within a region state country etc that is all transactions all purchases and or wages made by private individuals corporations and any all units of government iow it money moving around aka economic activity or busyness as opposed to actual business basically it a complete bullshit metric that was contrived during for fdr new deal aka the deficit spending welfare warfare state which then includes things like pushing papers around and other similarly inane things as positive economic activity as long as someone is being paid a wage for it hence the ridiculous inanities of paying someone to dig a hole for no reason or purpose and then paying someone else to fill it back in is seen as boosting the economy actual production physical goods useful services well that something for redneck cis gendered white males ie farmers miners factory workers and other low life blue collar types in flyover land and robots ie low wage workers in third world countries edit ok read aaron essay and have to say this below is not entirely fair or accurate students professional students professors academians ngo employees coffee slingers activists slacktivists politicians teachers peace corp workers americorp workers public sector administrators diversity counselors diversity consultants bloggers vloggers media personalities etc etc if you think about it all they do is complain they never actually do anything they never actually work their entire business model their entire profession their entire life existence is to bitch and whine thereby rationalizing the theft of others white males being the current target that is not true i mean it true of the delineated list he gave but when it comes to wider liberals well at least some of them do work and they do produce and depending of how you define it they even work at producing products services some of which are even albeit a bit more debatably useful products services that is they create things that others do voluntarily pay for in the marketplace the majority of what they produce though is in the fields of arts and entertainments which covers the gamut of everything from movies tv shows music plays books fiction as well as non fiction broad market as well as academic news opinion programs and other things that are either openly entertainments or at least ostensibly educational the key point of those is that they are essentially parasitic rentier based economic activity and moreover they are heavily dependent upon the state perhaps more properly they are based on having special status privileges granted by the state to wit copyright allowing them to extract licensing royalty feed lasting not only their own entire lifetime but effectively an entire lifetime beyond their death currently life of author 70 years or 95 years for corporate works it is critical to understand that because it has and explains two even three very important impacts points 1 why the arts entertainment media businesses are dominated by liberals or if you think about it the other way around why people in those businesses are invariably turned into statists and have a favorable view of the expansion of the state at least in size scope other than censoring their own works according to some ethical moral standard those who livelihoods and wealth are dependent upon the granting maintenance and if possible expansion of a special status from the government will tend need to pander to those in government meaning lending public support to the state political statists etc 2 the gross sales of arts entertainment are dependent upon people having free idle time yes well who has more free idle time and thus wants needs to consume entertainments especially mass media than those who are not working ie people in school unemployed pensioners and other dole recipients but of course they need to not only have idle time they also need to have money ergo is it any surprise that people in the arts entertainment biz are almost categorically wholesale fervent supporters of anything and everything that expands welfare state unless those poor people have money plopped into their hands they cannot buy movie tickets recorded songs etc so obviously if your own income is going to be increased for same amount of work by increasing the number of people who buy tickets etc then you want need more money to be gifted to the masses and conversely you are probably also going to be in favor of things that at least ostensibly will hold down the prices of certain other goods those masses might buy food clothing etc iow you are going to be all for squeezing the actual producers of normal goods trade agricultural industrial policies that force lower commodity prices and conversely even contradictingly also taxing the producers after all gotta get that money to give to the poor from somewhere right as for the entertainment biz paying taxes well see hollywood accounting for that also various government movie subsidies etc ostensibly to create jobs in various locales the same locales that are bereft of jobs because of other government measures the ones that create idle poor consumers 3 it also fully explains the arts entertainment biz support for globalization and particularly for so called global free trade agreements which are not about free trade at all but rather are about extending things like quelle surprise copyright laws onto other countries imagine the royalties you will get from your movie film roles scripts if you can not only tap into the 350 million us market and the 500 million of the eu but also add on the 1 billion of india the other 1 billion in china and as much of the remaining x billion people in the world currently of course there are various limited agreements and they are really not well enforced note also that by way of contrast some engineer inventor who comes up with some major new innovation in terms of productive industrial machinery can at best hope to obtain a patent whose duration is a measly 17 years and that from date you applied for the patent good luck even being able to perfect the idea and bring it to market in that time much less cash in on any profits likewise with the possible exception of computer programmers and then only the ones that found their own firms the vast majority of artists writers and other people who work in around actual production machinery never get any royalty at all everything there is work for hire ie you get paid for your time that it bye bye sucker i could address add on other things like how special status also applies to things like tax law for advertising primary beneficiary news media companies ie where liberals work where workers become liberals whereas other company purchases capital expenditures to buy production machinery buildings etc have to be amortized over years even decades any and all expenditures on advertising are allowed to be immediately and 100 expensed subtracted from gross revenues that too is a critical thing without it and of course a number of other little tax loopholes they have exploited firms like google facebook would never have become the wealthy behemoths that they are oh and in the case of google they were gifted other little exceptions like the fact that their entire base business rests on a blatant violation of copyright laws w00t so gee i wonder if that might be one reason why they have become liberal supporters of liberal politicians ,5,MGTOW
DWShimoda,ime most common meltdown tears crying jag usually in boss office or hr conference room generally goes unseen by the rest of the employees because due to past experience they know to time it for the end of the day and most commonly end of the workweek men on the other hand at least unless there is some chance of litigation typically get fired mid day are expected to be stoic about it and are taken back to their desk to gather their things and then escorted off the premises in full view of everyone in a sort of walk of shame or at least that the way it used to go about a decade more ago cannot really say what happens more recently because i have been working from home semi retired for 10 years now ,5,MGTOW
DWShimoda,here how this plays out seen it happen multiple times so many that it basically a cliche trope 1 he will cave and will buy the multi million dollar house made exactly how she want it 2 shortly thereafter probably 3 to 5 to 7 years later ie more or less a decade from now give or take a few years she will divorce rape his vp 7 m per year ass and he will be paying her probably a cool 1m to 2m per year in one form or another if not alimony then chilimony because she will probably pop out a kid or two claim to be ridiculously overburdened with it as well as varios post pregnancy health issues and since he a vp vip with a big multi million dollar house cannot let it look like crap he will hire cleaning maid service and probably an au pair to help with the child ren household 3 post divorce he will buy a more modest house albeit probably less modest that he would have bought before the multi million dollar house made exactly how she want it 4 he will meet some other chickee and do it all over again ie date cohabit marry then upgrade the house for her new 2nd wife get her all of the status servants etc 5 rinse repeat oh and lol he not going to retire at 40 does not work that way for married and then married divorced remarried repeat vip guys his ego is too heavily invested in his career and eventually that will lead to him hedonically ratcheting up to higher and higher status display of wealth currently his attachment to outward display of status appears to be relatively modest because his income is still currently relatively modest that will not last also do not be at all surprised at the fact that somewhere in the middle of this process this progression you will basically lose touch and get slowly sidelined in terms of your friendship with him oh to be sure he will still be friendly to with you and you will likely still meet up go out with him occasionally but it will becoming increasingly rarer and rarer on a gradual but steady decline basis ie post elevation to vp you will help him celebrate then with after the move to that multi million dollar home you will be invited over once or twice or thrice the first being basically the look at all this look at me scenario and the subsequent invites probably a month then again a few months later will be to pretend that the first invite was not just bragging ego subsequently he will become very busy stuff at work you see including new socializing circles events etc and your next invite get together will be canceled then bumped off a few months then again then you will finally get together but critically not at his home instead at some neutral sports bar venue the next instance will be x years later and much the same etc why because there is a class structure and once you reach c suite level well socializing other than the occasional reminiscent slumming with old buddies is all about money and position and unless you too are in some significant parallel position status and money well you are just no longer going to be moving in the same circles nor will you really have anything in common anymore other than sentimentality over the past that just part of the way it all works again seen it a dozen times over oh and it not bitterness or envy either because trust me if your friend were to attempt to invite you into his new vp vip social circle and events gatherings well been there done that you are just not going to fit in you are not going to enjoy it and quite frankly you will probably feel and unwittingly even display via body language etc a bit of disgust disdain with how fake insincere saccharine etc everyone in that new crowd is ergo there wo not be a repeat and frankly while you might miss the old him you wo not miss nor envy the smarmy sycophantic new version of him btw while you may have triggered the debate argument this is was all inevitable and the argument wo not change any aspect of it at all the raising of the red flags will not change a thing in part because as the other friend noted it will simply be dismissed as joking around ,6,MGTOW
DWShimoda, you said well if everything is a net loss then why have not you simply offed yourself already this assumes that i have adopted the mentality of mgtow no it assumes for the sake of argument that the tack you are taking in this thread is a nihlistic one ie nothing matters nothing is worthwhile there is no purpose or value to life ie everything is a net loss and that you have adopted that stance is all about you taking the piss edit why not try to help others see things the way you do those who are actually honest in their inquiry i do pissant trolls like yourself well its blatantly obvious that you are only purpose here is to try to fuck with people as a game you are failing miserably because there obviously a massive amount of miscommunication here from both sides miscommunication my ass misrepresentation especially on your part definitely bye bye now ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, you presume i adopted the mgtow completely i have not because like you suggested it would point towards suicide i am not presuming any such thing in fact quite the opposite as i said you are really just here to take the piss you are fucking around with bullshit philosophical crap playing devil advocate and what you apparently think is a quasi socratic game but which is in reality a steaming pile of nihilism and inane post modernistic relativity subjectivity claptrap you not only do not belong here you never will and given the tack that you are approaching it you also will never actually understand anything of mgtow oh you will come to conclusions to be sure but they will be entirely wrong and based entirely on the idiocies that you brought into the situation unwittingly trailing along with you ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, like i said i think we unknowingly agree with each other which you have pointed out here as well yes unfortunately the language and concepts have become so corrupted even perverted that it is difficult to make clear statements that wo not be misunderstood and worse well see the below my point is that the post coitus bonding is more of a conscious and active choice than simply being compelled by a feeling like love lust or whatever you wish to call it in other words you are no longer bound by a feeling you are bound by mere obligation which is why historically marriages were more like a business relationship the business of having children and maintaining a household to raise them in and why the concept of love ie marital spousal was wait for it more of a conscious and active choice and yes much less of a feeling of lust not that the two never overlapped but the former took precedence and the latter was sort of a happy bonus if it occurred moreover since men and women were historically understood to be significantly different creatures and because their work and roles in society were largely segregated into separate male female spheres or circles well your spouse was your partner but there was none of the bullshit about them being your best friend much less your only friend much less replacing or displacing your actual friends that notion the conflation of amicus with amare is an even more recent concoction mid late 20th century onward than the conflation of romantic courtly love with lust infatuation again it not to say that man woman historically did not ever develop anything like a friend bond with their spouse partner but rather that it was not some expectation it was again a happy bonus and given that men women would did still have separate social circles spheres it would have been virtually impossible for such a spousal philia aspect rise to the level of interference with their actual same sex friends iow did not matter how much you considered your wife to be a good friend she was not going to join in the weekly poker night with the guys just was not going to happen nor was she going to stop you from going to poker night because she had her own all female or all female small child social circle activities but of course the modern and post modern lifestyle which enables facilitates even expects and all too often demands a sort of constant companion continual love lust and permanent household partner worse yet a supposedly equal 50 50 partnership two captains of the same ship made even worse via technology telegraph then telephones then cell phones and not instant texting oy vey there is no room to breathe within that structure which is why in my opinion it is the above conflations the ridiculous loading up of a marriage with all of those additional roles and at the same time intermixing them into a proverbial stew that is then defined with a single word concept love that more or less dooms the modern spousal relationship at the interpersonal level that more straw than any camel can bear is there really anyone who can possibly fulfill all of those expectations and demands from one spouse to the other and even if there were such an amazing creature what are the chances that the other spouse will be similarly amazingly able to do so in the inverse worse that they both maintain all of that across multiple decades of life and while attempting to also rear a couple of rambunctious children good fucking luck with that so really the inherent problems with marriage 2 0 as it is called really it more like marriage v 5 7c with all of the additions bags that have been attached to the side of it they are not just legal ie divorce custody alimony chilimony etc no at the root the problems are with the fucking insane mix stew of ridiculous expectations that we have loaded the thing up with now i will agree and even posit myself that the changes in the legal aspects relative to marriage family ie no fault divorce and prior to that the ending of adultery laws the changes to custody arrangements especially the asinine tender years doctrine and the even more asinine extension of tender years all the way to adulthood that all of that was probably causal relative to the loading up of marriage imo each of those additional roles additions bags was an attempt to strengthen the marital relationship so that it could endure the new threat of each of the changes in the legal system to wit the most recent addition the advent of spouse as bff seems to have coincided with the no fault divorce and of course of feminism rampant title ix affirmative action women careers in the workplace from my memory understanding the general consensus view of marriage even as late as the 1950 and 1960 was emphatically not that your spouse was to be your best friend or that your social circles had to perfectly overlap that change to me seems to be almost 100 about trying to compensate for the risks of e z divorce the gambit seems to be that while wifey will divorce rape her former lover on a whim with a vengeance while she can divorce rape her protector provider and keep his house and him as provider via force she might fuck over the father of her children especially since she gets custody with extra resources but well surely she would not divorce rape her best friend forever amiright right and moreover that seems to me to be what has really led to the final emasculation of men their complete total cuckolding because it did not does not work what usually seems to happen is that in trying to fulfill the role of best friend forever the husband sacrifices undermines all of his other familial roles to attempt to maintain his perceived status as her best friend as he stupidly thinks it he abandons his headship of the house instead of even trying to be some co captain he simply becomes a rubber stamp junior officer turns the whole works over to her and then begs for some man cave as an escape or hide out ditches his duties responsibilities as father mentor of the children especially particularly the boys instead letting her make all the decisions regarding the kids schooling activities etc and all activities are organized groups supervised by non family members to which she simply chauffeurs the kids with hubby serving as backup driver vehicle and the final blow he even gives up his role as lover and instead submits to being literally cuckolded via some open marriage allowing her to freely be fucked by other men and in the worst cases even joins in an an observer and or co fuckee why wtf well see this way he is still being her best friend forever he becomes like her former lesbian pal roommate from college the one she used to ride the cc with hell he may even literally ala bruce caitlyn jenner attempt to become another female i mean how could she possibly divorce rape that right how could she not see how committed to her he is she the very center of his entire universe he become a sort of eunuch slave and even a lady in waiting to the great princess empress and thus tada he entirely ceases to be a man in any way shape or form it the creation of a fucking madhouse up is down etc and the frigging lunatics are running it ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, you are not placing the term in a sexual context not really relevant to the root meaning of the word sexual fetishes are not always pleasant i never claimed that they were you on the other hand fetish was defined as something that is so attractive to you that you cannot function without it did note especially the last bit there which is obviously false given the psychosocial distress and or detrimental effects on important areas of their life ie causing dysfunction rather than function not that you will admit you got it wrong of course cue the long diatribe in your future reply below wherein you more or less try to claim that function and dysfunction actually mean the same thing yawn ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, and women do out earn men in the 18 34 demo well yes and no certainly there are plenty of women who are making higher annual incomes than many men the problem with that kind of a statistic data thing though is that it does not take into account where and how those groups live to wit chick working in some media biz job might be pulling down 60k even 100k a year and possibly for a half decade maybe even a full decade when she in her edgy cool years mid 20 to early 30 and that seems like in nominal dollar is a shitload of money probably a cool million or so in total income before she a has been shown the door problem is she also most likely located in around nyc and living the life aka the sex and the city life which means she blowing all of that income at least as fast as it coming in and in addition to paying an insane amount to rent a shitty flat it mostly being squandered on incredibly stupid shit http nymag com thecut 2014 11 21 women on the dumbest things theyve bought html not a few such high earning women end up going home to parasitically live off of mommy daddy in their early to mid 30 and without a proverbial pot to piss in from their years in the big city by contrast a lot of those guys are out in flyover land and during those same years mid 20 to early 30 maybe they are only pulling down 40k or 50k but they are in a locale that has a lot lower cost of living and if they are wise and i have seen quite a few young guys wising up in this way they are also banking a good chunk of that income in one form or another buying living in a home they are paying off quick or else investing or building up a decent business and when they hit their early to mid 30 assuming they did not get hooked divorce raped and have to start all over again they are just hitting their stride fast forward another 10 to 20 years and from 30 onward to age 40 to 50 there is generally no comparison which is why so why alimony laws still slanted in your favor because when men are in those 30 to 50 year old ages they have solid assets and solid income meanwhile the former high earning prima donna have long since gone to pasture popped out a kid or two generally in an attempt to latch onto the assets income of the aforementioned guys and meanwhile their earning potential which was primarily either looks or other youth related market value ie the edgy feminista bullshit able to sucker other young women like herself into blowing their cash has by the time they divorce much like their vagina long since dried up but by then they have the hostages in the form of the kids useful for leveraging the home half the man assets and often a good chunk of his paycheck to boot all in the best interests of the children ,4,MGTOW
DWShimoda, the author who wrote this trash good gawd i mean i was already laughing my ass off at virtually every one of the 10 points my favorites being 2 there s a timer on your sex appeal too bucko which is just ridiculously hilarious in it complete and total cluelessness that first of all the limited time age appeal of women as actual commitment mates is not based on their appearance but in their fertility and that secondly the appeal of a man to a woman is likewise not based on his sex appeal but on his wallet assets etc it was blatantly obvious that this was written by a thoroughly indoctrinated feminist and also obviously still 40 she has not yet learned the extent to which she been lied to give it a decade probably a bit less then this one 4 you can t go through life alone everyone needs somebody even if it s for something as simple as a roof over your head or holding down the fort when you re on unemployment going it alone is a good way to make life s problems harder to solve was just absolutely fucking rotflmao funny bitch is basically claiming that men will all be homeless without a woman the sad reality is ironically the opposite most homeless men are homeless because they got involved with committed to a woman and she got the house there also a sort of i am fairly certain unwitting admission in there that the only way women are really going to have a roof over their head is if they acquire one from a man or men she does not realize it but this is basically every brick the next two are just incredibly ironic 5 by the time you realize what a fool you re being most women won t want you 6 if you want a family you ll need a relationship this douchette is headed for such a massive collision with the wall it ridiculous and the next is just plain delusional 7 you can t protect assets you don t even have it never ceases to amaze me how many commitment phobic guys turn down women because they re worried about getting divorced and losing half of their stuff the funny thing is that many women are out earning men or act as the sole working party of couples in fact many of my friends who hear this sh t from guys grossly out earn their love interests this is a classic case of not seeing the forest for the trees in an effort to protect a beat up honda civic commitment phobic men avoid the potential of getting a mercedes s class maybach iow she really believes the msm statistics though doubtless in the next breath the next article she spews out she will be bitching and moaning about the wage gap and the glass ceiling etc and of course despite the fact that she is doubtless doing much the same she rather clueless about what all those women are doing with their out earning men money http nymag com thecut 2014 11 21 women on the dumbest things theyve bought html and her focus on status display shit like the proverbial mercedes s class maybach is just another example but really yeah if they would just have posted her picture next to the story well really that would have said it all just by itself ,6,MGTOW

DWShimoda, why should i care the word care has multiple meanings the context i took your doubled question in was not so much about caring but rather being aware the yes was yes be aware not yes be personally involved and caring and to roll the context back further to your initial reply comment where the fun in that do not let the pimp hand get rusty man up fucker is telling me to be even more brutal and in my case well i am not certain that even possible much less desirable lol to wit now in addition to pedantically explaining that do you need me to cut your chicken tendies up into even smaller than bite size pieces maybe later on wipe your ass cheeks for you too see not sure that telling me to get rid of all restraints is a good idea ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, should i care does it not apply yes to the first and no it does not to the second ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, you are totally right she does not even love her own child there nothing besides her to her i am arguing it actually worse than that she cannot even envision caring about anything or anyone other than herself it not that she does not love her own child she is premeditatively planning on never allowing any such thing to even possibly occur now that is not to say that she will not someday change her mind at least in regards to the specifics of having a child but and if she does so it fairly obvious it will only be as a backup plan should he grandiose career plans fall flat and she determines that a child will be the best way to acquire resources to provide for her own sustenance resources either from some beta bux sucker man and or from the government ie men collectively and may god have mercy upon that child because life growing up under her is going to be a living hell ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, you have again just chosen to ignore my only point and instead hurl insults mgtow do not build relationships because it is a net loss i ask why many men here pursue other things that are net losses well if everything is a net loss then why have not you simply offed yourself already you really do not seem to have any concept of an actual purpose in not doing so glancing through your post history and it makes sense now you are just a cancerous little shit that attempts to plague reddit and project their insecurities on others not playing your games anymore go bother someone else thanks for the laugh lol riiiight says the little nihilistic snowflake ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, where the fun in that some people are just not worth the bother increasingly there are a shitload of men who may as well be women physically they may be males but the mindset and indoctrination into well idiocy and trigglypuff type snowflake shit not worth wasting time on better to just zap them out of one life i have my suspicions theories as to the cause of this and i do not think it simply education indoctrination i think there is a physical side to it probably a big part of it dietary hormonal both during gestation then infancy and adulthood and possibly in some part genetic as well let face it the majority doing the breeding in the west are not starting with a full deck of cards to begin with and just as selective breeding has been shown to have progenic effects in only a few generations well i am inclined to think that dysgenic deterioration happens just as quickly certainly there is evidence of both happening with dogs ironically the latter with so called pure breds do not let the pimp hand get rusty man up fucker lol you do realize who you made that comment to right ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, anyone have a list of jobs careers for mgtow where you do not have to deal with endless questions humiliation for being single and child free for life and not at all interested in people birthdays stories about their kids questions about your life idiotic holidays with pathetic dress up days all the meaningless shit people basically post on facebook and brag about all day etc etc as others here have noted get just about any job that is a not primarily an office environment and b not retail meaning no food service no health care and not in any store etc all of those places are essentially non productive environments that is to say they are not focused on actually producing anything building creating things repairing etc instead they are largely reactive meaning lots of down time lots of informal socializing and lots and lots of bullshit motivational entertainment team building crapola the latter being seen as necessary because the work itself is generally mindless and soul deadening hence the appeal attraction to women get some job that involves producing again building creating things maintaining repairing stuff etc and the whole socializing crapfest especially the top down shit usually all goes by the wayside there no time or place or need for any of that bullshit ,3,MGTOW

DWShimoda, lol so butthurt no it a serious suggestion if you are being all triggered as you were in this thread then it a suggestion you probably ought follow i use block user with a rather large number of idiots kin to yourself although generally a bit worse than you you are a whiney snowflake and more than a bit of a clueless idiot but there a teeny tiny spark of something that indicates to me that all hope is not yet lost in your case said spark is rather rapidly fading ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, there more to it than mere lust though of course there is this is precisely my point lust is just the desire to have sex with the other person which is the entirety of what you were talking about the thing we are talking about here also has an aspect of bonding for the sake of the offspring no that what i am talking about lust does not really help the offspring survive but it great for creating new offspring exactly which is why lust fits your statement of duh after breeding mother nature is done with the both of you romantic love lust is no longer needed run you are free go on then shoo and yes it sufficient for getting females pregnant and probably also one of the reasons females have an inherent tendency to simply kill the result of that even before it exits the womb as well as historically for quite a period of time afterward not so sufficient for survival of said offspring though not at the fully human homo sapiens level anyway though possibly at the lesser primate homo erectus homo idioticus levels to which much of of the population seems to be reverting regressing ,1,MGTOW

DWShimoda, never did i say i have a right or any inclination of doing so nor would i ever i am not sure where you got that from from the overall thrust of the content of your original post i do not want to rant too much but it hurts me to see what some of my friends go through and have gone through the ones who are still trapped in marriages or too blind to leave committed relationships children condishuns and disability women are set up to divorce rape any man they want they know they are and they are absolutely abusive towards men not all women are as abusive as these women i have some friends who are married that while they are not happy are not being outright psychologically tormented but some of my friends are i wish i could save them but they would lose everything and more that seems to me to be more than some idle wishing you are also not understanding that i am speaking about close friends whom i know intimately i doubt you know the entirely of their situation as well as you think you do you have to be careful of extrapolating some crying in their beer stuff from the larger reality that they are choosing to stay in those situations situations which are of their making more than anyone else i think you are just trying to be a dick no you dumbass i was giving you a warning telling you to beware because you seem to be both on the verge of doing something instead of merely wishing upon a star from afar and even bar that you are obviously getting your knickers in a twist about something that is not your problem something we do not need to see replicated in others in fact there is far too much of it already note that the comment from u bestat21 says pretty much the same thing just in a much nicer fashion yet he came to essentially the same conclusion from your little rant that i did moreover regarding this projecting about parental authority by telling me i am wrong as if i am a child well perhaps you need it even if you do not want it and do you forget that this is a public forum that there are in fact many other people who read and form impressions from the thread posts and comments here the paternal attitude and the warning were not solely aimed at you did you ever think of that something tells me that no you did not ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, i am not looking for an argument pal of course you are in fact that pretty much all that you are interested in to wit i am not asking for help indeed i am asking why do most of the things mgtow men go onto doing if they have the same net negative to them that relationships have it seems hypocritical to an extent it only seems hypocritical because you are chosen to fuck around with a nietzschean nihilistic bullshit attitude rejection response to everything the hypocrisy is in you not the replies and figuring this out may be what finalised the decision to join this community adopt this mindset or not riiight junior you are so full of bullshit it not only turned your eyes brown it leaking from your ears if you do not have an answer then feel free to rage at others elsewhere this place does not exist to play pansy assed versions of what is the ultimate purpose of life the universe and everything go try one of the r philosophy clubs if you want to fuck around with getting the answer or fucking join oprah book club or something or frankly just go fuck yourself ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, i am absolutely allowed to have sympathy for my friends in bad situations these are people i know closely and have told me they are trapped i refuse to withdraw from society be a monk or not have friends sympathy is one thing thinking that you have some right much less responsibility to step in as if they were children and you were some parental authority figure well that quite another ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, i do not want to rant too much but it hurts me to see what some of my friends go through and have gone through the ones who are still trapped in marriages or too blind to leave committed relationships children condishuns and disability women are set up to divorce rape any man they want they know they are and they are absolutely abusive towards men not all women are as abusive as these women i have some friends who are married that while they are not happy are not being outright psychologically tormented but some of my friends are i wish i could save them but they would lose everything and more you need to beware appointing yourself as some captain save a masochist seriously you may find the carpet furniture decor in your friends homes to be atrociously ugly but it is not your position to go over and redecorate their home instead you should assume that the general appearance of their home is the way it is because they have chosen to make it that way and so are happy with it or else that at the very least that they are unwilling to put effort or take the risks needed to change it and are therefore content complacent with it being that way worry about your own home your own furnishings and decor and likewise govern your own relationships and so long as there is not some egregious abuse of a powerless innocent child then you should cease to fret over the choices and circumstances and relationships of other adults iow not your job ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, you are dealing with your biological urges in the most efficient way possible that debatable i would move that there are in fact many other even more efficient ways largely understanding that the physical act is only sensory input to an orgasmic experience that is in reality and internal mental event a neurobiochemical flood response ,3,MGTOW
DWShimoda, i really dont understand this it their nature load of crap as if that was a good excuse for bad immoral behavior immoral though implies requires a standard of morality and if when a society or civilization era zeitgeist etc has discarded the underlying basis of morality or defined it to be simply and solely aka just only a social construct that can then be either determined subjectively or else redefined in an arbitrary willy nilly manner according to some fad fashion as ostensibly decided by collective society at large but in reality only as presented to that collective society via those who control the means of mass indoctrination propaganda schools media etc which amounts to the same thing ie the foundation has been removed it my nature as a male to be aggressive so that is a excuse to behave like a dick and burst out on people to mugg rape and kill it is in certain contexts or at least at times has been and in the not too distant future very likely will be again ie wartime and or other periods circumstances of chaos mob riots etc currently aggression is considered acceptable in certain ways and forms generally not physical violence at present but other forms specifically fraud upon the public various aggressive business schemes financial scams etc albeit it is not exclusively male territory anymore it is still largely mostly men who are the primary actors in that area ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, and only start fucking again when another female enters or their resources are threatened or once they become hedonically adjusted to and bored with a certain level of resources and so seek out additional greater resource status providers ie hypergamy or else even just thrills to end the boredom i have personally seen both of those occur with girls who did find marry millionaire sugar daddy types ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, i am not sure what happened with society but this is really really fucked up i would probably be fucking escorts till i get old but i would not really get into a relationship the shit is not worth it it probably beyond the ability of most here to comprehend but i would suggest the c s lewis book essay collection the abolition of man https www amazon com abolition man c s lewis ebook dp b002bxh5ru as one means of gaining a philosophical understanding and an answer to your query of what the fuck happened to our society civilization seriously no offense intended as cliche as it is to state in many ways the it not your fault line sentiment ie the trope from the good will hunting film is actually applicable for most many of you you were unwittingly indoctrinated into a mindset and have for the entirely or your lives swum in polluted waters that makes it virtually impossible for you to comprehend and ironic as it may seem that is one of the things that lewis book explains or at least attempts to explain predicted would happen note while i link to the amazon kindle version which i think is better to read digest such a crunchy chewy tome there are in fact online copies of the text available in various formats plain text pdf etc just search on the title author btw in many countries lewis works are now legitimately in the public domain as he passed away 50 years ago ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, how is watching more reality tv or shit movies something to be proud of i am sure it makes you dumber if anything likewise the books that women are actually reading not just purchase to set on a shelf or coffee table but that they actually read pass around etc go to any walmart and look at the books on sale or even any big box bookstore the few that are left and take a look at the size of the romance novel section then compare it to the size of say the science fiction section also pull a few random books down from each and note the publication dates hint the lion share of the sci fi books sold are classics that have been in print for decades almost the entirety of the romance novel section are recently published moreover for an even larger example go to either a used bookstore or better yet stop by some rummage sales and take a quick scan through the various books in the boxes by and large women read and watch crap ,24,MGTOW
DWShimoda, i do not know what you are on and if you either took not enough or too much today exactly you do not know more correctly it beyond your comprehension even your ability to conceive of it in the abstract to your self centered sociopathic mindset view of the world it entirely incommensurable hence you deem it nonsense and babbling and you have to posit that it is the result of some drug induced haze because that is your experience of such things ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, because we stopped listening to religious fundamentalists because we have society or at least certain aspects of it has collectively thrown out everything about the tao and adopted a wholly sociopathic animalistic mindset and then not realizing the irony bemoan the results like others who replied you have bought into a false dichotomy and see everything solely from a very narrow self centered and again sociopath viewpoint something everything is either useful to you or a threat to you your mindset does not consider apparently cannot even conceive of any third or fourth option or alternative not even when the idea of it is explicitly presented to you far from having the open mind that you have been brainwashed to believe you have obtained and which you are arrogantly proud of you have in fact been conditioned into an entirely mind less state ,1,MGTOW

DWShimoda, if you reasearch cults there is always centralization of power with people at top getting more and people at bottom getting fucked now since globalisation is basically a power grab by the elites it is likely the same effect we are seeing on a massive scale this is what neoreactionsafe on redpill calls the blue pill ie a deception so pervasive it seeps into the very core of the thought processes of millions just like the autonomous formation of cults this can happen without much central planning with agents accepting their roles and doing what they are supposed to cf also milieu control https en wikipedia org wiki milieu control milieu control involves the control of communication within a group environment that also may or may not result in a significant degree of isolation from surrounding society when non group members or outsiders are considered or potentially labeled as less valuable without basis for stated group supported and group reinforced prejudice group members may have a tendency to then consider themselves as intellectually superior which can limit alternate points of view thus becoming a self fulfilling prophecy in which group members automatically begin to devalue others and the intellect of others that are separate from their group without logical rationale for doing so additionally milieu control includes other techniques to restrict members contact with the outside world and to be able to make critical rational judgments about information 2 now apply that to the msm facebook twitter etc and particularly apply it to the vast masses of people who live in the clinton archipelago https polination files wordpress com 2016 12 clinton archipelago png and who are fed see things like this http endingthefed com wp content uploads 2016 08 media caught lying about the crowd size of hillary clinton rallys jpg ,1,MGTOW

DWShimoda, if you think about the bulk majority of men in human history effectively died as virgins the bulk majority of humans died as infants or children point in fact is that they still do infant deaths are in fact much higher in the western first world nations than they are in the third world we just do not count them as such we use the convenient euphemism aborted fetus and thus eliminate them from the statistics of either deaths or humans ,1,MGTOW

DWShimoda, wanting her virginity intact was just a way of making sure the babies that came out of her belonged to you it much much more than that it also an absence of sexually transmitted disease which often xfers to the children as well as spouse absence of damaged ability to pair bond which we now have at least a partial scientific and biological neurochemical theory for absence of a host of psychological issues and problems etc etc while the preference for a virgin bride can certainly become a fetish as indeed can any other preference that does not mean it is only ever and always just a fetish the same thing this same thinking reasoning error is present and pervasive throughout the feminist and gbltq and other sjw memes and indeed nearly all modern post modern mindsets identifying some singular aspect or trait of something proclaiming it as the sole explanation and denying dismissing all other aspects or traits regardless of evidence for them their prevalence importance etc per example you can easily see how this was done with sex gender first the creation of a second term in this case gender for something that was already adequately identified by the first term sex the new term gains some acceptance momentum simply because the first term also has other meanings and uses and thus gradually gender replaces sex on paper forms because the latter is too easy to joke about not now thank you and the new term helps to ironic as it may seem at this stage to reduce or even end ambiguity next comes the gradual shift in the definition of the new term gender gradually being used in phrase combination with another term role and used in a manner that is different than the meaning of the combination with the old term to wit gender role is not the same as sex role follow on with a notion that there are aspects of that these gender roles which are socially constructed ie much like the way that a building is constructed atop a foundation then declare that this aspect is the only one that matters ie that gender roles and thus gender are only and just social constructs iow not only deny it importance but literally abandon and ignore that there even is a foundation under the building as if the basement footings do not matter once that oversimplification becomes accepted proclaim that it is all a fraud which ironically as reconstructed and redefined it actually is but the fraud is not the real buildings nor the ignored foundation it is the false straw man house that has been constructed alongside or in place of the actual building slide everyone down into a sort of quagmire of nihilism ,3,MGTOW

DWShimoda,no they do not they may have assets which have been ascribed an imputed notational value of that much versus the aggregated notational value of the assets of those 3 6 billion but that is not the same thing at all even more this kind of article is pure bullshit from several other perspectives to begin with of the approximately 7 1 billion people on the planet nearly 2 billion of them are children ages 0 to 14 and legally in most nations they cannot have assets so they own 0 in assets ergo chances are if you have even 1 in assets then you are richer than that 2 billion then of the approximately 3 2 billion in the next age block from 15 to 44 well a significant chunk of them probably around 1 4 or another 800 million are also still essentially children but even ignoring that the vast majority of the people in this age group may in fact own and or have control over substantial assets homes vehicles etc and yet they also have substantial debts mortgages car loans student loans etc such that they have a negative net worth or a very minimal positive net worth just for shits giggles let posit that maybe half of these 1 6 billion have a negative net worth if you have more assets than debts well again you are richer than the majority of them as well and 1 6 billion times x the previous 2 billion time 0 well voila you too are richer than 3 6 billion people and their combined wealth which puts you in the same category as bill gates and warren buffet right not hardly moreover it pretty amazing that somehow the rothschilds the rockefellers and a host of other very wealthy families not to mention the wide array of trusts foundations and other little so called philanthropic entities they control are apparently nowhere on the radar of oxfam governments seem to be missing as well finally i will just leave a few things about oxfam itself http www snouts in the trough com archives 10847 http www fedee com global lies damn lies oxfam ,0,economy

DWShimoda, i do not know where the term fuck you fund originated but it was most popularized by the tom leykis call in show nah the term has been around for ages either as fuck you fund or fuck you money i first heard reference to it back in the mid 1970 when i ran across it in articles about the guy who had started various computer firms back in the 1960 when they would sell out or ipo they would be advised to not leave all of their assets in the company but to each take down about 1 million or so which at the time was a shitload more than it is now to pay off their houses cars etc and it was generally called the fuck you money meaning no matter what happened with their company afterwards whether they got fired or it went bankrupt or whatever they and their family should be set for life regardless assuming they continued to live in a relatively modest manner and i would not be at all surprised to find that the phrase even stated in that crude f word fashion is probably much older than that not to mention there were probably other less crude versions of it used previously edit apparently it was being used verbally in hollywood show biz as well back in the 1960 if not before and entered print in 1971 for many people f k you money is the essence of success if you have as performers will call it f k you money johnny carson once said all that means is that i don t have to do what i don t want to do having f k you money is the logical extreme of a certain conception of american freedom complete ownership over yourself and your time the freedom to retire at any time is a far more flexible proposition than owning your own business like most vulgar expressions of the more decorous at least publicly pre internet era the phrase origin is difficult to ascertain google books which searches an extensive digitized catalog shows a printed debut in 1971 in the show business nobody knows a book by earl wilson a gossip columnist who was known for exposing jfk s broad interpretation of his marital vows wilson like johnny carson pegs its origin to showbiz and names perhaps the earliest adopter as none other than comedian red buttons note that red buttons achieved fame fortune right after wwii circa 1947 1950 and really fu money would not be out of line with other terms from that era like fu bar and sna fu both of which were popular among the military during wwii and entered the vernacular after the war ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, you know what they say he who dies with the most money loses the game of life these days i have been hearing lots of stories where quite frankly having a big pile of money when you are old is probably even a detriment because it makes the person a sort of target for operations including literal operations surgery in hospitals that you are probably better off without as well as things like senior or nursing homes that will bill at insanely high prices we are talking 10k 20k or more per month imagine living frugally carefully watching every dime and dollar only to have some let call them what they are ripoff operation deplete all of it in a matter of months and in order to pay for what is probably a pretty shitty existence i am all for frugal living but personally i would rather die in my sleep years before i reach that point ,2,MGTOW
DWShimoda, 500k and you can live of the interest is this real life you would need more than that probably not bank account interest not these days but dividends gains from stocks absolutely at least in the us at present where such things are generally taxed at lower rates then regular working wages and there are mechanisms to only be taxed on what you withdraw and sometimes not even that then as u sphinx318 notes if you are properly set up and living debt free on your own in your own relatively modest home you minimize wasteful travel or other expenses do your own cooking etc well at least in the middle of america a single guy can easily live on less than 10k a year ie a mere 2 annual net return on 500k and live quite comfortably even somewhat luxuriously albeit with said luxury being in moderate ways amounts i might add i have lived several years with my base expenses at right around 6k per year and by base expenses i mean my total housing property taxes repairs utilities my vehicle licenses insurance and fuel and my entire food budget including nice butcher cut steaks one or more times per week etc with a little extra for some occasional entertainment bottle of wine every now and again internet a few books movies etc not to be sure there have been years when i have spent significantly more than that but usually in the form of either some repair upgrade of something in the home or on a vehicle which then lasts several years in some cases a decade or more and needs to be seen as being amortized across that time frame or else is some sort of investment in tools or other equipment which likewise last many years many years in which there is then no such expense ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, must of those people that say eating healthy is expensive will spend an entire weeks grocery budget eating out one meal and to sort of double the irony many people will claim they are deprived if they cannot eat out at least once each week ergo across a single month of such they blow enough money on just a handful of meals enough that would have fed them and probably much better for a full second month the additional irony on top of that is that in the western societies they are a part of they are rarely at a loss for a kitchen usually fully equipped to cook in that is they are not homeless and the convenience that they gain by eating out is illusory in terms of time or effort saved as well the effort is just in travel the time is spent waiting both of which can be more draining than the minimal work of cooking ,2,MGTOW
DWShimoda, as of yesterday my fuck you fund is at 32 000 it feels great to have such a financial cushion i will not change my lifestyle by much but i will go see some prostitutes again which will probably set me back about 500 and see how quickly i can double that fund ps i love my job so i do not envision ever going to need to say fuck you to my boss the thing is having that fuck you fund alters your level of confidence in any number of different ways both internally and externally you realize the former but are probably unaware of the full extent of the latter in part because it subtle and also because none of us can really perceive how we present ourselves in those ways so ironically you probably do not wo not ever need to say fuck you to your boss because that underlying change in confidence means that your boss is far less likely to ever put you in a position where you would ever need or want to say that in fact they will probably do the opposite it a sort of weird counter intuitive dynamic to the blue pill story people are told sure the strong probably should protect the weak or vulnerable but by and large that not how most people operate instead there is especially with men a tendency to take advantage of the weak vulnerable and to pander to the confident strong and relatively invulnerable why because well to put it bluntly you very easily can take advantage of those in a vulnerable position and with almost 100 guaranteed success whereas attempting to do so with the confident strong relatively invulnerable is much more difficult and far less likely to succeed one should note that there are exceptions not everyone wants or enjoys taking advantage of vulnerable people and or do so in only certain ways while maintaining a facade even to themselves that they are not doing so and many are not consistent about it at all that is they do take advantage in some circumstances but are appalled by the idea of doing so in other circumstances but the inverse is rarely true you generally do not risk losing competent confident employees not on an individual basis anyway bean counters fucking over entire hordes of such say to shift a factory to a low wage country that a different matter but of course in those cases having the fuck you money serves as a good insurance policy nonetheless ergo there is seldom any downside to having it ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, their psyche is closer to that of a child actually it arguably more of an animalistic psyche it not out of ill will they are just programmed to look after their offspring and make sure that they survive this is actually debatable women in fact seem to have zero problem either killing or abandoning their own children in fact the nurturing of children that women do seems to chiefly be as a mechanism to manipulate men singly and collectively to obtain provision protection for themselves when you really comprehend that and that the whole females are nurturing is a lie then you will more fully understand what such women are capable of in every other circumstance as well keep in mind the chief and arguably entire base argument used for the legalization of abortion is that women will do it anyway just with a higher risk of harming themselves that is women will kill their own children off in utero if the child is deemed to be inconvenient meaning not presently useful as a mechanism to them personally this is akin to arguing that men should be legally allowed to murder anyone they want to with a gun provided that they use a suppressor silencer or wear ear protection so that they do not harm their own hearing while doing so because such a negative consequence would be bad ,1,MGTOW

DWShimoda,there are in fact probably quite a few men who fit the category on the right problem is they do not always know that some chick they meet or date has a relationship with another guy ie the dude on the left seriously women who cheat also and i know this will shock some of you they also lie about not being in a relationship so while juan the pool boy knows damned well that the milf he fucking is married to mr ceo and while jody is entirely aware that he fucking dear john wife while john is on an overseas deployment the george clooney character in up in the air is entirely unaware that the businesswoman he been fucking off on is in fact married with children and i know of more than one guy who has found himself in a similar circumstance meeting someone online or via some business connection especially trade shows and shit and then only substantially later invariably accidentally finding out the bitch is married and to a man those guys have been appalled angry about it angry about being lied to because the omission of that info is a lie and angry about the fact that they have inadvertently been cucking some other dude as shocking as finding out there is gambling going on in casablanca ,4,MGTOW

DWShimoda, yeah i only shave because if i do not my face looks like the moon i guess you must mean round because otherwise well a cratered face say due to acne etc would seem to me to be more likely what a clean shaven face would look like rather than a full beard the hair i would think would help cover that up does not help i am black and our skin is oily as fuck lol not sure that necessarily an ethnic related thing i am a frigging germanic viking and my skin gets oily as fuck too most soap other skin care products only seem to make it worse only thing i have found that seems to lessen it is the old school kirk original coco castile soap this stuff https www amazon com kirks original coco castile count dp b004jmml9i which i sort of accidentally ran across got started using a couple of decades back due to backwoods camping because it about the only thing that works up a decent lather in really hard and or cold water plus is zero phosphate biodegradable etc love that it does not dry out the skin and so sort of reduces the oily backlash even works as a substitute for shampoo and shaving cream plus lol after the camping store closed up well it was difficult to source locally and this was ba before amazon so i ended up just ordering a case of the stuff direct from the manufacturer like 96 bars which also dropped the cost dramatically and the stuff lasts forever too so i have not worried about buying soap for years now point being if you can find a bar to test it might be worth a try i do not touch my chin though i got nice long goatee going on goatee are cool too and at least you can probably get away with skipping a shave every now and then ,1,MGTOW

DWShimoda,still not right try in brutal act young woman murders her own infant child minutes after giving birth goes back to texting on her phone immediately after young woman because i do not give a shit if she was a teenager 16 year old boys and younger are regularly prosecuted as adults and held responsible for locked up around all kinds of things far short of murder also yes murder because she did not just discard some stillborn corpse she murdered her own child and yes in a brutal fashion quit white knighting for her with euphemisms also incredibly sickening are the majority of the comments from the men in that thread rushing to her defense that this was a tragedy that she possibly did not know she was pregnant and a host of other bullshit panic reaction or not she chose to kill the child dial it down from premeditated murder to manslaughter although imo even that is really not justified because she damned well knew she was pregnant and she almost certainly knew how far along she was per the boyfriend she actively hid the pregnancy that to my mind constitutes premeditation all of this pussy pass bullshit needs to end ,5,MGTOW
DWShimoda,beard cheaper yet less waste of time especially in front of a narcissistic mirror and it demonstrates that you dgaf about conforming to societal fads fashion also gets rid of the androgynous bullshit plus appearance wise a beard can easily and dramatically alter facial factors otherwise boyish looking guys will look older more mature more responsible capable with a beard and a good beard can easily alter the jawline and chin etc women and children have smooth faces men have beards ,3,MGTOW
DWShimoda, unless you do not grow facial hair evenly like me then if you do not shave you look like a teenager in his awkward phase do not know how old you are but it is fairly common for young men especially in late teens but with some guys even into their early to mid 20 especially if they were late to puberty to be as of that point in time unable to yet grow a full beard if you get much beyond that though mid to late 20 that is and you still cannot grow a full beard and not merely assuming that based on failed attempts from years prior the you really ought to take a look at your diet particularly beware of things that have various soy based elements in them and these days that includes not just stuff like soy protein powders but a lot of the crap that is being sold as gluten free and of course low fat or even organic not to mention a lot of convenience and fast foods think that 100 beef you are eating at mcdonalds contains a variety of soy fillers and other soy crap that going to fuck with your hormones and you will probably not only look like a teenager in his awkward phase you may very well almost be teenager in his awkward phase in certain ways due to the side effects of the phytoestrogens in soy foods ie gastric problems mood problems weight problems moobs etc basically if you eat a lot of soy laden crap whether you are even aware of it presence in your diet or not well you may as well be popping birth control pills http www menshealth com nutrition soys negative effects unless you know for certain that beardlessness or a scant beard is a genetic recessive running in your family ie dad grandpa not only never grew a full beard they never really had a full 5 o clock shadow either well not to scare you unnecessarily but bar that a pronounced lack of ability to grow facial hair in a full adult male probably ought to be taken as at least potentially a sign that there is something not quite right with your body your health and while the most likely cause these days is probably diet and the most likely cause within the diet is soy there are potentially other hormonal problems that it can be a symptom of to wit years back i had a friend in his mid 30 who had previously in his 20 been able to grow a full beard w o any problem but it had gradually become scraggly sparse and he had other problems too man boobs mood depression issues digestive problems etc and no it was not due to him eating soy turned out he had a atypical tumor in his gut size of a baseball and once that was removed and he endured through survived chemo his hormones went back to normal sadly it had taken years for him to get it properly diagnoses most of he doctors he had seen attributed it all to him being fat ironically his getting fat was also a symptom and his weight gain had paralleled the tumor growth probably in part because of hormones and in part because the gut problems other issues had made him increasingly sedentary even lethargic once that was gone well post chemo he was easily able to maintain a normal weight and on a diet that was not much different than what he would been eating before ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, stop shaving cheapest and most manly option an old pair of scissors or a small trimmer are sufficient this beards are not only natural but serve distinct purposes they are as much as to distinguish a full adult man from a boy as they are to distinguish men from women this kind of androgynous look creature http i imgur com xz1uory jpg is really not all that different from this satirical parody http cdn lifezette com wp content uploads 2016 04 298216 full jpg even though the latter parody predates the former reality by over a decade and the ambiguity is really only possible because of the current facial hair fashion among men and really that fashion is a construct of pervasive marketing advertising nor is it too much of a stretch to say that it is largely a self serving result of the advertising of gillette et al and one could also say that it has significant roots in the androgynous aspects of socialism feminism etc because more than just being a waste of money shaving is also a massive waste of time and a literally narcissistic endeavor akin to female makeup and primping by contrast a full beard is very easy to keep trimmed at whatever length one wants expending minimal time on essentially a weekly basis and facial hair is then not all that different from the hair on one head beyond that the clean shaven male face is a sign of submission conforming to the fashionable norms of a rather corrupt and imo increasingly perverse society a society that worships youth are the fatuous appearance and imitation of it and denigrates real adulthood and is caught up in pointless materialistic display ie perception over reality ,7,MGTOW
DWShimoda, tarzan grew up in the jungle with apes he still shaved you do understand that tarzan is fantastic fiction right and that it is modern early 20th century specifically 1910 fiction from an era when beards were once again going out of style the reactionary far backlash swing of the pendulum against the fashion of the previous decades late 1800 which had virtually demanded all men wear full beards and in certain cases like british military officers facial hair was literally required moreover there is even an explanation given for him learning teaching himself to shave that he made a mistaken assumption drew a false conclusion when he was a teen and in the original story he was merely a teenager when he sought out his family history and other humans based largely on the fact that the black people he had encountered had no beards and the a few photographs that were left with his family last home belongings included his father with a clean shaven face something that would in fact have been highly uncharacteristic for a man of his father era he concluded that his beard and likewise his lack of clothing was somehow a sign of having lived among the apes and that he was becoming ape like when in fact he wanted to be a man and not an ape ergo the chief motivator for his shaving was a combination of fear with ignorance to wit but of these things tarzan did not think he was worried because he had not clothing to indicate to all the jungle folks that he was a man and not an ape and grave doubt often entered his mind as to whether he might not yet become an ape was not hair commencing to grow upon his face all the apes had hair upon theirs but the black men were entirely hairless with very few exceptions true he had seen pictures in his books of men with great masses of hair upon lip and cheek and chin but nevertheless tarzan was afraid almost daily he whetted his keen knife and scraped and whittled at his young beard to eradicate this degrading emblem of apehood and so he learned to shave rudely and painfully it is true but nevertheless effectively ,4,MGTOW

DWShimoda, yeah what you said here makes a lot of sense i like my friends but well you know better than most that guys who swear to stay bachelors forever tend to end up married well it simply a statistical fact guys who swear to stay bachelors may end up staying single longer but eventually the vast majority of men do get married or at least they end up cohiabiting in some long term relationship and more to the point of the bachelor pad they tend to go through a series of short to mid to long term relationships wherein they have one or more girlfriends who well if they do not literally move in and cohabit and often over the objections of the roommates due to some claimed emergency which is about as un predictable as an accidental pregnancy ie her lease ran out and she could not find another place she could afford etc then they still move in and take over as much as they can see her place is sooooo small and she does not have a good high speed internet so the netflix chill evenings are always at the bachelor pad and then well she too drunk tired to drive home so so you wake up the next morning to find a half naked chick bawling on your buddy dave lap in the living room and then you find out why she ransacked the fridge somehow an entire dozen eggs a whole pound of bacon and the better part of a loaf of bread all your personal food not dave has been well it been destroyed to say it had been cooked would be misleading the remains are all in the garbage can except for the bits on the counter the stuff coating the microwave ceiling and walls and apparently the collateral damage of the first few of booboohonie experimental attempts at this thing called cooking breakfast for boyfriend oh and did i mention that the coffee maker is wrecked someway somehow it too triggered or offended booboohoney when she tried to use it and it now sitting soaking but fortunately unplugged in the kitchen sink along with what used to be a couple of fairly new non stick teflon coated cooking pans and even though you are the chief victim the only one suffering any actual loss you are bereft of your brekky for the next week you dare not really say much of anything at least not in the immediate present for fear of triggering yet another volcano round of crocodile tears flinging things tantrums from booboohoney who seems to be in full meltdown mode because re is not as simple as x of principal fuck that complicated it is that why partnerships never work and why even multiple people setting up a corporation well there has to be one main party doing the bankrolling and in charge of the operations and generally either some reserve account that all holders have to contribute to or a line of credit to see you past the unexpected expenses then recouped out of profits or equity at the end of the year alright i have seen the light it fails the risk reward analysis with probably lower odds of idealized success than the average marriage thank you b 52 for dropping those truth bombs ayah i would say over a 5 year time frame even two bachelors buying owning a place probably has a lower chance of success that is the 2 still being co owners at the end of the 5 years than the typical marriage add in a third or a fourth bachelor buddy and the odds of success decrease exponentially to be blunt about it outside of h1b visa immigrants from some third world country i have never even seen 3 single american guys successfully rent together for a whole year one or another of them skips out somewhere in the middle and that was with guys attending the same college again that does not mean you cannot buy a place and rent rooms to a couple of buds that you cannot help each other out them providing some cash to reduce costs and or slave labor cleaning fixing up the place and then getting cheap rent for a while in exchange because you can do that and do it quite a successfully provided that is that the arrangement is very clear cut ie written lease rental agreement regarding base commitments expectations rent and other terms and part of that is explicitly who is in charge and in what ways forms you as the owner can end the deal plus owner is both authority and responsibility if the fridge or the water heater goes out it the owner responsibility to pay for and get the replacement in place you might be able to coerce some elbow grease from them to help pick up install a new one so that it can be fixed asap instead of a week from now but you are not going to be able to expect that they crack open their wallets in any form other than the monthly rent check fences make good neighbors and written rental agreements make for far more successful roommate arrangements yeah it patriarchal you or whoever is the actual owner of the group are sort of playing big brother daddy but well somebody has to be the adult bear the responsibility else it will all go to shit that the difference between a real house and a tree

DWShimoda, yes i agree about truly monogamous couples i was referring to the hookup culture that is so widespread today and the myth that you can have as many partners as you want as long as you practice safe sex i knew that was what you meant and i wholly agree the entire safe sex meme is utter bullshit my point was just that when most people hear the word abstinence they interpret it as meaning complete total celibacy ie no porn no fappping no nothing ever and that of course is a complete fallacy that what the promoters of the hookup culture want young people to believe that the world is some either or thing that they are either down with the whole hookup culture including exposure risk of sti or else the only way to stay disease free is that they will have to be a completely sexless orgasmless and hormonally frustrated eunuch for their entire life a nice little entirely false dichotomy which is bullshit why do they want young people to believe that well generally speaking i think it because in one way or another those people themselves want to get into many of those kids pants they are in fact grooming them as prospective future sex partners in many cases short term future in others a bit further out by stress on the planet i mean the fact that for example we are cutting down large swaths of rainforest in order to grow food and livestock which has consequences short of a long global nuclear winter obviously we cannot have a permanent effect on the planet but we can only continue for so long until our world population becomes unsustainable all actions have consequences good and bad and indifferent and even some global nuclear war the nuclear winter bit is a rather dubious theory but even if that were true as well in point of fact the planet would not be any more stressed about it than it has been by the various ice ages the massive meteors etc as for the population being sustainable unsustainable there certainly are limits to local populations in terms of local carrying capacity that is true of all forms of life not just humans and yet there really is no such thing as a sustainable population not in the passive sense of the word nor from the false view that the world underneath us is somehow stable because it is not the earth itself is in fact highly unstable it is dynamic chaotic and ever changing in a thousand different ways and it is also being transformed by the actions of not just humans but a million different forms of life and countless billions upon billions of different critters animals plants fungi even algae protozoans and bacilli oh and as for that rainforest you have been fed a rather large series of fatuous myths about that i would strongly suggest you fetch a copy of the book entitled 1491 new revelations of the americas before columbus and in the meantime take a gander at this article https www yahoo com news hundreds ancient earthworks resembling stonehenge 200000000 html and consider the implications those trees have not been there anywhere near as long as you think they have and the rainforests are not necessarily as natural or pristine or virgin ie untouched by human history as you have been mis led to believe i guess i was making a reference to natural selection people who are irresponsible and weed themselves out of the gene pool not necessarily in fact one could argue that people who are responsible via them being responsible will reproduce less and be overwhelmed by the sheer quantity of offspring of the irresponsible nature does not share your preference for quality over quantity and in fact the quantity strategy of reproduction is far more common than the quality strategy despite the inane claims of many progressives and the beliefs of many others largely based on a complete misunderstanding of the poorly worded phrase survival of the fittest natural selection is not in fact teleological in fact it really does not give a shit if anything survives and looking backwards with a teleological view is simply to engage in a very gross survival bias fallacy ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, have any of you gone through a big crisis like this and if so what helped you get through it the realization that regardless of family friends i was like everyone else will ultimately be at some time or another really alone and on my own in this world but that that can be a good and wonderful thing rather than a depressing one that i needed to make my own way in life and learn to endure through the various shitstorms to experience the periods of pure joy that will also be found at points in time in my life but of course to do that i had to still be alive and be open to seeing those things which one cannot do when you are curled up in a ball in some corner having a self pity party you want some concrete recommendation ok ggo fetch a book or two about some man or more likely boy who has somehow or another become a castaway lost somewhere unlikely to be rescued bereft of comforts bereft of supplies and even of any friend to help them such a person invariably and truly does through a major and deep stage of depression where suicidal thoughts and even multiple attempts are not uncommon but nevertheless in learning how to survive one learns the real reason and purpose of life which is the living of it there are quite a few such stories whether it is the classic robinson crusoe or the true life story of the man that character was based on alexander selkirk and most of those are in the public domain available for free in a variety of formats at project gutenberg other online resources but of course many of those are written in a language and style that make for rather difficult reading to us and the world that they came from prior to being castaway well it is not exactly related to the modern world we live in which is why i would recommend instead a much more recent book actually series of books written in modern english about a modern character from our present or recent past world the brian saga series by gary paulsen about a boy who becomes lost and castaway in the middle of the canadian backwoods and particularly relevant to you and your state of mind will be the first book in that series entitled simply hatchet https www amazon com hatchet gary paulsen dp 1416936475 i mean seriously it a relatively cheap book even if you are nearly broke you can probably afford to buy the kindle copy and if you do not have a kindle you can use the kindle reader on any computer and you obviously have some kind of a computer else you could not post here right plus most likely your local public library will have a copy you could borrow for free i dare you no i double dog dare you or anyone really to read that book and not be better off for it and besides before you off yourself well is not reading one little fiction story worth a try helluva lot less expensive painful or awkward than going through counseling or getting prescriptions for a bunch of mind mood altering drugs not to mention the side effects ,9,MGTOW
DWShimoda, but imagine a different world everybody is trying to make it from cradle to grave with the fewest number of partners so you are very picky about who you fuck sure any average chick could pull a chad once but unless she only wants to have sex a handful of times in her life a chad hookup is not worth it she going to have to sort herself down to somebody on her own level if she wants to have anything lasting you mean sort of like a world without antibiotics or more correctly perhaps where antibiotics and antivirals have been rendered almost entirely ineffective against sti because that world is not really all that imaginary it already well on it way resistant strains of many sti are already becoming more increasingly common and if things continue as they have the past few decades ie expanded global travel and global whoring around it more than likely will probably be the general state of things within less than a century ,2,MGTOW
DWShimoda, the only 100 reliable method of avoiding stis is total abstinence not really true any couple that remains truly monogamous can engage in as much sex as they want with each other and yet entirely avoid sti you could argue that for the individual that is less than the 100 reliability of abstinence since each spouse must trust and are ultimately dependent upon the faithfulness of the other also one could object that total abstinence is not necessary just abstinence from direct intimate physical contact sexual activity with other humans meaning that any all forms of masturbation phone sex video chat sex virtual reality sex and or sex with some animated doll robot etc will all be 100 reliable methods of avoiding sti and given to be bluntly honest how such things tend to end up being the vast majority of orgasmic events across the lifetime of most people married single divorced etc well it seems to be a bit ridiculous to pretend it is not part of the solution but as for his part in a way it just nature evening out the population we have too many people on this planet as it is if this leads to a decline in the population then maybe it will take some stress off of the planet nah nature does not give a shit about how many humans here are anymore that it cares how many snakes or worms or ants or bacteria there are moreover the planet certainly does not experience stress as a result of any or all species the only entities than can and will care about how many people there are are other people ,2,MGTOW
DWShimoda, the downside is that the harpy is just going to escalate her attacks against him until someone breaks well she already been out whoring around and they no longer sleep together judges were told that mrs owens had an affair which lasted less than a year and the court heard the couple who have grown up children slept in different rooms seems to me her main reason for wanting the divorce is that she wants the cash prizes and most likely the reason he does not want the divorce is because it would undoubtedly mean a sale of his home forcing him to go through all of the bullshit associated with moving etc and at 78 years old he does not want to do that cannot say i blame him as i noted above i would be willing to bet you that if the judge offered to grant her the divorce but it was without and division of marital assets then she would not want it any longer ,5,MGTOW

DWShimoda, this report was done in response to the people that say marriage is bad for men and we wanted to show that married men are happier than single men wolfinger said it shows repeatedly that these myths are not true that one sentence is all that is really necessary to discredit the entire report when a so called study starts with a foregone conclusion then everything about it is entirely worthless also this part wolfinger collaborator and conductor of the study said the report was done as a response to the online movement men going their own way that says marriage is bad for men this movement has an online presence that supports the idea of men rejecting marriage and rejecting women altogether claiming that marriage is too expensive and women will take away time and energy from men is really rather hilarious i mean seriously the subscriber count here is what just barely over 20 000 and a lot of those are almost certain not really single mgtow guys the point being though that the number is trivial pick just about any random subreddit no matter how inane and it probably has a higher subscriber count moreover r mgtow is probably one of the larger mgtow forums so why all of the overblown anxiety and concern well first of all because they are a bunch of cucks secondly because they wrongly think this is a movement rather than a phenomenon they foolishly think this is a matter of us proselytizing rather than the reality that most young men are doing the math and figuring this out on their own that it is not really about us preaching the mgtow message but rather about feminism the system having overreached having subverted and undermined marriage so far that the inevitable backlash is now begun and their report will be about as effective and walking into the water and trying to push a tide back ,2,MGTOW

DWShimoda, it a common tactic with women to accused a man of being gay they do it to try and discourage you hanging out with friends or pursuing your own interests and hobbies basically if you do anything outside of obsequiously doing what a woman wants or do not include them in an activity you will see the tactic used it also a defense mechanism used by virtually every woman whenever any especially still single male does not seem to be interested in them they cannot imagine nor abide even the idea that they are not desirable they have to deflect that and the easiest way to do so is to label the guy as well he must be gay then ,2,MGTOW

DWShimoda, and are trying to shame him into becoming slobs like themselves under the cover of encouraging him to do something positive such as getting a girlfriend actually they are subconsciously angry that he is spending his resources on himself and trying to shame him into providing resources time money to one of their own for more on that mentality go read one of dalrock several review analysis commentaries on things like the so called christian churchian film fireproof https dalrock wordpress com 2011 12 03 husbands submit yourselves to your wives where the chief point of contention is the guy in this case already married husband saving up for a boat which of course offends the woman because said money male created resource is not being lavished on her how dare he and nevermind that she already a ridiculously spoiled bitch with every possible comfort and luxury ridiculously large home fancy furniture every appliance imaginable brand new cars etc also nevermind that she has her own job the fruits of which are apparently not marital property nor family property but exclusively her money thus the modern female financial formula what is hers is hers and what is his should be hers too one way or another see the entirely insatiable female need for validation especially as expressed by the modern materialistic woman made even worse via incessant advertising marketing and facilitated by ez availability of credit debt aka buy now pay later virtually requires her to feel that she is being endlessly perpetually courted https dalrock wordpress com 2011 10 20 the endless courtship fantasy by men special snowflake princess deserves entire kingdoms from men and if when they do not provide it they are oppressing her and or other women and that of course means they any men all men need to be shamed or otherwise manipulated by collective feminine tribe into changing their ways ,3,MGTOW
DWShimoda, but you are missing the aspect of the enemy from within no i am not missing that nor am i dismissing it i just did not address it directly within that particular already rather long comment immigrants are already out birthing the average westerner muslims have 4 6 children whereas westeners average 1 2 yes this is true and that is a becoming big big problem in certain parts of europe particularly western europe france uk and to a lesser extent germany the mediterranean peninsula countries those regions may in fact succumb though imo all hope is not yet lost since the muslims are heavily concentrated in urban enclaves which are by definition highly vulnerable it is at present a significantly lesser problem in the new world and i think that whatever happens in europe ie either europe switching to perform a reconquista 2 0 or else succumbing and thus lots of whites fleeing will almost certainly prove the death knell to the kind of crap represented by this canada wants to pass a motion this week that forbids criticizing islam under a new anti islamophobia law this is the beginning of shariah law in canada you see much like the whole blm idiocy no fractional minority will ever be able to effectively threaten to use and push it anarchic chaos out onto the larger wider population blacktivists can spew all the bluff bullshit they want about taking the fight to the suburbs but they dare not actually try it if and when they do the grassroots civil war backlash that is likely to occur will not result in some mere decimation pacification subjugation of their urban enclave populations but rather it will be isolation starvation and eradication why because those densely populated minority enclaves are entirely and parasitically dependent upon the surrounding countryside and modern infrastructure supply chains the residents have essentially zero productive value and the reason that will be their ultimate doom is that it also means they have virtually zero control over or independent resources or skills they literally cannot survive or subsist for more than a few days if subjected to the least siege or embargo usually simply a matter of blocking or destroying one or two arterial access corridors and in many cases just a few bridges over rivers or bays everything the urban populations needs comes from outside and is generally controlled from outside it not even a matter of food or ammunition of which the cities will quickly become deserts w o resupply made worse by panic hoarding looting rioting destruction of what supplies do exist but rather of the basic more immediate needs of the even more fundamental things like water energy disable the electric grid and cities become dark cold tombs cut off the city water system and they become literally dry dehydration deserts and all too quickly epidemic disease infested death zones to that last people have to shit piss somewhere absent a functional sewer system dependent upon a city water supply and often electric pumps they are faced with two choices 1 defecate urinate inside their homes quickly rendering them virtually uninhabitable or 2 try to do so outside but alas given the density of the population on the sparse land that is not likely to be much better moreover it will quickly end up running off and polluting local rivers streams and lakeshore areas the very places that the residents will be forced to attempt to obtain their drinking cooking bathing water again in the absence of piped in city water moreover while you might protest and validly so that plenty of large populations have and do manage to live in circumstances as bad or worse than that in many third world locations what you are forgetting is that those populations have been living in that state for generations their bodies and immune systems are habituated to such an onslaught the populations of western urban cities are not and the disease need not be the major hard to treat fatal epidemic things like cholera and tuberculosis things that are relatively mundane like the various types bacterial amoebic of diarrheac dysentery are more than sufficient to both debilitate dehydrate and even kill off major numbers of people the treatment cure for which is relatively simple keep people hydrated but therein lies the problem in such a scenario an adequate supply of clean potable water is the exact thing that is lacking meanwhile out in the suburbs exurbs and rural areas none of those things apply certainly not in anything like as an acute manner as they do in the cities the population is spread out is usually better stocked up if only because the distance to resupply makes it more convenient to keep a full larder supplies of fuel and water are much more readily available and less likely to be depleted or become damaged or diseased etc in addition again because they are almost by definition often required to be more independent in terms of resources vehicles private wells larger lots extra gasoline on hand to run various utility and toy vehicles like atv boats garden tractors lawnmowers snowblowers etc not to mention a penchant for things like hunting camping barbequing or even fireplaces campfires probably mean some supplies of charcoal wood ammunition guns tents dried or canned goods etc etc and that is not to mention the tendency increasing of rural types to be somewhat paranoid and into prepping etc which is done on a distinctly different more self sustaining pattern model than the urban bunker safe room mindset in the battle between countryside vs city the cities always become death traps and yet the very parasitic nature of the muslim immigrants dependence on state central society resources to support their rapidly increasing numbers along with the desire to maintain a tight knit controlled community and especially the penchant to implement things like sharia which requires a dense majority in an enclave renders them supremely vulnerable in any major domestic civil conflict in short they are only allowed to exist on a combination of sufferance tolerance and a sort of indifference all of which only continue so long as the more problematic issues are kept corralled within the cities to wit white suburbs are not safe and clean well ordered places that are relatively crime free because there is something magical about the dirt it is that the people maintain it that way ,2,MGTOW
DWShimoda, what it means is that islamist countries will beat feminist countries not necessarily the big problem with the muslim world is that it can no longer feed itself that is the populations of islamic countries especially the dry regions of arabic african nations have vastly outpaced their domestic agricultural capacity the past several generations have been sustained on huge quantities of imported base foods sadly that is not as obvious or easy to see within much less prove or even point out in the trade data because while virtually all countries both export and import food the trade data is invariably recorded in dollars or other currency units then equated to dollars and so while a country may appear to import as much as they export the reality is they may be exporting relatively small quantities of high value goods say coffee exotic fruits etc while importing large quantities of basic foodstuffs grains rice wheat corn and of course other with other countries it will be the opposite thus the inability to self sustain is obfuscated by the differential trade value to wit the people in the usa and canada will not starve if they are deprived of apricots bananas cocoa coffee beans or kiwi fruit they might feel a bit deprived but they are not going to starve otoh the population of egypt if deprived of imported wheat would be hard put to it to survive eating the excess domestic cotton and there is another very basic fundamental thing at play some foodstuffs particularly grains like corn rice wheat etc are relatively easy to store in bulk both short and long term that means excess production can be saved up to endure things like droughts famine disruptions in trade wars etc and moreover grains can also be stored on the hoof excess production can also be shifted from export and instead used to feed or fatten or finish cattle provided of course that you have the appropriate land and water to be able to sustain a significant increase in herd size again dry desert is not exactly well suited to the task many other foodstuffs particularly the almost by definition higher trade value specialty foods like fruits and especially things like bananas have a very very short shelf life in their natural state and moreover are generally impractical to store virtually impossible on a large scale at least without significant investment prior planning iow while you can slice dry bananas into banana chips https en wikipedia org wiki banana chip and even turn that into banana powder https en wikipedia org wiki banana powder it a labor capital intensive process ergo if trade gets disrupted say by some war or embargo you are not going to be able to switch over from making regular daily shipments of boatloads of fresh green bananas to making banana chips powder end result of that is that equatorial and tropical lands while able to support rather large dense populations are also more likely to have rather fragile agricultural systems that is their populations are more likely to increase to the point where they are skirting the edge of disaster and quite frankly the more faster global trade facilitates an increase in their populations again via export of short shelf life high value products and conversely the mass import of durable base foodstuffs the more vulnerable they become you also need to remember that the chief causes of deaths during wars is generally not people killed directly by weapons but rather people who die indirectly as a result of disruption of trade destruction of basic infrastructure and finally mostly by disease to wit vastly more people died during after wwii due to malnutrition starvation disease than died from all of the bombs bullets ergo the destiny of most of the masses of people in muslim countries around the world is neither emigration to the west no matter how many attempt it much less how many succeed it wo not even put a minor dent in the base population growth nor will it be death in any war foreign or domestic civil war but rather death from dehydration malnutrition starvation disease iow malthus will eventually be proven largely correct that certain technological discoveries and inventions allowed a delay deferral of his doomsday predictions is not the same as disproving his base assumptions it just bumped the inevitable out further and it is not that they have not been expanding or improving their agricultural output because they have it just that 1 population growth has been even faster larger 2 the land is not necessarily well suited to the mass production of basic grains ie it hard to grow rise in a desert and 3 the trade value of other specialty foods agricultural products is higher ie the same land which can grow 1 million worth of say apricots which will allow you to buy 1 million worth of wheat well even if you cut down all those apricot trees you are never going to grow 1 million of wheat on the same land and then finally well dutch disease https en wikipedia org wiki dutch disease export of other resources like oil enable the purchase of lots of imported basic foodstuffs ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda,also of interest how many times have americans been married by age http overflow solutions demographic data age distributions how many times have americans been married by age in other words that green married category is not entirely got married stayed married of course within the married multiple times not everyone is as a result of divorce some increasing as you get to the higher age ranges duh but still relatively trivial are due to death of prior spouse also big caveat when looking at this data this is not tracking the same people as they age this is snapshot data about people who were born in year x xx years prior to 2015 so when you look at the data on 69 year olds you are looking at the first birth year spike in the post wwii baby boomer generation ie people born in 1946 ie current marital status at time of data survey married ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, this is a huge comment yeah i tend to do that sorry and i read the whole thing well nice to know someone did lol thank you for that well put information sir you have learned me a good one today you are welcome probably one of the best pieces of advice i ever got was to make a spreadsheet of the full loan amortization one row per month with a cell for optional additional principal payment on each line allows you to vary the amount if you make some odd or lump payment but of course you can also play a whole range of what if games with some flood fill of minor amounts and it rather amazing what paying even an extra 20 or 50 or 100 per month can do in terms of reducing the total end cost and shortening the payoff date for one good example see here https sites google com site spreadsheets spreadsheet categories financial sheets mortgage amortization with paydown once you get the hang of how it created you really do not need a template you can recreate such a spreadsheet on a whim and keep in mind you do not have to already have a mortgage to do the playing around with it i made the spreadsheets and played around with them for a good couple of years before buying a house lots of what if games helped me figure out just how much of a loan i wanted to take out since one of my goals was to be able to pay the place off in about a decade i ended up actually doing better than that paying it off in 8 years and really had i wanted to i probably could have paid it off in about 6 years i just decided that i wanted to build the workshop etc btw spreadsheet works the other way around too that is you can use it to track and see how some savings or retirement account is growing and will might grow though of course predicting future increase is a bit more dubious since returns are generally not as predictable or steady on a larger note it a really really good idea to learn how to prepare update financial statement things like a balance sheet ie assets vs liabilities and to maintain one for your personal finances makes it a lot easier to see progress towards your goals in terms of actual net worth and of course properly used it also helps you discipline yourself to not squander money ,4,MGTOW
DWShimoda, what they dont tell you within the pic is how many are engineer scientists and they will never tell you yup i have seen this with many different engineering tech operations every woman available is pulled in even if it their day off for the pr pictures to prove how women in tech is a thing at the abcd engineering company at one place i worked that included the three secretaries erm i meant documentation specialists who work part time as a job share at one position which is basically making stapling photocopies plus the two cad technician assistants interns still working on their associates degree at the local community college presuming they do not drop out or get pregnant before they graduate like the pair that were there the previous year did and then of course there are the four women who are on the qa team they are all labeled as working in the engineering department at least that what the org chart says but none of them are actually engineers not even the head of the qa team the so called qa engineer gal who just has a certificate from some 6 or 8 week course in six sigma crap i suppose technically she does have a bs degree but iirc it in oceanography and since jobs in that field are not exactly plentiful especially in the midwestern us well you know still when they are all standing there in the group photo alongside or actually in front of the 6 actual engineers all men it makes it look like the company is really proactive in hiring women to work in tech ,2,MGTOW
DWShimoda, yeah i have been saving for a few years now and continue tuck away money into a comfortable rainy day fund and or something i have not anticipated yet fund obviously the more i can pay in a downpayment and the more gets paid towards principle the faster i get to own the home outright and the less has to be paid out in interest overall yup interestingly enough i just now finished writing up saving one of my detailed comments on exactly that over in another thread https www reddit com r mgtow comments 5tuptr success down payment accepted and loan approved ddptagu btw key point that most people do not realize is that if you can do 20 or greater downpayment you eliminate pmi and you usually eliminate the need for escrow of property tax insurance as well that is instead of having to pay extra into the bank each month and then have them cut a check at the end of the year you take on responsibility for saving up your property tax homeowners insurance hellz yeah i am a machine operator and i often have periods during the day when a machine is running through its program which gives me a bit of time to daydream and think about stuff i cannot read a book or pull up reddit but thinking about something i have already read or looked at pictures or even stand up comedy routines or yt videos etc ah then you will love this book it perfect for that kind of a thing in addition to the front history of cottages and the back cottage design chapters there are like 30 separate houses profiled in the middle of the book each house getting somewhere between 4 to 8 pages so it the kind of book you can easily consume in little bits and pieces during breaks lunchtime etc and as i noted you can approach each house either as just look at the pictures or read the text about or read the text while examining the pictures ie flipping back forth to the bits he describing etc purchased for less than 5 dollars from amazon if the pictures are even half as interesting as i am thinking they will be from your description it will be worth and if i am truly inspired it will be worth much much more cool yeah at that price you definitely will not be disappointed btw it a taunton press book ie they are the publisher of like fine woodworking magazine etc so they use really good quality coated calendered paper and high resolution like better than national geographic quality full color offset printing etc y know i never thought about it like that but now that you have made the connection it makes perfect sense while i would like to expatriate some day that probably will not be for many years which as you pointed out really makes the under water scenario mostly irrelevant yeah people get themselves all worked up over that and i have never understood why i mean say especially after the housing bubble burst circa 2007 2008 2009 and a lot of houses were selling cheap they would be all concerned about the fact that their house valuation had dropped but then i would ask them were you really thinking of selling your house now like this year and most of them would say no and then they would often add that they are not really expecting to sell or refinance at all like ever or at least not for several years in which case they were getting worked up stressed about something that did not matter that would not matter to them by the time they do sell well it could be 10 15 years from now and who the hell can know what anything will be like then hint they cannot anything that far out in the future is a total crapshoot i mean like in my case i bought back at the tail end of 2000 when i was in my mid 30 and sick and tired of renting and especially of not having a garage a real workshop i figured that i would be staying here in this house for at least a full decade well it 16 going on 17 years now and quite frankly i still cannot see myself selling the place anytime soon maybe a decade from now i doubt that but of course shit happens so who knows at this point i am not exactly sure what i want to do for living situation in the long term i have considered expatriation vandwelling average joe home ownership and i believe it was u s0ma 6 that made a post a while back about living in a shipping container off grid with a dual solar wind electric setup and then occasionally u ss camaro 2 posts the lifestyle type posts with examples of guys living in cabins or tiny homes or earthships or treehouses yeah lol i always get a kick out of the whole off grid thing i mean i get the psychological appeal ie it free energy and the stick it to the man stuff etc but when i look at the finances of it well i have to laugh at how rather absurd the off grid equation is i mean i have a modest sized house my utility bills average about 100 per month that natural gas heat plus electric light and service fees etc winter months can be as high as 175 but summer months are well under 100 so aggregate total is about 1 200 per year average is about 100 give or take 5 a month in a given year that peanuts and definitely not worth trying to invest some 25 000 in infrastructure for some combination of solar wind that will likely not last 20 years and will need annual maintenance occasional repair in between i mean heck my grocery bill is more than that about twice that and that living alone doing all the meals at home and feeding one person albeit fairly well steaks chops roasts chickens etc plus of course off grid usually means really far out of town which means more money spent on vehicles driving back and forth as well as things like propane which is the proverbial dirty little secret that most off grid homes need use but do not like to talk about ie their fridge is propane etc ok so here a question what is your opinion on buying a house or perhaps some land and a new double wide trailor with a couple guy friends me and two friends have half joked half seriously talked about a rat pack bachelor pad type setup with the goal of paying off the property asap and then either renting it out for residual income or selling it and upgrading to another place the ownership would be managed either by forming an llc or sole ownership with private contracts detailing a cut of any profits made from rental or sale commensurate with the percentage of the principle paid per person so if one of us pays only 10 of the principle they are only getting 10 from the rent sale etc this is largely hypothetical we would definitely consult a lawyer first to find which is the best solution what is your thoughts personally well i would not want to make a bet on that working out in my experience the law of relativity business applies that is never go into business with a relative or a friend or a relative of a friend or a friend of a relative lol it very seldom works out anything even close to the plan and real estate deals with multiple owners are always fraught with problems the more people involved the greater the risk plus as far as mgtow bachelor friends well you can be pretty sure that within the minimal time span that you want to own a property that is 5 years at least one of the three will probably end up married the more practical time span of 10 years and it almost a certainty that at least one will get married and quite probably divorced as well which just opens up a whole shitload of problems a better solution would be for one of you to buy own and the others rent lease from him at rate that is somewhat discounted so that they too get some of the benefit albeit less than the owner since he is taking the risk among other things that gives everyone an easy out ie you do standard 12 month rent lease contracts and have minor penalty provision in there for breaking the lease that way regardless of what happens in terms of marriages relationships etc there is a clear hierarchy of decision making a nice clean break and no muddled crap of who gets what share of gains etc because re is not as simple as x of principal who is bearing the cost of making payments interest is that being done on the same x what if someone is tight some month and the others have to make up their share what about maintenance and repair costs especially big stuff like the furnace or fridge needs to be replaced will joe be able to come up with his x in a timely fashion what happens if he cannot does not someone else probably already paid the full bill etc then does the fact that joe repainted the kitchen count at what hourly rate dave helped him a bit but not really you get what i am saying the whole thing can and often does very quickly become a quagmire and can easily turn nasty as in divorce style nasty and yeah even with guys who are great guys and who are or were really good friends add in girlfriends even non cohabit str and all bets are off see joe started dating tiffany and she a high maintenance chick makes joe finances rocky worse tiffany is a royal bitch and her bitchiness rubs off on joe he cannot pay an extra 200 towards the furnace because he and tiffany went to vegas and he blew his savings and besides tiffany thinks that joe has been getting a raw deal from you guys and ad nauseum if joe is a co owner you are all fucked but if joe renting then lease is up in 3 months and joe can go off with tiffany and leave you and dave the hell out of it those would be my thoughts ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, hopefully i can work my ass off and buy my way out of that one too key to paying a mortgage off fast and at significantly lower total cost is understanding how the typical flat payment self amortizing mortgage works http www engineeryourfinances com wp content uploads 2010 06 graph 1 png that is by design and no malice to create that uniform locked in flat standard monthly payment amount well during the early years your payments are going almost entirely to interest with very little paid off against the principal ergo every extra dollar you can pay off against the principal reduces the interest from there on out which means payments during the early years downpayment and or first couple of years significantly shortens the length of time it will take to pay off the loan to wit using a common what if extra payment mortgage calculator http www mortgagecalculator org calculators what if i pay more calculator php plug in your numbers i will pick simple ones as illustration say the house was 100k and you put 20 down ie 20k 20 avoids pmi and usually allows you to avoid escrow payments on the property tax meaning a main loan balance of 80k calculate that at say 5 interest over 30 years but with an extra 100 each month against principal meaning instead of making the standard payment of 429 46 you would pay 529 46 each month make sure you tag the extra 100 as against principal instead of taking 30 years that little extra 100 per month means the mortgage would be paid off in just under 20 years 19 yrs 11 mts and your total payments made over those 20 yrs would only be 126 454 70 rather than the 154 602 85 of the full 30 year loan saving you 28 148 15 one way to look at it is that every 100 extra you pay off the principle in the first year well on a 30 year mortgage you will not be paying interest let say 5 on that for the remaining 29 years and that would be 5 interest saved each year x 29 yrs 145 in interest cost you wo not incur so if in that first year you make pay an extra 100 per month 1 200 for the year against principal it will save you about 1 740 in interest over the life of the loan ie 60 x 29 crudely computed and that will basically mean chopping off the last 4 months of payments iow your mortgage would end at the 356th month 29 years 8 months instead of at the 360th payment 30 years do the same the second year and the benefits are slightly less you save 28 years of interest on the extra 1 200 or 1 680 in interest and cut off not quite 4 more months and so on which brings up a very important point extra principal payments in the early years say first second year of loan are much much more effective than those made later on say in year 5 or 10 or 15 that one reason why 20 downpayments are highly recommended and can make such a big difference in addition to eliminating pmi which is just a financial waste you are paying for insurance for the bank not you and with money that would be better spent against the principal to wit using the same basic as the above let say some sizable chunk of money say 10k fell into your lap in the first year of the mortgage some big bonus from work or whatever and you decided instead of piddly 100 extra payments per month you will just drop a lump payment of 10k against the principal what happens then this happens http i imgur com 0iwo5ny png that one 10k payment saves you over 25k in total interest and shortens this loan by almost 7 years 6 yrs 11 mths ie mortgage will be paid off at 23 yrs 1 month instead of 30 years say you do that two years in a row or maybe drop 20k against principal at the 2 year mark this is the result of that http i imgur com zqhyvtv png the mortgage will now be paid off at just past the 18 year point and you will save around 40k in total interest and keep in mind both of those are without any other prepayment of principle ie no extra 50 per month they are just the single lump sum dropped want to play with lump sum extra principle payments here one calculator that lets you do that https www mortgagechoice com au home loans calculators lump sum payments calculator aspx personally i prefer to use a spreadsheet and set up multiple columns with a row for each month that allows more flexibility for various extra payments per month per year etc than the pre defined calculators do note i used a combination of the above methods during just the first 3 years of my mortgage i made both extra monthly payments of varying amounts against principal and at then end of year used my bonuses to make big extra lump payments to reduce the principal and then from year 4 onward i reverted to making just the standard payment yet i paid off my mortgage in 8 years so instead of 30 years of interest on the full original principal i only paid interest for 8 years and then for most of that time on a much much lower balance iow the mortgage really did not end up costing me much in term of total interest the banksters did not make very much off of me and of course once the place is paid off ie no more mortgage payments well all that has been left the past 8 years now is the comparatively trivial property taxes and utilities by year 4 i would knocked the principal down far enough that i knew i would be able to pay the house off in just a couple of more years so the following years i took my extra income bonus money and did other things made stock market investments did some remodeling on the house deck insulated the garage and installed a garage heater built a workshop addition off the side bought various woodworking tools plus got a new used truck ie new to me etc sidebar refuting the objection to prepaying but but but what about the opportunity cost of that bonus money you used to pay off the principal i mean you might have invested it in the stock market and made a bigger return ayah key operative word there is might i might have maybe possibly made x in gains or than again especially given the crash that happened in 2008 i might have bought a lot of stocks at inflated prices and then suffered a major loss and been a bag holder waiting for the prices to come back up again look at it this way i was contracted to pay x of interest on a certain amount of money that was a very real long term liability there was no might maybe possibly about it it was definite and what is more in my case it was a hefty 8 apr because that was the best rate available when i bought back in late 2000 so paying down the balance was like getting a 100 guaranteed return of 8 across a 20 to 30 year time frame and i do not know of any other investment that can guarantee me that sure i could have refinanced to a lower rate a few years later but they charge fees to refinance and every time i calculated it out well i was better off putting that refinance fee as a payment against the principal instead of trying to get a lower rate on a quickly dropping loan balance plus i did do some investing after year 4 i channeled some money into the markets and wisely was able to get out at near the peak before the crash and then bottom feed my way back in a year later for some sweet gains and of course i was also plugging some money into a 401k at work and profit sharing went into that too so i was really only putting part of my extra resources against the mortgage and then only for a couple of years besides in my opinion the whole opportunity cost argument is one that people use in a very selective manner that is they use it as an argument that justifies their own indenture ie not paying off debt ever notice that the people who make use the opportunity cost argument really do not do all that much actual investing instead they are rat race people the kind who have to drive brand new financed leased cars who have to live in oversized houses ie they borrow as much as they can to buy as big of a house as possible etc and think nothing at all about blowing 10 or more a day at starbucks for a cup of colored flavored sweetened water that would cost about 30 cents if brewed at home why are not they concerned about the opportunity cost of that 10 per day at starbucks multiply it out at just 200 workdays per year and that 2 000 they could have invested but they do not see that as the same thing go figure seriously go figure as in do the maths lol ,24,MGTOW
DWShimoda, thanks again i am not done reading the essays i have been busy and there a lot to chew on there i see exactly what he trying to say about indoctrination through implied context that a slippery slope right there yes as with a lot of other stuff relative to philosophy issues you sort of need to have a distraction free time to really quiet the mind so that you can engage deeper thought processes and really chew on it digest it otherwise all too easily one just finds that you have read the words but really not caught the ideas and have to back up a page or two re read etc moreover in these essays in particular he often talking to several different i guess you could say levels on that slippery slope downward spiral and yeah you have got it slipping in a kind of indoctrination that shapes people ways of thinking at a very fundamental abstract level but doing so in a context where their guard is completely down and or they are too young to comprehend how to critically appraise such things one reason i say i am not religious is that i do not trust churches i have only ever seen leaders seeking money and power and women jockeying for position in the social pecking order everyone more worried about the next fundraiser than anyone spiritual development perhaps there are better examples out there but my experiences have left me wary of anything organized cannot disagree with anything you have said there in fact i would probably go a lot further imo the modern churches have become at least as corrupt and perverse as the pharisees and sadducees were in the day when christ upbraided and rebuked them calling them whitewashed tombs and a pit of vipers i have virtually zero use for any organized church and even less use for the vast majority of clergy most of whom regardless of how they may have begun have essentially just used the system as a cash cow and a means to build a career seeking both money and status ambition and avarice but i make a distinction between religion especially formal organized and faith i suppose some would say spirituality but that word has been too tainted by the new age crapfest that said i think there is great value to exploring these topics for those who would like to try to expand their understanding perhaps there is not much we can do to alter the current state of affairs but there may be some peace to be found on an individual level and welcome support between like minded individuals i would join a mgtow theology subreddit if there were such a thing until then i will just keep reading indeed and such was the spirit if you will that i made the suggestion i am not trying to lead mgtow men to go back to some tradcon church plantation that imo would be a travesty rather the opposite i would that mgtow men should continue on a path to true enlightenment to the way which lead to true freedom which in my understanding ironic as it may seem requires a rejection of both modern and i suppose much traditional religion as well as the modern post modern secular and so called scientific mindset at least as the latter is commonly somewhat arrogantly defined and i think lewis aims along the same path in that series of essays showing the ultimate dangers perils of the secular wisdom so called and the modernists rejection of the tao i do think there is another possible humble path of the scientific mind cf richard feynman et al which acknowledges and admits to the limitations and does not try to negate or supplant the tao which is fundamentally entirely different from the arrogance of say a richard dawkins and his fellows ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, because i definitly do not want to be holding the mortgage for a 200k home that only worth 150 the thing is that much like with stocks the only prices or valuations that really matter regarding a home are 1 the price on the date that you buy and 2 the price on the date that you sell 3 will that price allow you pay off the debts and then to swap into some other house that has similar utility value everything else all of the in between prices are just noise what i mean is assuming you are wise about your housing that is you buy a place with the full intention of holding onto it for decades and paying off the mortgage asap and so by definition you are not flipping homes nor are you playing foolish house atm games via heloc refinance and take equity out to pay for toys vacations and other leveraging financial shenanigans well then if you bought a place for say 160k some bubblicious crap happens and it valuation zooms up to 500k then the bubble bursts and it crashes back down to 100k but a decade later it all levels back out and by the time say 20 years hence you decide to sell it has settled back to some 160k minor inflation adjust across those decades well all of those in between valuation fluctuations are entirely irrelevant to you as for the whole underwater thing while that certainly was a very real problem for people who bought at or near the peak of the housing bubble it was generally mainly a problem for people who were idiots ie house flippers and or people who thought the zero money down was a great idea what you need to realize is that for essentially any all financed things you are going to be underwater for the first x years that is due to the transaction costs of buying selling along with the loan origination fees the interest paid on the initial high loan principal during the first few years cf any graph of interest vs principal on a self amortizing loan mortgage http www engineeryourfinances com wp content uploads 2010 06 graph 1 png ie any loan with a flat payment across multiple years decades pretty much every home is technically a net loss scenario aka underwater during the first 5 years and possibly first 10 years of ownership iow unless there is some bubble going on and you sell before it bursts the general rule is that if you buy a place and then sell it less than 5 years later you are going to be going backwards financially if you invested a hefty downpayment you are probably not going to get it all back out you are going to suffer a net loss and of course if you did not put anything down well you still suffer a net loss it just that you are going to still be in debt after the sale so really the whole underwater mortgage thing was almost entirely a result of people buying places with zero money down or people who pulled all or nearly all of their bubble inflated valuation equity out via refinancing same thing really that why they got stuck locked in and unable to sell etc say you bought some small place for 100k a decade or so before the bubble and during the peak bubble years you were able to sell it for 500k wow look at the massive gains right well yes and no after all you still need a place to live so you sold your place for 500k and on paper you gained 400k but you now have nowhere to live what if every other similar house is also priced at 500k what if rentals are also ridiculously high what did you really gain the main way you could have truly gained out of that equation is if you sold in one local inflated price bubble area and then moved some substantial distance away probably to another state or country and bought a home in some depressed price region but were you really likely to do that that not just selling it moving which probably also means for most people a change of jobs etc and lest you think the above is some ridiculous scenario i worked with a guy who experienced almost exactly that he would bought this little run down hobby farm place in circa 2002 2003 and got it cheap right around 100k three years later he was able to sell it for 500k w o really doing a damned thing to improve the place i think he painted the barn walked away with almost 400k of capital gain in his pocket give or take a few grand taxes transaction etc figured he was set for life right so he quit his job and moved to arizona where he ahem invested about 200k half of his 400k as downpayments on a bunch of brand new houses in the phoenix burbs ie he was going to become a re magnate flipping houses and or renting them for a profit oh and then he stuck the rest of the 400k into the stock market oops 2008 came along and it all crashed he ended up selling of most of his stocks at bottom prices in order to keep up payments on the houses which he was not able to do for long and he eventually lost all of them to foreclosure last i heard he would declared bankruptcy and was back to working full time at a shit job he hates and living in some rental same guy told me i was an idiot back in circa 2005 2006 because i had just about paid off my home mortgage and owned it debt free see i was missing out on the chance to get rich by flipping leveraging etc btw i have lived a life of comfort ease for the past decade and with prospects of being able to continue to do so for the decades to come because i retired early based on savings and zero debt all assets including home vehicles paid off and low cost living combined with side business minimal effort or time and a bit of passive income so who the idiot again ayah life pro tip if and when anyone is soo desperate to sell you something or get you to sign here on some long term contract does not really matter what it is whether it a house or a car or a cell phone or stock or whatever that they will extend you ridiculous amounts of credit with zero concern over your ability to repay it and so to allow you to buy into it with no skin in the game zero sacrifice investment by you then you need to check in the mirror because the word r e k c america is probably imprinted on your forehead better yet use two mirrors that way you can see more clearly that the word is s u c k e r because chances are they are playing you for a fool they are making money off of the transaction the churn and generally all of the explanations they give you as to why it is a great idea for you to buy sign here right now before you miss out etc are complete bullshit do not walk away from that run away from it ,2,MGTOW

DWShimoda, right but it still does not make sense for the parents to be in love with each other to protect the offspring well as you noted you were talking about romantic love and i take it that in love means the same thing to you ie romantically infatuated nature may use that but really does not care about it and across most of history until basically the 19th century when the romantic movement was enabled by the industrial era affluence and idleness the idea of romantic love was seen as foolishness not a sound basis for a family if anything they should be more enamoured with the offspring than with each other the father should be able to protect the offspring from the mother should she go batshit as well as she from him not certain that enamored with is wording i would choose probably more concerned about would be more apropos but i agree with the general sentiment so yes that is what we would be talking about it what would very likely have naturally evolved and keep in mind that historical social construct and here we are talking not tradcon as in the 1950 stuff but rather the much older historical norms as a real patriarchal system and the offspring of those who were entirely unconcerned about their offspring who did the hit and run so to speak well those children illegitimate literally bastards etc were quite likely to and most commonly did die long before reaching adulthood and reproducing in turn some few obviously did and depending on the abundance scarcity of resources food shelter etc of the local human population their numbers would wax and or wane accordingly ,1,MGTOW

DWShimoda, hey man this looks great i am definitely going to buy the book thank you for the recommendation kind of thought a few guys here might find it appealing keep in mind you might even find a copy cheap at a used bookstore these kinds of books well lots of people buy several of them and then half dozen years later sell off a whole boxful often in nearly pristine condition my personal fave is half price books not sure if they have those near you or not and of course actual inventory varies as i am aging into my late 20 this is something which has been on my mind the past few months home ownership a month or two ago at the bank i saw they will loan 200k 3 5 apr for 30 years 200 is a small 3 bedroom 1 bath in this area but a half hour south in more rural area it would buy a nicer place with a garage and shed for my projects and motorcycles yes lack of a garage and solid driveway as a place to not only store but work on maintain vehicles was one of the main drawbacks in my opinion experience to renting even the last place i rented prior to buying which was this nice little 2 br 1 ba standalone home even had an enclosed porch area that kinda sorta functioned as a workshop workroom washer dryer laundry was out there too but still working on a vehicle on a gravel driveway is a royal pain as is having to clean ice snow off in winter btw i strongly advise saving up so that you have enough to put at least 20 down better yet 25 and with several grand leftover as a cushion because there are invariably unexpected things that will crop up shortly after you buy a place also the key to paying off a home fast is bigger upfront payments the early years i am just not certain that what i really want y know like a remnant of the white fence fantasy hopefully i will get a bit of inspiration from the book well that the thing i really like about this particular book as opposed to say the not so big house aka nsbh series which i also have because while there are some nice ideas and decent text in the nsbh books tolpin new cottage home has just a much wider array of home styles locations and i am talking wide array in terms of everything from size there are houses in the book that are basically just one big open room others that are more traditional to a variety of layouts number of stories to well even number of buildings there are even a few that he calls cottage cluster structures a series of small separate buildings with little walkways in between some covered sheltered some open ie one structure being like a main kitchen dining room another being a bedroom w study a third being a guest bedroom and a final being a workshop etc obviously an arrangement that could be built expanded over time point is that it really gives you some fodder to ponder on let you day dream in the good pragmatic what if sense sort of like trying on an outfit before you buy it so to speak on one style of place and then a few pages later on something that entirely different and you go hmmm than again like i said if nothing else it can be a relatively cheap bit of entertainment i mean just flipping through the book and looking at each of the various pictures layouts ie entirely ignoring the main body text can be a pleasant way to burn up a whole evening or two and then going back and reading pondering the text around each of the home types etc well depending on how much you stop and think while reading could easily consume multiple evenings over the course of a few weeks or even a few months it kind of weird because even though i would done all of that 20 years ago i ended up doing it all over again the past few days nights after i ran across it in that box it was like getting together with an old friend again and i was surprised at just how much was packed into that book including a lot of things that felt like they were new to me even though i know i would read looked at them before and must i have just forgotten about over 2 decades not to dump on the nsbh series because they are well done nice photography good quality printing etc and fairly interesting too especially the first one in the series but they are also a bit pushy in terms of agenda and almost too much single theme so to get the same level of varying content as is found in tolpin book well you would probably need to buy multiple nsbh books and then imo you would still be missing some of the more unique elements that tolpin includes like the 20 page history of cottages at the front or the 20 design guide at the back btw i do not necessarily agree with all of his ideas but they are worth reading contemplating especially given the informal almost conversational tone that he writes with ,2,MGTOW

DWShimoda, duh after breeding mother nature is done with the both of you not really nature is not really done with the parents until their offspring either reach viable reproductive maturity as well or are at least until the offspring are either fully equipped and or numerous enough that a sufficient number will survive to reproduce in turn species of relatively low intelligence generally have the quantity approach to reproduction lots and lots of offspring with minimal and sometimes zero parental involvement species of the higher intelligence ranges generally follow more of a quality over quantity reproductive strategy few offspring with much more parental involvement and longer time to reach maturity moreover those aspects tend to go more or less in lockstep the higher the intelligence the fewer the offspring the more parental involvement and the longer it takes to reach successful reproductive maturity it is not intelligence alone the overall size of the animal is also a factor which may be different than ie require development beyond take longer than merely strictly sexual maturity this is especially true in humans where the peak fertility levels are often several years later than the base sexual maturity and this is probably and adaptive mechanism where survival of the offspring is probably a bit higher with parents that are several years beyond puberty ,1,MGTOW

DWShimoda, i am viewing all of the hierarchy as if it was entirely and only about power which is just as wrong and much the same thing there is in fact a kind of social hierarchy among humans that is based on merit skill talent intelligence knowledge and other people having respect for it valuing it and elevating it into a position of authority often despite the leaders very sincere humble and very real attempts to demur and back away from taking charge ie literally not wanting the power or the authority and load of responsibility that accompanies it where there is an amog that is a tried and true leader and where others follow and defer to that individual voluntarily because past experience has proven to them that is the wisest and even most optimal course of action or way for the group to work people who have never fully experienced that never really encountered a natural meritorious amog leader and or who bring their own baggage into situations where they do encounter such not only disbelieve in the possibility of that but will often not be able to see it or differentiate it from their own prior bad experiences where hierarchies were about domination power games sex status and etc so instead they will then fill in the gaps with imagined diabolical motives and often even invent little things create needless dramatic situations etc that then make that new experience fit their preconceived model usually casting themselves into the role of either aggrieved victim or alternately as savior of everyone else in the group from the leader they and they alone view as a tyrant thus introducing a power domination fight scenario where there was none previously and likely will be none after they are defeated and either expelled or otherwise forced to depart the group thus they reinforce their view that once again they have proved it is always corrupt problem is the real common denominator in all of their experiences of that is themselves and the fact that they are the ones playing the power dominance subversion games hint if you are having to cast back in history all the way to the 16th century and henry viii who history btw you have almost entirely wrong and which you seem to be only vaguely and superficially familiar with then chances are your model is a pretty shitty one ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, that just may be what happened earlier in her and her sister life i would think that only the mom dad and she and sister may be to only individuals who know the thing is that depending on when how and who engaged in the abuse it entirely possibly that she and her sister may not really know and i am not referring to the repressed false memory kind of thing but rather that the abuse may have occurred when they were toddlers that is when they were still so young the pre fully aware age range that normative long term memories are not really a thing to wit most people have only the fuzziest of recollections of events even from their early school years say kindergarten first second grade and i know several people who claim to not really remember anything at all from those age ranges ie say the family moved when they were in 3rd grade and while they know from things like family pictures that they lived somewhere else attended some previous school other than those pictures they have no active personal memories of the prior home school and it is fairly common for people to not remember much of anything prior to their school years from birth through ages 3 or 4 or even 5 they might have hints of things but it very easy to discount those via what you at later ages realize is normal behavior so there an internal nah that could not be what happened kind of thing and of course that same phenomenon then makes some people highly susceptible to suggestion of some therapist implanting a revised expanded version of that which may or may not have anything to do with what actually happened edit see even the wikipedia entry on https en wikipedia org wiki childhood memory development of memory in childhood childhood memories have several unique qualities the experimental psychologist and cognitive neuroscientist endel tulving refers to memory as mental time travel a process unique to humans however early memories are notoriously sparse from the perspective of an adult trying to recall his or her childhood in depth explicit knowledge of the world is a form of declarative memory which can be broken down further into semantic memory and episodic memory which encompasses both autobiographical memory and event memory most people have no memory prior to three years of age and few memories between three and six years of age as verified by analysis of the forgetting curve in adults recalling childhood memories 1 and the point being that while they might remember some traumatic experience ie unusual abnormal in their experience up to that point in time if it was a matter of ongoing and subtle covert abuse mommy fingering their pussy when changing diapers etc they vary likely would not have a clue because it would not be any more abnormal or traumatic and therefore no more memorable than the experience of having the diaper changed at the same time it would doubtless affect their perception of what was acceptable behavior and at a subconscious level edit 2 and as sick and unimaginable of an act as that kind of thing seems to all of us normal people it absolutely does occur it just that it rarely ever reaches the news and then only when it an extremely egregious case meaning of course that the lion share of such things are happening well below the radar the people who do it just do not talk about it and the r est of us cannot even imagine that it would happen how frequently is anyone guess to wit http www dailymail co uk news article 2296592 ashley nicole williams mother admitted molesting infant wanted know like molester instead molested html www huffingtonpost com 2014 01 03 natalie webb sexual abuse n 4536569 html http www dailymail co uk news article 2188333 mother 29 boyfriend 62 repeatedly raped baby birth 18 months old html,1,MGTOW

DWShimoda, it hard to tell she disclosed a lot to me of course whether what she disclosed was really true or not or else as you note with the sport team rape gang bang possibly rescripted in her mind well her sister was also very wild and displayed the same behavior drugs sex manipulation i would say the evidence mounts then it definitely a possibility that the mom was involved yeah either directly as the molester or else possibly even facilitating it sick as it is that the reality some people like to watch as children get molested abused and that too usually has some prior experience as a child root ,3,MGTOW
DWShimoda, i agree it important to have a vision even if it just a sketch and the details become apparent as time passes exactly and especially when people have lost discarded abandoned etc a previous vision of their future life well the very next thread post https www reddit com r mgtow comments 5tmdsf how to start through made to r mgtow right after this thread we are talking only minutes later is relevant to this point how to start through i am about to readjust my believe system now what to do i am thinking of starting my own business and reach financial independence on the other hand i still want to have children that more challenging to achieve how do you deal with this and while not a direct match for what i am talking about here is nevertheless in line with it basically you have to have a plan and of course adjust it as time passes but probably the key part of any plan is that you need to have some goal in mind and it helps to be able to make that goal some visual image does not necessarily have to be a house of course it might instead be some sailboat or a motorhome or some other travel adventure related thing but most men will probably eventually want to create some home base if only as a location to store stuff and or relax in between trips then plan their next trip or adventure ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, her mother was a total cunt and may very well have been the first to molest or sexualize your ex seriously mother daughter shit happens too sex offending especially of children tends to be a multi generational cycle thing and again as i think i noted elsewhere in this thread the correlation seemed sporadic back in the days that they only looked at male and more specifically adult male abusers but once you add in abuse by females adult women and older sibling girls the correlation is almost perfect and undoubtedly not spurious but rather is obviously causative ie not everyone that was so abused necessarily becomes an abuser but virtually everyone that becomes an abuser was abused the shit of it is now that sexualization has effectively become part of the curriculum in schools well that likely to cover up a lot of the causation correlation link ie more kids will be sexualizing each other and at younger and younger ages creating a new norm that will make it difficult to suss out actual abuse ,2,MGTOW

DWShimoda, you know what most male serial rapists have in common childhood sexual abuse by an adult woman indeed same with child molesters nearly all of them were molested or sexualized in one or more ways as children that data point was hidden dismissed for years decades because their molesters were women girls ie very often mom aunts and sisters and it was decided that did not count as being molested ,11,MGTOW
DWShimoda, pussy pass would have prevailed i found out that she was regularly sleeping with the county prosecutor at the time he had a fiance as well it would have been swept under the rug and i did not want to get harrassed by police in retaliation i am jack complete lack of surprise edit corrected joe to jack ,3,MGTOW
DWShimoda,decent summary from one of the comments little bit more info on this the suppression of one of the hormones that allows you to breast feed actually makes you menopausal not only does it make you age a bit dry you out cause a bit of the post baby depression but it can also make you feel pretty bad about your partner you are basically describing my experience it does help to know that this is just biology and not your choice to feel this way it is in part nature birthcontrol to keep all those resources going to baby explaining the science helped me and my husband through it what you are going through isnt easy it messes with everything and if you end up wanting counseling that will help too i did just say it is post partum issues they know what is going on i recall reading about this years and years ago ie this the behavioral changes during nursing was long known well establised and non controversial or at least it was non controversial until feminism combined forces with the heavy marketing of infant baby formula as better for the child the 2 out of 3 doctors say bullshit etc which caused a dramatic decline in breastfeeding in western nations during the 20th century to the point that virtually no women at least in western middle upper classes was breastfeeding during the 1950 and 60 and well into the 1970 i find it interesting to note that when you truly understand this then the traditional gender roles that feminists just love to bitch and whine about and label as only social constructs are revealed as being quelle surprise biologically based iow there is was a solid reason why men were generally not involved in the care of infants and even not around nursing women and it has nothing to do with men being either incapable or unwilling to perform the essentially trivial tasks of taking care of the baby instead it has everything to do with the way biology and hormones can alter female human behaviors and affections moreover if and when this is fully understood and accepted as just being part of the natural differences between men women then it can be rationally logically and intelligently accommodated by a society iow pre modern people were not idiots with their social constructs whereas when that understanding is rejected wholesale because it does not fit with dogmatic ideologies feminism egalitarianism etc that want to believe despite all of the blatant evidence to the contrary and insist that there are no differences between men women well you end up with a whole shitbasket full of unnecessary complications drama to simplify it the fence was there around the nursery for multiple damned good reasons tearing it down was foolish and due not to superior knowledge but rather due to ignorance of those reasons ,13,MGTOW
DWShimoda, had i the mindset back then that i had now i would have detroyed her life like she did mine this was only one item on her greatest hit reel if i had to do it again the police would have been involved unfortunately it probably would not have made any difference and she most likely would have been able to manipulate the police just as she manipulated everyone else cf r pussypass what i am talking about is more a matter of not helping continuing to perpetuate the array of blue pill lies about women if we are ever going to see an era when involving the police will actually be effective then it has to begin with calling female behaviors and actions what they really are that slutty women are in fact sluts and that there are multiple reasons from the spread of disease to the social psychological problems that slutting around is something to be shamed and that likewise when an adult woman goes after teen boys they are in fact rapists molestors until that becomes the dominant narrative again the pussy pass will not be reigned in ,4,MGTOW
DWShimoda, honestly i just wished people stop seeing the world with just one eye not surprisingly you are guilty of much the same thing but apparently and again not surprisingly you do not see it you are viewing all of the hierarchy as if it was entirely and only about sex thus you see everything as if it were animalistic now there is no doubt that a large portion of the population possibly even a majority though i think it is somewhat less than that operates at that level but there are other social things going on as well and the reductionist view that everything is always and only about sex is quite frankly the neurotic projecting his own obsession onto everyone else ,2,MGTOW
DWShimoda, and i believe may have given a blowjob to sexually molested orally raped one of her friends 12 or 13 year old son seriously call it what it actually is she raped molested a child change the sex genders if you as an adult man had engaged in any sexual activity with a 12 or 13 year old child no one would say you had given them a insert oral sex term they would say that you had molested raped the child the fact that the offender was an adult woman instead of a man does not make it ok and no one should be describing it with euphemisms and i do not care whether he enjoyed or got some pleasure from the orgasm because regardless of that it fucked with his mind in ways he going to have problems dealing with in one fashion or another ,35,MGTOW

DWShimoda, looks like that an ashleymadson dot com type of website not a public service announcement yup basically a find a married sugar daddy and become his mistress website http archive is 1e2ah looks like they have decided that to expand their business they need to convince more married woman to also use their service since they have probably already garnered most of the unmarried single whores that are going to sign up this is a standard business marketing thing based on law of diminishing returns once you have reached or passed a certain peak plateau in terms of market penetration relative to one niche of potential customer not quite saturation but close enough expending more marketing money trying to increase clients from that original demographic will garner an ever smaller diminishing return ergo you change modes and begin marketing to a different niche demographic ,6,MGTOW
DWShimoda, everyone knows that eventually read sooner than we think machines will replace most human labor really everyone knows this future no junior everyone does not know that what you mean is that the vast majority of people or at least people you know have bought into a particular meme story one that has been heavily incessantly repeated ad nauseum in the media one could even say it been drilled into an entire generation as an explanation for ironically enough the present malaise thus effectively stopping them from examining any other possible causes and it conveniently enough serves as a sort of candy coating that makes it easy for them to swallow and tastes oh so sweet and serves as a sort of perfect excuse for them to procrastinate a well as a nice basis from which to demand and whine for more entitlements including the pen ultimate universal basic income the latest euphemism for a socialist authoritarian state dole system and of course the almost absurdly laughably perfect thing for the elites the rabble actually begging nay demanding to be turned into feudal serfs in exchange for crumbs lol ,8,MGTOW

DWShimoda,i love how they do not get the ironic hypocrisy of the following of those still working ms goldin said they re in occupations in which they really have an identity she added women have more education they re in jobs that are more fulfilling and they stay with them ms goldin happens to be an example of the phenomenon as a 70 year old professor and researcher so she 70 years old and checking online it seems she got her doctorate in 1972 born in 1946 means when she was 26 that was 45 years ago the same will have been true of essentially any and all of those 60 and 70 year old women they all got their schooling back before all of the major affirmative action crap before no fault divorce before roe v wade etc etc so why exactly was any of that needed especially the more recent bullshit seems these women managed to go to college and get a doctorate in economics no less even back in the big bad old patriarchal mad men era ,3,MGTOW
DWShimoda,if he a widower ie mommy is not divorced and off with chad or jody she 6 ft under and the kids are all boys then yes he might be a temporary mgtow with the above and a young daughter or two but once they approach or hit pass into puberty he screwed for probably the next decade or more and may as well have a wife in the house ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, yes mgtow people is a bad term i agree that it probably would fail if it existed but i still like the idea somehow well it a compelling concept and of course not really all that much of a new one i mean there is a long history of bachelor men walling themselves off from the rest of the world including chiefly if not solely women that fundamentally what monasteries are and not just christian but buddhist taoist shinto and so on virtually every large society culture or religion philosophy had some group of men who went off to the mountain desert etc heck arguably academia was a similar thing in the secular world albeit often intermixed with seminaries likewise i could point to things like gated communities especially gated retirement communities where they have attempted to establish no children rules and yet even those end up being breached ie grandma grandpa buy in but then x years later their son daughter dies and they are left with the surviving orphaned grandchild can they be forced to sell is the grandchild allowed to live in the community for how long once the exception is made for one grandchild what about others if the smiths can have their grandchild living with them why cannot the joneses have their grandchild visit for the summer while the child mother is in hospital or on vacation if the exception loophole is only for emergencies well what kind of a hospitalization surgery counts as an emergency a boob job is elective but so are many other surgeries like heart stents do you see where i am going i also agree that there would never be a chance that such a thing would be legal or just impossible to create in this society yes in our current society even attempting to establish such a thing unofficially would be problematic to attempt to create it officially well in most of the first world western nations you would be begging to be sued for discrimination even if it never actually happened but i mean it could also be like one building or one apartment block in which you just would have to sell out the single apartments so trustworthy mgtows see the above also the operative word there is trustworthy how do you measure that determine that much less can you actually guarantee it especially over the long term let take mr clooney for example he certainly seemed to be a trustworthy mgtow type solidly as a confirmed bachelor made many statements public emphatic that he would never ever get married etc then suddenly magically he met a unicorn and tada everything is changed unless your one building one apartment block contains only one trustworthy mgtow namely you then you cannot guarantee that the same will not happen with any or all of the other trustworthy mgtow and in point of fact you will probably have a difficult enough time not falling for a nawalt unicorn woman yourself ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, thanks for this i am reading the pdf this part stood out a few moments ago as appropriate perhaps in a word the old was a kind of propagation men transmitting manhood to men the new is merely propaganda i am not religious but do not think this is even about religion i do not see that it requires a specific belief in god to understand or appreciate we are here on mgtow because we agree there something fundamentally wrong and this is how we are forced to deal with it it interesting to dig away at that to the deeper levels glad to see that you are getting something from and especially thinking pondering around it and as lewis discusses describes it in that booklet or again really a series of essays he talking about what i would suppose moderns post moderns would call a social contract or perhaps even broader than that a general civilized cultural consensus around right wrong what behaviors are acceptable what behaviors are tolerated and what actions are abhorrent and deemed too destructive to be allowed he pulls the word and concept of the tao quite specifically because while in some contexts it might be seen as religious ie to taoists it also has broader acceptance as a philosophical abstraction a universal truth if you will that essentially all civilizations societies have more or less in common obviously there are things that do not overlap but really there is more that at least historically does overlap iirc at a certain point he even explicitly states that he does not mean in this book these essays to be pushing any specific faith or even the broad abstract of religion and yes the there something fundamentally wrong is what he really digging down to to try to discern what where at the fundamental level has modernity gone awry and what then are then likely if not inevitable results of that you can note that as religious or cultural or a philosophical pursuit but it there at that root level that all of the rest comes from as ayn rand was fond of saying everyone has a philosophy of life whether they understand that they do and have tried to define it in a conscious manner or not they still do and as i have stated many times and places myself it is impossible to teach without also simultaneously indoctrinating and not just in the semantic sense that a teaching or thing taught is a doctrine the word doctrine means teaching but rather that all teaching has to take place within some abstract context some way of looking at the world of ordering it defining it describing it one therefore cannot truly teach objectively because even some eclectic a non commital agnostic if you will approach is itself a rather specific worldview it is just an agnostic worldview and to teach from that perspective is to indoctrinate or at least attempt to indoctrinate others into accepting that perspective that worldview the man who says all rules are bullshit and should be disregarded is establishing his own new rule the rule of an ideologically dogmatic scofflaw who categorically dismisses disregards all other rules out of hand or to crudely paraphrase something some wit chesteron mencken stated before you tear down a fence you might just want to consider why it was put there in the first place the idea being that people usually do not put efforts into building and maintaining a fence for no reason whatsoever the reason may have been irrational or it may no longer exist but there was a reason and it must have been a compelling one ,2,MGTOW
DWShimoda, today i was thinking that it would be cool living in a neighbourhood full of mgtow people i can give you about a dozen different reasons why it would not work why it would not last very long certainly not as an open town or village that people literally bought and thus personally privately owned properties within but really it all comes down to one thing some of the mgtow will not be true to it and so inevitably and in fairly short order possibly even within a few months but almost certainly within a few years one or another of the mgtow men would end up bringing a woman into his home and thus into the community he would most likely assert a right to do so based on his ownership of said property and if it was not a blatant girlfriend wife but rather some exigent and temporary emergency situation ie taking in some sister or aunt or daughter or friend of a friend who was of course in desperate need well in many senses that would be even worse why worse because you have now made an exception to the hard rule and you have created a clear path for women to enter to breach the walls so to speak soon enough word of the exception will get out and around both within the community and outside of it thus new additional exceptions will be made and really before anyone is aware a significant fraction of the population will no longer be mgtow and that is without mentioning the likely legal interference the lawsuits of discrimination etc and the demand that anyone male female or well androgynous ambiguous be allowed in in fact you have already planted a seed for that kind of thing right in your description a neighborhood full of mgtow people you did not state mgtow men nor even men boys but the sex gender ambiguous people nevermind that it is an oxymoron a self contradiction it yet another hole in the wall that would be exploited not just the word in the description but the ambiguous mindset that unwittingly makes such an error there are reasons why monasteries are often founded in remote difficult to reach locations islands or mountain tops and it is also why they generally require vows of poverty and why they are communal property ie why other than perhaps the clothes on his back and a few personal oddments none of the brothers monks is allowed to own or even assert any personal rights privacy exclusivity to anything within the walls which is then operated on an authoritarian dictatorial model and with very strict even draconian rules with often quite severe punishments including exclusion banishment from the community for those who violate them it is because otherwise some loophole or exception some proverbial and seemingly insignificant hole in the dyke will begin to leak and then to grow and grow exponentially and faster than anyone believes and then well just like the dyke metaphor the community will no longer be the dry land of some walled off polder but will quickly become a soggy sodden swamp then sea that is just as wet as the surrounding territory it will become just like everywhere else ,2,MGTOW
DWShimoda, also i wonder if this pastor has read his st paul i wish that all were as i myself am but each has his own gift from god one of one kind and one of another to the unmarried and the widows i say that it is good for them to remain single as i am but if they cannot exercise self control they should marry for it is better to marry than to burn with passion i want you to be free from anxieties the unmarried man is anxious about the things of the lord how to please the lord but the married man is anxious about worldly things how to please his wife and his interests are divided i would be fairly certain that he has ahem excised that particular set of passages from his bible or else at least much like so many other passages per example this one women should remain silent in the churches they are not allowed to speak but must be in submission as the law says if they want to inquire about something they should ask their own husbands at home for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church he has ever so conveniently determined that it is a culturally contextual archaism and that it is no longer applicable to the ahem modern church and quite possibly all of those verses have been so entirely retranslated to mean something entirely new different in the trendy fashionable oh look are not dolphins cool daily study version of the bible that he prefers aka the porpoise filled life version revision ,2,MGTOW
DWShimoda,also to your larger point and perhaps more properly to those who mgtow here who are partially intrigued or interested but yet do not see themselves as of faith who are instead are possibly agnostic or even athiestic ie but not wholly anti theistic well to those mgtow or lurkers i would perhaps suggest as especially relevant to comprehending the trap inherent in a lot of the modern post modern worldview that they might seek out a little book series of essays really by c s lewis entitled the abolition of man pdf http samizdat qc ca cosmos philo abolitionofman pdf as a starting point in terms of understanding that there is more to the way ie the tao than simply some archaic obsolete religiosity riddled set of draconian moral laws it starts out somewhat dry seeming to deal with a relatively esoteric and even trivial topic but seriously it worth continuing to read because he digs probes the philosophical and yet also very real life implications ever deeper and deeper and imho layer by layer he peels back and eventually lays bare the absurdities and hollow emptiness of the entire modernist post modernist worldview the very underpinnings of much of the gynocentric feminist and other ist and ism mentalities the misandric and misanthropic end result of that path ergo the abolition of men males as well as the abolition of man kind hence the title of the book begin with that and then learn a bit more about what he describes as the tao and you will be better able to comprehend the real truths that are in the older scriptures aka ancient writings of the various faiths the ones you were trained indoctrinated into discarding dismissing wholesale and without ever having critically examined them or indeed even learned anything other than the wholly distorted feminist and other ist ism versions of them there are far more red pill truth in those ancient scriptures than merely the red pill of female nature and most of you are missing all of that because you been brainwashed into a blindness regarding it pshaw it all tradcon stuff etc when in fact that tradcon interpretation is as mistaken as the feminist distortion for those unaware of his story while chiefly known as a christian writer c s lewis was himself by turns both an agnostic and a full blown outspoken atheist for many many years from his teens to his early 30 in fact ,5,MGTOW
DWShimoda, religious mgtow are important too just because the message is not relevant to you does not mean it should not be heard if its really so hard for you to understand why someone would believe in god i suggest taking a look at your own dogmatism and see if you find any contradiction there sadly with mgtow and red pill there often comes an arrogance that having seen through one teeny tiny portion of the blue pill lie they were fed and indoctrinated into they run off and believe that they have now magically discovered all of the truth they will ever need most will thereafter fall into one pit or ditch or another despair or licentiousness and the searing of conscience blinding them to any further truth that a lot of other things they have been taught indoctrinated into believing or dis believing as the case may be especially as part parcel of the post modern gynocentric sjw psycho socio mindset that those too might also be blue pill lies that they might be equally or even more dangerous well alas more the pity but the majority of them will never even contemplate that ergo once again the parable of the sower seeds soils applies not of course that they will understand because even while having eyes yet they will not see having ears they will not hear ,3,MGTOW
DWShimoda,re about the reading through the epistles new testament i suppose i should clarify that one key point was that we did not read them in the order they are found in the typical printed bible but rather in the date order in which the epistles were initially written sent at least as best as can be determined iow we quite purposefully did not start with the massive and complex even oppressive pauline epistle to the romans instead we started with the relatively tiny but profound epistle of james prob circa 40 ad then moved on to galatians 50 ad a year or two then 1 thessalonians 51 ad then 1 2 corinthians 55 57 ad and ephesians 58 ad colossians 60 etc the chief point of that is that the lessons topics of those epistle letters changed or developed and grew more more complex detailed as the churches believers individually and collectively matured in the faith and as the congregations grew larger in size and thus more complex cf dunbar number and even as they began to cover multiple generations as various other leader began to spring up and teach including spreading false teachings etc to wit he focus of james letter is a set of messages or instructions to new believers that faith w o works is dead among other things that a huge refutation of the e z gospel he then goes on to instruct regarding proper works what many would now call social gospel warns them against boasting of status in he faith etc galatians then has a different message instructions the warning of not falling back into phariseeism and a reiteration that the gospel is about salvation via faith freedom from the law not contradicting james but further explaining the ditch on the other side of he narrow way that it is not sans works but rather that works are one of the fruits of the spirit rather than some methodical law means or mechanism of obtaining salvation and then well you get the idea again point being that these letters and they were letters not reference books were emphatically not random in origin and that when viewed and read relative to a timeline they make much more sense than they do in the typical scattershot way that the church commonly uses imho misuses abuses them it also helps to get rid of the idea that the epistles somehow contradict one another instead viewed taught read learned as a timeline progression of instructions well you expect a child will begin crawling first then you will need to hold their hand while they are toddlers and just learning how to walk you do not worry about running much less instructing them about the pacing and endurance needed for a marathon until they are the appropriate age and have mastered the prior stages thus it is truly sad that most christians will be unlikely to even become aware of the epistle of james with it new believer instructions until they have been in the church for decades if indeed they ever truly encounter or read it buried as it is in the middle of the nt meanwhile new believer all too often gets presented with the massive romans epistle the equivalent imo of taking some prime rib meal complete with course ground horseradish a massive backed potato cole slaw etc and plopping it down in front of an infant and saying eat this is it any wonder that it is un digestible in that form and that as a result some study guide has to be created in a vain attempt to sort of pulverize it and turn it into a kind of palatable baby food pablum that an infant can be spoon fed and not simply choke on or just as bad that the church pastors treat the bible as if it were some smorgasbord some all you can eat diner where the believer is expected to belly up and pick or have picked for him by some mother hen various and sundry random bits and pieces to put on his or her plate and consume regardless of their ability to properly digest or comprehend is it any wonder that the result is a sort of chaotic bipolar pseudo christian schizophrenia i do not think it an accident at all ,4,MGTOW
DWShimoda, not addressing any of my points all the while throwing petty insults to my direction is that really the best what you can came up with yawn go worship your combination of a singularity robot god and socialist state as your savior already do not waste time playing the i won the argument on the interwebs bullshit because you have not you wo not and i am not going to waste my time trying to teach a pig to sing go wallow in the mud ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, this is the kind of thing that needs to be spoken your story truly shows the dysfunction in god house well and really the success of the women feminine imperative domination in destroying there really is no other word for it the boys youth program it did not end with that see one of the chief goals of that program at least as originally constituted was to be a tool for the fathers of the congregation to do things with their sons which of course also became a sticking point with the bitchy women ie what about the daughters we want the fathers to do things with them too bullshit of course they did not want anything of the kind it was just another unequal feminist based excuse but i am digressing anyway while i would have to say that by and large the program failed in achieving that goal and i have suspicions as to the petticoat reasons for that women have a way of pushing nagging men to do things that effectively turns the men off of it so even the women who purportedly supported the boys program were often effectively undermining it well even though i think it was largely a failure there was one interesting unexpected but welcome offshoot of that the men who were leaders of the boys program and also two of the dad that came on the trips had started meeting quasi regularly we are talking a handful of times per year to do a sort of ad hoc bible study men group it just sort of naturally happened sprang out of the initial trip planning meetings well guess what also got killed when the boys program was ended that right the men study group also git skewered how simple really the wives apparently colluded behind the scenes and all came along i am told initially even rather deceptively in a couple of cases and said deception was of course never labeled as that they turned that into a co ed youth program leader group which of course did not last in that incarnation because it all got turned over to the youth pastor wife as soon as he was recruited hired i even have my suspicions regarding the genesis of the whole thing i think speculation but i would not put it past the man as there were other areas we would butted heads on that the pastor with assistance from his wife cf petticoat politics basically orchestrated the entire transition alas another sad aspect of that was that they then turned that informal natural men study fellowship group into something yet imo anyway more sinister the women and pastor pushed the whole promise keepers crapfest onto them ie if you are not familiar with it well count yourself lucky pk is basically a false gospel of subservience to women about as blue pill and entirely non biblical and imho anti gospel as you can possibly get a massive distortion total inversion of biblical scriptures ripped out of context and reinterpreted in a manner that would have made the pharisees proud effectively emasculating those men to wit he wanted additional pastoral staff to be hired the whole grow the church as if it were a corporation business model and to play at ceo along with the desire for higher social status of being a senior pastor which of course requires more than one pastor along with the accompanying higher pay fancier offices a full time secretary etc etc he had even blatantly admitted stated that he wanted to do less pastoring to step back and do more managing and thus to be less of a shepherd and more of i kid you not this was his choice of analogy one he seemed quite pleased with himself when he made it a cattle rancher when he stated that during a church meeting i had stood up and called him out on it noting that his analogy of rancher was both unbiblical as well as rather revealing while shepherds tend to sheep and you can argue sheer them which is bad enough but it the bible that created that analogy well by contrast ranchers do not tend to their cattle they drive them to market to be slaughtered en masse ayah we had not necessarily seen eye to eye even before that trust me the man was never a shepherd it debatable whether or not the term pastor was even applicable as anything other than a misnomer title for preacher and worse preacher of canned sermons plagiarized from others written out word for word and then preached as a sort of overly rehearsed and banal lecture the few times he led bible studies he used commercial video tapes and study guides but at that meeting well suffice it to say he turned pale as a ghost i would thoroughly skewered him and alas publicly as well albeit not pre meditatively on my part while i had an inkling he was going to be pushing for money to rent an office and hire a full time secretary neither of which imo were needed i had no clue he was going to pop out with the rancher analogy my response was entirely unplanned and spirit led but from that moment on i think he saw me as the enemy needing to be destroyed driven out because i was ruining his whole career plan i tended to teach straight from the bible extemporaneously to boot and achieved rather remarkable success at it just as one example one of the whole reasons the boys youth group had been expanded into the high school ie like boy scout age range well as background info you need to know that the chief original part of the program was the program for the teen hs age group the younger age group programs elementary jr high levels think cub scouts were intended as feeder programs to develop the interest this church had contracted with the national organization but had only ever run the cub scout programs in the younger years they would never had a sufficient number of older boys nor the level of interest nor leaders willing to run it anyway one of the reasons the hs group had begun was that there was an age group of kids in the church iirc about 3 whole grades where the families in the church only had boys in other words zero girls daughters were all either older or younger and moreover there was a whole pack of them nearly a dozen give or take a few tag along friends the boys brought with them as those boys finished the cub scout program they demanded not kidding not exaggerating that the program continue when i told them i was not sure there was anything more at the time i would been ignorant of the rest of the program they pushed me to find out and when i would found out they twisted my proverbial arm to actually do it so really it was the boys that created the hs group i was just the adult victim lol they chose and tasked with implementing leading it again not exaggerating so the further anyway of that is that this pack wolf pack of boys had basically run through run over all of the adults who had tried to teach them as sunday school teachers and when they got to the high school age range well the sunday school superintendent could not find anyone else willing to be their teacher so he asked me to do it and i had agreed with one provision that i be allowed to teach my own curriculum see i would looked at the book they would wanted to use the textbook or curriculum or whatever you want to call it and felt it was abysmal boring and well even crappy so my idea instead was just to read study through the new testament or rather to do a quick overview of acts then begin reading through the epistles ie the letters what do you do with letters particularly letters written to a group of people aka a church well duh you read them you read them out loud together from start to finish you do not read a single sentence and then have somebody bs for 45 minutes on what it means you read the whole letter in context etc then you discuss how it applies etc boring right i mean no way that gonna work a bunch of teenagers especially rambunctous boys varying 3 to 4 years apart from like 12 13 to 16 17 yrs old they are not gonna sit in a circle on the floor of a back room or outside on the grass and do that heavens reading out loud no way guess what they ate it up they literally loved it the bell would ring for the end of class and they would want to continue reading crazy right i mean after class was the time the kids got to run around while the parents dilly dallied and chit chatted not these boys they insisted we continue crazier yet some of the older and younger boys from the other classes came into our room to join us as soon as they could after their own sunday school class was over several of them even stated they wished to switch classes especially the two boys stuck in the older hs co ed group led by the aforementioned jesus freak quasi hippie couple they hated that class and wanted to be in mine which alas was not allowed hurt feelings with teachers go figure btw we obviously did not make it through anything like all of the epistles but the boys did get a taste for an entirely different way to view the new testament that the epistles were not just some random collection of verses in books with weird title names but actually a progression of age stage instructions given to the followers of the way see second reply lack of classrooms with chairs so guess which class gets the short shrift is made to sacrifice i turned it into a positive thing and even later when they reshuffled the classes and we got a room with chairs well we folded them up and sat in a circle on the floor anyway the boys preferred it that way ,4,MGTOW
DWShimoda, god has nothing to do with the mgtow perhaps you did not read the first sentence of op post so in the interest of clarity i will repost it with some emphasis below this is primarily for mgtow of faith but certainly anyone can contribute here see that bolded set of words means it is not aimed at you also the italicized word contribute means adding something of value also means snarky shitty anti theistic sjw style comments yeah they are not contributions any more than a turd left on your doorstep is a gift but we get it you are still thoroughly indoctrinated into following the herd and the zeitgeist of your generation no one is preaching to you so sod off already ,5,MGTOW
DWShimoda,with the possible exception of old order groups like the amish the church especially as organized into the various local churches and the larger synods sects are entirely cucked they have been gradually and steadily infiltrated subverted and taken over during past well probably century or more taken over by a combination of socialism psychobabble and feminism of varying degrees stripes only rarely will anyone within the church admit even a brief and indirect sort of glimpse behind the curtain manner the real extent to which the cucking has occurred to wit occasionally you will find someone writing something like the following https dougwils com s7 engaging the culture fear woman bringeth two three snares html note skip the first part he starts off with something banal seriously i think it because he wanted to make certain most people would not actually read far enough into the piece to actually see his shameful admission to wit the cowardice in the pulpit and beyond and as a side point i will simply note the presence of the psychobabble in the whole pastoral marital counseling itself a sign of yet another problem in the pulpit or more properly the pseudo leadership of the church being turned over to the hired hand mislabeled as the pastor and that kind of thing the deferential fearful cowardice he discusses along with a host of other things is pretty much pervasive throughout the entirety of organized churches top to bottom left to right inside and out and regardless of the denomination the supposedly fundamental nature of the congregation or the so called fire brimstone style of the preacher all of them are cucked and subservient to womankind they are not merely gynocentric they have in fact been wholly feministed really they may as well all take down the crosses and in it place erect a statue or stained glass image of a woman not some athena nor even a gaia mother nature goddess but rather the modern western tattooed pierced morbidly obese single divorced bitchy baby momma woman and for good measure pregnant again with a couple of dead dismembered fetuses at her feet as well as an obese child or two ideally of a different race ethnicity from herself sucking at an exposed teat because in reality that is their god a proverbial whore of babylon personal anecdote story time specifically about two decades ago i became a leader of a pre existing church sponsored boys only youth group program ie scouting style but a different org and even while i was still there various pressures were being applied to co opt and undermine that whole sex segregated approach and replace it with a more inclusive and equal co ed approach mind you this was in what was ostensibly an independent and fundamental bible church ie no pressure from above no synod or bishop to blame for it the pressure instead coming from a combination of a handful of new agey aka 1960 jesus freak type couples who of course used the excuse that the scouting theme was militaristic etc and who were pressuring for the church to basically end it own youth programs and instead quelle surprise to give them the funds to operate a community co ed edgy youth group as a parachurch thing ie not under oversight of the church elders etc but of course that was not the chief source of pressure that finally did in the program nope what ended the regimented segregated program and caused a switch to an utterly banal and basically directionless imo eclectic garbage dump co ed youth group was the wives of the pastor the various elders etc how well the boys group had actually managed to obtain some camping equipment tents backpacks etc obtained it by getting private extra donations from a couple of men who want to support that specific program and particularly to equip us to be able to do real backwoods hiking trips that did not sit well with the women see the girls program did not have such equipment did not go on any such trips nevermind that there was nothing at all that was preventing them from raising funds and obtaining their own equipment nor was there anything preventing the women lead doing such trips well nothing other than incompetence but of course that really was not the issue what they wanted was for the girls and women to be able to control use abuse eventually alter even arguably destroy the boys equipment iow boy has toy girl must assert dominance by demanding that she be allowed to play with it too why because vagina because equality nevermind that she has zero interest in the actual toy i had dug my heels in and since i was the one in possession control of the equipment i said n o absolutely not it had all been bought privately with money handed to me privately plus a bit of my own as well not as a donation to the church but to me with the explicit instructions condition that i was to use it buy the equipment for the boys group ergo i had all of the receipts the church had nothing and technically speaking i was the actual owner of the equipment for various and sundry reasons including some personal like that i took another different job that entailed a lot of travel i quit the youth program and shortly thereafter i left the church as well and in quitting i turned the equipment over to the men and fathers who had been assistant leaders on the condition that they maintain it and only use it for the boys group activities well you know what happened right that right they caved almost instantly the following summer the women girls used the tents for a sleepover ie somebody damned back yard oh and the backpacks too why the backpacks who the hell knows there was zero justification for it not even anything that was remotely plausible the backpacks were sized for high school teenage boys men the girls group was all preteen and did not even include any teen hs girls there was no way for them to make use of those packs even if they had actually gone on some hiking trip worse while the boys group had not attempted a trip that summer they did try to organize one the following year and guess what they found yup the equipment was all essentially ruined the tents had been damaged in several ways they would apparently been decorated with some kind of painted on flower designs they would not been properly dried out after the sleepover and so had become moldy mildewed and in addition they had not been properly rolled stored either instead just all stuffed into some plastic bin great for sealing in moisture and of course they were missing all of the tent pegs the poles had been screwed up one of the fly covers had been ripped etc similarly with the backpacks food including i guess some kind of a sticky syrup honey maple syrup fruit jam had been left inside one of the packs and worse it had been the one placed on top of the others and so over the year wherever the heck the things had been stored some garage or attic i presume the stickiness had dripped through and down onto the several packs underneath in addition where ever they had been stored had been far from ideal in other ways as various rodent droppings were found in the packs as well as several chewed holes and an abundance of nesting material shredded paper fiberglas insulation and etc the boys were so disgusted by what they found and so disheartened to find the equipment so damaged and unusable that they had to cancel their planned campout that they quit the program thus the following fall with no more teen boys even wanting the scout like program the church was able to successfully end that and begin their new inclusive and egalitarian equalitarian and ridiculously psychological sex education boy girl socialization co ed youth program the boys told me they went to the first and second meeting and that it was so lame and in other ways even offensive to them that they never went again but the women had achieved success they got what imo they really wanted the destruction of yet another male only space program oh and the church was soo proud and confident in the positive potential of their new edgy rock music psycho social co ed community outreach program that they hired a full time youth pastor to run it new seminary grad recently married of course with his musical bimbo wife being his unpaid but co equal ministry partner woohoo can you say christian woodstock end result of that by the way sad to say but truth wills out just a few years later two of the younger boys who had been freshman and just barely entered the program during my last year yeah they ended up getting each getting a girl pregnant their senior year of high school and i will give you one guess as to where they met the girls btw neither of them married the chicks but they did get stuck supporting the kids one went into the military the other started working doing auto mechanic tech school at nites imo both boys could have been college engineer programmer types and right on the cusp of the dot com boom instead they became beta slaves for 20 years and lest you think the church might have learned something from that well they claimed they did just the wrong thing they doubled down and decided what was needed was more sex topic group discussions in the co ed youth meetings with of course an entirely new intern freshly minted seminary grad youth group pastor and a new bimbo wife assistant ie hormonal

DWShimoda, i am surprised it only a total sum of 2 weeks in fact i think they are cushioning those numbers if female teachers miss as much time from work like women do in every other profession it more like a full one third to one half of the whole fucking year probably actually the article https www adn com nation world 2016 10 26 more than 1 in 4 us teachers are chronically absent missing more than 10 days of school op apparently screwed up the link merely states that 27 percent of the nation teachers are out of school for more than 10 days of regular classes so exactly what the median number for those who are in the category of chronically absent missing more than 10 days is never actually given it quite possibly significantly higher sounds to me like rather than reporting actual detailed data on every teacher attendance absence totals they are having the schools provide summary information in category form ie how many teachers fit into a 0 absentee days b 1 to 4 absentee days c 5 to 9 absentee days or d 10 or more absentee days thus teachers who are missing playing hooky for 1 4 or even 1 2 of the school year either all at once or scattered randomly throughout the entire school year will be lumped into the same category as someone who quite understandably missed two weeks as a result of illness injury recovery it a standard technique for hiding the actual extent of a problem btw there probably another easier and probably far more precise way to actually determine the extent of the problem and that is to look at payroll how many days hours of substitute teacher time were paid in a given school district also per the article it is the poorer school districts that are experiencing the lion share of the problems and what they fail to note is that the additional expense of all of those substitutes is exacerbating the financial problems of those same districts because absentee teachers are still being paid and the substitute is then an additional cost meaning vastly less money available for other uses ,1,MGTOW

DWShimoda,note the several very important little caveats admissions that are ever so conveniently tucked away hidden in one of the key paragraphs in the middle of that article now it s true that some of the fruit of a married man s labors goes to his spouse and children but by the time they reach retirement men who get and stay married are in much better financial shape than their peers who divorced or never married partly because they earn more and save more and generally spend many years in a dual income family stably married men have much greater wealth than their unmarried peers in fact the typical 50 something married guy has three times the assets of his unmarried peer about 167 000 to 49 000 let hit bolded little tidbits in reverse order shall we note that at the end there they state assets of the typical married guy versus unmarried peer what does that mean 1 well first ask yourself why are they using the term assets and not net assets ie assets minus liabilities the answer is simple the figures they are using are not in fact net it strictly titled assets meaning it that the typical married guy owns a 3br 2ba house which he being typical means he still owes 10 or more likely 20 years of payments on why 20 because at about 40 yrs old he they did a heloc refinance or upgraded from a smaller starter home 2 second note that he uses the term unmarried not the never married but unmarried the import of that is when it came time to discuss the assets the authors chose a mixed bag that includes divorced men guys who lost house and car and other major assets half of retirement fund etc to divorce rape and since that divorced group vastly outnumbers the never married group i guarantee you on any average ie typical basis whether mean or median those divorcees are skewing the personal asset number 3 finally the three times the assets bit consider what that 167 000 really means it marital property meaning that by definition at least half of that 83 500 is legally hers in fact if she been a non working or minimally working sahm she probably going to be able to lay claim to the better part of that if not the entirety of it if and or when she ever wants to on a whim moreover even if we assume that the married guy has title to a full half of that ie the other 83 500 it not likely that he has anything like full control over it that is he cannot sell off cash out his half and since it is likely part of a home an asset he not going to be able to cash out of without both divorce cost minimal 10k each plus realtor other home sale costs 10 8 350 out of his half well his 83 500 is probably gonna be more like 60k if he lucky and it an amicable divorce with no custody dispute no alimony no child support by contrast the unmarried guy whether never married or already divorced well he is in single full control over that 49 000 in fact it probably cash savings or relatively liquid investments cf a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush next let go back to that bit they slipped in there about and stay married as well as the peers who divorced or never married little trick 1 that means the authors here are engaged in wholesale fraud this comparison is not marriage against mgtow ie remaining pure bachelor for life but rather is an inherently and imo quite intentionally biased mixed bag that includes divorced men possibly divorced more than once 2 they ignore that the stay married is no longer in the man control in fact statistically women file 70 of all divorce papers meaning that the typical married man if typical means anything is fundamentally not in control of whether or not he stays married in fact he more like a dog on a leash not even in control over whether he gets to keep his balls or not his owner decides that based on the owner priorities the dog does not even get a vote so too with the typical married guy his owner decides whether she wants to stay married to him or not his opinion on the matter is fundamentally legally irrelevant finally to go back to the first bolded point the by the time they reach retirement is also hugely important 1 unless the authors of this article have a time machine or a literal crystal ball that they can use to visit or see into some foreordained future it means that they are basing this on generations that have already reached retirement ie men aged 65 yrs old as of whatever dataset they are accessing 2 that means men born at the very latest before 1950 and since presumably they are not basing this off of some single birth year cohort of men it means men born during the multiple 2 to 3 or more decades prior to 1950 ruh roh now since the baby boom began in 1946 in essence that means at most 4 years worth of baby boomers are in that mix and so regardless of whether the dataset of men who had reached retirement was a single decade 1940 1950 or two decades 1930 1950 or even 3 decades 1920 1950 the lion share of the men that data is based on would be the so called silent generation the generation that was not quite old enough to be in wwii but arrived at adulthood in the two decades following 3 iow men who married in the late 1940 1950 possibly the early 1960 that means the women these men married were largely if not entirely pre feminist women who as teens or early twenty something could not obtain birth control pills because they did not exist yet and who grew up in a culture where a girl women that engaged in any premarital sex at all essentially rendered her an un marriageable slut at least if it became publicly knowledge 4 it also means that in terms of financial status their sample set includes major portions of men who early to mid careers were during the post war boom era of the late 1940 the 1950 early 1960 who bought homes at relatively cheap prices if they were smart locked in at low payments low interest rates and which they were then later on able to pay off via highly inflated wages salaries and subsequently who retirement investments were on the ground floor of the several stock market booms not to mention often having jobs with solid if not generous pensions as well as those private 401k ira retirement funds quite bluntly bar divorce rape there is virtually no excuse for the members of that silent generation those who wives stayed married to them to not be sitting on assets of well in excess of 1

DWShimoda, i agree to that except that the whole point of a social contract is that you are a party to it whether you have agreed to it or not it a contract that has essentially been signed by the parent generation s and merely imposed down onto their progeny ,6,MGTOW
DWShimoda, there never been any contract between you and society promising you anything for fulfilling such things of course there has been it just that it was a fraudulent social contract akin to a con game promising things that were either impractical or impossible to be delivered on or which were never intended to be fulfilled ie corrupt cheat ,3,MGTOW
DWShimoda, there is only one thing we need to recognize contracts in general i would agree with you but contracts are a mutual thing and a civilized thing that is they only operate effectively when both of the main parties to the contract are voluntarily consenting to it terms as opposed to being forced into it by the opposing party or some third party and moreover are capable of fulfilling them the willingness consent is irrelevant to the latter the eventual outplay but the ability is critical point being that we are all too quickly reaching a state of things where mutuality is being entirely discarded and civilized aspects are being cast aside as well in favor of the naked use of force demands and ultimatums do this or else once that happens there is no longer an environment in which contracts are functional if they even still exist they are fraudulent and or under duress and often impractical to be complied with willingly or unwillingly all of which renders them invalid and eventually impossible to be upheld and by forced i mean literal threat of physical force ie true duress i do not mean persuasive pressures like some familial or societal sense of duty obligation because despite the modern nonsense those are not force though they may be fraud cf but that is a slightly different matter iow you cannot get blood from a stone to wit i might be able to convince someone else to voluntarily agree to some wheat chessboard doubling contract https en wikipedia org wiki wheat and chessboard problem but there is no way regardless of any legal judgement nor the threat or application of any amount of force that i can actually collect on the terms ,2,MGTOW
DWShimoda, when the history books are written they will say that in france and other places civil wars started somewhere around 2010 meaning they are already going on but people do not think of it that way yet yup ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda,more likely civil war that is to say one or more internal conflicts ie intra national within a nation state or empire probably ending the latter and dividing it up into separate entities regions rather than some major external conflicts ie inter national between different nation states though there is the possibility it fairly common that the former will also have some aspects of the latter especially since empires are sort of false entities that invariably become hosts to migration invasion relative to adjacent states the more demographically dynamic aka growing population nation pressing into the less demographically dynamic one aka whether declining stable or even merely more slowly growing population and one should note that this is far from a us mexico only issue the same inverse thing is going on with mexico vs it southern adjacent neighbor countries which is indeed the source of many of the immigrants that have been flooding through mexico and into the southwestern us and there are many other similar population pressure things especially vs food other basic necessity resources going on in many other places in the world nation with populations that have been growing exponentially ie doubling every 15 to 20 years for the past 60 to 80 years outpacing their ability to feed themselves and the older oldest generation s dying off or being killed off prematurely is not a solution since by definition they are 1 4 or 1 8 or less of the youngest second youngest teen hungriest generation and via natural attrition they are probably even significantly less of a fraction of the population and basic resource wise they use need even less yet ie taking grandpa great granda food is not going to feed even one teen much less 4 8 16 or more likewise out migration really does not solve the issue either in fact it barely and only briefly releases a tiny fraction of the pressure that is building up internally ,3,MGTOW
DWShimoda, i still do not understand how companies like snapchat and instagram are worth tens of billions of dollars whatever simplest answer is that they are really not those are imputed valuations based on the fact that only a tiny fraction of the actual stock has ever been floated the vast majority is held in reserve and simply used then as a collateral upon which the company engages in highly leveraged financial shenanigans which in itself is fueled by expanded credit monies ie fake fiat money of the quantitative easing programs in short the whole thing is a tulip bubble scam simply on a much larger scale ,6,MGTOW
DWShimoda, advertising revenue and the selling of personal information people are the biggest products except that even with those they are not profitable no profit no dividends zero inherent value of the company as an investment except under one scenario the greater fool scenario also known as a pyramid scheme and or pension stock scam see there is a shitload of money that being channeled into wall street on a regular continual basis both from pension investment funds as well as via private retirement investment programs 401k probably the most notable those monies tend to head for mutual funds of one type or another managed or indexed and from those into various stocks now so long as the inflow of money into that system is generally speaking long term a net positive ie total amounts being fed into the system being greater than the total amounts people are withdrawing from it there will be upward pressure on the stock valuations that is the most recent price bids and then the imputed valuations basically that money has to go somewhere it has to be invested into something one stock or another and in many ways the so called indexed mutual funds are the worst culprit since that money is categorically definitionally both dumb and mindless iow it flows into an array of stocks regardless of the actual merit of the investment whether the company is or even can ever truly be profitable it merely chases imputed valuations ie so long as there is some greater fool paying more for the trivial available float of some particular stock that where the money goes as an analogy it much like a meandering river which goes back and forth but continues to gain in size and strength so long as the tributaries continue to feed in additional water there are in fact more mutual funds than there are stocks which in and of itself ought to be a clue as to just how dumb ie blindered and ignoring data that is actually of import the system has become ,4,MGTOW

DWShimoda, this is a fairly enlightened response well it at least much closer to the factual reality than any of the other ways that the 1950 american housewife is portrayed it too brief to be entirely complete i mean women being bored was not the sole cause nor sole motivation for the obsessive compulsive control freak striving for the perfect perfectly clean home some of it stemmed from habit per example prior to electrification and clean burning central heating well homes heated with wood or coal and lit with oil lamps needed more frequent thorough cleaning not to achieve perfection but simply to keep the soot and dust and dirt down to a moderate and acceptable level and that to say nothing of husband and family riding in cars or on buses instead of walking through mud muck or riding horseback or open air buggy and coming in with dust dirt the point being that the behavior the cleaning continued to a higher degree long after it was not really necessary at that level the generation of women who lived through that transition finally gained victory over the dirt dust soot and were damned proud of it ie their previous home their mother home was never so clean that then shifted over to the younger sisters and daughters and the pristine clean became the norm the ideal goal and of course there were still other motivations as well the fear really we are talking phobia and paranoia levels over things like polio and all sorts of other diseases to say nothing of things like bed bugs the origins and etiology of which were not fully understood especially by the mass of the population add in some propaganda both government and industry marketing proposing promoting the idea that women cleanliness of the home ie perfectly disinfected were the front line of the war against disease along with the likely increased concern over her smaller number of children 2 or 3 as opposed to the half dozen or dozen children of her farmer mother grandmother then of course women living in suburban homes are now a lot nearer to their neighbors and with enough time to begin engaging in competitive oneupmanship in regards to the appearance of their homes themselves during the day throughout the week instead of merely sunday best and that competition being no joke as it often enough became a literal formal competition best kept home in the neighborhood best looking yard etc add all of those together and you end up with a sort of near perfect recipe for at least some of the neighborhood women to go over the edge in to neurotic ocd territory meanwhile the basic task duties done to a moderate acceptable level and hey everyone is not going to be best so if a c grade is acceptable why kill yourself do not really take so long anymore and since they do not really require either the time nor effort nor the level of skill they used to well they are no longer really so satisfying there is not the same pride of accomplishment for example in making a box mix cake identical to the ones your neighbors can make as there is in having perfected the skill of making a certain type of cake from scratch one that the neighbor women cannot quite match ergo the more technology based results even if better become a sort of hollow victory and when the internal self validation of a job well done gets smaller well inevitably this is human nature you will seek greater amounts of external validation from others and if when you do not get that validation that gratitude or even if you do even if the gratitude and appreciation waxes gross well it still does not feeeeel the same especially since you know you sort of cheated ie compliments on how great that german potato salad tastes are a bit hollow when you know it came from a can or likewise that the cake was from a box mix rather than from scratch you want the compliment yet know it not necessarily deserved and then from that you end up all too easily in irrational territory women proclaiming how hard their job is even though they know it is not but that is mainly an expression of how unappreciated they feel and also simultaneously and self contradictorily how bored they are and how they want or need the excitement and thrill of the workplace business all of which especially that last bit puzzles the hell out of the typical husband who does not see his job as either very exciting or all that thrilling for the most part it fucking drudgery etc ,1,MGTOW

DWShimoda,ironically it really was not that men were demanding that kind of stuff most of that advice was due to the fact that housekeeping homemaking had become too easy and women had become bored as result cf stepford wives etc wait what how why well probably the primary reasons would a combination of 1 the family moved off of some rural farm and into town or at least a suburban home ie levittown etc with hubby working either in factory office or retail etc city work and at the same time 2 the home itself became modern with indoor plumbing and then electrified with lots of appliances chief among them central heating hot water electric cookstove oven and electric laundry first the automatic washing machine and then the clothes dryer things like electric vacuum cleaner were relatively trivial additions later on when houses got carpeted instead of bare wood or tile with rugs first of course is that no farm no garden no animals women often were in charge of garden for vege and critters like chickens for eggs if they had a cow then milking butter churning etc also hubby probably sons as farmers would get clothing rather dirty working in the fields making it a lot harder to do laundry get the stuff clean especially with a plunge scrub hand washing routine not to mention having to carry clothes out to hang on a clothesline then pull back in when dry etc then keep in mind for prior generations of women say great depression era and pretty much all of history before a huge part of their day was getting the wood or coal fired cookstove heated up and then maintained for the days cooking baking remember the saying if you cannot stand the heat get out of the kitchen well that where it comes from big old cast iron stove said stove was then used not only for cooking and baking but also for heating washing water for bathing as well as clothes washing etc soap works much better everything is a lot easier to clean in or with warm hot water than ice cold from some pump and the amount of time for all of that cannot really be understated take the baking for example you live out on a farm 10 maybe even 20 or more miles away from some general store you do not have a car travel to town is horse buggy wagon or walk either way to town general store and back is better part of a day and the point is you are not going to do that every day or even every couple of days just to buy some loaf of bread etc also you also do not really have any refrigeration you might have an icebox but it pretty dubious and expensive and there is no such thing as frozen bread dough or really frozen anything yet which means you mix raise then bake your own bread from scratch flour water yeast a little butter sugar etc it really not that difficult does not even really take that much time but it is a process with stages over time mix dough set aside let it rise for approx an hour then bake meanwhile you do other things like the other cooking on said cast iron stove whether roasting or making some stew or canning vegetables or whatever and again including any all other heating water tasks laundry etc the actual work involved in any one of those things probably is not a lot in and of itself but the work happens intermittently over time and if your prepping several things for dinner well you have to coordinate all of it plus of course as part of that you have to keep your eye on the stove and maintain the heat keep it properly stoked etc with no thermostatic control and probably not even a temperature gauge or thermometer so how long does it take to bake those loaves of bread well you gotta know the stove trial error and experience plus stick a fork in it etc any and all of that even for some small family was sufficient to keep a woman and probably daughters too busy basically all day long and pretty much every day every week all year so what happens once you automate a lot of that electric stove turn the dial to the temperature and it set heck there even a built in timer so you do not have to watch any clock much less peek at or test what is baking roasting etc plus hot water on tap means no more heating pails of the stuff automatic or even semi automatic washing machine and you do not have to plunge scrub electric dryer and you do not have to hang clothes or retrieve them car and grocery store you can buy the bread already baked probably as cheap as the ingredients plus pre sliced etc fridge and you have frozen stuff etc long story short your purpose in life your work and basically entire reason for existence have been so vastly improved that you are bored off your ass so wife mom has to invent things to keep busy and fill the extra time she now has she becomes anal retentive and a sort of obsessive compulsive control freak trying to make everything perfect per the latest housekeeping or ladies magazine interspersed with watching as the stomach churns or some other tv soap opera and or romance novels etc ergo the modern crazed woman something tells me the amish women are probably a lot happier busier have to work a lot harder but happier and more satisfied with their life and home and family ,20,MGTOW

DWShimoda,thus ironically enough creating a moral basis for the crackdown against themselves and which their present course of action will eventually inevitably cause when someone openly and blatantly advocates for and defends the initiation of violence against others they are sacrificing any right to claim victim status later on which of course is exactly what they do want to claim authoritarian pre emptive violence is thus justified on the principle of maintaining order and on the very basis of the initiation of force that the left itself crafted all the state or oppositional group aka right needs to do is accept the premise as proposed by the anarchists in brief that might makes right imo what we are witnessing is basically a replay of the 1920 and 1930 in europe and not because trump is a nazi if anything he more akin to paul von hindenburg ie the political neophyte independent outsider who follows a failed quasi socialist and with a slight majority is selected over yet another of the same a career politician candidate in that case literally named marx despite the claims of modern wwii post wwii revisionist history mainly based on wwii propaganda the fascists in germany were not the chief initiators of the violence certainly not in the 1920 and the general public did not support the fascists until that is the left various communists socialists anarchists etc began initiating violence generally using guerrilla tactics ie random subversive hit run revolutionarily destructive of order etc then the fascists came along with an ordered methodical militant response and by degrees the public responded positively and eventually ate it up had the left not engaged in that repetitive initiation of violence the fascists would likely have never gained even minority much less later widespread support moreover it is rather understandable that the public did eventually switch and support the facists after all if you are going to have violence as a primary element in a society anyway ie if it happening regardless of the majority not wanting it well which would you choose random careless reckless violence against largely innocent people including possibly you yours plus your neighborhood businesses the public commons etc leading to anarchy and chaos or systematic controlled violence that has a goal of ending the random anarchy and maintaining order and stability i would move that most societies will sooner or later choose the latter then of course once the order is established once the real original anarchists are rooted out destroyed or otherwise controlled even possibly becoming integrated into the system well the systematic use of violence does not necessarily stop new enemies of peace order are likely to be found one after another really almost have to be found or created in order to stay in power and thus you have the first they came for progression and lest we try to fool ourselves that same thing is true of say the us foreign policy across the entire 20th century from the war with spain onwards ,2,Libertarian

DWShimoda, ka ching community technical institute for advanced knowledge of chittagong bangladesh you know the one the guy who was not sure what you meant by sql query too real man hahaha well seriously people at big corporations will categorically dismiss disparage anybody who went to say the north dakota state university i mean jeepers that like a bunch of dumbass redneck farmer kids ai not they how could they possibly have a decent computer science program i mean is that even a real university lolololol but the same damned hr people turn right around and go all googley eyed over some graduate of some university in a foreign city or region that they cannot spell have most likely never even heard of and quite frankly located in a country the hr person probably could not locate on a globe or map even with country names printed on it and moreover where nothing against poor people but probably half the population still does not even have indoor plumbing and where said university if it even in fact exists anymore or indeed ever did exist especially as anything other than a diploma mill well the students there might be lucky if it has semi reliable electrical power in the classroom and where maybe they have had a modern computer lab for the past 5 or so years with two laptops in it during the guy ostensible post grad schooling years during his undergraduate days well not so much plus said graduate well no offense intended given what he had to work with the people he was around but really he barely speaks english in anything like a comprehensible accent mainly learned from watching seinfeld or reruns of that funny the friends tv show oh that chandler fellow and the joey guy how you doin lololol is so funny when he do that and makes with the flirting with cat lady feebee no yeah that the guy you want to hire to polish up the erp system for your factory integrate it with the crp system so that it can handle all of the various sales use taxes of all of the states counties municipalities in the us not to mention properly design your accounting system to track profit loss on your contracts and compute your section 199 domestic manufacturing tax credit i mean he gonna be really great to have on hand as the el primo technical data analyst expert for all of those project conference meetings he will nod his head and say yes and yes and two weeks to just about anything or everything you ask nevermind that he did not actually understand a single damned word that anyone was saying well no big deal it will work out in the end right besides everyone knows those programming project schedules and budgets are not reliable it has always been a problem right ,3,MGTOW

DWShimoda, i agreed with everything until you mentioned doctor the majority of people will never need a lawyer but a decent majority of people will need a doctor at some point in their life and i would want them to be properly trained to say the least do you know what you call the doctor that graduated at the bottom of his classes yeah doctor sorry but the whole properly trained bit is bullshit most doctors know a lot but sadly the majority of what they know is obsolete outdated not really based on science more like tradition and largely about memorizing entirely unnecessarily obfuscatory jargon laden crap to wit that chondrosarcoma of the proximal phalanx of the tertiary digit oooh such precise sounding terminology right yeah right it means you have an abnormal tumorous lump growth on the cartilage by the middle knuckle of your little pinky finger now tell me how is that plain english not equally precise but of course if its said in plain english like that well you probably already knew that or at least suspected it it just that it sounds so much more scientific and professional and precise as a diagnosis ooooh wow a dia gnosis when it translated into medico anatomy jargon and fed right back to you in that obfuscated form heck you will probably try to memorize the words and repeat them with a sort of pride you have gotten a glimpse of the magic words doctors use etc woohoo oh and as for the actual diagnosis well really the doctor did not have shit to do with that see the x ray machine and the specialist technician excuse me radiologist radiographer performed all of the actual work even including probably writing up an analysis of the x ray image point being that you did not need the doctor as some incantation performing wizard like intermediary to the magical world of radiology he really just a gatekeeper preventing you from getting the x ray and of course dramatically increasing the cost if there was some machine at the local wal mart that you could have stuck your had into pressed a button and gotten a digital printed image and or file to some thumb drive a machine that by the way that could easily be made and the image would probably cost all of a 1 or 2 you could even pay with coins you would have been able to get the same essential result your local especially gp doctor xx years of medical training and experience are entirely irrelevant all he going to do next is refer you to a specialist they are also entirely irrelevant to the prognosis on that your local gp clinical experience is just anecdote based on a trivial and non random sampling on which despite all of the paperwork records he really does not keep diligent track of much less properly analyze the actual patient outcomes and is worth all of diddly squat when it comes to telling you the real prospects of whether it a benign growth or if it has metastasized in short he or she is clueless and really the cancer specialist ie oncologist because we have to use obfuscatory jargon in out titles it necessary for the perception of expertise and of course to stroke the doctor vastly oversized ego well he not going to be of much more use either maybe he will be able to tell you some aggregate statistical figures that he read in some journal the validity of which is probably fairly dubious even assuming the data is recent and not from 20 years ago not to mention the unlikelihood that he even properly remembers the numbers or quite frankly whether he really truly ever comprehends the statistics sorry but most doctors suck at math http www bbc com news magazine 28166019 i mean they really really seriously suck at it especially conditional statistical probabilities https www sindark com 2010 04 27 doctors and conditional probabilities you know like the what the chances are that tumor bump on your little finger knuckle will be fatal most likely whatever he tells you will be waaaaay offbase probably an orthopedic specialist who will refer you to another specialist most likely an oncologist who will ask you if you want to live with the lump or as he recommends get your finger chopped off hint you are going to be soo scared shitless by the big capital c word cancer that you are going to get your little finger chopped off who will then refer you back to a orthopedic hand surgeon to schedule the event and theater to do the actual deed with of course an anesthesiologist and assorted other staff doing the prep gassing etc after which they will bump you right back to the oncologist for chemo and possibly radiation treatments and of course meeting with various counselors to help you dealing with all of the stress of this whole cancer survivor thing said narrative is very important to the industry marketing reputation plus of course leaning to live with the amputation endure all of the chemo radiation hork out your guts sickness thing oh and did we mention hat your insurance will probably end up paying anywhere from 50 000 to 100 00 or more for all of that entire byzantine quagmire process all of those clinic visits specialist consultations x rays analyses etc etc etc weeks and months worth of it but in terms of actual medical technical expertise well your local veterinarian did the exact same process x ray diagnosis amputation surgery everything either all by himself or with some quick trained vet assistant 2 yr course at the local community college for your dog did it all in less than a day ie 8 hours total and at a final cost of 800 including the various medications iv drip anesthesia etc on which he made a nice profit margin but for you lol you are not allowed that kind of service no all of the ama fda quackery means probably anywhere from 3 to 6 months of a long drawn out stress anxiety filled process more time will be spent filling out paperwork doing the billing than the vet spent curing your dog essentially identical condition and ironically said vending machine would probably be better designed engineered ie less potential for screw up by humans better shielded use a lower dosage so safer all around for you and most likely better maintained clinic and even hospital units well they are poorly calibrated and the inspection audit system especially for older units in clinics and smaller hospitals it a joke btw a whole shitload of low cost portable low power digital xray systems exist you just cannot easily buy them in the us because you are not an authorized purchaser and please do not give me bullshit about it it because of safety reasons because quite frankly your microwave is at least as dangerous and your car a lot more so it not about danger or safety it about an industry a private guild system that has a government monopoly the bigger issue with medicine is how healthcare insurance is poorly managed oh the insurance situation is doubtless a quagmire but the root of the problem the whole reason that the insurance quagmire came to be in the first place was the artificial scarcity that the medical industry ama is again nothing more than a guild managed to create via political leverage corruption they the medical guilds insurance companies big pharma entire industry collude with politicians to keep you from gaining access to anything that is even remotely affordable or available health care the whole thing is a scam a highly profitable lucrative scam ,4,MGTOW

DWShimoda, lol no they wo not this article is sort of a perfect example of an analysis by someone who is what nassim nicholas taleb calls an intellectual yet idiot the writer is ignorant about the actual industry his whole analysis begins with the conclusion ie that millions of jobs will be lost to the dreaded automation robots which the author in line with the prevailing faddish politically correct meme is 100 certain is different from all other prior mechanization and he and his publisher love and want to promote that idea because it a basis for what they believe is the answer to everything totalitarian socialism under the guise of ubi basically he just building a case to support that foregone conclusion first step is to go digging for some numbers to back it up and ideally for big numbers in order to make the headline sensationalistic and scary his readers will love that because it lines up with their own desires to sit on their asses and get money handed to them perpetual adolescence basically he like a clueless schoolboy in a classroom writing an essay actually more likely plagiarising someone else essay but still for his equally clueless teacher success is merely a matter of pandering to the right biases of the audience so he grabs at a point industry field that others have already posited long haul trucking what is long haul trucking well he really does not know but it is a phrase he can google and get some big number data on for example this one according to the american trucking association these vehicles carry 67 percent of the freight that moves within the us some 9 2 billion tons a year what does this freight consist of the writer does not know it beyond his real world experience and what is more he does not care and does not think it is at all relevant why would he his goal is not to find out whether his thesis is correct his goal is to convince other people that it is to the author freight is just freight it stuff on a truck it a black box abstract concept that much like automation is both beyond his understanding and beyond his interest he got a case to make and a jury to convince he does not give a shit whether his position is true or not besides his professors in college all taught him that there is no such thing as objective reality or truth all that matters is perception what people subjectively believe and he knows that true because well because his perfessor told him it was and he got good grades on all of the papers and exams when he regurgitated it back but i digress he already got one big number to impress people with those 9 2 billions of tons of freight and that 2 is necessary gives the illusion of a higher level of precision it much better than him saying 9 billion tons or 10 billion tons 9 2 billion tons sounds so much more scientamatiferic and stuff plus he cited an authoritative reference bonus attaboy points from teacher and much more convincing to the equally clueless jury btw never mind that if you click the link well the page in question actually cites different figures over 70 of all the freight tonnage moved in the america goes on trucks and to move 10 5 billion tons of freight annually requires over 3 4 million heavy duty class 8 trucks and over 3 5 million truck drivers see you are not supposed to actually click that link he continues there were as of 2009 some 2 4 million class 8 trucks semis and 5 7 million commercial trailers registered in the us together they traveled 99 2 billion road miles in 2010 see now he got some more big numbers again note that there is always at least one digit to the right of the decimal point the illusion of precision is critical here all that driving employs lots of people in 2014 according to the bureau of labor statistics bls there were about 1 8 million people driving heavy trucks it is one of the last jobs available in the us that pays something close to middle class wages median annual pay of about 40 000 in 2015 without requiring a college education and there we have it there is the source of the big number of people who will per the foregone conclusion be doomed doomed doomed doomed he says three times and so it must be true to lose their jobs what are those jobs anyway i mean what is it these guys do well see they are truck drivers so that means they drive right since the author is clueless and does not care about reality this is all he needs to know especially since it fits the narrative the case that he is building that self driving trucks will of course cause truck drivers to not have anything to do it axiomatic drivers drive and that it i mean what are you come kind of an uneducated idiot the author went to college he has a degree which means he is smarter and more edumacated than you you are not allowed to question his conclusions least of all with pesky little details besides if you are a reader of vox you are probably already a believer in the robots r gunna tak ur jobz meme well okay actually he never really got the degree but he did go to college for two years so close enough to him it just like saying that writers write or that programmers program whatever the fuck that is or that accountants well accountants must do accounting which is probably like counting yeah yeah that what they do that why people joke about them being bean counters lol they count beans and stuff details are irrelevant so as soon as there is a machine that can ostensibly do the driving part well that the end of the job right tada he already proved his point and achieved his goal obtain a big scary number of jobs that will be lost most of his readers will stop reading at that point but of course he cannot resist continuing and those jobs are spread out too npr s planet money made a splash last year with an interactive map of the most common profession in each state over time it s based on data from the census bureau which also counts delivery people as truck drivers somewhat skewing the numbers and he continues with that well i suppose mainly to prove that this is gonna be some big massive problem my god almost everyone everywhere will be out of driving job as a result of these self driving trucks again to clueless writer truck drivers just and only drive a truck from point a to point b why he himself has ridden in many vehicles with drivers that do that there appears to be nothing to it and he cannot imagine that there is anything different with trucks i mean why would there be he never questions that his pea sized brain does not stop to wonder and create a question about those pesky little details like saying hey wait a minute why would being a truck driver be some big job in arkansas and also in maine and also in idaho his clueless state does not allow him to comprehend that the term freight is a misleading aggregation that tons creates a false picture of uniformity and again he never questions what a truck driver does he never observed that creature or profession in any sufficient detail to really know what the job consists of again it just driving he sees zero difference and is entirely unaware and unconcerned that there might be some difference between a truck driver that hauls logs on logging roads or that another truck driver might haul construction equipment here there and everywhere or grain from a field to a granary whatever that is is a granary still a thing is grain even still a thing and wtf is grain anyway he does not know or care he lives in an urban world and food comes from restaurants it gets magicked into existence by somebody some cook that will probably also soon be replaced by a cooking robot etc or again he is clueless that many of those trucks and truck drivers deliver things like lumber trusses and a host of other building materials to constructions sites he has zero experience of any of that and is 100 certain that he is above it and that it is all irrelevant little trivia i mean truck driving is obviously a low skill job does not even require a bachelor degree for gosh sakes so seriously how can it not be easily replaced by a computer robot thing ultimately that what really lies at the root of these kinds of articles they are written by people with virtually zero experience of the real world by people who are isolated and insulated from the wider real world of actual work people who have lived their entire lives in an urban enclave and who existence is as akin to that of a zoo animal with a number of different zoo keepers that bring them food etc likewise the destination audience for these articles is more of the same this is an article in the equivalent of a zoo newspaper written by a chimpanzee in an artificial keep and destined to be read mostly if not entirely by other zoo animals living in equally artificial cages yawn edit also not as if i really needed any additional evidence but the author complete cluelessness is 100 confirmed by his use of coal mining as an analogy consider us coal mining employment hit a high of 449 thousand in 1920 and has declined ever since with some ups and downs the last peak in 1980 was 229 thousand dude is seriously clueless

DWShimoda,even if you entirely ignore the aesthetic aspects just look at the contrast in the facial expressions in the before photos most of them are smiling and often look like they are genuinely engaged in either something fun or at least generally happy or pleased that is the smiles do not look faked or forced but in nearly all of the after photos well the facial expressions are typically what you would call morose generally pursed lips downcast eyes other expressions of anxiety even in many cases a sort of desperation angst frustration these are not happy campers they are not happy people nor are they content or fulfilled or satisfied with their state they are not loving life if anything they appear to be most akin to trapped tortured abused animals like dogs that bit off a limb chew on their own flesh etc although with the animals such self torture self harm generally has some direct and immediate rational purpose some logical attempt to free a limb from a trap etc with these humans there is no such directly rational purpose or logic edit also as bad as the outward damage is the worst is actually the damage that has been done on the inside the makeup can be washed off the hair color will fade and shaved heads eyebrows will eventually grow back the piercings can be removed and most of the holes will close up etc but the internal emotional and mental and psychological damage that does not disappear it cannot be washed clean anywhere near as easily and the scars are going to definitely cause problems later on ,18,MGTOW

DWShimoda, certain types are just allergic to plain direct language all fields develop their own terminology it is not necessarily malicious in it initial origin in fact the coining of new terms can and often does begin with an entirely honest desire to communicate in a clear concise precise accurate and unambiguous manner with others in the field of course it does not always or only begin with that as the sole motivation sometimes new terminology is created with the full intention of being either obfuscatory or exclusive secretive ie code words phrases etc or even maliciously and purposefully misleading and or deceptive in order to cheat or con others but regardless of the original motive unfortunately over time nearly all fields end up generating a sort of jargon a distinct separate language or dialect all it own that is confusing obfuscatory relatively impenetrable to outsiders and one unintentional consequence of that is that succeeding generations of students coming into the field well they too are initially confused by and unable to understand the terminology many of them do their best to actually comprehend the meanings of the terms which themselves have perhaps never been all that well defined to begin with and which have probably grown changed over time as all language tends to but comprehension of not merely the terminology but the underlying concepts the terminology attempts to describe is an inexact and problematic process the end result is that all too often many if not most of the subsequent generation simply learns to regurgitate the jargon and they do so in a rote like mechanistic manner with either no actual comprehension of the concepts or some partial mixed level of comprehension and mis comprehension frequently they end up playing it like a game of buzzword bingo faking their level of understanding by using the terms in inexact and even incorrect ways given a growing field an expanding number of students probably of varying and most likely decreasing intelligence that is to say as the field propagates more and more average intelligence people become a part of it the sort of final end result is that speaking in plain direct language becomes almost impossible and yes alas increasingly most of the people spouting the jargon are clueless they are pretenders and pseudo intellectuals who of course dare not allow themselves to be revealed as such because it would be the end of their careers ergo they fight to maintain the pretense of an expertise they do not have ironically resulting in the fact that the professionals tend to be far more ignorant than the amateurs who have no such vested interest in maintaining a facade fiat money is tyranny obviously not really or perhaps i should say it need not be fiat money is after all just an inanimate object and so is entirely passive it is neither good nor evil and money is indeed chiefly a tool of exchange but since it has no natural limitation no cost that inhibits the rate or scale of replication any and all forms of fiat or script monies can be all too often and all to readily becomes tool of tyrants and frauds counterfeiters etc regarding the previous the jargon pseudointellectuals etc one key way you can identify people who are either a ignoramuses and pretenders or b intellectually dishonest frauds counterfeiters tyrants or apologists for them is by getting them to elaborate about their thoughts regarding precious metals gold silver etc as money if they make some statement really any statement at all about how absurd it is to dig holes to extract those metals to make coins then you know they are either in group a ignorant or b dishonest if they make a further statement regarding a supposedly greater absurdity of reburying said coins then you basically know for certain that they are most probably in group b the dishonest apparatchiks of frauds counterfeiters or tyrants though of there is always the possibility that they are still in group a and are merely the ignorant disciples of someone in group b and are just mindlessly regurgitating the dishonest bullshit of their teacher bullshit they have never had the capacity or inclination to probe and critically examine i wish i could be more verbose with you but i am on a tablet touchscreen no problem to be blunt i mainly write for my own reasons sort of my own little entertainment hobby while it is nice albeit relatively rare to have a deep back and forth conversation colloquy about such things with others i generally do not expect it my writing is more like scattering seeds on the wind one never knows where or when or how they might take root if indeed they ever do at all much less what actually grows from it which ironic as it may seem is part of the fun of it ,1,MGTOW

DWShimoda, i do not live in the usa i think even furgal people would have a hard time live 2 full years with 38k dollar around here well like i said a lot depends on location other factors especially things like your housing situation my understanding is that most people first world or usa anyway commonly spend probably around 30 of their income on housing in one way or another renting or mortgage payments property taxes etc and a lot of people end up spending another 25 to 30 on things like commuting to from work or other expenses needed to keep maintain a job everything from clothing to grooming to quick eat restaurant meals etc where i live central us with essentially cheap abundantly available food well even including property taxes and utilities on my home plus licenses gas for my vehicles etc my basic annual living expenses all necessities no luxuries ends up being right around 6k a year and as insanely cheap as that sounds well if i ever really really had to i could probably sacrifice quality of life in certain aspects less meat more veg carbs lower the heat in the house sell or at least drop license insurance on one vehicle etc and get it down to less than that by another several hundred bucks maybe even down to around under 5k assuming current prices no major inflation now keep in mind that is with my home paid off no mortgage payments no interest just taxes utilities basic insurance and with two vehicles that i own outright etc but it also not exactly starving or even depriving myself in terms of things like quality of food ie i still have a nice fresh steak about once a week decent meats roasts chops full chickens etc the rest of the week for main meals and other assorted food including fresh veg fruit eggs etc and i generally do spend a couple of grand more than 6k a year but the rest is on entertainment various little optional hobbies home improvements other luxuries bit of travel etc ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, and saving is important i have since modified my plans to always have an emergency fund that can sustain me for a year that alone will save you so much stress it unreal this needs to be emphasized and imo cannot be over emphasized even if it not a full year just having to start off with an extra single month worth of normal expenses in an emergency fund which you do not touch until unless there is some real emergency can remove a lot of unnecessary uncertainty stress anxiety then if you can build it up to 2 months 3 months 6 months and ideally yeah that full year of normal living expenses well it gives you a sort of peace of mind and a confidence that is difficult to describe ironically also imo it is that confidence sense of peace contentment or general satisfaction and the corollary lack of stress anxiety that then undergirds and supports even enables you to engage in more frugal behaviors for example you learn how to choose to not spend money impulsively ooooh look new shiney toy i have enough cash that i could buy it right now if i wanted but waitaminute do i really need that thing do i even really want it how much would i actually use it nah think i prefer to keep my powder dry instead etc by contrast when you are living a life that is already full of stress anxiety over money well buying shit impulsively is often done as a sort of pickmeup gives you an instant albeit fleeting good feeling of euphoria a momentary high and really while it undoubtedly adds to the debt and thus extra stress anxiety especially if it was bought on credit it only one more little straw worth on top of the already existing load of stress anxiety so it does not seem to be all that critical and thus people rationalize away their inability to get ahead also in addition to cash in an emergency fund literal cash currency plus bank account currency units one thing that i have personally found to be a big boost in terms of reducing even virtually eliminating all stress is to have a full larder of food on hand multiple 2 to 3 months worth of the basics canned goods dried pasta rice even canned meats that i know will keep for years plus pancake cornbread muffin mix etc there is just something about knowing that say as just one example i have a full 3 months worth of decent basic ground coffee on hand i mean yeah if some disaster happened and worse came to worst i could always just drink plain water nothing unhealthy about that but the idea awareness that i have that little normal sort of regular luxury on hand in the dang cupboard no need to expend any time or resources to even hit a store to buy more is just really reassuring sort of takes the pressure off one entire life i am really not a prepper but i like knowing that i have got that grocery food thing handled there could be a month long apocalyptic blizzard or a major financial crash with banks locked up atm not functioning or even the electrical grid out for weeks and while i might have to worry about heat but wood fireplace i would not have to worry about starving beyond how to heat cook the food fireplace charcoal grill and in a tight pinch well a lot of it can be eaten even without any means of doing that canned food often can be eaten straight cold even dried pasta can be sufficiently rehydrated in cold water it just takes time hours not minutes and it wo not be a pleasant taste but it will work and keep you alive better than eating bugs lol ,3,MGTOW

DWShimoda, i could live for nearly 2 years by just not havong a wedding good to know invest that and with some luck well or alternately get a bit more frugal especially reduce your housing vehicle expenses most of which is typically job commute rat race related and a base of 35k in savings will or could should last a smart single guy a lot longer than that even in flyover land middle of the usa well properly setup that amount can probably sustain a guy and pretty comfortably for about 4 to 5 maybe even 6 or more years before it would be depleted and that would be with zero other income plus that to say nothing of how far long it can get you overseas depending on locale exchange rate plus how frugally or extravagantly you live it up edit seriously no joke at all the average typical woman basically ends up causing the average guy to squander probably about 2 decades or more of his earnings and yeah some of that goes to providing for raising kids but the vast majority of it really goes to what is effectively status bullshit that is of almost zero benefit to the guy himself or really even the kids or the wife even at a relatively moderate annual salary most guys should if they are smart frugal conscientious about what they buy and then wisely save up invest properly be able to work solidly for about a decade or so give or take a few years depending on location profession and luck with investments and then essentially if not entirely retire ie dial back the work effort expenses and again especially if they significantly reduce their housing vehicle costs related to rat race full time work and enjoy a relatively care free remainder of their life working at things that interest you etc the crap about kids costing a 1 4 million or more per child to raise to adulthood is all premised entirely on living raising them in that keeping up with the joneses suburban status bullshit lifestyle ie buying the right house overpriced in the right neighborhood so the kids supposedly get good schooling and then driving newer purportedly safer cars for the children and etc etc move to some back country area away from the bullshit of cities suburbs and buy a place with a few acres of land with some room to roam run and a bit more hands on parental fatherly involvement and chances are they will turn out just as smart and probably at least as well educated self teaching with practical knowledge experience to boot and so better off overall and at a fraction of the cost ,2,MGTOW

DWShimoda, easy solution state does not pay for your second you any benefits unless you get your tubes tied after the first ftfy because otherwise you are still engaging in enabling facilitating the use abuse of children the welfare system as a means of adult female sustenance and if you allow more than one such child per woman you are still going to end up with a dysgenic welfare entitlement dependent demographic expansion effect ie if you allow two children per female the rabbits will still multiply exponentially granted more slowly and at a lower exponent than if they have double digit litters but still the only way to hold it steady much less decrease it is to limit them to one that the reason it has to be limited to one child probably needs a further explanation the mistake with the two second child is to continue to think in terms of monogamous pair couples ie that 2 children is a replacement stable and non expansionary rate of reproduction but that simply is not true because it presupposes a 1 1 male female relationship what can and likely will happen instead is that one deadbeat dysgenic low life or bad boy male can easily mate with dozens if not hundreds of dependent dysgenic females if those females then only have one child even assuming the children are all females then you have a stable declining dependent dysgenic situation that is the number of dependent offspring will not increase if the bad boy impregnates a dozen such females they will each only have one replacement for themselves offspring and likewise in succeeding generations but and if you allow more than one even just that second child especially in the cases where both of the children are themselves female as they are likely to be see within below then the dependent dysgenic population expands to wit that one or even two bad boy male s can impregnate dozens or hundreds of females and then do it again thus you end up with essentially two children per prior previous dependent dysgenic female and 15 20 years later if those two are both female they also can and likely will see within below each have two in turn which becomes four ff another generation 15 20 years avg and that four can become eight and so on with the virtual doublings obviously the rate of increase will be somewhat shy of a full doubling 1 1 up to some 1 1 9 ratio given that it is unlikely all of the offspring will be female although i would not count on it being anything like the natural 50 50 mix because women do engage in sex selective foeticide infanticide and they do so relative to whatever incentives are in place in terms of sex gender allocated resources of the society traditionally that has meant killing the female children in favor or male offspring but that is in a patriarchal system in any system that funds incentivizes sustenance via more children in what becomes an essentially almost entirely matriarchal system then the incentives will skew for the women mothers and grandmothers great grandmothers to kill the male offspring meaning a significantly higher female to male child ratio will likely result keep in mind that grandma publicly funded gravy train potentially ends when her children reach adulthood unless that is they too start popping out kids to sustain the flow of resources can you say incentivized add in that a grandma during her first gen mommy days would get two allocations for 3 people 2 3 but and if when she can in turn have them each have two children then approximately the 15 to 20 year mark ie when the now grandma is 30 to 40 years old if they all remain in a household that household would obtain four allocations for 7 people and while 4 7 is less than 2 3 the base housing expenses do not necessarily increase in a linear fashion expand that for a third generation the 30 to 40 year mark when great grandma is aged a mere 45 to 60 years old in other words still living and the household can now have eight allocations for 15 people again the base household expenses increase but in a less than linear fashion end result is that mommy gets a reward the reward gets bigger better when she becomes grandma multiple times over and it gets even bigger better with each succeeding generation doubling of offspring in short the matriarch still gets richer as her family dependency on the system grows exponentially and point of fact that very much has already proven true the households created by the welfare system invariably become multi generational matriarchal households each succeeding generation of daughters simply pops out kids that grandma and then great grandma grandma s plural then keep within their household and raise often with very little of the welfare benefits actually being expended directly on the children minimal crappy food hand me down clothing multiple kids packed into a bed meanwhile grandma gets a brand new big screen plasma tv etc and all of that occurs often without a single dime of child support coming from the baby daddies who indeed often move into and live parasitically off of the welfare benefits themselves ,1,MGTOW

DWShimoda, plus they go on and on about sound currency but then somehow believe businesses controlled by bankers are all morally pure true most libertarians really do not have a clue what sound money actually is and of course most economists do not even comprehend what wealth or capital is much like the general public and despite all of their pretentious sophistication they still mistake money as it equivalent there are exceptions certain people like tom woods and of course some of the ron paul faction types and a few of the disciples of murray rothbard as well as some others particularly people like jes s huerta de soto the sort of quasi austrian spanish economist who not only understand than banks bankers are not morally pure but who in fact state quite blatantly the opposite that any all fractional fictional reserve banking is essentially immoral unethical and at it root simply fraudulent ie any and all expansionary credit monies are in fact directly akin to counterfeiting and any non 100 reserve banking is a form of theft whose books i highly recommend my only complaint with them being the length language used is too daunting for most and that we could really use a hazlitt econ in one lesson style shorter simpler version for the general public but of course that one of the inherent problems with economics there has been sooo much obfuscatory bullshit that simply stating the straightforward plain language truth is not convincing to most people who have been inundated indoctrinated from birth with the complexity jargon prestidigitation that they simply reject refuse to believe the actual reality and the instant you start to engage in refuting the bullshit well you have to address all of that which like a hall of mirrors is too difficult for most people to endure come away with any clear understanding most peoples eyes just glaze over ,1,MGTOW

DWShimoda, considering how many humans i have seen taking their pet pills because their pet problem is gone but the medicine also treats their own issues i would be okay with this shit i agree with this post 100 i have not seen a foreign vet yet lol true there are so many ironies in that too pet animal meds and hint many of them are legally available w o scripts from farm supply stores etc are arguably more advanced often a lot cheaper and generally at least as high in quality as human meds of course the opposite is true when it comes to common human otc meds where the animal pet version is often premium priced multiple times higher than the generic human brands provided you are intelligent enough to be careful and know what you are doing ie have the base knowledge which is seldom rocket science read up on the data around specific meds application contraindications side effects to be careful of etc ironically something many human doctors are flippant careless about well you can save a shitload of time and money and pain and fucking around and even given that many docs engage in faddish crap they have had pushed on them via pharma other nonsense possibly even avoid problems arguably human docs create more problems than they solve cf iatrogenesis but my main point was more in the line of the fact that as a general practitioner well in my experience veterinarians just seem to be a lot more competent capable and one hell of a lot more efficient not to even mention cost effective in short they are simply more professional all the way around and i mean that quite seriously with most vets there is little to no dilly dallying around you can typically get an appointment and or schedule a call and have t he diagnostic visit the same day examinations often including taking microscopically examining tissue samples getting x rays done even certain blood tests are generally done on site and while you wait at the local clinic generally with a fairly solid diagnosis prognosis in plain english and including generally a decent probability statement as well as other possible causes etc a matter of a few minutes later none of the long wait delays to even get an initial appointment followed by a shitty half hearted non commital exam that is conducted usually involving reiterating your symptoms a half dozen times despite the fact that they have ostensibly written it down nor the nonsense about taking samples to send off to the lab in another city or state or worse scheduling a date time with radiology often at a different location operation business and several days later because they are soooo busy you see much less the additional bullshit of another delay while the x rays are examined analyzed and then yet another delay to try to fit in another appointment in order to get the diagnosis which is invariably we need to do more tests before we can be sure all of which of course multiplies the costs exponentially not saying that the various advanced specialties of human health care are worthless because some of the things more due imo to technology engineering though rather than medical arts are pretty amazing just that when it comes to probably 90 or more of general basic day to day practice the human health care system is almost entirely inept and massively inefficient particularly when contrasted with the veterinary system interestingly enough most vets seem to have a solid handle on statistical probabilities and the implied ambiguity around them relative to specific cases even including bayesian probability reasoning whereas by way of contrast i have encountered many human doctors that do not seem to even comprehend how to use apply simple percentages like of people who suffer a certain side effect from a medication had one dumb broad try to tell me that a particular side effect with a painkiller mood swings was so rare she would never seen it and did not expect to ever see it yet per the data on the med it was expected to be encountered with around 5 of all patients so if she had say 300 patients a year she should be encountering it about once a month but she did not understand that and in fact rejected it when i tried to explain and as for anything more sophisticated like bayesian probabilities fuggedaboutit the typical gp is clueless the we are so busy is pure bullshit sorry but i have done contract work on site for hours and days related to clinics hospitals and i know what i have seen radiology other labs technicians in most health care operations are entirely idle probably somewhere around 75 to 90 of the time and that not counting the inefficient stand sit around wait time that a patient is actually present i am talking about the of time nothing is happening no patient is around no processing or analysis is happening nothing they are chatting twiddling thumbs and etc it just incredibly shitty management imo the entirety of the human health care industry is insanely bloated overly bureaucratic wasteful in an insanely byzantine fashion nor can it all be blamed on government regulations or cover your ass liability the bloat inefficiencies are present because they can be that is to say there is no competitive or other cost pressure to trim the fat if anything the excess is used to also bloat the profits ie cost plus pricing ,1,MGTOW

DWShimoda, i see a problem with this there are other problems as well the statement of no longer a state or federal matter is made only in regard to ordering enforcing child support payments from the father well as you noted but a state which would presumably continue to provide welfare services it does not remove the welfare state meaning the statement that no more frivolous women breeding with everything unless they want to pay for it themselves is a fundamentally wrong assumption and so long as the government is available as a welfare sugar daddy none of the rest of his assumed consequences or changes in female behavior will occur one needs only look at what has happened in many ethnic minority ghettos to see that already in action the women do not pursue and often do not care to even try to pursue child support from the bio baby daddy in part because they know in advance that the men do not have anything to pursue and instead they are entirely reliant upon the government as daddy provider for virtually all of their needs ergo in fact instead of what op picture posits what is much more likely to occur is women voting as a block for politicians that will provide them higher welfare and probably imposing a special surtax on unmarried males to cover it btw that is in effect what is already presently going on with obamacare and any all other nationalized health care systems note the demands of the bitter bitch march they want free tampons and free birth control along with free abortions and of course the perennial demand of feminists free daycare childcare etc etc ,3,MGTOW

DWShimoda, there is a lack of certain skilled careers in the west though nurses and doctors are a good example but ask yourself why the reason is that it is a quota system the medical field industry and it is an industry is essentially operated as an exclusive guild the number of medical colleges and the number of available slots for medical students has been artificially constrained for decades now starting about a century ago cf flexner report https en wikipedia org wiki flexner report and the policies that ensued from it in other words the scarcity is by design and primarily for the benefit the members of the guild who like the lack of competition as it increases their status and their income again see the flexner report https en wikipedia org wiki flexner report as that was the primary goal a century ago the previous medical crisis was that there were too many doctors and it was a low status low pay field but of course worse out of a purportedly humanitarian motivation a lot of and an increasing percentage those slots for medical students and internships etc have been reserved for students from third world nations and thus fewer americans canadians can get in the ostensible purpose of that at least so the story goes is so that they will get training here and then return to their native land to operate as medical professionals there except that in part because of the artificial scarcity the majority of them do not do that they stay here which is then justified as necessary because well gee golly whiz wally we have a shortage of doctors here so ai not it lucky that we trained these indian pakistani etc guys into being doctors and we can now keep them then as if that is not bad enough now that doctoring is a high status high salary field well women want in so add in affirmative action for feminism and force that via yet another quota allocation of those already doubly and now trebly limited student internship slots why are female doctors bad because for various reasons from maternity leave to simply sabbaticals and disinclination to work overtime stress leave practice grief other psychological issues etc in terms of actual functional post graduation practice they put in about 1 2 the total time and see 1 2 the total patients perform about 1 2 the total exams or procedures of a male doctor ergo every additional woman that is added as a medical doctor to the ranks actually reduces the total available aggregate count of doctors currently practicing by 1 2 doctor and then of course that without even mentioning the increased specialization of the medical industry thus the levels of scarcity insanity grows exponentially particularly at the local clinic level and that why when you go to see a doctor you have to wait a week or more to even get a brief exam appointment and probably half the time its a woman even to check your twig berries or your prostate you most likely cannot pronounce her name and she speaks english in an accent manner you can just barely understand but you kinda sorta get the idea that she is referring you to some surgeon specialist and there is not a chance in hell you can pronounce his name much less understand his clipped accent and rushed explanation especially as it mostly medical jargon intended to be obfuscatory of what kinds of medieval torture procedures he planning on doing to your coin toss soon to be corpse but yeah it must be because western young people are too squeamish or too stupid and unskilled which is why we need to import train free government subsidized tuition some kid that never even had a toilet to use when he or she was growing up yeah yeah that the ticket ,2,MGTOW
DWShimoda, as a person who is speculative about most things i have theorized it is possible the mgtow movement is a globalist ruse in disguise the idea of promoting white men to not breed and not look for mates and by extension promoting things like feminism whereby conditions are created that are so overwhelmingly burdensome and risky that being mgtow is the only rational choice also the most likely to be chosen by the more intelligent members of a society leading to a dysgenic phenom with the population ie basically breeding dumber people more animalistic and thus more likely to be controllable as a herd the thing is that such a scenario is in fact a kind of paradoxical catch 22 one that there is not a plausible acceptable risk way of avoiding solving see the problem with western first world nations europe japan usa etc is not that we have some insufficient numbers or that we are doomed to some numerical demographic decline there are in fact more white people and more white children alive in the usa and europe than ever before and likewise there are more than enough nipponese in japan they are still at very nearly their peak population ever nearly 3x the number that were alive in say 1900 the problem is not one of absolute numbers it is one of relative numbers the populations of second and third world or formerly third world nations have been exploding exponentially for the past 50 to 70 years primarily because of the import of cheap food medicine technology from the western first world nations those populations have continued to expand well beyond the actual carrying capacity of their native lands and indeed will probably very soon expand beyond the ability of even the western first world nations ability to adequately even feed them regardless of any exchange there is no nice way to resolve this cf the gumball immigration video https www youtube com watch v zdceliplhwq certainly not at current population growth rates immigration cannot succeed not even with massive immigration from the third world to the first because all that does is eliminate the pressure from the originating nation where the population is then free to expand yet again sincerely recall the devastating horrific genocide in rwanda where a brutal ethnic civil war killed millions in the end even that barely affected the population growth curve of the country it quickly returned to where it likely would have been anyway even if there had been no genocide https upload wikimedia org wikipedia commons 9 9b rwanda demography png ,2,MGTOW

DWShimoda,a lot of so called libertarians have been ideologically indoctrinated into a dogmatic belief in free trade and since they have uncritically accepted that usually via argumentum ad verecundiam ie hayek said so or von mises did or insert authority expert name here and without thinking through all of it premises base assumptions etc much less the implications they are effectively blindered from seeing other options problems if not indeed blinded to reality all they see is tariffs taxes and since they dogmatically believe all taxes evil well therefore tariffs evil toss on bullshit like smoot hawley tariff act caused deepened the great depression taught by all econ courses and accepted by virtually everyone even most so called austrians without much question or doubt and you have got the perfect recipe for some prime idiocy likewise they see border limit on movement and since any limit on movement constraint of freedom evil well again instantly they see borders evil to them it is simply axiomatic a b c the problem of course is that such those things are not all direct equivalencies and the dogmatistic understanding of libertarian principles is not only idealistic it is entirely utopian and remember that utopia does not really mean ideal perfect place it is a latin term that quite literally translates as no where aka not a place or non reality http www etymonline com index php term utopia ie it is a non existent thing the ideals only work in an imaginary fantasy world where everyone is a saint and no one has any evil or malicious intent or action but of course in such an imaginary world well any system would work even pure socialism which is how you end up with the absurdly ridiculous monstrosity of someone claiming to be a socialistic libertarian by way of contrast a centaur or griffin seems entirely plausible and far less absurd lol the fundamental flaw of the idealistic libertarian inanity is the mistake that assuming because free trade can be good for both parties it necessarily always will be good and an equal good for both parties with never any bad neither short term nor long term bad an absolute absurdity because the entire basis of all trade is unequal valuations ergo all trade is of necessity an unequal exchange the parties may attempt to make it relatively equal in terms of net end benefits but various differences in knowledge or need or time preferences will dramatically alter affect it likewise one of the fundamental flaws of libertarian idea of freedom of movement ie uninhibited immigration is that it not only requires elimination of national borders but ultimately via that the elimination removal of any all private property rights as well after all if someone else has a natural right simply via their mere existence to cross a national border and to come and squat or live within your country then there is no viable reason why they should not also have an equal right to cross your personal private property boundary lines and to then squat and live in your backyard or indeed within your home to what authority or on what basis will you appeal to for support or to even attempt to argue that the first is acceptable but the second is somehow magically via the hocus pocus use of the word incantation private property and suddenly un acceptable but but but cannot you see i drew lines on the ground and set markers on the corners gee do the birds and beasts obey your little lines no then why should two legged animals how is that not an absurdity it is only not an absurdity if and only if we accept that social constructs are uniquely applicable to humans that they are fundamentally necessary for a functioning human society again such things do not apply to animals and if humans act as animals then they are outside of human society that is they are choosing to be non human and human society rules including safety etc do not apply to see the additional kinds of contortionistic logic well just go fuck with the typical libertarian about the pet favorite idea of private roads vs unfettered immigration that is the concept that government is unnecessary to build roads since private parties are entirely capable of building them and simply charging a toll for their use well again how is that going to jive with their belief in no borders unless said privately owned toll road provider builds a wall or razor wire topped electrified fence along his entire road and of continues to have some many people policing patrolling and via threat of initiation of use of force controlling access to his road how is he going to collect any tolls at all thus you see how the axioms of most brainless idealistic libertarians but i repeat myself contradict each other and require again much like socialism a belief six impossible things before breakfast the very concept of private roads presupposes private property and the existence of private property is itself based on the assumption that the initiation of use of violent force by either the property owner or some proxy for him is acceptable in defense of the borders boundaries of that private property and to accept that is to accept the same basis for a group of people gated community walled city state nation to likewise establish borders boundaries for it territory and thus to control entry and or repel invasion and migration of large numbers masses of other humans is invasion via both fences walls and if necessary the use of force even deadly force thus private property inevitably leads to a nation state and it will be authoritarian at some level and to some degree you cannot negate the latter without risking the complete loss of the former as well ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, human instincts are a framework designed for a hunter gatherer society being applied to an industrial one naturally people will seem irrational as their instincts are trying to play out in an environment in which they are not adapted for they are also arguably adapted to a framework where there was generally a significant difference in ages husbands fathers often a decade or more older than wives mothers and where there was simultaneously a tendency for one or the other for various reasons including age violence human and animal as well as various accidents diseases to die prematurely together meaning many if not most couples would be unlikely to live more than a decade or two in the so called blissful married state with family basically just long enough to raise a few members of the subsequent generation to maturity moreover most societies whether hunter gatherer or agricultural were largely sex gender segregated which reduces opportunities for infidelity hypergamy plus alongside that you can add in the pre modern limitations of both travel communications which are exponential radius functions and then that combined with significantly lower overall total populations and much lower population densities even further dramatically reduced constrained the number as well as quality of available potential partners and thus options for gains from cheating in short when you are only aware of the say 300 or fewer people in your local tribe or community when fully half of those are the same sex as yourself leaving you with 150 when another half or more of those are prepubescent children leaving you with maybe 50 75 and the majority of those are already taken leaving you with 12 or so and you have to compete for them with 12 or so of your own sex age mates well you pretty much take accept what you can get for a mate spouse and just try to hold onto it maximize it value for the short decade or two that it is likely to endure point being that while there might be a hormonal drive to mate with any all others of the opposite sex it was not necessarily anywhere near as dysfunctional in consequence as our modern world enables it to be there were natural and social limitations on it sex gender segregation was created enforced by both men and women it was not simply male oppression older married women were at least equally motivated to maintain the sex segregation in order to curtail constrain reduce the probability or ideally entirely eliminate the possibility of younger more fertile women from either directly stealing their husbands and or from taking away any of his resources assets from them and their legitimate children to provide for a second family of wife bastard children that is also most likely what later led as cities affluence grew and populations expanded to the various class and or clan segregations each additional class clan separation adds layers of taboos and reduces the available acceptable sexual pairings even further even up to and including things like the constraints on royals from marrying commoners to do so is to risk the loss of royal status and since it is chiefly that status that the commoner seeks to benefit from it probable loss negates much of the value from such a pairing to the commoner as well ,2,MGTOW

DWShimoda, 1 remove the federal government from private citizens matrimonial business altogether for all practical purposes this has already effectively happened both with the federal and state governments people are entirely free to shack up short term long term whatever with essentially zero involvement from the government no license or marriage is required fornication adultery laws went bye bye a long time ago that means marriage is now an optional thing people are choosing to involve the government as a 3rd party and ultimate primary arbiter in their little contractual relationship also that arbiter role only comes into play in two scenarios 1 when the two parties desire to abrogate the contract and cannot will not come to an amicable agreement by themselves and 2 when additional people become part of the arrangement ie children it is that latter the family and or children who are not really parties to the so called matrimonial business do not have any real legal or substantive voice in what happens and yet are dependent upon the parties that are part of the creation of the arrangement whether formally legally contracted or not ergo why the government on behalf of the wider society is getting involved is primarily in regards to those extramatrimonial people the children and the community that has to in one way or another deal with them if you simply dismiss end that latter then you are going to end up with a whole shitload of street urchins to deal with why because people are fucking irresponsible when it comes to well when it comes to fucking and the natural results of it ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda,overall we would need to return to a true and full patriarchal paternal society steps to that end 1 mandatory dna paternity testing determination for all foetuses infants prior to abortion or at birth miscarriage there is really zero rationale for not doing this dna paternity testing is readily available reasonably accurate precise see next bullet point below and comparatively cheap plus it would be just one more trivial addition to an existing array of default mandatory screening tests cchd downs pku etc that are already being performed on virtually all newborns https www cdc gov ncbddd newbornscreening index html and even prior to birth foetuses pregnant mothers parents if dna paternity test of a candidate father is positive match that is a reasonably precise determination that the man or a close family member ie brother is the biological father but and if the father requests then a more stringent 20 marker test should be done to rule out any all other possible family being the actual father because you better believe that happens that right she fucked his brother 2 corollary to 1 is major penalty punishment for failure to identify father candidate s with additional penalty punishment of any woman who incorrectly falsely tags a father candidate btw criminal punitive public record database on these as well why because 99 of the time women almost definitely know who the actual real bio father is and if when they do not it is either a blatant lie or if ambiguous uncertain then either through deliberate deception ie after adultery with chad or jody she purposefully rides fucks hubby as well to trick deceive him into falsely accepting cuckold child or they are total sluts fucking multiple and or random strangers aka in either case a public health hazard aka a typhoid mary of std at least part of that penalty punishment should be a significant substantial cash payment from the mother to any incorrectly falsely tagged father candidate why because it reduces eliminates the revenge motivation forcing a man to submit to dna paternity testing loses nearly all of it appeal as a form of revenge if she realizes it is instead a reward to him even more so if when it comes at her cost penalties punishments should escalate probably exponentially for 2d 3rd or other additional false candidate tags side bonus to society of the above is that it also acts as a penalty punishment against false accusations of rape at least if when they are linked to pregnancy at a minimum it would provide a statistical basis for debunking the whole pregnant need abortion because i wuz raped bullshit additional benefit of the public record is that the availability of this info will reduce women slutting around 3 adultery by wife is option cause for divorce by husband see 1 2 above with default no alimony and no community property why not also cause for wife to divorce via adultery by man see objections below the line 4 no fault divorce by wife still allowed but she leaves with nothing no kids no cash prizes and no means to claim any from anyone ie no alimony and no community property and no custody of children see 5 below regarding children 5 default husband father custody full sole custody if father is not the bio dad cf above testing 1 then he has option to raise child as adoptive father if he hubby rejects child then bio dad has option to take custody if he adulterous bio dad rejects or fails to step up to proper paternal duties then he is a penalized punished and b child becomes orphan and ward of state this does not mean such women will never ever again see their children it subjects to the father control iow it leaves the degree extent up to him point is that adulterous woman does not ever get rewarded with custody of bastard child as source of welfare benefits why should women never get custody simple social policy reasons see under objections below the line objections refuted 1 woman natural right to her body sexual freedom etc if a woman or a man wants those natural rights entirely uninhibited by anyone else akin to say an ape in a forest then they can live in the natural world ie outside of society and civilization she and or he can run off to the jungle or woods and go be all natural there fuck whoever whenever whatever they want murder their babies even eat their babies or whatever of course there is also a price for that namely being bereft of the benefits of a pre existing civilized society but if a woman or man wants to live in a civilized society with all of the benefits that it carries then there is a price for that too the price is that they also accept that certain limitations and controls on their behavior and activities will apply this is what the terms civilized and society mean they mean a group that has imposed rules and limits constraints on it members this is the trade off 2 it is unfair and unequal especially that it is biased by sex gender first of all tough shit the notion that sexes genders are equal is simply a bald baseless ideological assertion moreover one that is easily proven to be a fallacy a lie in any number of ways secondly you cannot build a rational society based on a fallacy lie if you try what you end up with is a shitload of unexpected and unresolvable problems like just as one example the abortion murder of millions of infants each year etc so yes this is inherently tilted towards men intentionally so they are given certain default things default authority privileges but they are also simultaneously burdened with responsibilities as a direct result of those defaults thus while it is unequal no that is not unfair unfair requires adding in all parties including the larger society 3 how why is the inequality justified again because this is social policy and as such is not based on exceptions or emotions or being fair or equal to all parties no such thing is possible anyway any and every system will be unfair to one or more parties or will be a tragedy of the commons whereby uninvolved people are inordinately burdened with the costs of actions they were not a party to social policy must be what is best for the overall society 4 why not tilt it in favor of women seriously look around you a society of single mommie of illegitimate bastard children and we have more than enough data on this single mommies and their spawn are statistically speaking a disaster 5 but your system is not perfect either there is no guarantee that the fathers wo not abuse wives or children etc etc true but irrelevant to begin with remember there is deep truth in the aphorism the perfect is the enemy of the good most seeking of perfect x ie perfect total sexual freedom comes at a massive cost of bad worse consequence y dead murdered children which is worse an abused or neglected child or a murdered one overpopulation and or demographic crises plus devastated families men driven to suicide rampant and soon resistant untreatable sexually transmitted diseases etc etc etc no system and certainly no society or civilization will ever be guaranteed to be 100 perfect and definitely not on a permanent basis we are not after perfection unreachable we are after a stable and generally best for the majority society civilization ie a generally good system 6 but but but exceptions to bad moms yes i know nawalt either you were or you know someone that was born an illegitimate bastard and or otherwise raised by a single mom and you claim to have turned out alright big deal hint not everyone loses at russian roulette either we can literally hand a dozen different people their own colt revolver we could even load the chambers almost full leave just one chamber empty in each have them spin the cylinder stick it to their forehead and pull the trigger and probably one or two possibly even 3 or 4 of them would turn out alright live to tell the tale quite frankly the raised by single mom all by herself is simply bullshit you may not have known your daddy maybe he was a deadbeat who did not even make child support payments but in any case the plain truth of the matter is that in our modern welfare society you did have a daddy it was just named the state ie everyone else in society was burdened with various costs associated with raising you whether it was welfare or food stamps or energy assistance or earned income credit etc etc or simply public schooling your nawalt mom was in fact subsidized by a whole array of productive men who had nothing to do with your conception and virtually no say in how she squandered the resources she was given yet were by default assigned the costs hint that too is unfair and unequal 7 assorted other objections all of which are almost certainly just variations on the 6 already cited above ,3,MGTOW
DWShimoda, thank you u dwshimoda your response was informative keep in mind that the fact that this particular woman in this particular photograph was essentially fake posed propaganda piece etc that does not mean there were not any women doing actual welding and or torch work and who would have known how to properly light and use a cutting torch because there were women doing that they just very likely were deemed to not be photogenic enough instead what most likely happened is that some office of war information ie propaganda department photographer and his staff would come to some factory with a task of getting several photos of women performing various tasks or using various machinery or equipment generally speaking they rarely took real life candid photos instead what they would do is either bring a model along with them or else look through the generally younger prettier women working in some office or clerical jobs select one or two that were the most photogenic and then do a sort of cosplay routine with them after hours between shifts or even shutting down some part of the plant in order to pose and position light etc them to obtain some quasi plausible dramatic looking picture again the goal here was not as many make the mistake of claiming really documentary photography it was to obtain photographs for propaganda use in various government publications as the basis for painted poster art etc and so making things pretty and colorful and dramatic were all deemed to be much more important than realistic the same thing would commonly happen with men too if they were shooting photographs of some men manning say an anti aircraft gun or even pilots getting into out of planes they did not simply come along and shoot photos of group of men that were actually assigned to those positions instead they would select the more photogenic looking guys nice face good hair near perfect physique etc and then they would both dress them up or in some instances down as in removing shirts oiling up the skin possibly making them look dirty sweaty or in the case of pilots possibly even putting a non pilot enlisted man into a lieutenant or captain uniform etc pose position them and then take a series of alternate shots bracketing exposures maybe slightly changing their positions etc and quite often they would pose men doing things in entirely incorrect ways or using inappropriate tools or holding the tools in ways you would not ever actually hold them were you actually using them etc again the point is that they were propaganda photographs basically no different than commercial advertising you frame and pose and position things to create the best possible looking picture so they did not see that there was anything really dishonest about them the goal was never objectivity honesty to begin with edit and of course everyone companies governments etc still do very much the same kinds of things today in terms of marketing propaganda photos just with a bit of a different emphasis now it invariably to show a mixture of different ethnicities and different age groups etc and of course it very common to simply use stock photos and most commonly of photogenic professional models rather than actual employees or customers but the main point is the same reality does not matter making the photo look good and compelling is all they are going for albeit far fewer women would have been working in that kind of a capacity fewer than either the propaganda or more recent retro women in the workforce advocates would have you believe yeah a lot of women worked in factories but most of them were put to work in either clerical positions in places like inventory stockrooms or in either light assembly or final finish jobs oh and the vast majority of them were hired in the aircraft industry which was massively expanded during the war and then massively cut back after the war and even there they were mostly used in jobs that were well the only way to say it is the less critical and lower skill positions from what i understood about acetylene torches is that the flame temperature is over 3000 k and that propane was a bit below 3000 k the flame in the picture is not blue so it likely was less than 2000 k yeah as to the torch the only way you get that big of an orangey flame much less keep it that way long enough for a photo with a nice posed smile on your face is if you basically do not know what you are doing and you turn the acetylene gas up waay higher than it needs to be when you light the torch anyone who was seriously planning on using the torch would on getting a flame like that have an oh shit look on their face and would immediately turn the gas down and or the oxygen up to obtain a useful blue flame as well as save the gas ,1,OldSchoolCool

DWShimoda, can you also count the pipes yes and no you do not absolutely have to have a 3rd pipe to make a gas welding generally more likely to be brazing torch into a cutting torch and you can using a cutting torch as a welding brazing torch in a pinch or if it all you have got though you would typically at least put a different tip on it if you were brazing but in the kind of situation that the photograph was ostensibly taken that is to say posed to seem as though it is ie some commercial industrial civilian wartime factory or repair operation and i am assuming op is probably correct that it was a wartime government propaganda shot they would should have the proper types of torches for the jobs on hand most likely the torch is just a prop as indeed the gal holding it is far more likely a model selected for her age looks rather than actually being a worker who was truly using that torch the whole thing is just a propaganda photo session because virtually everything about the photo is wrong the torch is adjusted wrong she simply not properly attired to be actually using that torch for anything at all brazing or cutting the wrong kinds of clothing and wearing it all in the wrong manner arms not covered hair not properly covered the hat cap is wrong and the way she wearing it it actually worse than useless it downright dangerous goggles in the wrong place etc plus of course she had professional makeup applied with doubtless faux dirtied pants etc ,2,OldSchoolCool

DWShimoda, i hate to be that guy but that a cutting torch her job may have included welding but she is definitely getting ready to cut something if she ever gets her oxygen acetylene mix right you should not feel bad came here to post basically the exact same comment did a quick search on cutting and noted you would already made it plus i would say she not really getting ready to do anything she just a model that has been dressed up in a sort of semi accurate costume and not even properly at that she wearing the wrong clothing and she wearing basically all of it in the entirely wrong way and is striking a pose for the photographer us government paid for a lot of that kind of faux documentary propaganda photo shoot shit back in the depression and wwii eras with the torch as a prop and the absolutely ridiculous flame is that way because 1 she really does not have a clue what she doing at least with the torch i mean she probably does know how to be a model hence makeup lipstick the pose etc and 2 the photographer does not really have a clue either but simply wanted a nice bright big colorful yelloworangered flame because well just because he did it op or possibly the original photographer or whoever tagged the photo that is ignorant mistaken and should feel bad ,2,OldSchoolCool

DWShimoda,technically yes perhaps more importantly so too was the apostle paul who even generally advised men to live as mgtow he even noted it was superior to getting married so long as they were able to control their hormonal lustful urges ie basically staying away from women altogether in the sexual sense not only no marriage but no cohabiting no dating courting no plate spinning or flirting etc and despite the fact that the later church interpretations and spin on those verses and paul statements recommendations reinterpreting them as some kind of a call for men to become priests or monks in monasteries living off some kind of charity from the congregation community that obviously bullshit because a there were no such things as paid priests much less monasteries not christian ones anyway at the time paul wrote that and b paul noted himself and his own lifestyle as an example his statement that he refused to would not eat the bread of another man labor and instead or at least when he was not imprisoned he lived off of his own private business profession trade work as a literal tentmaker ergo he most definitely was part of society the general public private commercial community and explicitly was not walled off in some isolated monastery as paul specifically noted that but a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world and he goes on further to note that the married guy will chiefly be worried about how he can please his wife ie keep her haaaaaaaapy or at least prevent her from becoming too much of a nagging bitch etc and moreover he had already basically said good luck with that when he previously noted those who marry will face many troubles in this life and i want to spare you this and quite probably several of the other disciples apostles and leaders in early church remained single bachelors as well including presumably paul own well i suppose you could call them apprentices or disciples which word really just means students timothy titus afaik there is no record or even assertion of either of them ever having a wife or family ,23,MGTOW
DWShimoda,i agree with most of your post but i do have to insist that you do not really mean the following i do not believe that we should stop people making choices we do not agree with because unless you want to get rid of virtually all laws you really do not believe that to wit what if someone wants to choose to simply abandon a 5 year old child or maybe to simply stop feeding the child stop providing a room in the house for them etc maybe they choose to put the child on a leash or within a cage or kennel in the backyard or lock them up in some basement or possibly they choose to let strangers come in and literally fuck the child and or other heinous acts obviously neither you nor i will agree with any of those choices but i would move that our disagreement is a bit stronger than merely not liking or not agreeing with it we would in fact want to stop people from making those choices or at least to end them forcibly remove the child from them and punish them for it ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda, i know right i am surprised judges are not killed or at least beaten after rulings like that do they pump estrogen into the water over there or something in the wyoming case it really was not up to the judge state statute exists that explicitly sets a time limit ie statute of limitations on disputing paternity iirc two years which in the case that hit the news recently and generally would be two years after the child is born but possibly in other cases would be within 2 years of the man having been legally officially labeled as the father and ostensibly being notified of it ,3,MGTOW
DWShimoda, was the wy dude poor or did he have an idiot for a lawyer i am curious now he was not aware that he was not the father until the child was already like 3 or 4 years old iirc he had been married to the chick prior to the child birth saw no reason to question or test and thus legally accepted the role as father then divorced from her and some time after the divorce was final told him he was not the dad so then he got the paternity dna test court said basically yeah we see that but sorry too late he needed to would isclaim paternity before the child second birthday or within two years of having been officially legally labeled as the father ,6,MGTOW
DWShimoda, wo not it be considered fraud if you prove that you are not the father i thought paternity tests were only banned in france first of all its very rare that anyone ever gets charged with perjury much less do women ever get charged with it and fraud upon the court is even less likely especially when it comes to pregnant women who have a sort of double triple plus good pussy pass ie they can claim mistake and that hormones made them do it and assorted other bullshit courts obviously objectively should not allow that kind of crap but courts are really not objective places not when it comes to women children ,6,MGTOW

DWShimoda, i have been a actual mgtow member and following our movement for 3 years now really an actual member got a certified membership card or something because quite frankly i do not recognize your useraccount name maybe you have just been lurking or maybe you are bullshitting i would hate to see this movement get caught up in politics choose a side and isolate its own members 1 how many times does it have to be said before you fecking idiots get it mgtow is not a movement and just because you popped in here recently and possibly decided to call yourself mgtow or was that meetoo does not mean you get to dictate to others 2 you are engaged in concern trolling and tone policing as well as let call it what it is a form of censorship and here in the us that basically makes you an ally of the sjw 3 i get that you are probably not from the us tough shit most people on here are this is an english language forum that mostly deals with western first world and predominantly usa society and culture issues you coming in here and saying please do not talk about us politics is the equivalent of for example americans entering some persian forum and saying please do not talk about iranian poltical issues or anything to do with islamic sects and other things like that that would be inane and so is your request demand you are a minority guest act accordingly 4 you are being fundamentally dishonest you do not really want to keep all politics out of this sub you want to silence certain specific viewpoints and positions namely the ones you called out how do i know you are being dishonest because you did not critique any other political viewpoints and positions nary a mention of the bullshit robots no work ubi advocates nor any concern over greenie enviro types nor any other of the political memes that invade here multiculturalism socialism other isms 5 when it comes down to it for the people who live in the us well the lines are becoming much more clearly defined soon enough it will end up being either a get on board the trump train or b get on board with the biden quote fight in the streets sjw types by the way that means you will be on the same team as this bitch http dailycaller com 2017 01 30 blm anti trump protest in seattle we need to start killing people and it important to quote her during an anti trump protest in seattle this weekend an activist associated with the black lives matter blm movement took to the megaphone to voice her support for among other things killing people and killing the white house while she said that another protester can be heard saying burn it she also says white people give your fucking money your fucking house your fucking property we need it fucking all as another protester responds reparations regarding that last point 5 above and the penchant for staying neutral it ai not going to work seriously it only a matter of time does not matter that someone wants to remain neutral and not get involved because the intlerant radical left is not going to allow that do not believe me go look at the news of what just happened in the past day at berkeley did it matter that the vast general middle center non radical majority of berkeley students probably did not want to get involved in politics nope the left in typical bitch fashion is trying to force an authoritarian response and it will continue to push push push with increasing levels of violence until it gets that response ,3,MGTOW
DWShimoda, someone already said they agreed to the interview god knows what he going to say that will be used to paint all of us ironic as it may seem it really does not matter in fact i hope whoever does do the interview will simply feed him a bunch of inane insame bullshit that really probably the best way to counteract the game these fuckers are playing at i did find this website on a book he writing aaaaand i hope you know you just gave him your ip address and thus basically your location do not post direct links to crap like that always use an archive or proxy to wit anyone wanting to take a peek at the guy bs book stuff can look at this link http archive is dczfl not the manout us address hell he might have turned into one of us lol not a fucking chance in hell just as the whole tell us your side of the story is nothing but a bullshit trap ((())) are not interested in truth or reality merely how to construct a perception of things propaganda hit piece that is useful to them ,1,MGTOW

DWShimoda,meh really do not see the point of gifting more money to academia much less white men or really any men subjecting themselves to multiple years of crapfest bullshit at them i much preferred peter thiel idea of gifting the scholarship directly to guys to avoid the college system and instead go out and create a startup of some kind imo the best thing possible would be for men to simply and entirely boycott colleges and universities leave it to the women manginas let harvard become a place that hands out nothing but degrees in social work and gender studies and assorted other bullshit see how long their reputation as an important institution lasts ,6,MGTOW

DWShimoda,exactly just felt it might be necessary to warn some of the less technically savvy that they can at least potentially be doxxed via their ip and while said ip is generally visible to places like reddit also well it takes a bit more doing to parse that out given reddit massive size traffic etc versus it a piece of cake for some other independent bullshit website especially one setup exclusively to harvest mgtow opinions ,3,MGTOW
DWShimoda,lol and how long did it take for you to get the cheap ass ink that wapo uses off of your buttocks skin see what i did there lol ,2,MGTOW
DWShimoda, the 22 blonde with the tight body can convince a rich beta to pay her rent or tuition if she throws him a few leg spreadings by using the right websites hell they apparently do not even need to do that anymore just saw something the other day where basically they just do some cam whoring and desperate idiots send them money in exchange for some live video performance ie just spreading legs squatting in front of a cam with the improvements in vr it unlikely that is going to remain a lucrative profession for them for long but hell who knows ,1,MGTOW
DWShimoda,then you realized even your ass and your excrement deserved better ,6,MGTOW
DWShimoda,my advice do not go to visit that website anytime you go to some specific website server software can record your ip and these days it a child task to turn that into a physical location sometimes right down to gps coordinates if op was really truthfully and honestly seeking answers he could simply lurk and read mgtow content also everyone needs to beware of any all upcoming ask mgtow type threads because doubtless failing to get people to visit the website and take the bullshit survey or engage in idiotic interviews op will almost certainly create additional new accounts and attempt to get bullshit quotes to manufacture a fake news piece slandering mgtow ,12,MGTOW
DWShimoda, his purpose is to figure out how to get men back to working themselves to death on the plantation confirmed http www sfchronicle com opinion article millennial men s failure to launch is a problem 6305817 php plus based on this article early retirement selfish unpatriotic http articles baltimoresun com 2008 03 26 news 0803260434 1 social security working longer encore careers well based on the crap he states in that article well shit the cuckwad either does not know his arse from a hole in the ground or else he thinks everyone else is a fucking idiot i mean the following paragraph however if americans retired later either staying in their current jobs or taking up encore careers what marc freedman of civic ventures calls do good later life jobs we could significantly slow the growth of our multitrillion dollar national debt which is largely driven by rising medicare and social security costs as yesterday social security trustees report makes abundantly clear we also could keep more people in a labor force that would no longer be growing appreciably if not for immigrants is just a sign of utter and complete idiocy keep in mind this is an obama supporter and writing in 2008 all concerned about the national debt riiiiiiiiight rotflmfao ,4,MGTOW

DWShimoda,note the first two words i demand this is how self centered and entitled women are even though there are multiple women holding the sign and it is supposedly a demand of an even larger group nevertheless they still choose to use the singular i and not the plural we also they demand really demanding from whom or what are they expecting the trees or the mountains or perhaps the cute little forest friends aminals to concede to this demand obviously this is aimed at men men who are expected to create whatever it is women demand so much for the independent women who do not need men for anything note also not request but demand basically an ultimatum with an implied if not explicit or else but what exactly is the or else or else they stop cooking cleaning being respectful appreciative of men that does not work as a threat because they have already stopped doing all of those things as for them wanting erm excuse me i meant demanding a world where there is no violence against women and girls well i suppose it depends on your definition of world as well as the subjective definition of violence but i am fairly certain we could pack a bunch of them up together and drop them off on some deserted pacific island let them fend for themselves of course to make absolutely certain that they never ever suffer even the merest chance of violence say being eye raped by some male looking in their direction again we will need to quarantine that island and make certain no resupply boats or any other human vessels or vehicles ever come near it again though something tells me we probably could send another recolonization group of women there on probably an annual basis since even in a tropical paradise i rather doubt that after a year there would be any of the prior group left alive otoh if they want a whole planet well maybe we should have nasa build them a nice colony ship and launch them off in the general direction of mars albeit they will have to figure out how to pilot and land the thing themselves as well as what to do when they get there because obviously no man can be allowed to accompany them besides they do not really need men right for heaven sake such a man might potentially oppress them enroute commit acts of violence against them like trying to mansplain something and that cannot be allowed not if their demand is to be met ,6,MGTOW
DWShimoda, february 14th sounds like an odd random day of the year to pick is there any specific reason now that i think about it it probably the day more so than any other that many men say fuck it and begin their mgtow lives ,3,MGTOW
