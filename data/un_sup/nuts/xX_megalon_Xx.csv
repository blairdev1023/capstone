xX_megalon_Xx,yup i know right its a shame as i have kids that love nintendo especially kirby but they have turned into a joke why do they keep releasing underspecced machines they say the focus is gameplay like it cannot have nice graphics developers willing to release on their platform as well as good gameplay lol the switch is basically and android phone ,1,witcher
xX_megalon_Xx,how come you not like it i think its great though its already obvious that the switch will be a bomb bloated with indie shovel ware and no decent third party support not like anyone did not know that would be the case right from the start and will nintendo stop making fucking party games no one wants them ,1,witcher
xX_megalon_Xx,i meant cheap second hand one and wup installer wii u can now be softmodded and games downloaded depending how you feel about piracy if you spend decent coin on a wii u like me it may just seem justified that being said botw is very good ,1,witcher

xX_megalon_Xx,just today square enix dropped io point proven sir ,1,MassEffectAndromeda
xX_megalon_Xx,i feel like its a nasty circle were development companies make deals with publishers for money to get project going yet they pull the strings as to when they want it out what they want added cut its a deal with the devil but development teams could not get project of ground without backing its surely the publishers fault look at companies like project red or rock star when they do not really need to answer to anyone except maybe some shareholders its night and day the difference in quality ,2,MassEffectAndromeda

xX_megalon_Xx,its a bloody good game honestly was it that bad jeez i would hate too see what a terrible game looks like in this day and age i do not think any game can live up to such hype and high expectations next it will be red dead 2 it will be a good game but will get crucified at the slightest slip video game developers really have their job cit out for them these days and the hype machine does not help when will publishers understand this ,35,MassEffectAndromeda

xX_megalon_Xx,just bought few days ago and love it feels a bit like an offline mmo ever played xenoblade x very similar 4 very big open world planets a few smaller ones and a few social hubs can romance and hump most main npcs graphics are great i reckon eyes have been fixed lots of good sniper rifles plus can craft more powerful ones and also craft mods to apply to them i think they have various scopes but feel nice when firing probably a bit more star trek than star wars can also feel grindy but i like that i am not a massive mass effect fan but i love this game ,3,MassEffectAndromeda
