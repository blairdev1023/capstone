indoobitably,not a fan of dsi but si is pretty good dsi ok good at finding cover with si being much better at finding fish and cover but still pretty situational i mostly use plotter sonar when fishing unless its a completely unknown body of water and even then can find most soft cover with sonar save for an affordable side imaging rig or do not waste your money imo ,1,bassfishing

indoobitably,not my fault several colleagues have been targeted and mugged while visiting our overseas development sites trying to hire people for technical jobs with the possibility of moving to the us later we had to implement that policy because we are too civilized for their accepting society they wanted to do as you said go out and see the country and they lost everything they had on them meanwhile every literally every developer we bring over rants and raves about how nice it is to live in a society that cares everyone well being how the collective people regardless of social status know where to shit and can throw their trash away ,1,pics
indoobitably,yup i missed out on the river of floating shit that is the ganges sacred river of life flowing with literal shit or the mounds of trash and shit next to almost every inhabited area or the oceans with literal tides of shit and trash the extent of my posh life ends at the 10 6 pack of craft beer i bought yesterday i grew up on a farm doing manual labor and getting far dirtier than your completely made up bullshit that i will use to make my point because i do not have another argument against reality life in a city being a pussy ,-1,pics
indoobitably,so what you are trying to say is millions of people plus 1 apparently are too stupid to collectively decide to assign small blocks of land for public bathroom use because no one ever told them instead we will just continue to shit in the street because public planning or bettering your entire society is too difficult a task also there is no such thing as public restrooms anywhere in the us let alone major cities we are too stupid to think ahead ,1,pics

indoobitably,yes i have and unlike you i have lived the life of agriculture it is a concern for all farmers and chemical manufacturers they know the cause now nicotine substances used in chemicals is a big one and have begun to discontinue using them just like they did when we saw the results from ddt stop being such alarmists and actually use your brain when you read if this was such an enormous issue there would be very noticeable outside of california and some almond trees impacts to our food production i still see bees everywhere i go vegetables and fruits are just as cheap as ever and yes it is important to take action but the world is not ending ,3,UpliftingNews
indoobitably,yes i read the news too but once again there are still trillions of bees everywhere across the globe we have not killed them off and it will be extremely difficult to ever measure their populations i have bees all over my patio in texas i see bees everywhere i go outside in dallas my family are farmers in south texas and there are tons of natural bee populations down there for the hundreds of thousands of citrus trees my parents just got done removing a huge colony of bees that keep coming back because they are all dead from their house for probably the 3rd time and they live in the middle of heavy agriculture no the world is not ending because some bees died ,-11,UpliftingNews
indoobitably,if a colony or two gets hit when they are spraying inside their cities they arent carpet bombing the entire country everything will be just fine billions of bees die every day from other hardships besides our pesticides they have survived for millions of years and lets be honest humans have no possible way to measure the bee population especially in sri lanka edit for a website that hates alarmist bullshit you sure love to eat up the bee alarmist bs its nowhere near as big an issue as the reddit entomologists think the researchers note that many factors are contributing to colony losses a clear culprit is the varroa mite a lethal parasite that can easily spread between colonies pesticides and malnutrition caused by changing land use patterns are also likely taking a toll especially among commercial beekeepers so yes chemicals are likely effecting them but the mites are doing the real damage but sure some people spraying nowhere near bees is killing them all off ,6,UpliftingNews

indoobitably,baits are presented in different ways drop shot requires a fast action rod to translate those quick twitches down to the bait without lifting the weight bait off the bottom most people go with spinning because these rods tend to have more action in the tip and a lighter reel frog rods tend to be heavier because you are fishing deep in lillies grass and you want something stiff to set the hook pull the fish out of the muck longer and stiffer rods throw a bait farther as well baitcaster rods tend to be stiffer and the reels beefier for handling the extra weight i personally use baitcaster for everything but dropshot for the reasons mentioned most manufacturers put a little bit of text somewhere on the rod with recommendations for presentation or lure choice after that the small differences in sizes really come down to personal preference ,2,bassfishing
