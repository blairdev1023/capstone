BenzoBoomer,opinion on hot pretty girls with significantly uglier friends eg hb9 whose girl group is hb5 6 cannot tell whether this a red flag they are just a late blossomer or what just saying this because hot girls usually hang around with other hot girls perfectly illustrated in high school etc ,1,TheRedPill

BenzoBoomer,kinda rant but fuck whiney people the negative mindsets present here ever heard of a self fulfilling prophecy yeah life is not fair some people have it easier some have it way harder but what is a belief that you will never amount to shit with women wealth health or life going to do for you no wonder it a crime to be relaxed and happy these days when every loser is depressed and wallowing in their own shit it impossible to fail when you compress all your time energy and focus on a specific objective going full psycho is all but bulletproof 4 ways to piss off masses losers you run your own biz successfully you clearly workout dress well fail perservere dont complain social beast ,6,TheRedPill

BenzoBoomer,some of the comments here are so arrogant no real threat of violence what if things go tits up and you have to move to a rough area homeless caught in a riot in a city go abroad and get caught in a dodgy situation natural disasters inspire chaos at time what if your friends family kids get involved with some bad people the point is 99 of the time there could be no fucking violence but that 1 of the time could be fatal and are you willing to risk that also read in between the lines doing all these things would be immensely helpful psychologically eg exercise etc and the confidence from knowing your capable and peace of mind of knowing your prepared ,9,TheRedPill
BenzoBoomer,sounds like procrastination to me you need to practice self discipline more i recommend meditation or physically removing the things that are distracting you like your phone etc ,2,TheRedPill
BenzoBoomer,dance been dancing since i was 13 years old specifically street dance 3 hours a week almost religiously since i first started hated it at first but as i improved i learned to love it do competitions youtube tutorials etc now to get to the point though i kept it a secret for a long time from my friendship group school my older brother use to call me gay for it and it got to me in the earlier days do not get me wrong i moved a little at house parties etc but people do not usually properly dance at them or at least the ones i went to but then at 17 a ton of people from my sixth form were off to this big house music event in leeds so i got a ticket borrowed my brothers id and went along too about half way into the night around 3 o clock a guy in the club started dancing pretty fucking well with his top off in the centre of the club now i was on md this night for the first time and i thought fuck it i went into the little circle space that had formed and just danced i ended up having a dance off with the other guy ton of people gathered around and the dj even called out to the two guys dancing then when i finished my friends swarmed me obviously surprised strangers came up to me and that was the day the game changed for me girls were much more receptive to me people i met on that night got my contact word speed i guess now i am 26 living my dream getting free access to vip area know a lot of club owners in my city all the while making decent cash on the side and enjoying the tail from my dance classes the takeaway from this i guess is do not define certain hobbies pursuits as feminine if you are talented and love it express that motherfucker and reap the rewards ,26,TheRedPill
BenzoBoomer,phenomenal books but you need to reiterate how important it is to apply the lessons learnt in the books make notes highlight the key points and implement them into your daily life similar to trp you can know all the theory you want but if you do not go out and game you will never fulfil your potential and to reference one of my favourite quotes what a man can be he must be kurt goldstein ,18,TheRedPill
BenzoBoomer,mindset is huge just the angle and perspective you view everything at for example when i was shredding for summer trying to get into that single digit bf i used to view it as this is shit i cannot eat that pizza those crisps etc however i shifted my mindset to see what i would gain from shredding not what i was missing out on i told myself how good i would look how great i would feel etc and that motivated me and this applies to literally everything in life,1,TheRedPill
BenzoBoomer,there are some good posts on the sides bar which extensively cover the topic however i would just start by sitting down in a room quiet location and staring into space a fixated spot allowing your mind to be still if any though do arise just imagine them passing through until you return to your original state of stillness it can also help to breathe deeply and control your breath through your body i also read somewhere that visualising yourself in a pure white room can help as for duration 5 10 minutes in the morning night is great and you can build up as you gain experience plus once the psychological benefits start manifesting you will want to do it longer anyway after 1 2 months the effects will definitely be noticeable and remember consistency is key this is where 99 will fail with meditation ,2,TheRedPill
BenzoBoomer,yeah yeah bro i understand your perspective life good why would you risk ruining it i do not conform to the whole burn the boat methodology i am more of a transitional guy myself obviously i do not know the full extent of your circumstances situations but you could start a side hustle etc do not have to straight up quit your job also about finding mentors a good way to go about this is attending events functions where you know high up people will be the most influential person in my life was a guy who i met at a function i wo not get into too much detail but he liked my idea about competing goals and priorities of different reporting lines leading to a lack of clarity and my solution to this i implemented it got back in touch with him and it history from there mentorship is absolutely huge though i am kinda of going off an a tangent here but i do not think it expressed enough on trp you think you got it all down until someone on a completely different level shatters your preconceptions and allows you to elevate ,1,TheRedPill
BenzoBoomer,to summarise how to achieve critical thinking understanding reading improves writing writing improves thinking thinking improves understanding understanding increases power power lets you enforce your will,1,TheRedPill
BenzoBoomer,you say you have it all but comfort this attitude is only going to act as a constraint on you as the fire inside of you dims so to speak if you want more go get more you say you have a great job have you ever explored entrepreneurship starting your own business in your field the potential for is limitless if you go about it right you have a large social circle but is it a quality social circle sure you have boys you can go out with etc but do you have relationships with older men who could act as mentors or deep friendships with certain people does your network include powerful influential people important connections you sound like you have nailed the basics probably more than that you are a man of value but the self improvement game never stops it always there you are in the top 10 why not the top 5 you get the idea explore your options perfect your hobbies upgrade your plates increase your income create passive income keep up the hard work buddy ,1,TheRedPill
BenzoBoomer,the need for validation usually stems from low self esteem a perceived lack of value to rectify this you need to become more confident self assured this can only come about with time by adding value to your life improving physically more muscle less fat achievements in school work hobbies and lastly meditation control of your thoughts is a big thing learn to allow your mind to be clear and free of thoughts because then you wo not be thinking about what others think you will be completely present and consumed in the now ,3,TheRedPill
