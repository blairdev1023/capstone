Auvergnat, it seems that to the modern woman the term boyfriend has a new meaning a boyfriend is now a cuck who provides emotional and financial support while she s off in the clubs riding chad s dick in the disabled toilets at 3am when i am chatting a girl and she comes up with the i have a boyfriend shit test my go to answer is now good on you i deliver it with a genuine attitude of gladness for her just as if she had just said i won the lottery a month ago as far as i am concerned she just told me she got emotional support and commitment which absolutely does not impact how i will behave with her ,1,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,last in date for me my flatmate has a buddy who just went through a breakup the girl apparently cheated on him he forgave her to try to work it out then a friend told him he saw his girl kissing a dude he confronted her she denied she could not believe he would not trust her she decided they would better break up for good because of this insecure behavior breakup is now the fault of the guy behavior not hers spin little hamster spin ,57,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,yet another indisputable redpill observation of a peculiarity of the female mind did you ever wonder how come women all seem to have only dated jerks and assholes when you ask them although you do not see so many bad guys out there well op perfectly described why ,161,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,law 5 so much depends on reputation guard it with your life law 6 court attention at all cost the fact that robert greene put those two laws next to each other is not coincidental the smart man will know the value both of reputation status and standing out attention the smart man will know they are not mutually incompatible equating reputation with being a boring fuck who does not stand out in order to support an argument for standing out is an obvious straw man you can be a silly motherfucker and still have a reputation indeed that is your reputation by guarding your reputation greene only means to act in such way that people do not think of you as a dishonest and shady character he did not mean do not approach women because that bad reputation by all means approach women be the one who stands out and get people talking about you as that fun weird guy who bothers women as long as they do not see you as that ungrateful guy who i would not trust with my money business your reputation is safe ,3,TheRedPill
Auvergnat, from man life published in 1959 you cannot blame our women for running around because what has the american male got to offer to keep her satisfied this is undoubtedly true of men today but it is ironic that this was written in 1959 as a fucking judgment of men then when they did offer a great deal to keep women satisfied problem was the need for satisfaction only increased every year after the bounty of consumer society of the 1950s began that the first thing i noticed too i wonder if the explanation is not rather that women are just going to run around whatever men do to for them ,2,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,couple more important stuff from the first paragraph i think she suffered some depression and anxiety due to some medications women have that natural desire and ability to avoid responsibility so as not to tarnish their status as a wonderful woman this one lost attraction for op but she could not admit to it because it kinda implies there something she could have done about it so it the fault of her medication or health condition so we took a break i know a break is never a good thing but i love her i did not want to end things at all and here it is predictable as clockwork the root cause of all op issues more investment in her than she has in him always remember the cardinal rule of relationships boys ltrs are a valid form of sexual strategy but as soon as you enter one and for the duration of it you must always have it in mind ,14,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,you did not get the point of my comment i was arguing for the exact contrary to what you wrote aka if you want to self improve for the sake of self improving go to some self improvement subreddit there are plenty selfimprovement getdisciplined decidingtobebetter manprovement etc if you want to discuss about hypergamy and how it affects your life then stay on the red pill sub ,3,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,we do not shit on self improvement or saying self improvement is for betas pussies we are criticizing the spreading idea of disconnecting self improvement from its purpose op self improvement got you the girl and the validation from girls notice how you came to an epiphany that it not important only after you got that validation hindsight is always 20 20 if sex with a hottie is that insignificant why do not you stop lifting and stop gaming them so that you can save yourself plenty of time to do the things that are really important to you if self improvement is good for its own sake why do not you go improve your online gaming skills and masturbation techniques instead of the skills that just so happen to lead to the type of man that is attractive to women that why we reject unguided self improvement here on this sub we do not say improve yourself we say lift or become a social master or gain status or become a top 1 man because women are attracted to top 1 men failure to see that distinction is the reason why we end up seeing those posts on here that are so blindly focused on self improvement without purpose that they have no connection whatsoever with sexual strategy today i could write a post on how to be be more productive at work and it would get a lot of traction on trp because of all the fans of self improvement for self improvement sake who at no point would stop to think wait what has this to do with hypergamy ,-2,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,take up hobbies where you meet people are you on the coast take up surfing windusurfing or join a diving club near mountains take up rockclimbing mountain biking or join an alpine club in the city join an art class take dance lessons attend small live music gigs whatever commonalities is how you make friends among the people you meet focus on those who also may need friends singles expatriates newly arrived in town these are the ones who will be more likely to appreciate your wanting to make friends and to make some efforts themselves ,5,asktrp
Auvergnat,men are wired to want to have sex with as many girls as possible whatever the conditions and women are wired to want to have sex with top quality men so this means that there is a likelihood that the girl you are currently seeing will end up cheating on you with someone who will know she with someone but this does not mean that you cannot be angry at them by any means punch that guy and hate on that girl ideally you would want to be able to punch her as well but in our modern world this could have bad legal consequences for you that being said awalt is an interesting concept and yes there is variability in the likelihood of it happening to you depending on the girl some may want to explain away this variability as there being a spectrum of awalt but the variability of the environment is a better explanation consider that they all are likely to do this and all equally likely but that not all will have the environment necessary to happen for example if you put some distance between you two ldr consider it more likely or if she grew up to get a kick out of partying with her friends consider that context more likely to lead her to make a mistake compared to the same girl who get a kick out of staying home doing crochet so yeah basically you are right if the girl has more to lose she less likely to do it but it never means you are safe say your girl has all the green lights she finds your smv astronomical she has low n count she does not like to go out she does not have single friends there is much social pressure to not divorce and you live close by so that she never by herself then the context is pretty conducive to her not branch swinging but if a coincidence of events arise such that you lose your job her best friend divorces and she feels she needs to bring her out and that night when she out a super hot guy is there and keen on her and it happens to be her first love she had lost touch with then you are in trouble so ultimately you can reduce chances of branch swinging cheating happening and you can do so by selecting the girl and controlling the context but given that awalt and you just need for the planets to line up for it to happen you are better off never feeling like it would never happen ,1,asktrp
Auvergnat,assuming that you want it let her bring it up and say no let her bring it up again and say no again let her bring it up a third time and say ok maybe with a reluctant attitude ,15,asktrp
Auvergnat,it is in the nature of women to both look up to and envy men just as it is the nature of children to look up to and envy their parents feminism is women acting on the feels of envying men they really feel men have it better and that life would be so much better when they are at the level of men but their tingles for a man who is better than them come from their natural looking up to men they do not realise their feelings is a double bind either they stay under men and can look up to them but still envy them or they are at men level and they wo not envy them anymore but wo not be able to look up to them anymore ,19,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,i was like you not so long ago could not sleep with a girl who had a boyfriend my male friends were impressed by my ethics saying they would not have so much scruples now that i am redpill aware i do not either and with hindsight i think my friends were less impressed than they said and likely judged me as the idiot that i was if trp teaches you one thing is that women are not loyal their biology not only makes them always looking for the 1 guy they can get implying that branch swinging is their normal strategy but their biology also makes them attracted to different males for different reasons alpha fucks and beta bucks given this knowledge of the nature of women you cannot persist in the delusion that as a man you can expect loyalty from any one woman this is like expecting santa to come give you presents this year when you know he does not exist it will not happen she not yours she not his either girls are biologically made to be comfortable branch swingers if you really cannot fathom getting in a ltr with a comfortable branch swinger you would better not look for a ltr at all you will get around eventually ,1,asktrp
Auvergnat, i have a boyfriend mentioned out of the blue is always some form of test whether it used to demonstrate her own value to see if it unphases you to avoid responsibility if you do hook up or to reject you the meaning is not important beyond it meaning she caught up on the seduction vibe between you two what is important is that you do not get caught up in it and just keep acting in your frame aka if you want to bang her keep running game with this statement of her being completely irrelevant in other words keep what you were doing that is teasing her on her lack of flirting skills either ignoring the bf statement or bouncing on it like it an unimportant bit of information ,1,asktrp
Auvergnat,well guess what you happen to have forgotten something at your friend place you need to pick up and it not too far from here ,2,asktrp
Auvergnat,good man do you have your logistics right backwards the place to fuck her the excuse to bring her there the place close by to bounce to where you can have her isolated to kiss the first place to meet ,2,asktrp

Auvergnat,it the endorphine kick use it to stick to your schedule at the start so that the power of habit kick in before the initial motivation has faded the recipe to not feel weak anymore is be fit know how to fight to achieve those you need to regularly workout and eat and sleep as necessary and pick a martial art and do that regularly too and then give it some time to get there ,3,asktrp
Auvergnat, u mallardcove is right here a girl sending you nudes may not mean she wants to fuck you it could just as well means she using pics to gather orbiters by dangling that carot in front of their nose until you have your dick in her vagina you cannot be sure of her interest in you so stop trying to find a meaning to her sending nudes and wondering how to answer and push for a real meet already ,2,asktrp
Auvergnat,awesome the original field report by goldmund http goldmundunleashed com redpill player steals girl friend zone and this analysis by rollo https therationalmale com 2017 05 31 the utility of beta men part i are both gold redpill knowledge if this post does not reach the top with at least 100 upvotes while some shitty self improvement post about meditation or life is hard makes it i will really need to reconsider why i am spending time on this message board ,58,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,perhaps but why would you settle for second chance when you could have had her at the first one with you current physique and simply by being more sexual and less friendly you would have gotten her one important thing to learn though you want to be sexual in your body language and subtext rather than in direct text verbal communication do not ask her what she looking for on tinder do not talk about hooking up do not talk about going on a date do not ask her if she wants to do naked acrobatics all of these put pressure on her and raise her asd just offer her to meet or catch up or hang out at your place so she has plausible deniability and then when in person be more a lover than a friend tell less stories and ask her less questions keep non sexual topics so what is your job at a bare minimum while insisting on sexual topics do you think those two over there are a couple where is the craziest place you have had sex etc touch her have some fun generate some feels ,2,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,the term sexual strategy on this sub was a poor choice it was never meant to be as in what is my strategy to get sex it was more what are the competing biological imperatives of the two sexes in the human specie aka af bb for women versus as many bitches as i can for men ,5,TheRedPill
Auvergnat, u circlhat is right this sub is a forum of discussion about sexual strategy it the offical definition not a forum of discsussion about self improvement it great that you improved yourself with trp and it surely is a main theme on this sub but it only is a theme because the reality of human sexual strategies is such that women are attracted to men at the top of the hierarchy ergo if you want to fuck you need to improve that said the themes of women are more devious than i was led to believe and modern human society is skewed towards fulfilling the female biological imperative are also recurrent themes on this sub because they too relate to the reality of human sexual strategies the fact that for you trp is almost uniquely useful to help you improving yourself does not mean it is the point of the sub the very definition of the sub or the men right science or culture flairs should clearly demonstrate to you that trp is way more than mere self improvement ,3,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,where do you see fear in the sentence watch what she does not what she says i am not telling you to live your entire relationship waiting anxiously for the day it will end i am only telling you to read the proper signposts along the way women are very good liars and often use verbal communication irrespective of truth but to gain benefits rather than to convey actual information as men would hope if your girl seems upset and after you ask her what is going on she says nothing in a snappy tone will you consider what is she said because she has a history that proves you can trust her or will you consider her attitude instead with all women at all times consider their actions more than their words you can either accept this good tip and live accordingly or you prefer not to and face the consequences up to you ,11,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,the wall is defined at that moment in a woman life when she realises that her looks have deteriorated to the point where she does not have the same attention from men as she used to have so reacts to this epiphany by switching the priority in her dual sexual strategy from enjoying hot alphas and trying to secure one to settling for a good and faithful beta provider what is sharp in the wall is not the sudden deterioration of her looks it not always sharp but the switching of the focus in her strategy later in her life after having enjoyed a good and faithful beta provider and having locked him through popping out kids her strategy might revert back to seeking alphas basically the reverse process of the wall more detail to be found in the rational male second book if you read this comment having not read it do yourself a favor and go buy it immediately and do not come back to reddit until you have read it rollo books are trp 101 ,13,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,you are free now go forth and slay my friend ,40,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,your comment is the exact same type of shitty common sense that lead men who have been happily married to a faithful woman for many years to fail to connect the dots when one day she starts acting distant silent uninterested in sex and start spending an unusual amount of time visiting her female friend nah i am just being insecure and paranoid i have a history with her that proves i can trust her says the cuckold watch what she does not what she says no fucking exception ,23,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,so in summary girl is in relationship with guy 1 who not only has major oneitis for her but also gives commitment without demanding sex in exchange combo validation perfect beta strategy fulfilled girl gets bored of guy 1 betaness and get the tingles for guy 2 she just acts on her tingles and fucks guy 2 adds alpha fucks to combo girl trickle truthes guy 1 into butthurtness and he breaks up she can now keep fucking guy 2 guilt free butthurt guy 1 comes back into her life giving her a good ego boost by showing so much investment and sexual attraction to her more validation girl fucks guy 1 in order to make guy 2 jealous the plan works and guy 2 now invested in her gives her sexual exclusivity branch swinging complete that is masterful branch swinging skills right there kudos to her as for you op you got played from a to z except the part where you broke up with her how can you strut around boasting about your redpillness all your revenge fucking her and her friend she can interpret correctly as a vivid demonstration of your ego investment in her superior value so i know you acted out of bitterness because of seeing crashing a 2 year long investment into losing your virginity fair enough many would have done the same but now that it done next time a girl breaks up with you try this instead ghost her dont text her do not call her do not catch up do not ask for closure do not look for info about her life do not try to fuck her just erase her from your life ,107,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,contact her june 1st saying hey i cannot make it on the 3rd what about the 2nd or 4th that way you get back to a more normal interaction with a date suggestion only a few days ahead do not setup dates 2 weeks in advance because that how you run exactly in the problem you are experiencing where each one does not know how to act without looking needy ,2,asktrp
Auvergnat,ldrs are not relationships period if she not fucking you several times a week then by definition this is not a relationship since she wo not be able to because she far away this is not a relationship the moment she steps in that plane the relationship is over it does not matter if you think she a good girl or a bad one it does not matter if she fucks other guys over there or not it does not matter if you consider yourself still with her or not these do not change the fact that she not fucking you right now so that you do not have a relationship with her now whether you do not want to fuck other girls while she away is up to you wether you want to believe she wo not fuck other guys while over there is up to you wether you want to stay in touch is up to you wether you want to resume the relationship when she back is up to you just be aware there is no relationship therefore there is no expectation of her or you being faithful faithful to who ,2,asktrp
Auvergnat,it is oneitis love infatuation attachment it all different words pointing at the same human feeling trying to figure which is which is a fool errand it like trying to figure out if that dark colour thing is black or noir or negro it just different words from different languages to describe the same thing in the case of oneitis love infatuation it just different cultural perspectives particularly the distinction between a good version love compared to a bad one oneitis infatuation is a loaded scam it only power talk tactics to get you to act according to someone interest for example if i want you to be attached to someone i will tell you that you love that person if i do not want you to be attached to someone i will tell you that you are merely infatuated with that person the only thing that important with that human feeling is that you are aware of its relation implication which is that your dependence on someone else gives that other person power over you if i am looking to buy a car and a car salesman is looking to sell a car we enter a relation in which each of us will negotiate the terms of our contract with whoever needs the other the less having more power in the bargain since there are many car dealers and there are many people looking to buy cars that relation is more or less balanced but now picture that i am lost in the desert dehydrated on the verge of dying and i stumble on a passing water salesman this guy has all the power over me and can basically charge anything he wants that because i need what he has while he does not need what i have in relationships oneitis love infatuation is the feeling that you need the other and if he other does not need you as much they will start skewing the terms of the relation in their favor in summary what you experience is oneitis and also is love but it does not really matter how you call it what matters is that if this feeling of yours is stronger than hers if you need her more than she needs you then it is jeopardizing the continuation of what you enjoy out of this relationship ,1,asktrp
Auvergnat,dude you are welcome to uphold your side of a bargain irrespective of any consequence simply because you feel morally obligated to great for you for everyone else there must be set consequences for breaches of contract or else there is no reason to keep abiding by the terms or in other words if there are no more consequences for not abiding to the terms of a marriage contract then there are no reasons to keep following its terms i know it sucks that humans are not all upstanding moral citizens that cross the street when the signal is green only just because they are supposed to but that how the real world rolls ,3,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,i have no idea about the extent of their relationship only relating my convo with a girl around a text she showed me that was from an obviously enamoured young man expressing his confusion about what was she feeling for him she was obviously sending him mixed signals to keep him hooked she told me she would just wait some time to answer to keep him stewing and then send a non committal ambiguous text textbook perfect game ,2,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,it true and i would lie if i would say i did not feel sad for the poor sap but at this stage i am really looking at it like a bbc animal documentary showing a predator playing with its prey before killing it i feel a twinge of empathy for the poor zebra but mostly gladness i am not it and awe at the amoral violence of nature ,10,TheRedPill
Auvergnat, best convo i have ever had in my life and i love the fact they were so open and not pretending to be little princesess around me why cuz they literally told me that i am that rare kind of guy that just gets it life is great girls open up when they realize you just get it and do not judge them during post sex talk with a current plate of mine she showed me some cringey texts from a boy who so in love with her i laughed and asked her with a smirk what she was going to do about it let him go and end his misery already or string him along a little bit longer she said oh string him along a bit longer for sure then i just laughed some more ,189,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,i would say it more that a significant percentage of people on this sub are still in the anger phase and come here to read about women being bad people not to see a major ec confirming that they actually are victims of the society that emasculated men ,16,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,that because females are attracted to stand outs the male in any species is the experimental sex it displays more variation in all traits that females so that females can choose among those unusual traits and allow the production of a next generation with some variety on which natural selection can then act selecting among those unusual traits those that increase chances of survival and reproduction above the average others that why males in every species are invariably the sex with the most unusual physique or colourful traits or the most strange behaviors but that female choice is moderated by a drive the other way for the top examples of a the more common trait and that why women end up with fantasies for men at the top of the hierarchy athletes famous people band leader but also the stand outs the struggling artist that society does not understand the rebel the ex con ,5,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,garbage men and soldiers do not need to go to school but you are still right about society being shaped by the elites school was invented to create a specialized workforce for urban factories and these indeed do not need to learn how to budget or keep healthy ,1,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,girls your age get offered so much alpha dick and so much beta orbiter resources on a daily basis that they have zero need for any form of continued relationship with one man you want something from them that they have zero interest in providing this leaves you with two options stop wanting it or offer something in exchange that they want ,3,asktrp
Auvergnat,good thinking this actually may be the best illustration that modern human culture is centered around the female biological imperative of your two observations the first male display is a matter of females having the choice in the mate selection male must reluctantly comply with female decision while the second male persistence is a matter of males having the power to impose their choice female must reluctantly comply or the male aggressive persistence might end up having bad consequences for her the fact that the second is not socially acceptable while the first is the rule of the land should make it really clear to you whose biological imperative is the norm in human society ,6,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,it just looking at her while imagining she naked and you want to bang the shit out of her a gaze expressing strong intent and strong lust not dissimilar to that of felines hunting focused on their prey and she will understand that gaze count on it the proper way to express your sexual intent and that you find her attractive just do not pull it too early generate some attraction first ,7,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,that is very very true everything in the book is about lovemaking not seducing dating relationship ,1,asktrp

Auvergnat,fuck congruence it might give you a feeling of moral superiority but that about it given red pill awareness and a desire to fuck a man has no choice but being machiavellian if you go out with a girl at a gig and do not like the band and tell her so you being a downer wo not make her attracted to you you feel like shit today and she asks how you go and you tell her same result you feel weak and she asks you how you go and you tell her same result what you should do is act in accordance with red pill theory irrespective of your mental state and then over time have this theory end up defining who you are you will achieve congruence then ,3,asktrp
Auvergnat,think of the ways you can get them to emote not you the whole point of rose i love you example is to get her to feel the love,4,asktrp
Auvergnat,i always say that lift is the 1 advice on trp for so much more than looking better the frequency and regularity of your program teaches your discipline progressive overloading teaches you that you can never rest you always need to reach the next level the delay before getting results teaches you patience the fight against gravity teaches you that you can act against the inertia of the material world actually that you should do so the ability to move massive amounts of weight teaches you self confidence and self reliance looking good builds your self esteem doing the most basic effort human males were meant to do allows you to reconnect with your inner nature as a man i have done a lot of hobbies in my life nothing comes close to weight lifting for combining all of these experiences that define what it is to be a man and the fact that women are instinctively attracted to the physical results of a man who regularly pushes his limits in weight lifting only confirms this is core masculinity i still dislike the physical pain of lifting and would rather spend my time enjoying one of my many hobbies instead but i keep lifting anyway because of all the above and this is why you should too now about the specifics of what you mentioned girls are instinctively attracted to strength in men that what defines their desire for alpha one of this strength is physical strength and shows as height weight and a fit body being fit does attract girls if you take a man any man with all his life experience attitude body language voice tone social skills and you make this man fitter he will be more attractive than the non fit version of himself now the two caveats are this a man who is very fit automatically gives the impression of a man who spend a lot of time in the gym with all the judgements that any particular woman will have if you are trying to game a bookworm who has prejudices against gym bros then her judgement of you as a shallow man might overcome her attraction to your fit body sometimes they dont and that how gym bros get shit tons of women even some who claim to hate guys who are too muscly a woman who is past wall with baby fever and in need of a wealthy beta to exploit will not consider you as a good relationship prospect if your attractiveness is too high meaning you have chances to stray but you do not want to be beta bux anyway just be the one she cheats on that husband with ,2,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,awalt op traditional women know the value of a good and faithful beta but if you either drop your providing or get her to meet another better provider or give her an opportunity to fuck an alpha without the consequence of losing your providing you will witness first hand how quickly she will act just as trp predicts ,12,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,and this points out at the main thing you can do to avoid rape accusation and that missing from op list 0 be discreet do not brag around about your sexual encounter do not give details to anyone in your common social network based on the stories i hear around the number one reason women make false rape accusations is to cover up their social status or current relationships she will throw your entire future under the bus in order to save her social standing by being very discreet about your sexual encounter you seriously diminish the risks on her social status and as a consequence you seriously reduce the chances she will need to do something to cover it up ,18,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,mind developing why the way i see it is that women liking black men is the natural expression of their desire for an extreme masculinity that they cannot find in white men of their generation so i do not find this unnatural if anything the knowledge of women natural attraction triggers thanks to trp makes me wondering why not all girls do not prefer black guys for the af side of their strategy ,1,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,agree but to tone down a bit vulnerability weakness are not of those masculine traits that are attractive but they do happen in the process of seducing women or maintaining a relationship which is the same do your earnest not to show any vulnerability or weakness however we do have weaknesses and we do experience vulnerability it important to acknowledge one shortcomings to start with because doing away with them necessitates we first recognize them ,2,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,from another comment i wrote your intent shows best in your body language when you approach a girl and start talking to her when you escalate physically when you look at her eyes when you talk to her she can read those signs very well you do not need to verbalize it especially if by verbalizing it you cannot help yourself saying things that lower your value in her eyes being stereotypically attractive or not does not change that general approach of showing your sexual intent through body language only if she is not attracted to you she will make it understood to you by stalling the conversation or back too to your physical escalation you just need to understand the message and then either abandoning the approach or continuing it with less escalation and more dhv negs tease fun because you have understood by then that you had not generated enough attraction in the first place ,2,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,when i read women desire to be desired i thought this guy has read manson models when i read this requires a lot of vulnerability i thought that gotta be copied straight out of models let me criticise positively and negatively is sexual intent important yes the sexually active and attractive male does not refrain from expressing strongly through body language his desire for sex is sexual intent attractive debatable girls have a special name for unattractive males with sexual intent creep going back to romance novels the heroes are attractive men with a strong sexual intent would have anastasia fell in love with christian grey and his sexual intent had he been an ugly garbage man rather that an handsome millionaire with all the respect i have for buss and despite my agreement that women desire to be desired that statement is most likely incomplete women desire being desired by attractive men do you need to be vulnerable bullshit the main flaw in manson models in my opinion vulnerability is not a masculine trait and there no evidence in my experience neither does it makes sense that women get tingles from a vulnerable man what vulnerability is is a chink in the armour of the attractive man a weakness that allows a girl to unconsciously understand she can hook that attractive guy if you are unattractive or struggling to generate attraction in a woman do not even think of displaying your soft belly if you already have her vagina tingling at your sight though if you already have her as a plate on rotation then yeah maybe do so to give her the feeling that she can get you for herself that will spike up her feelings and comfort a bit here what roissy had to say about vulnerability game https heartiste wordpress com 2009 01 29 vulnerability game as you can read that not a weapon to use often to use until you have attraction and to use if you do not have a good grasp of game already to know when it appropriate to pull you can have a strong sexual intent without showing vulnerability it actually more powerful that way if you can make yourself attractive first then make it clear to the attracted girl that you are a sexually active man and then you can make her understand that you do not even care if she rejects you because you are un vulnerable then it is when you will get the best response sorry i m being kidna weird honestly i m just feeling nervous because you re intimidatingly attractive giving her a compliment on her attractiveness tell her it intimidates you this is a terrible way to make her understand your smv is below hers while telling her you are uncomfortable hitting on girls why do not you ask her if you can offer her a drink while you are at it not surprised you have mixed results sometimes it doesn t but either way my night is always better for it because i get over my fear of letting women know i m attracted to them and in so doing i let myself feel attracted to them emotionally you know what makes for a better night getting laid ,17,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,talking about sexual arousal men are sexually aroused by features of beauty and youth in women our screening for those other criteria you cite are trifles in comparison to those criteria that influence us subconsciously and are manifest by the raging boner we get when we see a woman that fits those criteria women are sexually aroused by features of beauty in men as well as a flurry of other masculine features including all those that demonstrate physical mental and social strength you do not get a boner when you see an ugly girl leading a famous band on stage women do get aroused when they see an ugly man leading a famous band on stage your idea that other criteria are important when screening for a ltr are just as important as when women say they want someone who is sensitive and listening to her these are rational wants that do not stand a second against emotional desires ,2,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,awesome trp material right here good share but hey ben is rich he looking to start a family he the right age he has all those things that i cannot compete with right now it all a perfect example of demographics from the book models you are wrong here ben is in the beta category she loves him because he fulfills the bb side of her sexual strategy where she is safe and secure and cared after her finding him boring and not good in bed confirms it that still leaves the af side of her sexual strategy wide open she needs the good genes the jerk attitude the mystery the danger and you have been providing that especially the fact that we cannot continue do that it bad is the strongest aphrodisiac i know of it breeds both her horniness and yours like crazy need to make a post one day about that but basically if you can manufacture a reason why it not socially appropriate to have sex with her so you should just stop sex will remain on her mind and yours at all times like dangling a toy just out of a cat reach makes it go wild if you can plant in her mind the idea that it ok it natural it important to follow one feelings let just keep this our little secret then you will have a horny fuck buddy for a long time the only issue is the cognitive dissonance between her good girl image and her actual situation of having both bb and af leads to huge amounts of hamstering and that what you have been experiencing the hamster needs to offload the bad feels onto your shoulders my suggestion move out but only after you have planted that idea above in her mind then you will be living away from that drama yet still have her on a booty call ps demographics in models is not so much about the pool of people who make a suitable husband wife or society class it sounds it is it just is your pool of potential sexual mates if you are a loner or leave in a small town or do not have many hobbies you are in low demographics situation if you are social have lots of friends lives in a city have hobbies in which you meet many girls then you are in high demographics situation mark manson only meant that it a numbers game and that if you want girls you cannot do without being in a place where there are girls ,6,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,first i was a social retard and now i am not traveled enough you like to talk shit but that does not back up your opinion answer my question would you smile and say hi to someone who obviously attracted to you when you are not to them are you implying that you are from some culture that does that ps nevermind i checked your comment history and you obviously do not have the life game and girls experience to know what you are talking about keep reading the sidebar keep approaching girls particularly those who return your gaze and smiles seriously ,3,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,ok i want you to visualize the following say you are in a cafe by yourself at some point you look up and cross eyes with a man now you know that usually people do not stare long and just go back to their thing but this one holds his gaze at you and that when you notice from his clothes hair and attitude that he a flamboyant gay man he seems to have noticed you checking him out and now still holding his gaze he cracks a smile at you and waves at you now assuming that you are not gay yourself and therefore disinterested in that man what do you do now picture the same story but not with a flamboyant gay man but a very fat and ugly woman who you find repulsive same question look at me in the eyes well the screen and tell me that you are going to do something else but just give the most neutral nod and advert your gaze and go back to your coffee like it the most interesting thing in the world that has all your attention and completely ignore that person and just spend the next seconds hoping that he she got the message and that he she not going to walk to your table to start a convo tell me if you dare that you would instead of the above smile and look at him her in the eye just because you are being nice the body language of sexual interest and that of sexual disinterest are both obvious extremely different you would be the socially awkward one or a very young and inexperienced one not to be able to tell the difference ,17,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,if it lasts more it counts as an ioi and you would do well break a light smile if she smiles back it counts as an ioi and you would do well say hi wave or nod upwards if she reacts with anything else but looking away without smiling like you do not exist it counts as an ioi and you would be stupid not to open the conversation after receiving three iois ,10,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,not sure where this idea of an active first date comes from i mean sure you want to give her feelings but making the effort to do something unique with someone you do not know yet sends all the wrong messages in terms of over investment my approach first date is a cafe or walk on the waterfront it just to get a feel for each other so it must be easy convenient cheap and in such way that any of us can bail at any time if it gets weird i could not imagine something worse than being stuck for hours with a disagreeable stranger you feel no connection with if we connect and i think i would totally bang her then i will suggest to bounce to another place involving some light sexual charge alcohol to loosen it up and some moderate amount of fun a bar a live gig etc a place to kino see you must make it paradoxically both clear and covert that you have a strong intent to have sex with her women are attracted to men and men want to have sex with women it expected from a man to want to have sex a woman may complain that a man only want sex from her but she might still fuck him while she will ignore or string along the man who want to take it slow or to be friends first or do not mind going on a third date on a row without sex being a possibility if you do that she going to start seeing you as an asexual friend and stop wanting to have sex with you and she will lose interest so logistics to lead to sex must always be on point even if it might not happen in the end if you organize a complex date that has no chances to lead to sex asap you are sending the wrong message only down the line after first couple sex i may invite her to come with me rock climbing or surfing or do some activity to hook her up on feelings that the reward i give her for putting up and being attracted to me and it just confirms she made the right choice ,5,asktrp
Auvergnat,1 the real instigator of the war was agamemnon brother menelaus the lawful husband of helen for him it was just pride his wife had been taken off him by some pretty boy so he just had to go and kill him or else he would be seen as a cuck by everyone for agamemnon it maybe a sense of responsibility towards his brother but mostly i reckon a way both to demonstrate political and military domination in the area and put an end to the growing threat that was troy 2 helen left a king menelaus for a male model paris but i do not think there any need to analyze it in terms of hypergamy or stockholm syndrome at that epoch women had no choice by force or not she would have been taken away but perhaps had paris been an ugly loser she would have maybe chosen to kill herself instead of following along 3 agree although men can be intelligent and cunning raw masculinity is better illustrated in raw physical strength cunningness is more a trait of the ones that are too weak to impose their will by force that why women are not attracted to cunningness intelligence though they are attracted to the social status one may gain thanks to his cunningness intelligence ,1,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,well if you are interested to know my understanding from the book have not watched the movie is that acheans went to war out of a combination of owing to agamemnon likely spoils of war to gain promises of lands and riches from agamemnon longstanding hate for trojans who would be going on occasional raids in greece helen was enamoured with paris for his beauty but she did not have much choice to follow him or not after he raided her place she was definitely remorseful for being responsible for the war the horse was odysseus idea and you can call him cunning or machiavellian but given the number of trojans he killed with his own spear you cannot say he was not masculine best description would be a that he was a good war strategist and after losing countless men and friends to the war you could hardly blame him from figuring out a solution to put an end to it i also read the book as part of high school curriculum and found it boring was too young to appreciate it re read it with a redpill awareness and it an entire different story ,4,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,not sure if i agree with the author your quoted the section he specifically quoted compares hector strength to that of other men of his own generation it seems more to me like one of the many references in the book about hector being the best of men in troy which justifies why he was its military leader and a favorite of some gods also hector had many many brothers priam definitely made good use of his status as king to fuck every woman in troy and the book definitely emphasises how he was the best of all of them and priam favorite so it not a very long stretch to imagine that his generation specifically referred to his own brothers i do not remember the book arguing that modern men for homer times had become weak but it possible and a common complaint at all times and in the context of a story about the heroic exploits of super human men it would be very natural to make such comparisons when in a superman movie you see superman lifting a car one handed to the astonishment of nearby regular people it not a social commentary as to the weakness of regular people it just a way to stress how superman is special ,2,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,i confirm op comment the iliad finishes with achille giving back the body of hector to his aggrieved father the war still ongoing and troy yet to fall but most importantly it not the trojan war story that is a valid trp commentary it specifically homer personal take on it everyone may tell the story the way they want but homer version is quite objectively an ode to pure masculinity with the exception of the borderline gay love of achille for his friend patroclus most men in the iliad display typical masculine features often in emphatic ways extreme physical strength extreme cunningness extreme honor extreme in group kindness and out group hate extreme sexual desire extreme blood thirstiness extreme greed extreme competitiveness extreme leadership non heroes also display not so great masculine features almost as a way to provide contrast with the heroes particularly fear of the strong enemy as well as the occasional desperate plea for mercy which is often answered by immediate death punishment for that cowardice women in the iliad are mostly just there crying and praying to the gods for the return of their man and sons for not being raped too much if the enemy wins and for their kids not to be slaughtered but preferably sold in a slavery they might escape in the future so all in all a strong dose of natural sex roles and horror of war realism notwithstanding the gods which are but personifications of nature human emotions and human concepts such as luck or fate completely free of any ideological wishful thinking as for the heroes their extreme masculinity definitely make them interesting trp examples i am particularly fond of ajax for not owing his exploits to gods like most others and of odysseus for showing a cunningness composure and political sense that is unique among the heroes and truly illustrates him as a natural leader of men ps another major dose of red pill awareness in the iliad is the relationship between zeus and his wife hera zeus sleeps around and barely tries to hide it hera hates it but hey he the king of gods so her vag tingles anyway zeus imposes his will on other gods by sheer physical threat and even if his brothers resent him for it they just cannot do anything else but bow down to superior strength hera uses her status as wife of zeus her cunningness and her charms to impose her will on others she even regularly tricks zeus into fulfilling her plans when every other god just bends the knee she also bad mouthes other goddesses and plot with others to fulfill her interests by very far the most cunning of all characters in the book is its main female protagonist there is no greater illustration in the literature that i have read of how men naturally get power from strength and domination and women naturally get power from cunningness and charm than the relationship dynamics between zeus and hera in the iliad ,6,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,not entirely because the more trp gets popular the more of these voters are clueless newbies who upvote what sounds good to their inexperienced ears but that the curse of reddit anyway the way to fight it is to read the sidebar and recommended books and blogs more than you read the sub and when you read the sub pay most attention to the comments by ecs and then the most upvoted comments whenever i read a post i first scroll for ecs comments and answers especially the ecs i know who are consistently pure trp knowledge mattyanon whisper arch winger mentorpheus vassiliy etc always ,7,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,you wo not get her back girls are repulsed by needy men your wanting to be in a relationship with her before she does it made you look needy to her upset to learn she was not exclusive made you look needy admitting your infatuation wanting to get her back thinking about her all the time needy needy needy absolutely everything you do out of infatuation she interprets as you being needy and it lowers your chances to get her back again again and again because non ugly girls have their pick of men they can desire the best ones and your consistent display of neediness just demonstrates clearly to her that you are so low value you do not even think you could get a replacement for her we do not live in a world where women value a man love as an attractive feature it actually a repulsive one it sucks but that the way it is now even if you were to understand this now and do the appropriate move stop trying to get her that would probably be too late anyway she now sees you with a giant neon sign over your head that says needy and even if you were to become a hot muscular dude who have lots of women and does not care about her what you would need to be to have her she would still see you with that giant neon sign over your head and believe all those improvements are just fluff to cover up the neediness that now characterizes you so yeah conclusion you wo not get her back just make peace with it so maybe mourn for one more day as if she had died and move on with your life ,2,asktrp

Auvergnat,on one side women feel an urge for validation and a man love is the ultimate validation so they crave for it on the other side women are attracted to men who are superior to them that hypergamy that how they roll and a man who is superior to them is not invested in her if a man loves her she interprets it often correctly as a proof of his investment in her and if it more investment than hers then he is not superior to her and she loses attraction so it a catch 22 for women on one side they desire the love on the other they react negatively to it if they receive more than they give however the pull for validation is happening in the moment whereas the repulsion she feels for a man too much in love with her is happening in the future so at each moment she privileges her need for love until she gets it solution do not show tell them you love her or only tell them after they do as long as you maintain lesser investment than hers you are in the green ,18,asktrp

Auvergnat, lift is not trp only answer it the answer as to what is the first thing to do when you discover trp as much as you hate it pua mental jiu jitsu can turn a virgin nerd into an experienced player and game still remains a cornerstone of trp and that because trp is about understanding the reality of women sexual strategy and that reality includes the fact that girls are attracted to the dominant frame displayed by a social master asking a girl to coffee is something you do once she attracted to you if you do it before you have attraction you get rejections and or flakes some girls are attracted to you off the bat and you can straight ask them out but for all others who have not made up their mind about you yet you need to lay the ground work until she attracted to you and only then you can ask them out maybe you are physically attractive enough that you can afford to bypass learning the social mastery necessary to generate attraction from scratch through a social interaction then good on you everyone else needs game asking a girl to coffee is something i do and it gets me girls but it only does if i sense attraction from her if i go for it too soon i get flakes and since in most case attraction does not happen off the bat because i am not classically handsome i need to generate it thanks to game i cold approach her with an elderly opener and a time constraint followed by subtle but steady of display of high value shitloads of rambling and comfort building chitchat until i get enough indicators of interest to allow me to guess she attracted and then i pull the trigger for everyone in my case mental jiu jitsu is a requirement ,8,TheRedPill

Auvergnat, girls intuitively understand this i think it why a guy sleeping around but maintaining a special interest connection with her is something she can accept but if that same guy were to emotionally cheat on her by developing a close bond with another girl that would be far more devastating i think the emotional jealousy of women is more due to the important risk of losing the resources of the bb man they invested in in an equivalent manner as physical jealousy in men is due to the important risk of losing the certainty of paternity in the woman they invested in so i do not really see how women picking up on men possible desire for the one would factor in but hey different hypotheses i guess there are some girls you are erring dangerously near nawalt territory the emotional bond comes from women emotions whether due to sex or pedestalizing a man a woman can have sex with an attractive alpha without feeling bonded to him but simply out of sheer sexual attraction similarly a woman can have sex with an unattractive beta without feeling bonded to him but simply out of calculated need to keep his resources i know plenty of girls in the first case ,1,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,i did not mean to imply girls are 100 content with one guy quite the contrary my entire thesis was that af bb is their operating software by yet most of them are exclusive to one men i only meant that reality gets in the way of their realizing the dual af bb which you basically imply when you say the only thing that stops a woman from attempting to branch swing is when her smv drops due to age it basically equivalent to lack of sexual options in my list of things that get in the way perhaps i should have wrote yet most of them are temporarily exclusive to one men at any given time ,4,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,no evidence just my hunch but my hunch is in agreement with what you say the only currently available evidence that somehow support trp theory is the work done in evo psych about short and long term mating strategies see buss and others the problem is that literature is so controversial that there not enough being done in that direction and even the work of these guys is tainted by their need to bend to the social morals of our time my hunch is a combination of that existing literature trp theory my experience and that i witness in others the current state of my theory is that both men and women have a dual competing sexual strategies but i do not see it in terms of short versus long term more in terms of co existing strategies present at all times and whichever prevails at any time is dependent on each person situation i see it like hunger and thirst both are existing valid urges which you kinda have at the same time yet feel differently strongly depending on the situation mostly you will feel thirst if you are already satiated with food and you will feel hungry if you have already satiated with water and also picture them as mutually competing as in when you are looking for food you sort of cannot be looking for water and vice versa i now it not accurate but bear with me it just to help in the comparison women desire the af and they desire the bb but they cannot find it at the same time different ages different period of the month and they will privilege one urge over the other particularly when they are young and extremely desirable and have a lot of men wanting them as partners they will privilege af and when they are old and the only guys who want them are just wanting them for sex they will privilege a search for bb that is obviously occurring in conjunction with men strategy aka as women smv drop so does the interest of the top men aka alphas and as a result they are forced to settle with less attractive men and therefore seek among the non alphas those that are willing to provide aka bb i picture men with a similarly dual but different strategy they desire the sexual variety sv with no strings attached and they desire the one true love otl to which they can give their commitment but what drives the difference in urge i think is their sexual options if they are obviously desirable alphas they will pursue sv more if they are lacking in options they will focus all their attention on finding otl as with the hunger thirst comparison men still want both but depending on their situation sexual options they might be so focused on one strategy that they barely feel the other accordingly both men and women respective dual strategies work in lockstep men with sexual options are attractive so they pursue sexual variety while women pursue them as alpha fucks men without sexual options are unattractive non af so they pursue one woman to love to which a woman eventually consent to if that man is a good potential provider bb and in a phase where she needs it etc i do not have the time to develop more but that my basic perspective again there no solid evidence it all armchair science here ,4,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,you must realise that evolutionary psychology only explain humans psychological make up their inclinations and their behaviour but that the real world is not necessarily cooperating with said inclinations take men for example we are wired to seek sexual variety yet not every man cheats has a harem of women or are unexclusive plate spinners many men indeed the majority are sexually exclusive but if you could read their minds to find their inner desire you would find the same inclination for sexual variety unrealised for them for whatever reason such as lack of sexual options social pressure to conform risk of losing their current relationship self control blue pill idealism etc same goes for girls 100 of them have both the inner yearning for fucking the attractive male af and the inner yearning for the support of a dependable man bb yet most of them are exclusive to one man who is only af or only bb or even worse unsuitable as an alpha or a beta and again there are many reasons for reality preventing them from realising that af bb biological imperative and that often the same ones as those i listed for men ,14,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,use facebook backpacking groups say yes to every visit activity suggestion unless it bloody stupidly dangerous do not go cross a desert without proper planning and do not go swim in waterholes where there are signs saying there crocs in the area but anything that sounds safe even if you are not too keen on the idea or unsure you can do it yes multi day hike yes shark cage diving yes a group of backpackers suggests to drop your plans to follow them to do another thing they just heard of yes feel the stress that comes from lacking control but do not let it influence your decisions ultimately embrace the uncertainty backpacker girls game is easiest game there is because you have the best non threatening reasons in the world to spend extended time with them although you just met indeed meeting new people is the whole point because you will live emotion inducing experience with them and because the girls are away from their normal social context and moving often so without the risk of slut shaming affecting their status they are more likely to just act on their attraction without doubt just open girls with basic hey my name is x i just arrived and keen for some adventure how long have you guys been here and what cool stuff you recommend types of openers suggest activities and agree to suggestions do the activity and generate attraction by leading and being good at it flirt the whole time end day activities with drinks score you may need to arrange logistics check there is a double room available in the hostel that could be booked last minute even though girls asd is way down compared to when they are home in their regular social environment so that they will be less difficult with logicistics as long as they are attracted ,3,asktrp

Auvergnat,whenever someone use redpill as a verb we can tell you come from the donald it not the same here the red pill is nothing but the reality of intersexual dynamics the reality of the sexual marketplace so you cannot be too redpilled either you know the truth or you do not either you accept it or you do not and either you do something with your life to benefit from the truth or you retreat to not do anything and willingly keep losing on the sexual marketplace it all your call but once you have seen the truth and realized it was the truth you cannot go back to not knowing it ,4,asktrp
Auvergnat,you are wrong the sexual marketplace is the market to rule them all seriously now your idea of there being several types of attraction with some being more important than others at different time is blue pill type thinking not that it wrong but just that it completely unsubstantiated and unpractical a more useful way to see it is that there is just sexual attraction with its presence absence intensity being dependent on a number of things from the guy poise physical attractiveness dominant behavior looking like that ex she not over with yet intellect that make him look like an expert in his field her the time of the month etc sexual attraction drives her want to fuck you it how you recognize whether you fit in the alpha category in her head but then girls also want their beta bux support attention but there no attraction involved in it even though she might say so in order to get you to give her the bux support attention ,3,asktrp

Auvergnat,your description of short term lust is on point but your description of long term love is all lovey dovey bluepilley romantic i did not say wrong i would agree if by love you mean the potent mix of habit with the feelings of comfort and companionship all wrapped up tight in the package of sunk cost fallacy same thing except i am cynic oh and about there is some percentage of women out there who will stick through it all grandparents may be a good example of this awalt the only reason our grandmas are on average more faithful than girls our generation is that on average they did more of growing up in a tight family unit under patriarchal rule having low n count prior to marriage allowing them to pair bond having a more masculine partner than what is on offer today having more societal pressure to stick to her marriage through the drops in attraction having less financial independence and less government benefits in case of divorce making leaving only a very last option in case of grave issues again all wrapped up over time in a longer package of sunk cost fallacy ,17,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,my point badly explained i recognize was that building a real body strength will eventually affect your mindset and make you feel strong there is no way on earth that a guy who is currently strong has been for a while is being told so by everyone in his life is being called when a buddy needs to move a particularly heavy piece of furniture feels weak your body influences your mind if you feel down fake smiling and see how that weirdly affects your mood ,1,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,it not a matter of relating a momentary feeling to a momentary activity its a matter of affecting reality in such a way that it then affects your mind if you lift often so that you grow visibly and actually strong and you can see it in the mirror and people tell you so your mind will adjust to that reality you cannot maintain forever a belief that you are weak if everything and everyone in your life confirms to you again and again that you are strong again it not because you lift weights once that you are supposed to feel strong it by building looking being practicing being told recognising strength that it will start becoming your mind reality ,1,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,so many spergs in this comment section op if you know your theory well you know af bb she has the bb now she wants the af and guess what its you everything in her actions scream that she got the tingles for you but her rational brain tries to reign her in to protect her self image of a good girl she wants to fuck you but she does not want to shoulder the consequences of doing it both on her ego and her social image if you provide her with all the necessary security that there will be no such consequences then she will fuck you and gladly so let make it clear this is both extremely common and one of the darkest aspects of female sexuality that society is desperate to hide so you can fuck her if you play it correctly so first things first ask yourself if you want to do you want to get involved in her cheating on her bb do you accept to take all social responsibility for being the other guy who seduced her into cheating which she never wanted to do if you accept buckle in and get ready to navigate the difficult but rewarding path of black knighting what you have here is a girl who is desperately horny for you but cannot accept the responsibility and the social stigma of cheating your strategy will be to be as different as possible from her bb to keep arousing her sexually to get her to act on her feelings to disconnect her rational brain from her actions to comfort her that whatever she does is not cheating that she is not a bad girl that she is not a slut to plant in her mind the idea that it is always right to follow one feelings there are two components to always keep in mind when you feel she is horny you physically escalate do not speak do not analyse it do not discuss it make it like your inner animal finds her so hot that your hands are just acting on their own volition completely covert under the surface body to body communication when you feel she is resisting physically or verbally descalate and assuage her worries verbally the surface communication the verbal one is only to comfort her more on the appropriate words below the strategy is laid over many many meets at every meet yo push the envelope only slightly further for every meet you suggest say nothing will happen it just to catch up and watch a movie then at the meet kino slowly but surely escalate feed the hamster comfort her that you know we should not do that but you cannot help yourself that its natural to that it not going too far that it not worse than what you did before that it not cheating that she is and remains a good girl keep pushing the envelope at every meet in small increments today you went all the way to kiss next time to touch her belly skin next time to touch her breast with bra on next time to touch her breast next time to suck on her nipples etc etc with sexual tension building next times will get bigger and bigger steps towards sex there will be a point where she snaps and realises it went way too far so that there no more point in resisting because she a bad girl now anyway and you will get the hottest sex that humans can have cheating sex after sex she will be filled with remorse layer massive amounts of comfort that it ok it natural that we could not resist our feelings that this does not make you a bad girl more importantly make it clear that her social status will remain intact because let keep this our little secret this is important not only to ensure you will get at least a few more sex sessions and avoid false rape accusations ,4,asktrp

Auvergnat,15 years old is not too young to be told about the reality of the sexual marketplace if anything it is the perfect age to start learning that said this sub might not be the most appropriate way to teach a 15yo there too much noise to filter out to get to the signal and the quality of the filter depends on your life experience since you are a woman willing to tell him you guys playbook then just give him some tips from times to times as you did alternatively send him this http theredpillroom blogspot co nz p the red pill primer for boys html that should get him covered until he has enough life experience to come to this sub ,11,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,you fall in the typical trap that decades of modern romanticism has instilled in your brain thinking that a relationship must be based on that fleeting intense emotion we call love for million of years humans and proto humans have pair bonded because the bonding was mutually beneficial over a wide range of reasons financial status family stability companionship mutual care now it all based on the shakiest most ephemeral of all the chemical highs that run through the human brain it like wanting to decide your entire career only in the moments you are high on drugs so to be clear a meaningful relationship is not based on whether you both love each other indeed as you understand from what i said it is unsustainable and therefore a fool errand make a meaningful relationship with a woman you respect and appreciate enough to obtain a benefit from the relationship family stability companionship but if you need to love her to be in it well i have some bad news ,4,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,it does not matter pretty girls are the ones being chased on average so they get to be the picky part in the deal do not see their wants as something they demand and do not offer any compensation for it just that with so much dick on offer they get to choose the most attractive ones it a marketplace you gotta run the same game become high value so that you become in demand and then you get to be the choosy one and when you will reach that point and you tell a girl the long list of qualities required for you to deign spend time with her and she asks but what do you offer as a counter part of all you want in a girl you will get to say it does not matter i am the one in demand ,3,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,that mindset described is what is called being your own mental point of origin and it not the result of the three things you mentioned but rather these three things are the manifestations of that mindset 1 read the rational male for the be your own mental point of origin mindset 2 make the attainment of that mindset your goal 3 when you interact with people ask yourself how does this benefit me am i doing what i want to do do i say this because i want them to appreciate me or because i just want to say it etc if it sounds selfish then you are on the right path 4 every time you catch yourself doing something to gain validation from someone stop yourself in your tracks every time your actions make it look like you put someone on the pedestal stop yourself unless it your master see law of power 1 5 ultimately apply the mindset to your interactions with women you are the prize and she just lucky that you have some attention to spare and that you give it to her 6 once you have put yourself on the pedestal this way everything should fall into place you will exude higher status and people will believe it ,9,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,what part of game is complete nonsense to you the part that teaches you to be confident because chicks dig confident guys the part that teaches to approach more girls because you miss 100 of the shots you do not take the part that teaches you how to tell stories that captivate an audience oh no i know it probable the parts that teaches you to change my persona to something more edgy or maybe the parts that teaches you what to do when you notice a good looking girl sending me iois nah you are right anyway do not even try it you already know it will not make a difference for you ,3,asktrp
Auvergnat,notice the commonality between the three cases it is being more invested in her than she is in you women are attracted to powerful men http swooptheworld com women want power in any relationship the person with the most power is the one who needs the other the least https therationalmale com 2011 08 19 the cardinal rule of relationships in a relationship the woman will be attracted to you if you need her less than she needs you ,27,TheRedPill
Auvergnat, seeing an awalt moment this does not mean anything if you do not know what a trp expression is used for just do not use it we will understand your posts without them and you wo not be confusing newbies about terminology anymore as for the rest you demonstrated high value to the girls and your girlfriend by being the guy ontop of the local hierarchy the host of the party and acting like it talking to everyone and making them enjoy the night ontop of being a guy mastering social skills approaching boldness confidence etc this resulted in the girls being attracted to you your gf picked up on their attraction for you the combo dread and preselection not even mentioning you passing her tantrum shit test by not caring about it resulted in massive amounts of attraction this is overall just great trp application except that you did it on accident rather than how a trp veteran would have done it aka on purpose if you are keen to stay longer on trp you would do well to remember that event as the accident you should aim to turn into who you are and how you act in life but in the meantime keep reading the sidebar and the rational male blog so that you do not misuse the lingo and understand by yourself what you do right or wrong ,2,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,i do not think it a matter of attraction here we are clearly talking about the beta bux side of women dual sexual strategy in op case and all others where a woman left a man who lost money or a job i would argue it was not due to lack of tingles but anxiety about beta bob not being able to fulfill his beta job ,2,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,exactly op you are now basically in same situation as married red pill men so you go back to the original meaning of plate spinning which is build sexual options which is in your case keep approaching and flirting and building up your smv also check often for your situation as betaization is a slippery slope you just do not see coming regularly ask yourself am i seen as a provider more than a lover who is the most invested that is who has most power in this relationship would i be able to walk away from this right now and how long would it take me to find sex somewhere else etc ,4,asktrp
Auvergnat,your idea is correct rollo posts a lot about hypergamy essentially putting women in a constant state of anxiety wondering if her current man is the best she can do cue constant tests both internal shit tests and external covertly asking friends to assess and reassess your place in the local hierarchy i would say it not exactly the reason for her behavior in your example though remember women mostly humans are solipsistic and that women are attracted by preselection so she must have believed that by showing you off to that man she would have gained his attraction it was not revenge it was a plot to have him by making him jealous ,9,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,hm interesting you need to entice them with feels like women then ,2,asktrp
Auvergnat,oh you have an acute case of laziness you poor little snowflake give me your address i will personally come to your place pull you out of bed at 5am and kick your ass until you start doing shit will that be enough motivation for you ,4,asktrp
Auvergnat,make the event a game to practice game approach and open people merge sets practice how to be seen as the person to know out there tonight as for the girl flirt like crazy kino push pull as long as you do not go for the kiss everything has plausible deniability if you generate enough attraction she will hamster a good reason to fuck you and if she does not you will still have practiced generating attraction as for paying for her ticket in a general manner the answer is do not pay for girls the caveat here though is to see what is the custom for the event if not paying is going to make you like that one stingy guy in the history of the prom who did not pay it will hurt your status more than it will benefit it like wearing a costume at a prom i would never wear a costume on a date because it would look try hard but i wo not uphold that principle for a prom where everyone is expected to dress formal ,1,asktrp
Auvergnat,your high investment in her is the root cause of your issues it the reason why she flakes on you she can sense you are valuing her higher than you value yourself resulting in her believing the same and losing attraction it also the reason for your intent to rage quit on her if a girl was not giving you the sex and attention you want while you were not invested in her then you would not react emotionally as you do instead you would just naturally distance yourself from her without even realising it just like you distance yourself unemotionally from people in your life who you do not value beggars salesmen strangers lesson to learn stop valuing any one girl more than you value yourself ,5,asktrp
Auvergnat,agree not only alpha is contextual even if you are the alpha in her current social context she just needs to get into another social context girls trip workplace ect to find another alpha but ontop of that women are fickle since feelings rule their mind all you can do is do your best and prepare for the likely inevitable end ,15,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,i think they are highly overlapping think status for example women are typically attracted to the highest status man around your def 2 which is highly contingent of the woman current social situation your def 1 ,4,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,alpha by highest local status,5,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,commending you on your game tips your examples are typical of the idea of statements that provides information but give the impression that you are withholding more important information which i have been thinking and using for a while to generate investment in conversations eg this is my 2nd favorite thing to do in town basically what roosh called baits in day bang i had not thought yet of doing it with the information being about her fucking genius ,2,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,this should not be the top comment op post is on point it true that you should not listen to what women say or write but this applies to what they say or write to you or to men it fundamentally different for women romance novels because they speak to themselves and in order to sell they need to speak their inner truth and boy do they sell en masse they sell so much because they fulfill the female reader hypergamous instinct by proxy in every novel the heroine is some bland regular woman they can relate to while the hero is the super high value super attractive man who falls in love with her and commits his resources time attention money to her the ultimate alpha beta combo these novels are the best window into women mind you can find and every man would do well getting some lessons from them so op is right once you have demonstrated your higher value and generated attraction it is a good idea to spice it up with some apparent demonstration of her being special giving her hints that you could be the unicorn alpha beta combo but then it is true that it a dangerous game to play because beta vibes kill alpha vibes the moment she feels you are very invested in her is the moment you will lose her attraction so always start with making sure she attracted to you first ideally you are already fucking her and do not do more than giving subtle hints of your beta qualities commitment unless you are specifically targeting the bb side of her strategy closing in on the wall ,14,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,this should be more a lesson about how everybody here is completely misunderstanding the point of alpha alpha gets thrown around a lot these days it a mindset for some it appearance for others but its most often an archetype of a manly man for most muscular badass bold successful etc but originally alpha in the manosphere is not some fixed masculine feature whether mindset appearance archetype or a combination of these alpha is at its most useful as the defining term for the lover side of women lover provider dual strategy alpha fucks beta bucks alpha should have never been understood as anything else but the man a given women wants to fuck at a given time while beta should only be understood as the man a given woman wants for his resources at a given time and sure enough women on average tend to want to fuck a certain type of hyper masculine mindset appearance or archetype we talked about a lot around and often call alpha but never forget you are only really alpha not if you fit the type but only if she wants to fuck you she fucks you or wants to fuck you you are alpha she does not want to fuck you you are not alpha it should be that simple similarly if she wants to associate with you to benefit from your resources you are beta she does not want to associate with you to benefit from your resources you are not beta if someone is asking you whether they are alpha or not you should only answer with the two questions for which girl and does she want to fuck you the result of disconnecting the terms alpha or beta from simple labels stuck on women dual sexual strategy to some archetypes of men result exactly in op anecdote that apparently disproves trp theory that guy was a total alpha yet she stopped fucking him to fuck someone else looks like trp is wrong and alphas do not get the girls guess what it not disproving trp theory you are just not getting the theory right in op case the guy was not alpha anymore the moment she started wanting to fuck someone else that other guy was the alpha for her and at that moment keeping that in mind will help you not getting blindsided down the line when you will reach the point where you are so sure your appearance and mindset qualifies you as alpha that you will stop asking you the real question does she want to fuck me or not ,100,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,ok i see where you come from then but you should not change the meaning of a classic red pill expression and propagate it especially if your alternate meaning basically negates the original trp never meant the she not mine it just my turn expression to mean she has the most power in that relationship so she will leave my sorry ass eventually it was always meant to say relationships end be aware of it and prepare for it so you can hold the power in the relationship again as per the cardinal rule your meaning makes sense but you are just going to confuse the shit out of newbies she not mine it just my turn equals beware not investing myself too much in any relationship so i can keep the power ,3,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,refrain from going out partying and drinking to start with a girl who is in love with her man and afraid to lose him would naturally refrain from doing anything that she thinks the object of her desire might just interpret wrongly and leave her over it just like a beta in love with his woman would refrain from cheating or even flirting or even looking at another woman for fear of the object of his desire might just interpret wrongly ,3,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,the fact that people know that 50 of marriages end in divorce or whatever is the accurate statistic yet people still marry gives a quite clear evidence that people do expect a lifelong love they all think that divorce wo not happen to them ,2,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,people do not like change they put you in a little box with a label on it and they freak out when it not accurate anymore even if you changed for a better label ,15,TheRedPill
Auvergnat, i am the prize is a mindset to generate attraction even if you are unattractive and have nothing going for you aka low smv you are still encouraged to develop prize mentality because it will show in your body language which will make a girl perceive you having higher smv she not mine it just my turn is a mindset to maintain a lower investment in a relationship than the girl which by virtue of the cardinal rule of relationships allow you to hold the most power in it having most power is the best way to maintain her attraction for you and her interest in the relationship the she not mine it just my turn mindset does not negate the i am the prize mindset the redpill aware man knows that women are fickle and that even if he was the highest smv man on earth it only takes the boredom of ltr a little argument a bit of alcohol and a man with good looks game status at the right place and the right moment for her to do a mistake those two beliefs are not incompatible and you would do well cultivating them both ,39,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,yes that part is gone for me and i kinda miss the bliss of the idea of romantic love but fuck it that was a small price to pay to never being driven to pits of despair by a woman ever again ,11,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,oh but they do care they care for your continuing providing love safety or a good dicking to them and to ensure that she kinda needs to care for you see it like your employer your employer do not really care about you he cares that you continue doing a good work for him and since you need to be happy and healthy to continue working for him he kinda cares about your happiness and your health and provide you with certain benefits including salary to ensure that does seeing your employer with that perspective makes you want not working with him or anyone anymore does this perspective makes you hate your employer that he does not care for you the way you would wish him to care that is unconditionally it should not you would probably continue working for him and try appreciate your work in his company thanks to a mutually beneficial contract but with the full knowledge that if situation was to change in such way that he does not benefit as much from having you anymore he would probably drop you on the spot and you would do well to do the same if the situation was reversed i wo not deny that it took me a while to finally accept that a relationship with a woman is the same i had deeply entrenched blue pill delusions that i would ultimately find someone for whom i would be special and our bond would get to redefine who i am as a person at no point was i bitter about it only felt sadness at slowly shedding my blue pill dreams as i accepted them as a myth while feeling joy at the newfound freedom and understanding of the mating dance and then one day you just realise that it does not make you sad anymore because you do not think about it especially when you have integrated trp enough to know that ltr are still possible kids are still possible love is still possible just not the expectation of unconditional love ,18,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,gut feeling if i feel that beginning of a twinge of shock pain discomfort at the news i recognize it as over investment on my part and let her go only other option since acting butt hurt and mate guarding is the sure fire way to her losing respect for you if i just do not feel anything at the news it means i am currently non invested so i do not mind keeping her around my lack of reaction may actually result in her increasing her investment in me and stopping fucking the other one ,2,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,i did not say that love is a myth but lifelong love and actually as i wrote in another post i think i should have written our expectation of lifelong love is a myth love is real if you mean infatuation humans get infatuated with each others but infatuation is a feeling that is essentially temporary though some cases might last longer under the right circumstances your thinking is dangerous if you start separating girls who can love from girls who cannot you simply run the risk of finding one that you decided is one who can and then start expecting her love for you to last i have had girls loving me for a night for 6 months for a few years all of them eventually moved on all it took would be a new man for them to love i have had girls so incredibly infatuated with me usually because of me not being infatuated with them just completely get over me over night because they met a new man rollo post war brides is particularly relevant to my life experience ,4,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,i do not think my topic is strongly related to that question but my personal view is that a strong society requires monogamy and marriage our society is now such that this has become a really bad proposition for men better off doing what we want fuck the strength of our society now enjoy the decline if one wants monogamous relationships let him do that just as long as he aware there are little chances it will last it ok series of ltr and breakups are a valid sexual strategy my personal stance is very open for now i spin plates non monogamy on my side if a plate fucks another guy and i do not care i will keep fucking her if i do care i take her off my roster and let her live her life on her own ,2,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,very true and one can only be agnostic on the matter there are no proofs one way or the other but there are major elements that make me really doubtful do dogs live after death do mosquitoes flowers bacteria why would we have a life after death and not the others because we have consciousness what about animals who do have some form of consciousness then do apes have a life after death dolphins does not is seem extremely suspect that we totally consider the possibility of life after death for humans because oh boy that would alleviate a lot of our fears but the possibility of it for animals we just do not give a single shit about it and mostly suspect a bacterium does not go to some bacterium heaven does not it make it really suspect that this is but a whishful thinking we cling to like santa when we were kids ,1,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,i actually agree it something i noticed i had phrased wrong after re reading myself love exists and as a feeling is temporary by nature but it does not inherently prevent freak circumstances to actually make it last a lifetime so yeah if i could edit rewrite it i would not state that lifelong love is a myth but our expectation of it is ,1,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,i am mid 30s been traveling the world a lot and lost dear ones you point simply at the existence of human emotion which i do not deny like all humans i enjoy it myself and i enjoy seeing it in others through mirror neurons i actually do appreciate chilling in airports before or after a travel and look at people emotions before departure or on meeting again yet the existence of human emotion does not negate in any way the fact that people experience them for selfish reasons the two lovers crying in the departure hall of an airport as one is leaving are both mourning the impending loss of their own pleasure in the relationship ,2,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,trp canon theory would be that men are the true romantic implying that our kind of love is superior or real it ai not we are just as opportunistic and self serving but it expresses itself in different ways first the fundamental premise https heartiste wordpress com 2013 03 21 the fundamental premise and its result men being the ones filled with testosterone and therefore the needier ones the buyers mean that most men have few sexual options and will therefore be more prone to clinging to their options oneitis we tend to feel a deep strong bond because we are aware it will be difficult to get another one anytime soon second women as primary carers are basically stuck with their progeny while men have in theory the ability to get away from caring responsibilities at any time and indeed our need for sex and sexual variety means we have urges to do so in order to counter this effect we developed a psychological module to force us into staying in the relationship to help the mother of our child care for our offspring the result of this is that men love tend to be stronger than women making us doing the most foolish things such as waiting for a girl to finally love us back staying in unhealthy relationships marrying a woman after she got pregnant because that the right thing to do staying with a woman after she got unattractive etc yet our love still is self serving except that it more serving our genes rather than our self in a way just like women love is men love is also opportunistic and it being typically stronger does not mean it indestructible many men leave their wives or cheat on them despite loving them just like women love being typically weaker does not mean it always going to break although it pretty common for women to leave a suddenly disabled or fired husband many do stay and support him because of a combination of sunk cost fallacy stockholm syndrome social pressure and love induced pair bonding ,4,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,no worries you have been investing a lot of yourself in that relationship so separating from her bruises your ego because it feels like you just ripped a part of it so it going to make you angry hurt and second guess yourself it normal it just needs time to grow out of the idea that she was not part of your ego she never was do not bottle up the feelings express them to your buddies not too much your dog if you have one or mostly through actions gym punch a boxing bag exhaust yourself in a run be sure of two things 1 just give it time and it will get better 2 your situation is now 100 better because you are not tied to someone who might be unfaithful who was bringing drama in your life who you are not having sex with or enjoying feminine presence of you are now free to focus on your endeavours pursue other pussies or just another one whatever ,13,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,good on you a redpill aware man can be in a relationship and you could have tried to make trp work for you in that one but long distance relationships are not relationships at all this should be a no brainer to all if you split geographically just split it entirely as for your analysis it mostly on point except that you are analyzing it too much all those quotes can be translated roughly as i love the fact that you love me because it makes me feel good so here something i say that i thought might help keep your interest in me so here a made up example based on yours she says i want to fix our relationship so bad because i love you so much but i do not know how to and i do not want us to break up because it could be a huge mistake and i think we could be meant to be together bla bla bla translation i love the fact that you love me because it makes me feel good so here something i say that i thought might help keep your interest in me your thinking should be anything she says is just self serving bullshit if i want to know what she wants i need to look at her actions the medium is the message what are her actions what is the medium observation 1 we are geographically separated observation 2 she flirting with other guys observation 3 she not making actual efforts to keep me just words conclusion time to eject your answer to her this is not working out we are done when can i pass by get my shirts back ,40,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,i agree fully and on the topic that we do not quote my entire sentence the only way to solve the dissonance between reality and your wants is to drop the delusion and face reality dead on i never meant that everyone had to drop their delusions if you do not feel dissonance if believing in god lifelong love or any other want do not contradict with your reality somehow then by all means keep believing in it and be happy if you feel that dissonance but do not want to lose your wants because they are too important to you and you would tailspin into depression without them you are free to keep on living with the dissonance if you feel it and want to solve it then you have no choice ,7,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,the other guy got it though the insult was not necessary the love of your life is a myth like earth being the centre of the universe or us being the apple of god eyes or the existence of life after death all myths we are so prone to believe because they shield us from the otherwise apparent horror of reality that as living organisms we are essentially alone among other mostly self serving organisms insignificant in the grand scheme of things and finite in time the reality in the case of love and relationships is that you current significant other is out there for herself first her kids second and her source of security third she does not love you she loves the fact that being with you make her feel good loved secured protected high status etc and the day you do not make her feel that way anymore well you are in hot water this does not mean that there is no chance of you ever growing old and dying together it just means that you have no way to ensure that it will happen just like with the other myths the only way to solve the dissonance between reality and your wants is to drop the delusion and face reality dead on these myths are just myths reality is harsh it ok we will be fine anyway in the case of love relationship it consists in getting the mindset of she not yours it just your turn enjoy it while it your turn ,4,asktrp

Auvergnat,personal experience i think bantering is an unconscious and covert way to assert dominance within a group you may think it all for the lulz when you tease your friends that it is done naturally for the fun and that some people like it more than others but personally just like other human behaviours since i discovered trp i do not believe it some harmless social construct with no purpose behind it i see it as some built in behaviour helping one to set a local hierarchy within a group just like pups play fighting it all cute and fun but actually that how they learn the pack hierarchy i do not see the fact that this specific girl repeatedly teases you as a coincidence or a purposeless quirk of her personality there is a method in that madness and i think the method is the unconscious test not for your value as a mate but for your rank in the pecking order now i am not saying it means you are low value i am saying it means that this girl perceives that you are either that or you are a threat to her in some way think about it if she had nothing but the utmost respect for you because of how you naturally lead the group do you think she would tell you that sort of things ,2,asktrp

Auvergnat,women are only out for themselves just like men are and to achieve this women sometimes take advantage of men with charm and other manipulation tactics just like men take advantage of other men with strength or wit when a female student takes advantage of a beta classmate who does her homework in the hope to get in her pants when she never hinted at that being a possibility i do not blame her i just pity him and blame his upbringing that made him so clueless about women and as for women being incapable of love like men are i do not see it as a flaw but two different kinds of love nobody said men love ought to be the only one true type of love and women opportunistic style of love can still be incredibly full if you are her top alpha but in any case i do not think you can teach a daughter not to be a woman you can try teaching a cat to bark and fetch a ball but you have very low chances of success let women be women ,22,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,it more anti slut defense than shit tests when a girl hits you with i have a boyfriend or i am not that kind of girl or i do not sleep on first date what she doing is effectively getting rid of any responsibility for anything that may come after by hearing her statement and keeping the interaction going you effectively accept to shoulder that responsibility with the burden of potential social shame off her shoulders and squarely on yours she can abandon herself to her feelings on the moment and if her feeling is the desire to fuck you it ok because its not her responsibility anymore if on the contrary you refuse to shoulder the responsibility for example if she tells you she has a boyfriend and you answer it ok we can be friends even though you plan to insist later then the responsibility remains on her shoulders even if she desires to fuck you she wo not because then it will be her fault edit beware do not go start believing that when a woman says i have a boyfriend it automatically means that she wants you it can very well still mean she does not want you to keep going i have a boyfriend can mean i am not interested in you but i wanna be polite about it just as well as it can mean i am interested in you but i do not want to be seen as a bad girl so i am telling you upfront so it not my fault if anything happens as usual with women the truth about their desire is to be understood in their action and their body language and the truth about the i have a boyfriend statement you will find it in her reaction to your keeping escalating a bit further ,89,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,this is it there is no inherent woman hating in red pill theory only an evidence based belief that sexes are different and complementary and a field tested understanding of their different sexual strategies now we certainly do have a significant amount of women bashing here but this is more due to our strong stance on real talk rather than the contents of the theory and the proof is that we bash male betas and omegas just as much now mainstream thinking is pc and based on an equalitarian dogma so of course both red pill theory and our real talk is offensive and must be opposed and the most effective way to do this is through spreading lies and shaming tactics and in our case the target of choice is our woman bashing so the fact that red pill theory is evidence based will be ignored the fact that we have redpill theory saves relationships see the thanktrp sub will be ignored the fact that it makes men happy will be ignored the fact that women also read trp and benefit from it will be ignored the fact that we bash men as much as we bash women will be ignored red pill is to be only women hate ergo evil end of discussion in that context there is no debate possible bare the ppd subreddit the mainstream uninformed opinion is that trpers are just a bunch of sexless losers who hate on women and it will remain that way there is no amount of proofs of either personal sexual success general happiness or healthy relationships that will convince trp haters as long as they cling to their uninformed view of what red pill is about so yeah a guy says trp is disproved because daughters ignore him he has no idea what he talking about he just thinks woman hating so nevermind them who cares what they think you are happy your girls are happy people who read you are happy that all that counts ,66,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,it funny where did you and other passing trolls see i was triggered i wrote i loved it ,1,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,what you described is a good course of action a much better one would be to leave her she disrespecting you and girls are not attracted to men who let themselves be disrespected and the only way to regain her respect is by calling it a day and going looking for another girl who respects you ,3,asktrp
Auvergnat,it just two different things women love to be seen as sexually attractive to everyone but they only want sexual interaction with those they themselves are attracted to ,23,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,1 get lifting it important if the gym is too expensive get your ass to a street workout gym or get a pull up bard and do a bodyweight program again lift it important 2 do not marry her do not marry at all it not about her it about the government you would put in your bed by doing so so stay with her all your life if you want wear a ring on your finger if you want tell her how you will marry her if you do not mind lying to her and ruining her life plans but do not ever marry her 3 reading the rational male will help you make sense of women you will understand what you did that made your girl into you dating other girls breaking up with her etc basically making yourself the prize and what you did that made her repulsed by you over invested in her beta moves etc basically making her the prize just keep reading rp material and the correct behavior will just naturally comes to you 4 quit the strip clubs waste of time and money if your girl ever asks tell the truth own it lying can be a great tool but doing it in order to keep the peace in the relationship stinks of fear of her leaving you which will slowly infect your mindset and her behaviour 5 redpill aware at your age you would be better off single and slaying but hey if you just need one pussy do whatever you want however make sure she always aware that you are so high value that you would find a replacement in a heart beat if she ever decides to drop you maintain in her that low hum of mild anxiety that will be more than compensated with her immense joy that you deign staying with her ,3,asktrp
Auvergnat,good on you op do not mind the criticisms whether she a plate or not the concept of spinning plates was originally meant to describe the activity of pursuing several sexual options at the same time to foster a feeling of abundance mentality and you are doing exactly that ,12,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,read the sub rules personal questions go on asktrp post there and you shall be answered ,1,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,oh i agree both about the need for repeating re articulating fundamental red pill ideas and about rollo increasingly obscure style was not criticizing op originality at all just telling him that his insight is as red pill as it gets as proven by the fact that it a recurrent theme for the father of the manosphere ,6,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,what you describe is the bread and butter of rollo blog posts social conventions invented to serve the feminine imperative yadda yada difficult not to call yourself red pill aware after that personal insight of yours ,8,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,do not worry about it u aanarchist does not like any dissent to his opinion and actually neither assent if it written in too many fancy words for him to understand whether it assent or dissent and once his opinion of you is made he will refuse any debate he right and your opinion is either blue pill delusion or red pill parroted delusion ,5,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,wow do not go drawing the wrong conclusions here she was not turned on by your intelligence she just had a boost of respect therefore attraction for you due to your sudden and unexpected increase in smv you displayed in an instant both mastery of a craft and the mystery of what other skill could you be hiding from her and you played it off like it nothing pro move the timing and execution were perfect but that absolutely does not imply that women are turned on by intelligence you say stay away from musical talents but what do you think would have happened if instead you had gotten to a cafe where a guitar laid there had picked it up played with some mastery skill some awesome song and then after she asked you what was what you had the same conversation where you play down your skills yep you would have gotten the same result probably even better ,23,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,the evolution of human culture has always happened through the male approach violent coercion or the female one insidious manipulation if you think that the modern changes due to the society bending to the feminine imperative are something new and that the world would be a great place without it you are gravely deluded ,3,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,very true but it not the hating that helps bang them it the not caring that goes with it if you can keep the not caring attitude you can get rid of the hating part ,5,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,i do not even resent the lies anymore it like i am playing some ball and my opponent just tricked me with a fantastic fade i had never seen before ok he beat me but i cannot help but be admirative at his technique after 2 years of red pill i am now smirking at women deception about their sexual nature their concealed wants their manipulation of men society through the exploitation of the white knight bug in our software damn that was a good move buddy had never seen that one before ,35,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,why are you so unwilling to even consider advice from someone who may know about the matter sure enough you have no way to tell whether your current approach or that suggested by u redditadminsuck 88 is the most appropriate but then given that you basically got zero lays out of seven approaches with your current method maybe it worth experimenting with different advices direct vs indirect approach is the classic game dilemma and there are proponents on both sides but here the rational behind going indirect the main problem in direct approach what you do is that it scares away the cat as roosh said women in the street have a shield constantly on theyre being stared at catcalled engaged and usually not by the most high quality men they might even fear being assaulted as a result their default reaction to any man engaging them out of the blue and without providing a valid reason is to be startled and fear for their security and that not a good first impression to make see for example in your list of seven the most positive reaction you got is the one where you gave her a reason to talk to her even if that reason was just to hit on her at least then she knows why you are there and that enough to assuage some of her worries the main advantage of going direct is that it will filter out really fast the interested from the uninterested but unless you are good looking enough so that her immediate attraction for you to drown that stranger danger alarm in her head your numbers are going to be very very low again it up to everyone to choose the method that works best for them but testing various approaches is generally a good idea to figure which one works best for you so it always worth considering alternative advice ps that being said you must be commended for putting yourself out there and facing approach anxiety dead on congrats,20,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,ok got it it the same fine line being walked on as when talking about negs the same comment depending on tone on delivery can be either a gentle tease prodding for her frame shit testing her or a snarky mean barely veiled offense ,1,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,we do not want to psychoanalyse you we just want to understand your point just like any other post we ask because it was not clear in your post and your answers still do not provide a satisfying answer we get that you may want to settle and therefore interview the girls for what they bring to the relationship why not but your description of their answer affection a good heart honesty loyalty a sense of humor does not feel much different than yours financial and emotional stability honesty loyalty and a big dick you even have two words that are exactly the same in these conditions calling their answer a bunch of crap or superficial drivel and yours everything a woman wants just feels completely dishonest and that why you are being downvoted then some ask you to clarify your position and you just say you are being mysoginistic on purpose which does not answer your motive for not considering the two answers as equivalent i am even starting thinking you are a blue pill troll for making such a point and failing to understand our fair criticism ,4,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,reading your post and your comments hurt all your issues stem from your over investment in that one girl you come to us and all your sentences are about what this girl is what she did to you what you could have done to get her what is the appropriate redpill answer to her shit test etc etc understand this now the only appropriate answer when you have oneitis is to move on you stop seeing her you stop talking to her you refocus your life on yourself because when you are over invested in someone it shows in your body language and that is extremely unattractive i know it hard but there is nothing else to do the proper redpill way to manage your situation would have been to leave her and not post about her on the sub ,6,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,he being downvoted because his logic does not hold water the idea is interesting ask the girl what she brings to the table wait for her to say unimportant things wait for her to ask the question back answer actually important things but here op answers back the same things she said it does not make fucking sense to criticize someone for bringing little value when you answer the same thing and hold it in high value you get the point op is being downvoted because he strutting around like he found some really snappy line to tell women except that it not and just make him look stupid if instead of answering the same exact thing he would have said concrete things like a roof over our head food in the fridge lights on a shoulder to cry on protection from assaults then it would have all made sense ,34,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,bragging is not dhv but please do develop what are the concrete actions you take,4,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,i did not say controls the conversation i said generate attraction if you maintain your position with that change ie the way that someone generates attraction is by non verbal means do not hesitate developing your argument ,8,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,fair enough to each his path but op should not expect his alternative position to be well received on a forum with an obvious orthodoxy a christian would not post on a jewish subreddit and expect his opinion to be well received ,3,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,i understand that what you want is unprotected sex and it ok to go after one want and to shape your decisions around your want in that context not sleeping around is probably a good idea yes and even though trp favorite option is non committed sex with multiple partners red pill theory is just as applicable in your case as well in your case your only major issue is your carelessness about the high risk of pregnancy your lifestyle represents you should be afraid of knocking a girl up you seem to have absolutely no idea how badly the mother of your future child and the government can fuck you in the ass once you are legally on the hook if you knew and still did not want to put a condom on then you would better abstain from sex altogether the reason men naturally want to have sex with alot of women is to increase the chances of passing on their genes but most people here seem to be afraid of knocking girls up some even go so far that they get a vasectomy do not confuse the evolutionary reason behind a behavior and a rationale motive behind an action modern men feel an urge to have multiple sex partners because in our species ancestry the genes that resulted in this behavior spread more on average than genes who did not result in this behavior modern men still feel the urge but that does not mean they want to get multiple partners pregnant similarly humans crave sugar because that behavior was positively selected but that does not mean humans want to get fat ,5,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,strawmen everywhere in your post you do not want multiple partners so you declare that men who do are somehow defective which then comfort you as the morally superior one newsflash men who want multiple partners do not do it for the ego boost or to impress guys in locker rooms they do it because they want to do it a desire for sexual variety is built in our dna and expresses itself as arousal google the coolidge effect it cool if you do not want it it your life but do not go strutting around as some morally superior man because of it ,10,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,it would be my idea of fun but also the best idea to dry up a vagina if op had meant take some time off trp to focus on actually applying it it would have been a great tip but he did not say so what he said is that he disagrees with a lot of basic trp stuff so that rather than facing the hard truth like a man he chose to ignore it by stop reading it and then he proceed to have a long date talking about some extremely complex non feelings inducing topic note how he said he went on a date not that he banged the girl also note op belief that some women are better than others nawalt or his wish to go straight into a ltr without building options first spinning plates translation op has half chewed the pill ,11,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,solid answer about the problem lack of attraction but missing the solution three components to generate attraction basic pua displaying your high value tell stories especially some hitting attraction switches like preselection or leader of men be fun and social bold lead the party neg your target tease her be playful with her treat her like your bratty little sister kino make it clear you are in for the sex but using push pull to not come too strong on her in op account i saw none of these three ,35,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,no i said if you want to bang that girl do not apologise profusely your complete misrepresentation of my point is intellectually dishonest ,3,asktrp

Auvergnat,the fact that cuckoldry is getting normalised as a positive kink for a man to experience to the point that such comic can be made without it being satire reflects the concerning state of modern western culture the pool of western men out there with so little self respect is growing every day we are ripe for the taking over by other cultures ,130,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,you have no idea what you really missed she could have answered no thanks to your dinner offer ending the interaction right there and then or she could have said yes and then take you for a beta ride and having you pay for her dinner and maybe instead you are now free for the night and you can go out at old man or deus and have another hot girl jump on you right away turning your earlier perceived fail to an actual win moral of the story do not get attached to outcomes even perceived missed ones just approach as often as you can and push each interaction as far as it can go and when one ends focus 100 on the next one,195,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,the box office is showing historical marvel characters young heterosexual white male protagonists the day marvel movies star mostly female black feminist superheroes they will tank just like ghostbusters did ,7,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,the reason why the ghostbusters reboot failed is the same marvel is mentioning here alienation of your core market comics and ghostbusters type movies make money because a large number of heterosexual males are willing to put money in that form of entertainment to which they can relate if the characters are heterosexual males change the characters and the heterosexual male cannot relate anymore so interest and sales from that demographics drop and although interest and sales from the new demographics might pick up thanks to the change there is simply not enough interest from these new demographics to make up the loss women do not enjoy enough superheroes movies ,38,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,the expression spinning plates means splitting your efforts between several sexual options at the moment clearly you are not spinning plates what you are doing is that you are in a relationship with a girl and even though you might not be officially exclusive you actually are by any practical standard now your girlfriend since that what she is is telling you about wanting to be with a guy and that upsets you it upsets you because she your only source of pussy and she could be walking away with it at any given moment scarcity mentality what you need to do is look for other sources of pussy immediately ,4,asktrp
Auvergnat,good question and i just happened to have edited that comment the way i imagine it the best way would be to meet people who are successful and ask them what they think is happening of their field but even they might not be able to tell perhaps others here have better ideas ,2,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,i agree with his comment on a whole minus the last part i agree men main issue definitely is a lack of masculinity i agree what they are wrong in perceiving their problem to be a lack of self esteem their main problem is a lack of success due to a lack of masculinity low self esteem is the result of the lack of success and it not in attending your low self esteem that you will cure the underlying issue if anything as long as you remain unsuccessful the low self esteem will persist low self esteem is your body way to urge you to get successful already given this i think most non masculine western men will have low self esteem just see how many men are clinically depressed those that have high self esteem are those who are successful and the more successful the more self esteem so in that respect i will disagree with u archwinger that modern men have high self esteem we have a lot of entitlement and expectations but they do not come from a high self esteem your best rule of thumb is always to err on the side of too much boldness believe you are special believe you are the prize believe you are entitled to pussy show abundance mentality and prize mentality even if underneath you have low self esteem just fucking believe it then reap the sexual rewards of it and the low self esteem will turn into a high one ,3,askMRP

Auvergnat,western women are completely deluded at the reality of natural human society in all fairness western men too but how to blame them when all you have ever known is the safety and comfort of a middle class family housed under a rainproof roof a full fridge and a policed society how can you not start believing that men natural sexual desire is entitlement how can you not start believing that women can do all that men can do how can you not have the silly idea that you would cycle through the middle east to demonstrate to your fellow westerners that it perfectly safe to do so after her contact with reality that one came to her senses a bit she might still be blind as to the reasons why men act the way they do it not ignorance honey it testosterone but at least she understood that if she had not had a veil a knife or a police escort she just might be dead ,65,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,depends if you had oneitis for said ex or not if you never felt it and you are the one who broke up yep an ex can make an excellent plate dr warlock had an awesome post on the matter some time ago if you had oneitis for said ex and you acted all beta with her it unlikely she will ever see you as alpha and feel genuine attraction for you in such case her re contacting you is more likely an attempt at getting you back into orbit and if you caught the dreadful oneitis for that one in the past it likely to rear its ugly head again better leaving that kind of trash on the curb,3,asktrp
Auvergnat, urgh i am just not strong enough to throw away such a relationship in an instance that your problem right there you are over invested she can sense it this has shifted the balance of power in her camp as per the cardinal rule of relationships and as a result of your powerlessness she is slowly losing attraction for you if it not entirely gone yet your only option now is to prove to her and yourself that you are not in fact invested in this relationship in the single bold move of breaking up none of that we are on a break till next week shit pull out the plug now or be stuck in a few months in a flat with a cheating woman who hates your powerless gusts your call ,11,asktrp
Auvergnat,the red pill man should practice developing options in all matters of life in order to never been caught in over investment of any girls of course but also sources of income and friends you should have other friends that are such that you do not mind losing any of them at any point for any reason from this abundance mentality the course is set clear you are a good friend tell him he needs to know just as you would like to know in his position if he lashes out at you just keep frame and tell him calmly that you are disappointed that he would shoot the messenger who only wants his good if he insists just ghost him ,29,asktrp
Auvergnat,you have been rationalizing so much of your issues it sickening you need to spend less time reading and analyzing and spend more time doing understand that the psyche of men was built during another epoch when proto men did not have the leisure to read and analyze their problems they just did or died modern mental issues have less to do with bad parenting and more with that unnatural idleness that our brain did not evolve to tackle you just tell it yourself when you had things in your life to focus on aka direction all your problems magically vanished you need to get back to that state where you have a direction and then just spend your time doing in that direction again reading stuff and analyzing your situations are the very actions that make your mind rot you need to have only two words on your mind goals and action choose your goals and then work tirelessly towards them exhausting your brain process time in the unending quest of fulfilling your goals this is what men brain is designed to do which specific goals matter less than their existence if you spend 3 months analyzing which goals you should pursue you are just being back at square one pick what is more important to you in life and run with it and add lifting and fighting to it they will give you the toughness you are in a desperate need to build ,1,asktrp

Auvergnat,i understand your point but disagree your point goes like this i am the prize girls should chase me i have abundance mentality so if they do not i will focus my efforts on others it a great mentality to have but the reality of the smp and of girls mindset make it incredibly counter productive in practice girls are not good at taking initiative they are not used to it or they feel like if they do it will look desperate and that will kill your attraction for them plus their feelings are fickle today she not so interested in you but in a week time she will just contact you out of the blue for a fuck the reality is that unless your smv is sky high and that girls trip over themselves to fuck you a significant of girls will not be as keen on you from the get go as you wished so if your smv is so high that you have 5 new tinder matches a day and 4 out of 5 are all over you and one is lukewarm you can afford to ditch the one girl who did not reschedule and have 4 new choices to select from to get your dick wet every day if your smv is not that high and you have 5 new tinder matches a month and only 1 out of 5 is all over you and 4 are lukewarm and do not reschedule on the spot your prize mentality will make you discard the great majority of your options it like if a potential employer offers you a new job with a sub par salary if you already have plenty of offers that pay well you can sneer at this one without a doubt but if you are currently unemployed and that the only one you receive what are you going to do show some self respect and decide to just stay unemployed or discard your sense of pride and take the bloody job until a better one comes along ,1,TheRedPill

Auvergnat, so what s going on here a crisis of masculinity a mass effiminization of the american male not exactly oh the biggest driver as alluded to above is likely changes in americans work habits in the 1980s men were more likely to be employed in jobs involving manual labor than they are today less daily physical activity means less overall strength and incidentally more weight gain too oh so you mean like mass effiminization then ,6,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,1 the name chad thundercock was invented as a joke by someone to describe a random super hot super tall super jerk natural alpha who a woman got instantly attracted to usually in a story about her rocky relationship with a beta partner the name was funny so it got re used and eventually stuck but it was never meant to describe a man to hate or to use as a role model 2 the word you are looking for is alpha alpha is your objective alpha was not meant as an equivalent to chad even though chad is alpha per definition 3 non chad type men usually hate chad because they are jealous of how easy he has it with girls using parentheses because it will not often comes to one mind that chad perhaps actually works hard to appear a natural alpha at the very least with lifting it natural read human to be jealous of those that do better than you on the smp it ok to be jealous just do not let it overwhelm you to the point it affects your actions 4 women attraction to alpha men including chad is not right or wrong it just is anyone who think that it wrong and that women ought to be attracted to beta men has not understood the most basic truth of the red pill 5 women have a dual sexual strategy they desire the sexy alpha but they also want the dependable beta which one they want most at any given time depends on their rank on the smp read age and their stage in their cycle 6 betabux is not defective it natural read human it just that it the not sexually attractive end of the spectrum and that if you know that and want sex you should conclude that you need to work towards being more alpha ,47,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,this op if there anyone in your life you do not want to talk to just stop talking to them asking them to stop talking to you is basically asking them a favor aka engaging with them just do not initiate conversation and if they tell you something just say ok or nod and get your mind back on your own business they will quickly figure they are talking to a stone wall and stop engaging you ,28,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,very interesting link thanks,2,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,i actually agree,2,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,great comment actually lucky i said almost before yes it is important to keep a critical mind with everything you read i hope i myself manage to stay critical for anything i read i try to ask myself 1 does this fit most my experience or do i have several anecdotes that contradict it 2 does this makes sense from a scientific perspective ie evolutionary psychology for trp material 3 does this fit with anything i know that have passed those same tests before the reason why i am on the red pill is because most of the canon theory passed those tests like every human being i am heavily critical of anything that does not conform my pre existing opinions but i have the chance to have a very curious and scientific mind made science my job so that i value a new theory that fits the observation better that any pre existing theory i may hold red pill theory made so much sense according to the criteria i wrote before that it turned me from a classic progressive secular humanist into a realist conservative traditionalist in no time even with canon redpill theory i do not agree with it all i am still a recurrent critic of some minor points in rollo posts but i also often disagree with many new contributions on this sub so although i can be sure of nothing your comments regularly fail my three tests above hence my criticism i read the sidebar several times and more in terms of books and other classic manosphere blogs and reflects on its contents through the three tests above regularly i hope i have processed it by now though i keep re reading it every so often to check if it still stands the tests given the evolution of my red pill understanding i do parrot everything that stand those tests again and again and i hold these test passes as proof of the truth and importance of what i parrot your last two sentences are on point always good to stay critical and i hope my system allows me to not fall into mindless partisanship in any case what i see as your mistakes in your comments grind my gears i feel like you will never learn but i never say anything and just always wonder why this comment of yours admitting your own stubbornness the metric i use is if someone downvotes me is because they are a beta scrub finally explains it all but then i hold stubbornness as an overall positive masculine character trait so in summary i hate it but goddamn do i respect it ,2,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,it so weird that for someone who posts excellent content on human interactions thereby demonstrating you practice what you preach you can get so butthurt over a discussion on a criticism of mine to the point of rage quitting trp not entirely rage based since you posted this new work i will try to clarify for the last time my criticism was not on the content of what you wrote i deemed it excellent my criticism was not on the lack of details you are welcome to put as much or as little detail on whatever topic ou want my criticism was only on you titling a guide to day game for a post that goes from preparing to go out to approach while forgetting what comes after from this criticism several options opened to you you could have justified your choice by saying beginners need only to concern themselves with prep to approach you could have justified your choice by saying by guide i did not mean an essay giving information on the whole process but only about the beginning of the process or you could as you have chosen to do tell me my criticism is nitpicking that you think your content is good as it is and you like your choice of words and we would have just agreed to disagree but rage quitting because you received mixed feedback between my criticism of your choice of title or others criticising your content or even your person is a little bit how to say that lacking in backbone your content is good just grow a spine and take on the bad feedback and criticisms like a rite of passage and let the overall vote count and comments decide of the worthiness of your contributions ,3,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,i agree i am pretty critical of reddit as a vehicle to transmit knowledge its inherently democratic nature every user irrespective of background and opinion has right to post and 1 vote per person has much appeal and is great to draw the crowds since the most appealing votes comments rise to the top but is very questionable for learning anything there simply too many contributions from people who think they know but are unaware they do not i might be one how can i know and may be upvoted to the top by similar people that how this subreddit has been slowly but steadily misunderstanding many red pill concepts and as the misunderstanding goes uncheck they steadily become new canon definitions that muddle the original teaching contributions from endorsed contributors are a way to keep this in check but this is not optimal best thing you can do is check anything you read here against canon literature that is manosphere blogs rational male chateau heartiste black dragon illimitable men etc and particularly the older blogs posts and the sidebar and of course against your own experience not belief but experience ,13,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,awesome account cheers a quick read of the wikipedia page on bonobos show quite strikingly how our western society has moved from a male dominated chimp like one to a female dominated bonobo like one though the wiki page is not detailed enough it does not say much about parental investment and how male attractiveness is defined in bonobo society surely there must be criteria for sexual selection to occur i need to read more into it so thanks for the links ,3,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,yes as op explained there was positive selection in our ancestry for males to feel reluctant to commit to a woman for whom we have evidence she is a slut since women biological imperative necessitates a male commitment there was a correspondingly positive selection for women to feel the need to hide such evidence in order to avoid males reluctance to commit hence women innate reluctance at being seen as a slut hence the hamstering on i am still a virgin because anal does not count or this fling during my europe tour does not count because there was no feelings involved etc note my emphasis on the word innate despite feminists wishful belief that slut shaming is a cultural vestige of a patriarchal society that must be torn down so women can slut around to their whim publicly proudly and not been penalised for it by men judgment of them in their quest for a suitable commiting male the reality is that women feel in their guts the need to hide their slutiness because this behaviour was positively selected best proof of the innate character of this behaviour is that more than men it is women that slut shame other women as an unconscious tactic to lower their mate value on a smp they also compete on ,13,TheRedPill

Auvergnat, being from such a different culture i have a hard time believing what is always deemed blue pill is simply a social construct you are a human and biologically want to pair bond and propagate yeah i am starting thinking more and more that the blue pill is not the cultural result of a lying society bent to the feminine imperative but more that of a comfortable and soft society in which the beta sexual strategy thrives the idea goes that a man bent on a beta strategy is more likely to want to pair bond and want to believe in a faithful wife and thus propagate the myths of everlasting love and faithfulness just know that it fine to loosen up around someone if you want dude mind detailing your thought in my experience loosening up is the start of the slippery slope but would be happy to be told i am wrong ,3,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,this feeling you have means you have not integrated she not mine it just my turn mentality so get to work on it once you will have integrated it you wo not care about it anymore because the cup is already broken ,15,asktrp
Auvergnat,usually hard times create hard men so given your background i am a bit surprised at your blue pill mindset but it wo not be too much of a problem most here arrive with a low smv so the redpill awareness and mindset tends to arrive first after a few months while it a few years of slowly building up a decent smv in case of people like you with a smv that is already so high that you are already reaping the benefits in terms of pussy you just need to keep reading red pill material and you will get the mindset in no time just make sure you do not get a girl pregnant or marry one until you have got it once you have the mindset right you wo not regret the sweetness of the blue pill anymore ,11,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,you are just too new to the red pill you still have the typical expectations and reactions of a blue pill upbringing i mean seriously look at what you wrote you hook up with lots of hot girls then one day you decide you have had enough of the lack of connection and want to find the one so you find a girl that fits the bill and catch the feelings after seeing her twice and now you feel all butthurt that she on tinder which is where you found her for fucks sake ,58,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,beat me to it just as with every trp concept newbs tend to have the wrong idea of what is smv smv is not the total sum of some objective features that men think ought to attract women eg i have decent looks and cash i would say i am a good 8 style of comment smv is simply the subjective measure of your attractiveness as a sexual partner to a specific woman at this specific time and place this is not new with display of high value puas did not mean show off your gucci watch your muscles or talk about your world travels they meant subtle things that hint at your social importance and mastery such as dominate the conversation control the frame or lead her somewhere sexual value was always meant to be in our lingo more subtle and subjective as the typically rational male would want to define it think of it this way you could be sitting at a bar by yourself trying to chat the waitress by the virtue of your looks clothes choice of drink body language and level of social mastery game she perceives you as having a given value to her as a potential sexual partner suddenly two super hot girls who know you and like you join you at the bar and start competing for your attention to that waitress at that place and that moment your value just shot through the roof because of preselection without you having changed any of your objective features under the appropriate smv definition op excellent post on the extreme importance of lifestyle and logistics summarizes accurately the concept of local social status that i advocate tirelessly as the most important component of smv looks game assets status and yes preselection is part of local social status ,26,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,even if it true that women as a group are on average weaker and shorter than men as a group and that you can make a similar statement about intelligence depending on your definition of it it still does not follow that women should earn less i am a man who is shorter and weaker and less intelligent than many other men and that does not mean that a reason to pay me less the only reason to be paid less is if you do less quantity or quality of work and if you are not good at negotiating your salary and these are the real reasons why women as a group are on average paid less than men as a group oops did not mean to write that see update below let try again his statement was a moronic statement to make irrespective of today pc context the only reason to be paid less for the same job is if you do less quantity or quality of work and if you are not good at negotiating your salary the real reasons why women as a group are on average paid less than men as a group is due to the higher proportion of women doing part time types of jobs that pay less career interruptions and lesser negotiating skills ,2,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,this is an extremely selfish point of view but then trp never taught to be altruistic so you come here leeching off the teachings of the more experienced than you but do not plan to ever contribute back ,18,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,do as you wish that what frame is but be sure that if women see you as their optimal bb ticket because of your obvious wealth they will withhold sex to try to manipulate you into committing here what i suggest as a workaround do as you wish and tell her about you and your wealth if she asks and you do not want to hide it do invite her at expensive restaurants if that what you like to do but prepare yourself mentally for her seeing you as her beta golden ticket and as a result her attempts at manipulating you into committing aka delaying sex do escalate physically early and strongly make it extremely clear in your actions that you want sex and you want it now brace for her resisting as manipulation tactic for example in the form of it going too fast for me but let meet again soon at the first sign of her resisting call off all future hanging out sharply if she asks why do not hesitate to state clearly i have had too many dates with women seeing me as a meal ticket rather than as a human being normally you would not want to be this overt in gaming we would rather advise to deal with lmr the classic way covertly and along with pull push to build attraction and bypass her rational mind to deal only with her animal brain but here is different because she not resisting her attraction out of fear for her social status but out of calculated manipulation also in your case your astronomically high smv means you have all cards in hands and are basically untouchable so push hard and overtly at the first sign of manipulation attempt let her stew for a couple of weeks on this that will give her the time to hamster that she lost her best prospect she ever had because she misjudged you and thought she could manipulate you contact her again after some time hey wanna hang out again get ready for her putting out this time and fast ,7,asktrp
Auvergnat,i have thought about it before and my answer is yes the feminine is attracted to the masculine and all masculine features count height muscles broad shoulders jawline large hands beard and facial hair etc now that does not mean that all women love a man with a beard for a whole lot of reasons some women are at a life stage where they are actively looking for a bb and the less masculine the better appearance factors in less in women attraction to men status incl preselection social mastery aka game and others are very important so a beard wo not magically get you more girls particularly if we live in times where facial hair indicates low status for ex in the 90 people sporting a beard or mustache were just has beens women still have physical preferences usually based on her past experience if her dad she loved so much or an alpha of her past were shaven while her creepy uncle or that villain in a movie she watched when she was young had a beard she might be repulsed by it so yeah the cop out answer depends on girls depends on you is unfortunately the right answer but it does not invalidate that facial hair as a masculine feature will probably on average and in theory in a cultural vaccum make women more attracted to you ,1,asktrp
Auvergnat,1 she not trying to fuck you over she just looking for another relationship and it turns out her best current prospects are in your common circle she out there for herself as you should 2 now that you broke up you have no say in her next relationships stay out of it 3 you may still be able to maintain that social circle as long as you do not have oneitis if your pride gets in the way you will have to gtfo start other social circles going in a general manner i am surprised redpillers understand the point of having sexual options but do not necessarily see the point of having professional options and social options anyone reading this and having just one circle of friends wake up and go make others ,1,asktrp

Auvergnat,is red pill theory mostly factually correct as in fitting with the observation of intersexual dynamics yes good on you for having the intellectual honesty to acknowledge it are there many posters commenters on the trp sub angry at women and filled with resentment oh yes however this does not change red pill theory being factually correct particularly some redpillers resentment towards women expressing itself by a strong attachment to the concepts of cock carousel and the wall does not invalidate the factual correctness of the red pill about those concepts these concepts do not exist as a result of the resentment of some recently unplugged angry young men they exist independently from it and then said resentment by many users make these concepts actively discussed and often misrepresented let take the wall for example in canon red pill theory it designates a woman life stage when she realizes that her currently declining attractiveness does not allow her to compete against other younger women for the attention of the most valued men and she starts developing a feeling of urgency to settle that tends to make her switch her sexual strategy from hooking up with hot guys af to finding a secure relationship bb this is real women do decline in attractiveness often sharply and they do get anxious about it and they do switch to looking for a more secure partnership due to this anxiety and all of this is true independently from resentful trp newbies who misinterpret this concept as women getting ugly and feeling sorry they rejected guys like me earlier in her life actually us trp theoreticians often need to remind these newbies that it not because a woman has hit the wall that it means she wo not have her cake and it it too women at this stage of life often do successfully find a dependable beta husband as for the cock carousel if this does not lead to a decline in a woman value as a partner then why do women actively hide their n count they do so because they know that prospective beta partners do not like it whether riding the cock carousel made her uglier or not whether it made her incapable to pair bond or not or whether it increased a risk of infidelity or not is besides the point the interesting fact is only that if this information was to be known to a prospective mate he would immediately get a gut feeling that she wo not make a good partner by this most direct definition a high n count does reduce her value as a partner in the eye of prospective mates overall the red pill is factually correct it does fit the observations made about intersexual dynamics and the wall and riding the cock carousel reduces a woman value as a partner are among the factually correct observations theories even if there were no resentful trp newbies taking pleasure in obsessing over the wall and the cock carousel and their effects on relationship dynamics to the point of often misrepresenting them these concepts would still exist and still be valid ,6,PurplePillDebate

Auvergnat,you do not have to act so defensive i am not telling you that your post is shit it not nor demanding that you write us a long novel on every step of day game i am only giving you a criticism that you do not seem to be willing to take despite you saying so that all your good points constitute a good guide on psyching oneself up and preparing for day game but do not actually say a single thing about day game itself and that it a bit rich to call it a guide on day game in these conditions that a problem on message boards that one easily feels personally attacked when facing criticism instead of taking it professionally and using it to grow in this case and as a keen reader of game material my criticism could prompt you to share the rest of your thoughts on day game building attraction getting her invested in the convo getting her number preventing flakes etc does not have to be baby stepping does not have to be novel length just curious on what is your take on actual day game aka after approaching which is where your current guide ends edit i finally had some time to explore your history and only discover now you have been posting quite frequently these past few days on the topic of conversation as you said in one post not groundbreaking but good to be reminded of basics that partly answers my question about your thoughts on day game it still leaves off the number closing ,4,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,my point is you wrote a post titled a guide to cooking that only contains a list of all the ingredients you need to start cooking know what i am sayin i would expect a guide to day game to lead the reader from preparing for day game all the way to at least get her number you just stopped at the start and calling the rest baby stepping is dishonest from your part now if you have a confidence and conversation piece great add it to this preparation for day game piece and then add a getting her number piece at the end and then you will have your guide ,6,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,also see rollo most recent update on the topic in which he discusses how women reinvent this image of themselves as good waiting girls in order to hide the fact that betas are not that attractive to her anymore https therationalmale com 2017 03 15 the epiphany phase revisited and my addendum to it http archive is 5j4sw suggesting women also make betas wait in order to test for the quality of their betahood that thesis is simple enough rollo but i think you are missing another huge evolutionary incentive at making beta bob wait see bob here is for her a mean to fulfill the betabux side of her dual sexual strategy and in order to optimise it she needs to make sure he willing to give a lot of his resources in exchange for her sexual access and what better test for bob willingness to share as much of possible of his resources whatever she brings to the table than checking how long will he be willing to wait for sex and how much time attention and money will he be willing to spend before she finally opens her legs for him i would therefore surmise that making beta bob wait before sex is for the post wall woman not only an expression of her lukewarm sexual interest in him but also a test for optimal beta qualities that is she may be settling for a lower smv man and not liking it one bit but she still unconsciously going for the best deal she can get just like she shit tests potential alphafux to verify the quality of their alphahood she wait tests potential betabux to verify the quality of their betahood i would add an addendum to this addendum post wall women making men wait re invent their image as a good girl because they know that what they need to attract a beta taking into account the following from a recent comment of mine http archive is pvlqh the alpha male has in theory so many women to bang he would not care sharing one or two that what we see in practice for example the sexual strategy most advocated on trp spinning plates is a fundamentally alpha strategy and it would thrive in a society where women dual sexual strategy is the norm the problem is only that it a lot of work to become alpha enough to be able to be selected as a lover by many women and that by definition not everyone can be a top 10 value man the truth is that it the beta who would not tolerate having to share his chick with an alpha dude women sexual strategy totally fucks up with the beta sexual strategy indeed men sexual strategy is also dual but the manosphere has not discussed the topic as much i would venture giving it the following definition men dual sexual strategy if possible fuck a large variety of chicks if not exchange the commitment of my resources to get one but ensure that she gives birth to and raises my kids then very obviously the image of a good girl is of paramount importance to attract a beta hence women entering the epiphany phase and switching their strategy from af to bb must reinvent themselves as prude girls this is necessary both to test for a prospective male beta qualities and to show good mate value to said prospective beta males ,39,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,as usual the best measure of all is sex an ex contacts you wishing to come back in your life assuming you do not have oneitis for her or are sure you wo not catch it just welcome her game her with minimum investment of your time as you would a brand new girl if she welcomes the seduction and has sex with you you have got a new plate if she does not welcome the seduction and resist it she just wanted you as an orbiter just next at all times remain unattached to the outcome ,19,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,considering offing yourself because you do not get sex is as desperate as it gets unfortunately million of years of evolution have given bitches the super power of smelling desperation on you and that happens to be the most unattractive thing in existence with that level of desperation you could be tall ripped handsome and rich and still not pull solution stop caring about sex either make the conscious effort of not trying to get it anymore or go see a hooker to get that over with results will happen when you do care less about it ,15,asktrp

Auvergnat,correct answer after all it even in the title how to make friends and trp is pretty clear about the fact you do not get a girl by being her friend friendship is an equal relationship scratch my back and i will scratch yours opposite sex attraction is an inherently imbalanced matter men are attracted to the submissive and women are attracted to the dominant but then the book is great to help create and sustain social circles and better increase your social rank in them ,3,asktrp

Auvergnat,we are getting into murky waters here if we are demanding our discussions to fulfill the scientific method a physicist would laugh at you dissing a field as not scientific so that you could bring up psychology as a real science shit fitness comfort testing is definitely redpill bro science loosely justified by evolutionary psychology but mostly based on the principle of let try to figure what hypothesis appears to fit the most data with data being the collective experience of thousands of men discussing on the manosphere so yeah not real science but bloody relevant though anyway i am not sure i understand the point you are trying to make it very interesting and you are trying to stay clear of the correlation implying causation fallacy aka attraction agitation or attraction causes agitation or agitation causes attraction but still seem to rely on it to draw conclusions it seems pretty plausible to think women shit test a man because she attracted to him and anxious that the guy is really an alpha and not a beta in disguise and it just as plausible to assume women betaize a man because she anxious she going to leave her all around women anxiety will be the proximate cause to many a behaviour but that does not mean the ultimate cause of that behaviour or the anxieties are necessarily the same ,5,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,there you go i think the confusion comes from the problem that beta is ill defined on the manosphere on one side 1 there is alpha beta defined from the dual sexual strategy of women women want two things they sexually desire the sexually attractive male af and they anxiously need the dependability of the resources time attention money etc of a willingly providing male bb on the other side 2 there is alpha beta defined from the attractiveness of men or lack of either you are the alpha chad that slays or you are a beta loser alpha in those two definitions are basically the same but beta is not under both definitions beta is non sexually attractive for sure but beta under definition 1 is still a valid asset to women the one fulfilling half of their sexual strategy while beta under definition 2 is worthless on this subreddit definition 2 has come to dominate because it simpler to understand for newbies and that newbies dominate the narrative landscape by their sheer number and the democratic nature of reddit 1 upvote per person on the rest of the manosphere both definitions co exist depending on the view of each blog author comfort tests make sense under definition 1 shit tests are test for alpha traits verification of value sexiness comfort tests are tests for beta traits verification of security of providing under this view passing a shit test confirms that you are high value that you are attractive that you are alpha and failing it demonstrates you are not high value that you are unattractive that you are not alpha but it does not necessarily mean that you are beta under definition 1 because your unattractiveness does not necessarily make you a good provider under definition 2 as you noticed the notion of comfort test loses its point if one fails a shit test he is not alpha therefore he is beta loser what is comfort test testing then back to definition 1 comfort tests make sense and are useful in two specific cases a woman past the wall anxious at ever meeting a man who will commit to her aka looking to fulfill her beta strategy will comfort test you to ensure you fit the profile if you only show alpha traits she sure will be attracted to you but she might resist hooking up with you because she done it too often and she not that kind of woman anymore or just use you for a ons but if you pass comfort tests aka show just the right amount of dependability security not too much because beta traits are anti attractive you might qualify as a more interesting long term prospect you might get the reward of a ltr if that your thing or better a plate that last longer than one night until she realizes you fooled her and never intended to commit admittedly this case is rare for a woman you just met you are better off considering the question are you a player as a shit test to answer with amused mastery rather than a comfort test to answer with anti seductive re assurance but then if the interaction before that leads you to believe the girl is actively looking for a beta provider it might just well be a comfort test see heartiste post on the topic https heartiste wordpress com 2014 06 20 are you a player demonstrating the subtlety of answering this question the more frequent case is that of a woman in relationship with you whether she attracted to you or not and sensing that your dependability is fading that you are starting looking elsewhere she will comfort test you to re assure herself that you are not going to leave her the reward in this case is that she wo not go batshit insane because of her worries often we have people on asktrp surprised that their gf is going insanely dramatic even though they pass all shit tests as taught by trp when what happened is that these were comfort tests and she needed op to show some betaness to reassure her and they just did not see it if you fail these comfort tests repeatedly your gf might just go away to seek a more dependable boyfriend though it will kill her inside to have to leave you attractive jerkboy a quick search on comfort testing gives some weight to the view that it fits definition 1 https heartiste wordpress com 2014 06 18 value shit tests vs comfort shit tests http archive is 8dmzw http archive is b6zpq ,2,TheRedPill
Auvergnat, does this mean that they would thrive in a polygamous society exclusively geared towards them meaning dudes cannot have two chicks but bitches can have two dudes in a way yes the ultimate fulfillment of women dual strategy would be to have a alpha who is also beta since it impossible apart in novels the alternative is to have an alpha who would fuck around since that one of the things that make him alpha and a beta who would be providing exclusively to her note that since beta billy is always here for her it not necessary for alpha chad to always be there as long as he always here to give her the d she fulfills her strategy note that the societal pushes for accepting and normalizing the sandbergian tactic https therationalmale com 2014 06 18 controlling interests fuck attractive men in youth later marry the dependable man polyamory and open relationships https therationalmale com 2015 12 16 open relationships forcing a beta partner into accepting that she has an alpha lover under the guise of having an open mind and sexual positivity and open cuckoldry https therationalmale com 2015 12 07 open cuckoldry forcing a beta partner into accepting that she has an alpha lover because what the fuck you are going to do about it loser are all testimonies to women pressure on society to accept their strategy as the standard one but what makes this impossible to fulfill is the alpha part there is no way in hell an alpha would let another guy share the girl he chose or would feel so strong about a female that he would tolerate a her desire to want to keep him but add someone else in the relationship dude is alpha he can get other chicks the incompatibility you identified is what u rollo tomassi called the cardinal rule of sexual strategies https therationalmale com 2016 07 29 the cardinal rule of sexual strategies for one gender s sexual strategy to succeed the other gender must compromise or abandon their own but it not entirely accurate the alpha male has in theory so many women to bang he would not care sharing one or two that what we see in practice for example the sexual strategy most advocated on trp spinning plates is a fundamentally alpha strategy and it would thrive in a society where women dual sexual strategy is the norm the problem is only that it a lot of work to become alpha enough to be able to be selected as a lover by many women and that by definition not everyone can be a top 10 value man the truth is that it the beta who would not tolerate having to share his chick with an alpha dude women sexual strategy totally fucks up with the beta sexual strategy indeed men sexual strategy is also dual but the manosphere has not discussed the topic as much i would venture giving it the following definition men dual sexual strategy if possible fuck a large variety of chicks if not exchange the commitment of my resources to get one but ensure that she gives birth to and raises my kids ,3,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,shit testing and betaization look the same on surface ie trying to slowly erode or break an alpha frame but their purpose are completely different shit testing is to test the congruency of a man frame usually a man that the woman does not know well betaization is to get desirable beta qualities off a man usually a man that the woman is in relationship with they should be answered in the same way ie refusing the beta frame offered and result in the same outcome ie more sexual attraction but it still good to make the difference because where passing a shit test is all positive refusing the process of betaization implies failing a comfort test see my other comment in this thread for the purpose of betaization and why it important to women ,6,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,only good answer in this thread people on trp seem to forget fast their redpill theory 101 women have a dual sexual strategy they want the alpha fucks and they also want the beta bucks women sexually desire the sexually attractive male but they also need the exclusive commitment of the dependable male thus women will desire the sexually attractive male and desire to turn him into a dependable male giving her exclusive access to his time and attention and the most obvious proof of this is that what i just described happens to be the basic plot of every novel for women ever written little do women know that betaizing the alpha turns him into a non alpha the same man cannot satisfy both sides of her sexual strategy at the same time the fulfilment of women dual sexual strategy with one male would be ideal but is impossible in practice but women are not conscious of this ,12,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,i am glad you raised that point i did think of talking about it too because the parallel was obvious but refrained for the sake of brevity when i was a young idealist progressive i thought of tank man as that symbol of the resistance to oppression shit that powerful man now years later and as a realist i gotta ask you what is the guy name you do not know nobody knows and we do not know because that man got captured right after you do not see that bit on posters as much as the standing in front of tank aye and vanished he was in all likelihood killed less than 24h later after a very probable long and painful interrogation another question for you what did his bravery result in answer nothing absolutely nothing changed on that day in china or ever after in the decades since this happened the only thing that this man brave action resulted in besides getting killed is getting young idealist westerner progressives collective dicks hard because of the power of the symbol of resistance the symbol was printed on posters and tshirts and started thousands of discussions but in terms of actual effects on reality nothing the collective bravery of soldiers fighting and dying in a hill can change the outcome of the battle sure but the bravery of an incredibly weak opposition to an incredibly strong force is nothing but a symbol for those who wish reality was not so awfully real the collective bravery of french r sistance to nazi occupation during ww2 had an extremely minor influence on the outcome of war the number of r sistants who were killed in the process compared to what they achieved is incredibly unbalanced if it was not for the superior force of the us entering the war and saving the day that minor resistance would have been but a barely noticeable splinter in the foot for the otherwise unstoppable march of the evil nazi war machine over europe the symbol is great food for thought and discussed at lengths in the safety of homes but the reality trumps the symbolism every time ,5,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,you get used to it and surprisingly fast before discovering trp i was like you morally idealistic thanks to a successful blue pill programming being the other man felt icky i could not touch a woman who had a boyfriend once i knew this info she would become out of bounds in my mind most of my friends did not share this mentality they would say they would not cheat on their girlfriend when in ltr but when they are single all girls are fair game if they cheat on their boyfriend with them that the girl fault not theirs the logic made sense to me responsibility is only that of the one who is in couple but i could not morally adhere to it some of these friends thought my moral standing was stupid while some praised it but all of them scored more than me way more than me now i would say that they simply had more of an alpha mindset than i had note for people interested in game theory that this mentality benefited me once in my blue pill time i got with a girl who had a boyfriend out of town despite my morals we were both attracted to each other and tried not to do anything but every time we met we would go a little bit further the fact that our lust was forbidden only managed to create more sexual tension i had some of the best sex i ever had when we finally did the deed along with mortifying guilt on my side for having transgressed my own morals i do not suggest this as a game tactic as you preferably want to beat the iron when it hot to avoid flakiness but it did teach me in retrospect with redpill awareness of the awesome power of plausible deniability ie we wo not do anything so we can meet safely and of the build up of sexual tension through pull push anyway when i discovered trp first i was like you horrified to see that the common take on this matter was does not matter if she taken married will game and bang if i can i thought it was ok i could still learn trp and benefit from its teachings without having to go for girls who are taken but as your knowledge of women behaviour grows eg saying i have a bf as a shit test or to evade responsibility when sexual tension builds up hypergamy as constant desire to upgrade to a better bf categorising men in her life as either nuisance provider or lover you start seeing the fluidity of the sexual market place and the cheating of women as a feature of life also your moral high ground comes from your identifying with the man who is cheated on commited and in love after enough time on trp you stop identifying to the poor bugger and suddenly your morals ai not so firm anymore so your moral high ground slowly erodes you think less and less about it and it matters less and less and then at some point you realise that you do not care anymore when a girl you are gaming says i have a bf it might be a lie shit test or it might be true she wants you to shoulder responsibility for keeping going or it might be part true orbiter or ldr but you simply react by adjusting your game without giving a second thought about the poor dude and you finally become like your alpha friends of your past last tinder chick i banged in that situation told me after we had sex before she did not tell about her relationship status and if you are smart you do not ask she had broken up with her last bf of three years a few months prior she said he was just too indecisive and she eventually found it too frustrating so she ended it little did she know a little bit of facebook stalking had allowed me to find out she was still officially with this guy and the few public posts he had on his facebook page demonstrated clear oneitis ridden betaness endless messages of love for his snowflake and pictures of them together blue pill me would have stopped pursuing her in the moment i found out or reacted in horror had i discovered this info after the deed and perhaps even told her off red pill me just smirked at the nature of women as revealed by the manosphere and yet confirmed in a real life example once again felt a bit bad for the guy but not blaming myself one bit she probably slept with many other guys than me and just considered for a while whether i should bother sending him a copy of the rationale male anonymously or not so to conclude keep your morals if you want do not force yourself changing them if you stay on this sub long enough you will eventually find they change themselves and you could not care about them be any happier ps i definitely would not get a coworker fired to make more money though trp did make me become a bit more selfish in my career eg i do not feel i owe my employer to stay in their company for example but i would not mind fucking a married woman now if the situation is not such that consequences will befall me say a woman traveling for example as in my story above your two examples are not equivalent if a married woman fucks me it means she unhappy in her couple and needs sexual relief outside with me or someone else or it simple hypergamy talking or it that time of the month and beta husband has been successfully manipulated into accepting cuckoldness like in op example your morals come down from a time when her wedding ring made her the property of a man and sleeping with her made you a thief this age is long gone and trp will help you update your morals to our time without you having any regret in it ,3,asktrp

Auvergnat,you are right and i precised this in my private convo with op if you are very attractive then yes girls look at you and if the girl is not shy and currently at the horny phase of the month then yes she might engage conversation be dtf straight away on tinder or even make sexual advances to you in bars and clubs but that special treatment is reserved for the top 2 men in looks here you need to be genetically gifted tall have a good face structure have good hair and be very fit if you have the good genes the fitness is something you can eventually get and join that special club but for the 98 who are not genetically gifted there is no cool haircut fat loss 6 packs abs good fashion that will get you to enter that special club of men who get approached sure enough they will all be great assets that may attract girls and might help you get laid with minimal game involved but you will need game involved i did not mention all of this because in the case of op i needed to uproot from this mind the idea that finding a cool haircut may somehow make girls look at him and want to talk to him that the mindset of those guys who think a fedora and a neckbeard should get them attention from women and get bitter when they see it does not work ,7,asktrp

Auvergnat,men look at the women they find attractive and some engage conversation in hope to bang them women are not men they do not work like that but since being a man is all you ever experienced you made the classic error to think women were working like you it called solipsism so in conclusion women do not express their attraction to you by staring at you and engaging conversation so stop using this as a yardstick of your attraction ,41,asktrp

Auvergnat,talking to journalists is pointless the idea of media reporting objective facts is an old one that does not apply to our modern era if it ever applied the point of journalism is to have an opinion find the facts that bolster that opinion artfully write a piece to present this bias while giving the reader an impression of objectivity and defend the result as factual the term of fake news is recent but the idea behind it is nothing new so yeah if journalists contact you feel free to answer but be sure they will twist your words to fit their opinion every time ,5,TheRedPill

Auvergnat, it seems you might have gone defcon1 a bit quickly nah i reckon he did great what he did was perfect teaching he showed her with crystal clarity that 1 it an important boundary for him 2 just her thinking of going there is a boundary crossing it means she willing to put the relationship into jeopardy and 3 the punishment is swift and deadly 100 withdrawal of attention now op just has to follow through break up let her wallow a bit and let her come back with her tail between her legs and op can show great magnanimity into taking her back as plate and op will enjoy an extremely faithful partner who will not even think about getting anywhere close to that boundary ever again ,8,asktrp
Auvergnat,approach anxiety is an ancient deep seated masculine emotion even if you had no shaming history you would have approach anxiety anyway we all do actually not all of us the men who got successful with girls early in life do not have it and this should hint you as the only thing that will kill that anxiety for you getting really really successful with girls until then you will have to do with it using one of the few techniques developed by pua to trick your brain just long enough to approach anyway approach in under 3 seconds approach with the deliberate intention to get rejected elderly opening etc ,1,asktrp
Auvergnat,you are being a little bit unfair there rollo sure enough the feminine and masculine imperative are different and sure enough hypergamy is specifically feminine but let not downplay the ugliness from women perspective of polygamy as the masculine imperative just like a man does not enjoy being confronted to the result of the hypergamic urge in a woman a woman wo not enjoy the result of the polygamic urge in a man aka cheating of course the fact that women can answer to our criticism of women hypergamy by the fair criticism of men polygamy does not remove our right to criticise hypergamy and the result of its unleashing in the modern destruction of the family unit at least men fulfilling their polygamic urge by philandering was not breaking up family on the same scale as women fulfilling their hypergamic urge nowadays ,1,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,as usual turn to evolutionary psychology for the answer this behavior is the exact same one as children trying to extract a maximum of resources time support etc from their parents you can generalize it to the behavior of any dependent party in a provider dependent relationship the dependent will manipulate the provider into providing more resources to him her at the expenses of the provider him herself and of other dependents for example this dynamic governs the behavior of siblings in which a child manipulate his parents to favor him at the expense of its brother aka but he started but he had more than me last time another example of this dynamic at play is a wive in a second marriage manipulating her husband into privileging her children rather than his children from a previous marriage this one stings personally as i witnessed my cringingly beta uncle new girlfriend successfully managing to get him to alienate his family including me and his own sons from his previous marriage so as to get him to spend 100 of his time on her and her son but like everything in the nature of humans this is not a conscious process it deep seated in people psyche you might be annoyed at a dog barking and you may want to teach him not to but dogs are made to bark girls will always want to extract more from you that what girls do even if she can objectively realize there is no more to be extracted from you she will still unconsciously want more and complain that you do not give enough or more likely prepare to branch swing to another provider with resources to extract as a natural dependent evolution designed her psyche for this behavior just like children ,26,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,easy tiger i just checked your post history you have been here 4 months and you have been deeply angered since the beginning but since you want advice i will just give you this one piece when you think of it there are really just two things you can do about your life change or not change now reading and commenting on reddit cursing at others complaining how life is unfair expecting people to help you and feeling sorry for yourself are all activities that might make you feel good but you gotta admit they wo not change a thing about your life it not to say you cannot do them you are free to do whatever you want to do but at the very least recognize that these are not things that lead to change now if you really want some change the only thing that will make it happen is taking action nothing changes unless there is a force that acts to operates that change that basically the first law of physics aka the first law of our universe in the case of your life that force is you and unfortunately there no other you must take action not talk not complain not write not read not stay there but take action do not just read that you should lift but go to a gym find heavy weights and take the action to lift them off the floor do not just read how women are fickle and discuss the ways to approach them but put your shoes on get to a cafe and take the action to engage a conversation with a woman again it not that you have to do it if it feels like too much of a burden you are free not to do any of it but you cannot escape realize that only taking action not talk results in whatever change you wish to happen now pause you have just read my comment and are smart enough to have understood what i tried to say even though you might disagree you said you were looking for mentorship and one has just popped up and talked to you personally an endorsed contributor has seen your plea and decided to take upon his time to give you a piece of advice because you asked for it and that piece of advice is that only taking action not talk results in whatever change you wish to happen what are you going to do are you going to press that grey reply button under my comment in order to debate the metaphysics of what i just said and explain to me why my comment is not useful or why it does not apply in your case or are you going to take action it the moment of truth motherfucker what are you going to do ,9,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,perhaps but i would retort that 1 in ops story she was not exactly rejected since he gave her exactly what she said she wanted her hindbrain might not take it as a rejection i agree i am nitpicking here 2 women may take rejection harder but they also move on much faster at the same second a male with higher smv enters her field of view and expresses interest in her op wo not register on her mind anymore as per war brides principle 3 women hostility may take the form of completely ignoring op i personally experienced women who i rejected just acting like i never existed out of spite or in an effort to move on 4 assuming you are very right and she reacts personally and with hostility this does not necessarily invalidate my comment that his ego will deflate real fast when she sees him flirting with another man out of hostility to him aka make him jealous or not ,2,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,ok confusion here because of my choice of words my bad i did not mean to say that girls who used to be on her own are bad prospects because of that specific feature i only meant that an article that says what it means to love a girl who x is a predictable essay on all the common flaws of girls whether they did x or not but that somehow must be forgiven by men in the name of love for example she s strong maybe even too strong for you at first but do not let this intimidate you which the redpill aware will correctly understand as she going to be an insufferable bitch to you but you gotta forgive her see for yourself http archive is 6hsxg,9,TheRedPill
Auvergnat, a lot of guys on here say all girls are red pill meaning they operate under red pill concepts but i am sure they do not know it consciously then they are not red pill the reason for the red pill metaphor is that it describes the thing that wakes you up to the truth the truth being that of natural sexual dynamics women dual sexual strategy hypergamy solipsism feelz over realz men variety over quality etc which are built in our biology and eternal at least until we evolve into something else than homo sapiens everybody operate under these truths men women alphas and betas teenagers and adults now it a matter of whether you realize it or not and more specifically if you did not know it previously and then found something that made you realize it ie the manosphere aka the red pill ,11,TheRedPill
Auvergnat, female websites are full of these sort of essays she probably read a similar post on jezebel or askwomen and then parroted it all over facebook no doubt to many likes from women and manginas alike yeah these public calls at appeasing the betas into accepting the modern woman flaws appear all so common predictable after taking the red pill an aquaintance of mine just posted a link to an article titled what it means to love a girl who is used to be on her own which predictably lists a long series of red flags and deal breakers that men are supposed to accept and forgive ,64,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,will for the win as usual it all ok for op to want to white knight if he wishes to if resisting his instinctive masculine programming to fuck and instead submitting to a beta schema he learned from his blue pill indoctrination feels better to him than busting a nut in a hb10 then good for him and for the next man who will get her easier because of her sexual frustration but the important part in all of this is that the guy genuinely believes she meant what she said and that he did what she truly desired blindsided by his blue pill education he was completely unaware that she really wanted to bang and just needed him to shoulder the responsibility for it i hope for the op that he does not stumble on that girl all over another man in the same bar the next weekend because if so while she will be hoping that hopefully this time this man will get it and give her the plausible deniability she so desires op smug new self esteem as a rare breed will deflate real fast ,24,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,the only difference logistics make are relative to her interest in same night lay if she not into the idea of same night lay you can still bang her at her place by juggling with her asd and giving massive amounts of plausible deniability if she lukewarm at the idea you can bang her at your place by juggling with lmr and giving good plausible deniability if she keen on the idea she wo not mind going to a hotel so there you go just go on the date like any other escalating constantly gauging her interest in same night lay if you get her up to heavy make out and obviously all over you you can just tell her let get out of here and book a hotel and she will go along with pleasure plan the date backwards to move fast and minimise chances of her changing her mind check in advance the possible hotels around have an app ready to be able to book from your phone although many hotels now have automated booking machine at entrance the most important is to not sweat it out do not let the logistics difficulties and the lower chances to score convince you it not worth organising a date with that tinder match just do it if she turns out to be really keen you score and if it turns out she does not sleep on first date it great game practice she might on 2nd,4,asktrp

Auvergnat,ok so it not because you pass shit tests that you are automatically alpha alpha is the collection of sexually attractive traits good looks social personal dominance high status pre selection etc when a woman manages to get with a man she finds sexually attractive and get him to commit to her she slowly turn him into a beta a process called betaization why because she also need to fulfill the other side of her strategy which is getting a dependable and resourceful man to give her always more stuff so she needs her alpha to become her beta once you get into a committed relationship she actively trying to turn you into someone that she needs although it is someone who is unbeknownst to her unattractive that why trp tells you to shack up as late as possible in a ltr not to get married to maintain active dread to pass shit tests to be ready to walk away etc it work for you to fight her instinctive attempts at making a beta out of you and to ensure you stay enough alpha to remain sexually attractive to her it especially important as familiarity brings contempt anyway and that women are naturally attracted to the emotions brought about by mystery and unpredictability aka strange dick is alluring just because it strange you can read more about betaization in that awesome book https www amazon com practical female psychology man ebook dp b00rr6rno6,12,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,you were just given the right answer she did not comment on your work ethic she could not care less about how much time you work as long as the money is rolling in she was commenting on what you do for her which she considers not enough she feels like you think that now you have her so that you do not have to make more efforts to keep her it a standard complaint of women after all you are only in her life to give her stuff vagina tingles money fun your time etc so it her inherent purpose to get more from you even if you were not working at all and giving her 100 of your time she would still be trying to get you to do more stuff with her so the answer is of course not to give her more of your time but just more tingles ,8,asktrp
Auvergnat,stories that are either funny scary sad or engaging relationships holidays travels activities passions not weather philosophy day to day work mundane shit but no need to overthink it just pay attention to her reaction to any topic if she is emotionally engaged in the convo keep going if she is not engaging change topic on top of that i f you can catch yourself talking about or about to talk about something that is not emotionally charged and change topic then you are gold,1,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,a relationship is like any form of human contract that is one where each party is trying to get the better deal for themselves get more while giving less except that in a relationship the terms are constantly being renegotiated depending on the constantly shifting balance of power eg dear hubby since we are now married i will be giving you less sex for the same amount of resources you are currently giving me because i unconsciously realize i can get away with it because you wo not do anything about it since it would be more difficult costly for you to leave me but you need to take into account af bb in your analysis a woman exchange of sex for commitment is only happening for a bb relationship with an alpha sex is something she willingly gives away because that something she receives too it when she is with the beta who is by definition not sexually attractive that sex with him becomes not something she wants but a bargain chip in the constant renegotiation of the terms of the relationship in exchange for his resources so what she did with previous alpha men was not really a price she paid and therefore not a previous cost she needs to take into account when deciding to sex her beta partner or not ,31,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,he right though you are summarizing buss study in a three words sentence that buss himself would oppose buss figured that status is sexy not money even if status often derives from money imagine the guy who is super wealthy but puts all his money in a retirement account using none of it and living as a poor man is he sexually attractive no what about the man who has not a dollar in his bank account and is ugly as fuck but is the most well known rockstar ever is he sexually attractive you bet so status is inherently sexually attractive not money and the question of whether status trumps aesthetics would be a good one to ask but the question of why women are attracted to wealthy men is worth digging deeper in you must keep in mind af bb women want to fuck the sexually attractive man and want the man with resources to commit to her a wealthy man has the resources by definition which makes him a prime beta target but if he also uses his money to display status he will also be sexually attractive he an evolutionary jackpot and yes in that sense money trumps looks but while a woman may be very attracted to a wealthy man because he combines the alpha money derived status with the beta large resources her sexual desire remains for the alpha traits only if our wealthy man decides one day to stop flaunting his money as status she will lose attraction and even then money derived status is not always enough to generate tingles if our wealthy man acts too much invested submissive she will eventually lose attraction hence the trope of the millionaire wife fucking the hot pool boy or why elon musk cannot keep a wife at all ,3,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,very good question i wondered the same and think it the human male complementary sexual strategy to women dual af bb women evolutionary want to fuck the sexually attractive man but need the resources of the dependable man ok well then men would have evolved sort of psychological modules to fit both of those strategies which both allow passing your genes to the next generation even though one is more effective than the other one psychological module consists in wanting to fuck lots of women and getting attached to none alpha and the other module consists in being in love with one woman therefore proving your being committed and dependable beta since the two modules contradict each other not getting attached vs getting attached we men will go fully one or the other depending on how sexually successful we are in some sort of positive feedback therefore the more sexually successful you are the less likely you are to get oneitis for any particular girl so that you can keep passing your genes through an alpha strategy and on the contrary if you are not sexually successful you are more likely to catch oneitis so that you can convince a woman of your dependability and hopefully pass on your genes through a beta strategy love infatuation oneitis is an evolutionary adaptation for sexually unsuccessful men ,5,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,oneitis is the result of scarcity mentality not of blue pill delusion this means you can very well be red pill aware and still have oneitis as op story demonstrated to never have oneitis again you need to uproot scarcity mentality from your psyche which means 1 have sexual options or at least the perception of having options aka spinning plates and 2 be aware that she not yours it just your turn aka always be willing to walk away ,5,TheRedPill

Auvergnat, this not even talking to op because from his post and comments he obviously too invested in the idea that he did everything right to even realize his oneitis but pay attention everyone else this post is a good lesson you can be believing that you are high smv because of your self improvement that you keep oneitis away because you are flirting with other girls or banging them that you did everything right because you read trp often but just like we advise about girls you only have to watch your actions op actions posting on trp about his breakup with the 2 3s of his post being a copy paste of his ex breakup message admitting being heartbroken admitting to spending too much time with her to dumping his plate spinning forgetting she not yours it only your turn just 100 pure oneitis in a relationship he thought was 100 redpill watch your actions ,27,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,there are two ways to think about it either you keep in mind that women attraction for men is a purely emotional matter and that it is directed at strong dominant men so that you must primarily show a mix of confidence and authority along with fun and other emotion inducing topics or you can keep in mind that women are children and you must interact with them as such the later is a good shorthand for the former even though it sounds ethically wrong to male minds that have been force fed a blue pill indoctrination since birth but in truth both mindsets produce the exact same attitude which is the one that is actually attractive to women so pick whichever suits you best ,252,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,i have come up to the same conclusion though could never have expressed it that well thanks two comments 1 science is exactly in the same state scientists manufacture data to fit their hypothesis that why all published material is strangely always statistically significant and always supporting an hypothesis that call for more funding of course the data manufacture happens the same way you describe by picking and choosing the results you need data ai not statistically significant does not get published only difference is that there are not two camps as in politics all science is pushing in the same direction that which bring fundings 2 the information bubble brought about by social media has a major influence in what you describe people start with a preconceived opinion which gets reinforced by echo chamber repeating whatever media tends to the facts of that camp ,4,theredpillright
Auvergnat,ok i understand what you mean my example gave the impression i was advocating that smv is highest in your normal environment which was not really what i tried to say what i tried to say is simply that smv is contextual so you are better off finding the context that benefits you most say for example you are a surfer living in a surf town where every guy surfs if your level is average you clearly wo not stand out you are just one in a crowd but transplant in a city away from the ocean and that tidbit of information makes you stand out a bit and you can use it in your game however if you are the top surfer of that surf town your smv is maxed out there because people know you as that guy who rips in the city that difference in your surfing level does not mean shit your surfing still is but a tidbit of information that makes you stand out a bit but wo not mean much in comparison to some other feature that is clearly used to assess the local pecking order ,3,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,bang on smv is both contextual and woman dependent eg if you are a top hospital doctor who just starting climbing your smv is higher at the hospital surrounded by your subordinates than at the climbing gym surrounded by your friends who are all better climbers than you moreover of all women at the hospital your smv is highest in the eyes of the nurses under your command than other female doctors which explains my usual redpill tip find the context that maximizes your smv ,31,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,women mind and heart are ruled by af bb saying to a beta boyfriend or a prospective beta boyfriend that with alpha chad it was just sex but with beta bob it is real love is just a sentence invented by women to keep bob happy with his transactional sex situation a social convention to serve the feminine biological imperative as rollo would say beta bob ai not supposed to discover that the most intense passion a woman can feel for a man is the one that comes with her strong urge to fuck a sexually attractive alpha independently of his giving away time money or attention how women managed to turn the definition of that word love from the uncontrollable and unconditional sexual passion of a woman for her alpha or of a man for any hot woman to the contentment arising from fulfilling her need for long term commitment of a beta male resources obtained through the exchange of sexual favors or not is a testament to the incredible power of female manipulation working on a social scale ,10,TheRedPill

Auvergnat, except for the fact i brought up my number because you said that i had to read the sidebar i never made a claim about you reading the sidebar i merely said i do not need to read it furthermore your response was the typical rp garbage response of someone who spends to much time around here not even reading any further why are you posting and commenting on a sub you did not read the rules of refuse to read the most basic material and then being surprised that your opinion goes against that of everyone else why do not you go find a sub about flying where you will be able to post how you think flying ought to be done and tell off pilots who asked you if you have ever taken any course or read any book on the topic or yeah just stay here keep posting and wait to get banned again for either breaking a rule you do not know exist or share your non redpill opinion ,2,TheRedPill

Auvergnat, i hope you realize i am plus 1100 pretty much all from this sub and i am 9k and pointed 4 times and that dick size contest does not even fucking matter what matters is whether you understand trp theory or not so i will reiterate in the form of question have you yes or no read the sidebar and the two first years of best of rational male what other rp books have you read what other rp blogs do you follow if you have read it all and you disagree with a advice as basic as going radio silence to cure oneitis then you would better argue it really well banned me for 2 days for saying trump trade policy is awful and free trade is good yeah rule 0 mods are here to keep you in line with the direction of the sub so that the sub does not end up rubbish you disagree with that too bad for you my gf and i broke up and are still good friends i had no issue transitioning her we work better as friends i am glad i did this but if your chimpanzee brain cannot handle a female friend you used to fuck then i agree to silence is the answer none of my conversations with her since has been on getting back together nor do i want too then you did not have oneitis and the common advice to cure oneitis does not apply to you similarly your advice does not work for op i have many female friends i used to fuck no oneitis no need for radio silence now please answer my question what rp material have you read ,2,TheRedPill
Auvergnat, i will say first you will get the typical trp advice of ignoring her forever i do not subscribe to this dumb advice these losers do not understand that she is your best friend and you feel like a loser without her however clearly withdrawing a little from the relationship would be beneficial you obviously barely know anything about the red pill i strongly urge you to stop posting until you have gone through the sidebar and the best of year one and two of the rational male minimum oneitis is cancer you must uproot that shit altogether or else it will regrow more powerful the losers who advocate for going radio silence with the object of your oneitis understand very well the feeling that she is your best friend and how important it is to keep that friendship and that withdrawing totally from her feels like shit they know it all because they have all been in that position before and 100 of the time when they did not take the step of going radio silence it just prolongs the oneitis making the suffering more and more intense then they discover the red pill or they had a friend who convinced them to go radio silence or they understood by themselves and though it hurt at the beggining they quickly started healing quickly started feeling better and eventually get over it again the cure to oneitis is radio silence she not your friend anymore delete her phone number delete her off facebook do not hang out with her anymore it tough to do but it works withdrawing a little does not work because oneitis survives when you stay in touch only way it would work is if you bang 10 other girls in the meantime except that your oneitis makes you unmotivated to bang other girls and also makes you look desperate in the eyes of every girl in your social circle which does not help at banging them guys kill themselves over oneitis it a serious disease just uproot that shit ,6,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,this is the issue with learning game it needs a lot of self awareness to remember and pull it off and if you cannot pull it off looking naturally it will come off as really bad so you basically need to learn it all then forget it all and let it transpire through your interaction or more realistically learn it practice it and stumble because you do not look genuine again and again until it internalized and then it will come off naturally learn some go out practice one thing at a time keep learning let is slowly seeps into your unconscious anyway to your examples there are two sticky points 1 you are being too cocky negging and teasing too hard for day game in your examples it might work great in a club with a girl who here to get some attention an been drinking a bit already but in the day the girl is not in the street to get seduced so your seduction energy might be too high for her you need to tone it down a bit your two teases nerd lazy would offend 100 of girls in the day unless they find you real hot 2 you do not want to use questions too much ask her as little questions as possible because 1 it comes off as an interview vibe aka a forced interaction 2 it unoriginal that what everyone does show lack of things to say 3 it feels as if you are requesting a lot of work from her like answering a test and 4 it make you lose a golden opportunity and that for her to ask the questions first a girl asking you questions is the best indicator of her interest there is so if you can wait till she asks you personal questions then you are gold so what to do instead of questions ramble with baits about you me i found you attractive and wanted to say hi i am x her i am y thanks me you look a bit like actress z pull i am a big fan of the last couple movies she was in bait you are into movies though she used to come off as awkward to me before light push as you associated her to said actress you know it strange how your perception of people can change dramatically after something happens like there this girl in my dance class bait who bla bla bla the point of rambling is to sprinkle baits for her to bite on so she invests herself in the conversation her oh you are dancing what style are you doing first personal question on her part i have been trying salsa recently and love it bla bla bla for more info read roosh day bang i am just parroting his work here but then it works great for me ,1,asktrp

Auvergnat,i made a post about alpha but instead of reading it you just copied these three links as a comment my very argument was the fact that alpha means a lot of things to different people yes rollo definition should be the standard on this sub and i advocate personally for it but you must recognize at some point that the term has been up for debate since forever and you wo not change that by trying to impose a definition today like many before you even rollo in these posts admit it the term existed before him it was debated before him he would catch some heat for telling his version and the term continues being debated after him i too wish we could agree on a definition for it and use the right one how many times have i thought of posting exactly those links in an exact same post to force the proper definition on people but eventually you gotta realize that people will continue believing whatever they want alpha to be i posted thinking that if i cannot remind people the proper definition i could at least try to say which definition is not useful but even this did not get traction what i got instead is answers of people like you so dead set in their definition being the correct one that they could not even agree with me on what was a bad definition i now believe best you can do is dispel the misunderstandings without this term altogether for example you will not get laid if you do not learn to approach and seduce women rather than ignoring game is not alpha ,7,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,i do not know much about tesla but read he ignored women not because he was asexual but because he was too shy to talk to them because he was putting them on a huge pedestal so i imagined he was some sort of super genius mildly autistic mgtow type but if i am wrong and it is true that he was attracting girls and not for his money then he would have some alpha traits indeed i guess fame at least what you experience is the classic fallacy of trp newbies who believe alpha good and beta bad and then proceed to attache to the word alpha all the positive masculine traits you can think of for example being a good father being virtuous being courageous etc but the original way we use alpha and beta is simply in describing women dual sexual strategy as in alpha what women are sexually attracted to since nobody will deny that being attractive to the opposite sex is a good thing newbies came to think that alpha good and proceeded to redefine alpha as anything they find good but what if i tell you that being a badass ex convict is attractive to women dark triad traits are not good but typically attractive these are unfortunately i guess alpha traits that why rollo in his seminal post which i linked earlier used a complete idiot to receive the title of alpha buddha he not a good man but he an attractive one the whole point of the alpha beta dichotomy was to explain women dual sexual strategy as in why girls are attracted to the jerk but end up marrying the nice guy af bb if we do not stick with our definitions we will soon have armies of trpers who think of themselves as nice and therefore good and therefore alpha while that jerk over there is an asshole therefore bad therefore beta they will have it completely wrong back to square one in their blue pill delusion ,3,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,his paragraph says how people arrived to the red pill as a way to explain why critical thinking is important in order to bolster his former weird point that trp is critical thinking my paragraph and my whole point is to say what is the red pill and that not critical thinking but a body of knowledge on intersexual dynamics i perfectly read what he wrote and if you cannot tell from our chat the point i am trying to convey i do not see how i can explain it to you better in any case i will now stop writing about it because we are just bickering on trivial issues at this point,2,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,look i understand arguing on internet is painful and when your opinion is attacked one feels the need to double down on one opinion is critical thinking important yes does trp deal in absolutes and that often too much yes do people here get emotional and you need to filter it out yes do you need to figure the good from the bad yes yes yes of course but then why do not you go to a criticalthinking subreddit instead the red pill is here to teach men brainwashed by years of blue pill indoctrination about how women really function and how to take advantage of it is all advice 100 accurate of course not do you still need to figure out what is the best advice or what advice works best for you yes obviously but making the focus of this sub about critical thinking is just besides the point when the definition of the sub is discussion of sexual strategy and the sidebar a collection of posts about sexual strategy feel free to critically think about it all but do not go deny that the nature of trp is anything but a body of knowledge on a specific topic ,2,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,this is a perfect illustration of op post at the time of my answer this is the top comment and upvoted 4 times yet it not proper red pill advice the red pill is not be a critical thinker of course that good advice in general but that has little to do with the red pill which is but a body of knowledge on the reality of human intersexual dynamics it like being on a forum about quantum physics with a sidebar explaining the basics of quantum physics and someone comes and say being a critical thinker is quantum physics it not what op said in essence is that if you wish to learn about quantum physics make sure you read the basics of it as explained in the sidebar before you go discuss it in posts and comments with other people some of whom are deepak chopra followers critical thinking may help you figure which posts are bullshit but knowledge of proper quantum physics theory will help you much much more ,16,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,i am likely over simplifying yes but you can say that about most of trp hypergamy awalt af bb etc and the ideas still stand you can pull girls even though you are not 100 fit but we will advise you to get fit you can pull girls even though your game is not stellar but we will advise you to improve your game and you can pull girls even though you are not the 1 in the room but we will advise you to become that guy or put yourself in situations where you are you can absofuckinglutely demonstrate value without being best guy in the room at x because that guy might be an awkward goober he might be a pretentious twat maybe he gay and everyone knows it but you yep and all female eyes in the room will still be directed at him because women look for value in the form of genetics looks but particularly social competence game status you are upset with me being categorical and i give you that i am over doing it but you cannot deny the message i am trying to pass show how well you can handle adversity that what women want to know they want to see you handle your shit and you know why they want to see that because when you handle your shit you demonstrate your social value and what better way to handle your shit than being in a situation where you are the best sure enough a woman would appreciate that the day you have a flat tire you can fix it yourself but what if you are in a car with several friends and you are the only one who can fix the tire yep tingles aplenty i do not want new guys to think that there some bullshit formulaic approach to game do not be afraid to try a new experience with your girl just because there a good chance you wo not be the best at whatever it is you do man or woman nobody can respect a pussy who is too scared to take a chance and leave their comfort zone fair enough i understand what you want to say i did not mean to tell people do not get out of your comfort zone after all if your comfort zone is dancing you would have needed years of practice aka being out of your comfort zone to get good at anything you must often start by being shit at it and keep going what i am just saying is that if you want to be efficient high lay per approach ratio then you are better off playing on your strengths if you are the best surfer in the area but never climbed in your life good on you for trying your hand at climbing and good on you for bringing your date at the climbing gym because you thought it would be fun but do not be surprised if she starts eyeing the hot top climber in the gym and he gets her number while you struggle climbing some beginner route and despite all your frame and be sure you would not have had that problem if you had taken her surfing instead ,2,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,so many people who do not get it here promise it my last answer you are wrong the entire idea of trp is that women are attracted to high value men you cannot be high value if you are in a social context in which you suck if you want to pull you must be proficient at whatever activity is the focus of you social context if you want to push your comfort zone and learn new things by all means do it but be aware you wo not pull until you are one of the best at said activity if you want to pull you are better off withdrawing from activities you are not good at ,5,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,you have to see a relationship like a never ending negotiation between two parties each trying to get more out of the deal than giving a woman chips are by order of importance sex making and caring for your children emotional support care for the home and others a man chips are by order of importance status by association financial support emotional support attention and others in that context you are trading your time resources for sex so it not much different than prostitution the difference being it not a one time contract but a life time one and women are really good at renegotiating all the time for more benefit for themselves if you can see through be good at renegotiating as well manipulation always being ready to walk away and overall always have more leverage in the negotiation then you can get a lot of sex for really little time attention and other resources ,1,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,it just choreplay at a societal level the main engine of betaization in a couple is the wife manipulating her husband that if only he would help her more around the house spend more time with her rather than his friends listen to her more he would qualify for smiles spousal support sex overall peace at home it like a computer virus exploiting our dual weaknesses that are our desires for these things and our hardwired white knighting default psychological module at a societal level it women upvoting a post on reddit praising the men who help smash the patriarchy in order to enjoin others to do the same and you know what i would not mind such deal if it was not 1 a ploy destined to get more without having to actually give aka a fraud and 2 doomed to fail the relationship because it erodes the woman respect for the man and therefore her attraction to him ,61,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,do not exaggerate point of game is not to game them all and there are many cuties among them my question stands,2,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,it was more the follow up that created the schism i think he went on tv mostly to prove to himself he could maintain his frame in the face of haters just like you would swat shit tests but he got destroyed by more experienced than him at this game and who in any case can edit the video to control the narrative this subreddit called him out for appearing as a tool http archive is qntac roosh tried to re assert his frame as a redpill forefather like you would scold a child for misbehaviour this subreddit did not like it one bit http archive is tfc7g people here started to think it was weird for him to have made such a stupid thing as going on tv and then slamming the red pill so many started thinking it was just a ploy to separate himself from the redpill which he could not control and therefore not benefit from and focus his followers on his forums and blogs from which he can profit by advertising for his books rollo was the first to think this way and the schism between roosh rok and theredpill rollo was complete since then everything roosh does is seen by rollo and this subreddit as nothing but an advertisement move for profit including the rok failed meeting of last year https therationalmale com 2016 02 08 outrage brokers i am personally not convinced that roosh masterminded all of this he does financially benefit from all this advertisement but he does not appear machiavellian enough to me to be able to put himself willingly in such horrid positions being hated by everyone including both sjws and the redpill being blacklisted by some countries organisations getting himself and his family doxxed risking false rape accusations just to make some money and even if he does manufacture outrage for profit i think he fucking deserves it for unplugging so many men and making their life better he lost anonymity so he wo not ever get a break from anyone ever again and a man gotta earn his living in any case the sad end result is that many new redpillers are not aware of the good material that available from roosh and the rok authors his neomasculinity manifesto would work great as a general red pill manifesto http www rooshv com what is neomasculinity ,3,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,yeah and that the very point of federal and state elections of representatives the people decides at these occasions the direction of the country the opposition to democratically elected representatives is nothing else but people angry that their opinion does not prevail in the population in other words entitlement and a lack of democratic values,1,PurplePillDebate

Auvergnat,of perhaps not many but that besides the point the point here was how do i get a high quality man and the answer is first and foremost be young and pretty because that what all men are attracted to and high quality men have options so they go for whom attract them most if the point was alright i got a high quality man how do i keep him then yes be kind and supportive and meek and feminine and do not nag would be the answer though there are two other answers 1 bring other girls into his bed strangely not a common choice yet the best way to instantly make you an absolute keeper 2 chain him to the relationship by marrying him and getting him kids and also lower his value by making him fat and lose his social circle and make sure his time is 100 shared between his work you and the kids so that he does not have an opportunity to meet anyone else a very very common choice indeed yet the absolute worst to make both of your lives hell ,4,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,you are starting to get it but you ai not entirely there yet the traits that attract men are physical first youth and beauty the other traditionally feminine characteristics are attractive also submissive good cook nurturing innocence prude etc but are much much less important men attraction switches are 99 physical that why hot women can be complete bitches and still get the most attention ergo being a tomboy does not help but if you are a hot tomboy guys wo not mind so much if you want to improve your smv as a woman you should put 99 of your self improvement efforts into appearance be thin hair clothing and even if you do not get there guys are so thirsty anyway that just putting yourself out there should get you some attention though not necessarily from the kind of men you are actually after ,54,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,http theredpillroom blogspot fr 2012 05 female social matrix introduction html excerpt a better conceptualization of all female group dynamics is the crab basket model bischof k hler 1990 1992 in a basket full of crabs one does not have to put a lid on the basket to prevent crabs from crawling out because every time one crab tries to crawl higher another will hold her back by crawling over her while men will decide on a leader and then advance their respect and grant him authority in good faith until he proves his incompetence once women decide on a leader they immediately begin looking for ways to cast her down undermine her authority or mitigate her power without looking like that what they are doing female competition is subtle and indirect a matter of turning group consensus away from the established leaders desire toward your own and if you are thinking that a lousy way to run a company or a non profit or any organization that wants to actually get something done well i cannot argue with that further in the article when a strange group of women meet they undergo the same sort of social hierarchies that men do eventually but instead of demonstrations of alphatude to establish a pecking order women take longer to evaluate and portion out their respect and loyalty to other women because first they must establish the context in which they are all related before they can decide who leads the local matrix that means a lot of informal communication and careful observation of established social cues before the initial soft alliances grouping into cliques begins in other words before women can even establish a matrix consensus they must carefully evaluate the other women in social context first and then begin making personal assessments that can lead to a decision whether or not to socially ally with them when the women are strangers and there is no pre established common point of discussion upon which to base an evaluation women will defer to the culturally and socially mandated rituals which are acknowledged as socially productive segues into a fuller exchange of information in other words women have to talk about their shoes before they can figure out who going to lead the matrix ,26,TheRedPill

Auvergnat, who said i am willing to do so it profoundly pisses me off that shit test is about to become anything from teasing to power plays whether it pisses me off or not it does not matter the usage of the term even imprecise gives it its meaning opposing this is bound to cause miscommunication glad to hear i feel the same willing to always get back to original definitions later redefinitions muddle concepts personally situations in which someone consciously puts another to reevaluate its value based on its specific behavior this comes from pua and i think anything more comprehensive than this causes confusion but i will cause confusion if i define it this way rollo states that girl night out is a shit test so i guess the most canonical you get in rp is situations in which someone consciously or unconsciously puts another and in which its behavior will allow a reevaluation of its value but as i said people abuse shit test a whole fucking lot you can label it however you want these days to me what op got was a power play not a shit test ok i got my understanding more from trp redefinitions than the original do you have a source for that original definition because i am not quite sure i am getting what to reevaluate its value based on its specific behavior means comfort test has a far more consensual definition that would be requesting someone to reassure the value you hold cheers i understand that better something that pisses me off is the assumption all interaction between men and women happens through shit testing or comfort testing this is a matter of definition and if one is given i ought to accept it but until they do i simply avoid relying on the concepts wise enough now i get you were sarcastic when you said i guess at this point the meaning of shit test might have as well grown to embrace this situation as well though the question remains then even if we forget the concepts a second given the little information we know why was she challenging his boundaries do you think that in that situation she did so because she had some power to grab out of his possible answers or do you think that she was feeling insecure about the safety of her relationship and was just trying to assuage her anxiety ,1,asktrp
Auvergnat,by coincidence i just happen to be discussing this subject on an asktrp thread asktrp comments 5p3xru girlfriend kept causing drama i set a boundary i am trying to figure out if the story related by op was a comfort test what do people think here an excerpt of on of my comments there how do you define shit test and comfort test in the first place i see them both as challenging that what test stands for a man boundaries mindset opinion frame whatever the difference being in their origin and purpose the shit test originates from a position of assumed strength and has the purpose of imposing her frame on him eg i know you do not like me going clubbing but i will go anyway and i will manipulate you into accepting it watcha gonna do about it while a comfort test originates from a position of insecurity weakness and has the purpose of requesting changing his frame to assuage her anxiety eg i know you do not like me crying for no reason but i really need to talk about my feelings right now please i see shit tests characterized by defiance and comfort tests by fear given that women desire dropping their frame to submit to the stronger frame of a strong man if a man reacts to a test by re establishing his frame trp theory predicts she will gladly accept this re establishment and feel more attracted to him after all when trp teaches men to pass shit tests the expected reaction is not tears tantrum drama but compliance and attraction what i am coming at is that here op clearly responded by re establishing and enforcing his frame if she had been shit testing him this would have constituted passing and she would have shut up and gotten horny instead she kept on pushing and pushing and then crying and throwing a tantrum and later cried rivers supplicating him not to leave her to me that fits all my definition of comfort testing edit bonus link to a relevant post and a comment of mine to further explain my views on the topic http archive is ktdny,16,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,so you are unwilling to alter the definition of a comfort test but you are willing to change that of shit test it a bit intellectually dishonest do not you think how do you define shit test and comfort test in the first place i see them both as challenging that what test stands for a man boundaries mindset opinion frame whatever the difference being in their origin and purpose the shit test originates from a position of assumed strength and has the purpose of imposing her frame on him eg i know you do not like me going clubbing but i will go anyway and i will manipulate you into accepting it watcha gonna do about it while a comfort test originates from a position of insecurity weakness and has the purpose of requesting changing his frame to assuage her anxiety eg i know you do not like me crying for no reason but i really need to talk about my feelings right now please i see shit tests characterized by defiance and comfort tests by fear given that women desire dropping their frame to submit to the stronger frame of a strong man if a man reacts to a test by re establishing his frame trp theory predicts she will gladly accept this re establishment and feel more attracted to him after all when trp teaches men to pass shit tests the expected reaction is not tears tantrum drama but compliance and attraction what i am coming at is that here op clearly responded by re establishing and enforcing his frame if she had been shit testing him this would have constituted passing and she would have shut up and gotten horny instead she kept on pushing and pushing and then crying and throwing a tantrum and later cried rivers supplicating him not to leave her to me that fits all my definition of comfort testing ,2,asktrp
Auvergnat, based on the level and amount responses this does not appear to be a comfort test failed comfort tests rarely end into exuberant chasing do they i thought a failed comfort test was by definition resulting in tears and tantrum you do not love me waaaa but i admit i might need to freshen my knowledge of comfort tests have not been much on trp about those in a while ,2,asktrp
Auvergnat, maybe maybe not we do not know if that happened before though and that she should know not to bother true we would need more info to classify that move but whether shit test or comfort test women never learn or know not to bother whatever they feel at the moment is what they do if op is staying uber mysterious on his past relationships you can be sure that she will feel something is off about it and that she will need to talk about it what we definitely know though that this drama is way inappropriate and unnecessary the way it happened makes me suspicious that she either is a drama queen or that she wanted to create some drama however all these things do no not matter she needs to learn options and thus is the way he should teach her women create drama as surely as dogs bark some do a lot some do a little but they all do they feed on feelz op could get her through a rigorous training to try to get her to stop creating drama but if she so used to generate such huge amount of feelz how would she take being forced to reduce it perhaps op is better off assessing how much barking he willing to tolerate ,2,asktrp
Auvergnat,ok what do you think that was then an attempt at pushing your pre established boundaries to gain more power ie shit test or a cry of anxiety due to a fear of you leaving her ie comfort test ,3,asktrp
Auvergnat,disagree to me that was a comfort test he could have disarmed the entire drama by giving her a big hug smile at her and tell her do not worry babe i am with you now instead enforcing his stance by withdrawing just worsened her anxiety if i am right his smv has taken no hit but she now less trusting of him as a partner and could end up leaving for a man with more dependable beta qualities ,15,asktrp
Auvergnat,well that info changes it all could be that time of the month where hormones are playing with her mood catch up again in a few days if she still behaving weird then yes there another guy in the picture ex or not does not matter ,2,asktrp
Auvergnat, where did i say men looks cannot be improved are you kidding that is the entire thesis of your post that women supposedly are looking for genetic unchangeable traits your entire post is just a ridiculously transparent bait and switch argument you baiting women are attracted mostly to physical traits in men all of them are unchangeable us of course not see lifting see game you switching no game or lift will improve the chances of a super uber ugly man the fact that you cannot see the flaw in your argumentation reveals it an emotional matter for you so i am going to guess you find yourself physically ugly whether you are or not and you think you have no chances with women so you hamster a fit between trp theory and your personal limiting beliefs so that your situation makes sense to you and makes you feel better very ugly men do not have it easy sure but we wo not encourage you to give up and in all cases we wo not encourage you to mis inform on trp theory just so that it fits your world view you cannot come on trp listing the physical traits that attract women while deliberately missing out on the non physical traits you cannot come on trp saying that we have little control over those physical traits when we specifically call for losing the fat getting ripped getting a good haircut and getting your fashion style on point now what to do if you are that ugly do whatever you can that what men do in the face of insurmountable odds we just keep on going that rock you are pushing up the hill keeps on rolling back down well fuck it i will just keep on pushing it up that is what men do https en wikipedia org wiki sisyphus what to do if you are that ugly stop whining get off the internet fix your diet to lose the fat lift to build muscle go to the dentist to fix your teeth and a skin specialist to fix your skin get contact lenses or glasses with trendy frames get a haircut save for a surgery to fix your ears and if you are still ugly when all that is done at least you maximized your looks and you will get better than what you get by doing nothing and whining and if you were smart while you were doing all you could to maximize your looks you would have also been compensating some more by getting super trendy clothes a job that pays so much you can get yourself a sports car and practice your social skills by taking on theater and organizing parties become that super social super happy super dominant man that is such a pure concentrate of positive mindset that you would get laid even if you were born with no limbs https www youtube com watch v s3qezbvn1be cause that what chicks are attracted to the man at the top not genetic unchangeable traits https www youtube com watch v nknzswdcuga ,9,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,that funny since trp advocates to lift if you are thinking only looks count to attract women you are an idiot if you are thinking men looks cannot be improved you are a bloody idiot you are just wining like a little bitch trying to blame your current difficulties with women on things you cannot change so that you do not have to make efforts to ameliorate your situation you get to feel good about yourself yay be a man for fuck sake stop complaining and do something,18,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,haha classic branch swinging situation she told you she single but she actually is not more likely they are on a break or she needs some space at the moment to think about it aka she still officially with him in this context sleeping with you would mean cheating on him and there no going back with him after that without lying to his face more importantly since she firmly believes she not that kind of girl cheating on her bf would reflect poorly on her self esteem that why she shows massive resistance so first off you have to decide whether you are happy with fucking a girl who has a boyfriend ok one she trying to break up with but still and if you are happy with it you have to decide whether you can take the consequence of doing it when the guy is going to know it he going to blame you if your social circle and this guy do not overlap you will be good if they do measure the risk on your reputation hint it not entirely bad you also get some good rep as a lady man you have decided to go and fuck her anyway good you have to act fast because you are reaching a point of diminishing returns after 5 dates without fucking you are going to have to give her massive amounts of plausible deniability massive amounts of discretion and get her soooo horny so that you disconnect her rational brain that obsessing about what she about to do i am not that kind of girl and get her acting on a purely emotional level we did not want it but it just happened use massive push pull swings where you get her horny escalate and then pull back we should not and then get back on her but you are sooooo desirable etc etc ,5,asktrp

Auvergnat,you are missing his point his argument is this 1 girls love the bold and confident man and despite the hesitant and unsure man 2 your body language is more important than anything you say 3 fear of rejection makes you hesitant and unsure this shows in your body language despite anything you can say 4 if you get to the point where you have the mindset that rejection is nothing to be afraid of your body language will stop displaying uncertainty and lack of confidence 5 therefore you should condition your mind to react to rejection with positive feelings for example that it funny or trying to collect as many rejections as possible to win once the fear of rejection is no more your body language will only be positive ,2,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,it true that going beta does not make her want to leave you it only makes her lose attraction but if op girlfriend had not been reacting as op wanted her to lose attraction from there branch swing he would have simply reverted to plan a and dumped her ,2,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,easy tiger did you actually read what i wrote or you just assumed i was opposing your viewpoint i did not misread your post i was not disagreeing with you at all treating women like children is an old redpill trope that i already accept and that you put in your own words beautifully i was just pointing out that your reaction to major transgressions can still be seen as following the same pattern that you had established with minor ones aka treating her like a child you do not smile and hug a kid that has ruined your car major transgressions call for major punishments that being said i had not caught the negan reference do not watch that show and if by this you really mean that your reaction to a girl betraying you or cheating on you is to physically attack her then i will disagree for any transgression i now follow hsp guide to manage your bitches http archive is iyxcr if she wrongs you bad keep your cool and just next her that will avoid you going to jail for assault ,2,TheRedPill
Auvergnat, all of the above only applies to her childish and minor emotional behaviour if she has done something major you need to punish that shit like negan if she has betrayed you or cheated then you need to next her for minor emotional stuff you are much better off treating her like a naughty kid than you are berating her or trying to get her to see reason but your response to major transgressions actually follow the same pattern of treating her as a child when a child has some minor emotional behaviour you respond with amused mastery smile and cuddle when a child does some major transgression you should respond with punishing him her overtly because if you do not the child will see that boundary is a soft one and will start pushing on it just cause they can to see how far that boundary can be pushed when a woman does a major transgression you want to punish that swiftly by removing your resources from her time attention money in a way that teaches her the lesson well because if you let that slip she will transgress further nexting a woman when she has cheated on you is simply a strong punition removing your resources from her entirely because anything less than that she will take as a soft boundary that must be pushed further ,16,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,no that not a good summary of the red pill truth first it depends what you want do you want to be the man women want to fuck or do you want to be the man women want a relationship with you can be both sort of it ai not really true but it difficult to understand how the subtleties of women mind make it impossible to maintain both on the long term see betaization to be the man a woman wants to fuck you need to be the highest value man in the room which means have a value high enough that you are higher than every other man she can get right now and being high value means a combination of 1 good looks 2 good social skills and 3 high social status all of which can be attained through self improvement lift for getting good looks game for getting good social skills and learn to lead make and spend money ace your mission for getting social status to be the man a woman wants a relationship with you need to be willing to share your resources with her time attention money be dependable and be emotionally supportive that nothing that needs self improvement and too much of it leads to losing the high value that gets you laid ,4,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,just being practical the glass is already broken,4,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,that last paragraph sums it all it missing the emphasis from the blog post though so you re a great father to your kids and a devoted husband who built himself into the guy that any woman should be attracted to who should be a great catch that s great but that s what you re supposed to do and all those things you re supposed to do those aren t what engender a woman s genuine desire in a feminine primary social order the same order that deliberately misdefines masculinity for men all men need to do endlessly is just a bit more to do everything right in other words women are manipulating men into giving women what women want ie always more of their time money attention support and other resources by setting up social conventions that hide this fact and exploit men natural inclination for relational equity you could almost say women are resources parasites ,3,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,but if you grow improve and focus on your goals so much that you stop being social and do not go where ladies can be attracted to you all that work you put in wo not get you laid see trp is not originally about self improvement it about the truth about what women want a part of this truth is that women are sexually attracted to men who are high value therefore to get women you should self improve to attain high value this part got picked up by a crowd of people eager to focus on self improvement only and decided that self improvement is all the red pill is about even removing the fact that you would do that to get women in the first place except that it not despite what they want trp still is about the truth about what women want and a significant other part of this red pill truth is that women are sexually attracted to men who display high social value therefore to get women you must learn social mastery aka game but the self improvement crowd does not want to have to do that so they just discard it ,9,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,i get where you come from it took me 6 months after my discovery acceptance of the red pill and my starting lifting i did not see the point given that i was already doing many sports creative hobbies and had my career on point had no interest in becoming a gym rat and justified that lack of interest by saying i did not have the time you always have time it all depends on your priorities but as my understanding of redpill concepts grew i started getting the theory on why everybody was so insistent on it see my other answer in the post it about the mindset mainly and then the looks so i reluctantly got into it experienced what everybody was saying and never stopped because nothing i have ever done or achieved in my life had as much positive impact on my masculine mindset than weightlifting because of the materialist stigma of weightlifting in our blue pill world lifting still appears as an oddity in my non materialistic lifestyle intellectual culture and outdoor interests and it baffles my family and friends who know of my lifting but it definitely what turned around my mindset to the best do it and you too will realise why it the most common suggestion ,2,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,it very true but beware of starting saying that she means the opposite of what she said in the typically rational man mind what she says is a statement about the future that exactly reveals what she has on her mind and will either come true or not so when a girl says we are not having sex tonight we stupidly take it rationally she said that therefore it means she does not want to have sex with me tonight therefore it wo not happen but if you think she said that but given she a girl it means she does want to have sex with me tonight therefore it will happen or if you think she said that she may be lying or not how can i know then you are just as clueless in the typically emotional woman mind it very different the fact that she says we are not having sex tonight reveals that having sex with you tonight is on her mind it just confirms that she attracted to you in case you were too dumb to realize that after making out with her and a girl who is attracted to a man very much desires to sleep with him but a big alarm sets off in her mind at that thought if i sleep with him tonight he will consider me to be an easy girl and will lose interest later on worse my girl friends will judge me as a slut and i will lose my social standing that is a huge problem for women this is that anxiety that she voices with we are not having sex tonight so it not that we are not going back to my place means the opposite it that it means i strongly desire you come back to my place but i am afraid that doing so will come to a social cost to me so she wants it and she does not want it at the same time your job in dealing with that anti slut defense is to 1 keep the attraction up so she keeps desiring having sex with you and 2 assuage her worries about the potential social cost associated to it and assuaging her worries involves confirming to her that sex is indeed not going to occur that is giving her plausible deniability as op did great minimizing the risks to her social standing that is keeping it discreet from her friends downplaying the negative connotations of casual rapid sex on her character that is it just happened if you do all of this correctly and logistics are right she will sleep with you tonight since she attracted to you and as a side note given that women nowadays are socially allowed and encouraged to retroactively retract consent you would do well to keep playing the same build attraction assuaging social worries game the morning after confirming to her that sex is indeed not going to occur i really did not want this to happen but you were sooo desirable things just happened minimizing the risks to her social standing leave discreetly if you stayed at hers do not tell people she knows that you slept with her downplaying the negative character connotations of casual rapid sex next morning it was fun let meet again soon text,25,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,i will bite pua gets a lot of unwarranted bad rep it pains me to see you a man with an obvious deep understanding of game principles participating in that witch hunt and unfortunately perpetuating it by convincing newbies who will then miss out on the opportunity to learn awesome game material but then i am not surprised you are part of what i call the insanity of game instruction it a really weird state of affairs that everyone new in the business of seduction 1 teaches theory on intersexual dynamics 2 gives some lines as illustrations 3 insists that the most important is body language inner game attitude delivery congruence so it necessary to practice a lot and it best to come up with your own material as soon as possible and 4 criticizes all other teachers that came before as being big failures because they only focused on memorized lines a game newbie will always use the lines provided he too new to come up with his own yet plus often those lines are just the best and fuck it up prodigiously because of his bad inner game and delivery it normal and it expected of him to improve over time to follow the acting analogy a wanna be actor will have a shitty delivery at the beginning of his career and therefore appears as a bad actor but you would not use your observation that teenagers in their first year at the high school acting club are bad actors as evidence that theater actors ultimately fail would not you yet that what you and everyone affected by the insanity of game instruction do pua ultimately fails because memorized lines but you just gave lines in your post of course you added a disclaimer on top of your post but that just what puas would do say too and you know what newbies on trp are going to do with your post they are going to use your lines and fail because of their shitty delivery despite your disclaimer and people studying game in 10 years from now will shit on your name having forgotten your disclaimer they will say that u popular culture guy and trpers were all about memorized lines that did not work now here my essay on shit tests the reality is that just like you pua offered so much more than memorized lines most of what trp teaches in terms of game frame inner game look your best etc is exactly what previous men now known as pua failures taught all the bad rep about pua focuses on criticizing the idea of memorized lines but if you would made the effort of reading old material that is now qualified as pua you would see them giving a lot of the same timeless concepts about intersexual social dynamics giving some lines as example and criticizing the idea of relying on memorized lines david de angelo one of the first would make fun of guys asking him for lines neill strauss the most well known would criticize newbies using the same canned lines over and over again he would warn against becoming social robots the problem with that circle of insanity is that anybody here who never read pua material because they got convinced that pua fails because it all about memorized lines before looking at it is missing out on all the awesome info that in it the essay on shit tests by u illimitableman and your illustrations in this post are great extensions of what mystery wrote about the existence and purpose of shit tests and example answers over 15 years ago do not believe me here an excerpt of the mystery method section on congruence tests it important to remember that often she is not deliberately testing you it not necessarily something that she is consciously aware of she just gets a feeling to behave a certain way and so she does based on how you react to this she then feels either more or less attracted as a result this is known as a congruence test if she views you as a contender then she will test you a woman often wo not even bother to test losers instead she will just become non responsive and then leave as soon as she can thus a test can be considered an indicator of interest of sorts congruence tests are a double edged sword if you respond the right way she will be noticeably more attracted to you after the test but if you fail then she will be noticeably less attracted how is that pua ultimately failing it red pill before the red pill to conclude i am not writing this to convince you you know your game well so you are not missing out on good material out there i am writing it for the newbies who are going to read your awesome game post read your unwarranted criticism of puas and conclude that trp is the real deal and pua is shit and thus miss out on the awesome

Auvergnat,assuming monk mode is a period of time where you focus on building your smv a de facto monk mode should include regularly going out and developing your social self since social mastery status is a core component of a high smv ergo a monk mode that is based on avoiding being social is just yet another buffer https therationalmale com 2011 08 26 buffers ,4,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,i wish we had not redefined spinning plates away from its original meaning rollo original meaning was approximately always be working on having several sexual options and not fuck multiple girls you are not committed to as it is now understood around here the second definition implies the first but is not equal the whole point of rollo spinning plates series of articles was to teach men that they maintain power in any relationship by having other options and that teaching is lost with the new definition for example we now consider spinning plates and ltr as two mutually exclusive lifestyles although working on building fallback options is exactly what you should be doing in a ltr you do this by maintaining your friends circle having activities outside your relationship flirting with other girls having a hidden online dating account etc you would not necessary fuck another girl but you know you easily could because you are constantly building new sexual prospects worse with the new definition you might end up thinking that you can spin one plate and sure you can very well be fucking one girl without being committed to her but if you ai not looking for other options at the same time then this completely goes against the original idea this is exactly the mindset op fell in he must have been thinking hell yeah i am still spinning plates i just have one at the moment if op had had the original meaning in head instead then he would have realized on the very moment he did not have any other alternative options anymore that he was not spinning plates anymore ,71,TheRedPill

Auvergnat, you do not understand what i am saying i am not saying to ghost a girl you have barely hung out with that is stupid that exactly what you told op to do i give you that one should not have written it without explaining and pointing out that the end result will depend on how much attraction he had generated by then that because you did not have enough attraction in the first place if you have generated enough attraction then you can get away with many things such as ghosting her or cheating on her yeah i am sure if i was brad pitt and my game was tight as a drum it would not have mattered but there only so much most of us here can realistically do even if we focus on self improvement as much as possible it not realistic to expect you are always going to be so attractive to most girls that you can ghost them whenever you want without consequence if that was the case it would just be a sign that you could be fucking hotter girls and not ghosting them i completely agree but that does not negate what i said generate enough attraction and you can get away with anything i think our main issue here is that we are talking about two different things you are thinking attractive as some universal value you have to all girls in which case my advice sounds like be hot and ignore girls which i understand you oppose i would too except i am thinking of how attractive you are to one specific woman after playing it her well if his options are either ghosting her or tell her he has a std that really not his only option though he could lie and make up a different excuse which is the best option in my opinion i would agree except that it shows he cares too much but hey you are probably right on that one probably has better chances than my suggestion i agree that it uncomfortable in that sense and i do agree that a guy who has the ability to cheat or even acts on it can definitely be considered more attractive for it but what i meant is it comfortable in the sense that you get to keep banging spending time with someone that you already have rapport with same reason guys go back to girls who cheat on them and people remain friends with those who wrong them if you mean that it not cheating that is comfortable but the idea of going back to a man they already know i can only agree of course and i would actually agree too on the fact that such comfort also pushes people to go back to those they know even if they wronged them but i do not think that the main reason as the comfort of being with the one we know is seriously tainted by the discomfort of being with one who can backstab you at any moment again i think we mostly end up wanting to go back to a cheater because by cheating the other party demonstrates they are higher value than you aka attractive look i agree that comfort is almost always overvalued by guys and they should focus way more on building attraction but i think in this case ghosting is just a bad move like i said and i think you said the chance of him having built enough attraction or even having the possibility to have done so and then to ghost and get away with it is unlikely you actually convince me now also if it all about attraction and he can sacrifice some comfort would not admitting he has the std be even better than ghosting because then it implies that he has the ability to fuck lots of girls it would imply this yes but of course that a ridiculous idea since the disgust would immediately repulse her so of course that is not something i or anyone in their right mind would suggest and it obviously does not follow logically from what i suggested nice fallacy anyway i think making up a completely different excuse is the easy play for him to make here i agree easier and probably most likely to work as long as he does not make excuse after excuse after excuse ,1,asktrp
Auvergnat, i did exactly this ghosted a girl for a month after hanging out with her a couple times and she barely agreed to hang out with me when i hit her up again it took way more effort to build the comfort back then it would have to just handle it differently that because you did not have enough attraction in the first place you now should understand why women eventually go back with a man who cheated on them attraction trumps it all 1 that totally different than ghosting a girl you have barely hung out with you do not understand what i am saying i am not saying to ghost a girl you have barely hung out with that is stupid what i am saying is this what is most important is building attraction if you have generated enough attraction then you can get away with many things such as ghosting her or cheating on her of course if you did not hang out enough with the girl to generate attraction ghosting her will do no good did op generate enough attraction i do not know but if his options are either ghosting her or tell her he has a std he better off with the first option either he generated enough attraction and the ghosting wo not affect the end result or he did not and she will move on the third option chatting to her endlessly does not generate attraction it like the man who does not physically escalate eventually the girl gets bored and boredom kills attraction 2 you have that completely backwards if it was all about attraction why would not they go for another guy who is more attractive that she could surely pull but not necessarily get any commitment from because going back to the guy who cheated on her is more comfortable you think girls go back to men who cheated on them because they are more comfortable let me open your eyes girls go back to them because their success with other girls is attractive cheating is the opposite of comfort it evidence for her that this man might ghost her when she needs him most eg pregnant i have had several female friends going back to a cheating boyfriend and the pattern is always the same rationally they do not want to go back to him because they are afraid of him cheating again or leaving but they cannot stop thinking and talking about him the point of my comment is indeed that attraction is everything a girl will forgive a cheater because she attracted to him a girl will stay with a man who hit her if he attractive a girl will leave her loving and wealthy husband for the pool boy if the husband is not attractive of course by attractive i do not mean simply physically attractive but everything we here call alpha in your example you mention a woman who could go for for another guy who is more attractive but how exactly do you imagine this guy to be more attractive because in women book a guy who knows me and yet decided to chuck away our relationship and is able to pick up other girls who i feel are more attractive than me is really really attractive comfort is important of course but you are over valuing it ,1,asktrp

Auvergnat,the real question is why did you bother coming telling us do you want to learn why it happened or what will happen in the future with her or did you post here because you thought hey i got this story where a woman does a fucked up thing better post it on redpill to get some karma ,0,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,i think that as men we cannot fathom the actual contempt that women feel towards men who are useless to them think about it when we see a man who is higher value than us we men might feel respect or jealousy where women feel love how much of a stretch would it be to realize that when we feel pity for a man who is lower value than us women just feel scorn ,20,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,did you buy them or what other scheme you did ,12,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,all relationships are transactional in men women relationships men want sex women want your resources mostly your time and attention but also money emotional support help etc a man who plays a good game is the one who pushes for sex to happen asap while being reluctant on providing his resources a woman who plays a good game is the one who pushes for you to give away your resources asap while being reluctant on providing sex here you have a woman who just does what woman does just keep going at it keep pushing for sex to happen asap while realizing it normal for her to try to delay it in order to hook you into providing your resources so yeah do invite her over and do not be unphased by her resistance to it happening soon ,3,asktrp
Auvergnat,answer to your questions this is how humans more or less consciously assert social dominance this is not due to insecurity they are bothered when you do the same thing for the same reason as you are bothered when they do it to you in the first place because they perceive it correctly as someone asserting dominance over them it all part of the social dance people deep down feel that they need to rise up to the top of the local hierarchy because pussy goes to the top only what you need to do fight back treat it just like you treat girls shit test agree amplify pressure flip silence commanding authority etc if you do not fight back you will end at the unconscious bottom of the hierarchy then you can expect women in the group to being repulsed at any of your attempts at seducing them worse that that they may get vindictive towards you women hate losers ,1,asktrp

Auvergnat,do you know how to fish op it not too complicated but there are several important bits to it first you need to find yourself in the good spots that have fish next you need to use the proper lure bait and hook set them at the proper depth and with the proper technique for the target fish then you keep at it patiently you keep casting again and again until one hooks next depending on the fish you are likely to have to do a combination of letting it taking out the line as it fights and pull and reel in when it not you have to alternate both with the proper technique until the fish is at the surface what you are telling us is akin to a beginner fisherman coming on a forum about fishing asking us i get that the advice is to let it take out the line but i have not got any fish yet you need to understand there is so much more than that particularly the let it take out the line reel in combination is the equivalent in pick up to dhv and neg not giving her attention is negging but do you display a high value to her it does not work if she does not see you as high value ,3,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,hey i see this comment is a copy of some content of the other so i will answer the other one which has extra content ,2,TheRedPill
Auvergnat, what is the best way to deal with women like this in general ignore them people judge people all the time you cannot prevent it act in the way you feel is best to your interest and if that too cocky for some too bad for them if that too cocky for many and that impacts your interest only then review your behavior bonus answer you can bang her that girl obviously picked up on you being higher smv do some flirting with her next time you see her,1,asktrp
Auvergnat,i often wonder if it not mental illness but simply typical teenager delusion accordingly i would say let her grow out of it on her own be the typically masculine caring big brother to her and let that dynamics slowly make her realize people are happier living in accordance to normal sex roles ,2,asktrp

Auvergnat, women who pursue sex like men pursue sex get called sluts and whores y all would get laid way more often if society just stopped doing that what an incredibly transparent bait hey guys i have been sleeping around a lot and getting a bad rep for it i am here to advise everyone to stop doing it and hey there a reward if you do i am already discussing with you on different comment thread but i will venture some redpill explanation since i am guessing this might be a pet peeve for you why do men shame sluts a red pill analysis it innate men are the sex that is not childbearing so we can never be sure if the child born to our partner is ours while women biggest evolutionary driven anxiety is to get raped by a non suitable mate ours is to raise a child that is not truly ours and the only useful evidence we have of our mate not being currently promiscuous with other men is proof of lack of past sexual promiscuity by the same token we men are naturally crazy jealous about possible physical cheating promiscuous women naturally pain us natural selection puts deeply in our guts that fear of promiscuous women because it spells bad omen on our genetic material on the other side we love promiscuous women because that more chances of passing on one genetic legacy scott free it a peculiar cognitive dissonance we have to love to fuck promiscuous women on one side but shame them on the other i guess it a bit similar to the cognitive dissonance that women must feel about being deathly afraid of rape but at the same time having a rape sorry ravishing wish since the ravishing man thus demonstrates he is a bold man who does get his genetic legacy propagated it funny to see all the female erotic literature playing with that dissonance 50 shades of grey being only the most recent and worst quality example have you read o in summary do not waste your breathe slut shaming is here to stay as long as half the population will have a y chromosome deal with it ,3,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,you come on our turf be ready to hear us roar i appreciate the fact that you are still here debating rather than rage quitting if you are interested in debating red pillers the purplepilldebate is the proper sub for it here you wo not find anyone to agree with you but as for our discussion i stand by everything i say we do generalize a lot and while i agree we often do too much those generalization remain a better model of reality than the everyone is a special snowflake and gender is a social construct theory that your feminist philosophers have managed to convince modern society of for your information i do not have a low opinion of women i have a low opinion of humans or rather a realistic opinion of humans see on trp we do not believe it all nurture not everything is a cultural construct i believe culture is the thin layer of paint that covers the building that is nature i believe the average woman naturally desires to bang the hot man the socially relevant man the famous man the takes no shit from noone man but that she needs the dependable supportive man to commit his resources to her i believe this psychological state of affair is due to the action of evolution by natural selection on the human sex that is childbearing i also believe that due to women being the physically weaker sex women are innate liars and manipulators to enact this dual sexual strategy is that a low opinion of women perhaps but then i also believe that the average man desires to bang multiple women and that he is reluctant to commit to any single woman although he will if his sexual options are limited i believe his greatest fear is to raise a child that is not his for he would be wasting his precious resources while losing his genetic legacy i believe this psychological state of affair is due to the action of evolution by natural selection on the human sex that is not childbearing i also believe that due to men being the physically stronger sex men are innately violent and sexually objectifying to enact their preferred sexual strategy is that a low opinion of men perhaps too although note that it not too far off what feminism tells you about men except that for feminists this low view of men is not by nature but due to culture and therefore it can be stomped out of men if we psychologically hit them hard enough you have not been socialized to like jerks it in your nature look at what girls go for in pre modern or non western cultures it what women do men have not been socialized to sexually objectify girls it in our nature again that why all men in pre modern or non western cultures do you cannot stop these things from happening because these are not social constructs these are deep within who we are we have been building men who respect girls for a few decades now and look they still want the jerks it not the 1950 anymore a large majority of men respect girls as their equal and yet women still bang the assholes why because the asshole is sexy a look at him sets fires deep in your loins without you being able to explain it culture did not build that response nature did by jerk a woman calls a man who do not take her shit there are guys around who do not take my shit when i try to get them to do what i want them to do i hate them because they do not do what i want them to do women hate jerks just the same except that they are also sexually attracted to them women who hate jerks and like nice guys are women whose looks have started to fade and do not attract the hot studs anymore so they finally start stressing out about finding a mate their more limited pool of options means they are starting settling in terms of acceptable mate looks which nicely fits with their new valuing something else that pure looks ie dependability and emotional support these types of women are more likely to be feminist simply because they cannot use their looks to get brownie points from men anymore so they have to complain to attempt getting some power back the young hot girl gets all guys at her feet so why would she complain about men having all the power feminist bullshit i am a nice guy i know it difficult to believe since i am just evil words on a screen for you but you do not see how i am nice to my parents and family and my male friends and my female friends i am nice to the girls i sleep with and i am nice to the girls i used to sleep with the fact that i have a cynical view of human nature and culture does not mean i am not nice just like op story made him appear not nice when he actually made everyone around him his friends the girl have a great jolly nice time i made assumptions about your life and passionately opposed your arguments but i have not been a jerk to you however i am not bending to your opinion so that makes me a not nice person i guess i did not give up i am not exploiting anyone i am just going on through the same life as i had before except i do not let anyone exploit me anymore and particularly not letting women exploiting my time and resources for their benefit despite their manipulation attempts i give them in measure to what i am being given in support and sex that is all are men standing their ground to get a fair deal the new hitler about your relationship i cannot tell if you are telling the truth or not but if you are then i am happy you found yourself a great mate i seriously doubt you can maintain such relationship for long but for your happiness i would be glad to be proven wrong if it turns out i am right do not hesitate to come back to us chimpanzees for answers we will give you a maximum of answers and hopefully a minimum of i told you so ,6,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,too bad your post got deleted i can see it was coming from a good heart with a willingness to help unfortunately your advice is complete bullshit but since you were nice in your post i will be nice back by explaining to you who we are that advice you gave us is exactly what we followed all our lives our sisters mothers and fathers friends teachers and tv people gave us the same advice be yourselves be genuine be kind and respectful being good boys we did follow the advice but somehow we would get no success with girls we would have to witness girls like you getting laid all the time but with the jerks with the bad boys girls like you would come cry on the shoulder of guys like us complaining how chad let you down again and how great listeners we were why do i always fall for guys like that and where can i find a nice and kind man just like you and then when we would gather enough courage between two acts of friendly kindness to ask you out you would say no we have such a beautiful friendship let keep it that way plus i am really not looking for a relationship right now and then when the week after we would see you dating someone else you would tell us i know i said that but i just met this awesome man and do not worry there will soon be a girl who will be lucky to have you later you would come back to cry on our friendly shoulder because the awesome man was actually a jerk all along you want to convince us that you go for your friends who are sweet and caring that your own words right we heard them a billion times before and they got us nowhere you might tell me that was just one mean girl you cannot generalize your bad friendship experience but that was not just one that was several girls it was a girl when i was 15 and another one when i was 18 and another one when i was 21 and when i was 24 and while girls like you were fucking other men than me i was there following your advice getting nowhere in life wondering why you might tell me well if it happened with several girls that got to be a problem about you then not them and i would think for a second that you could be right except that then i discover on the internet that so many men experienced the exact same thing it ai not a coincidence it a pattern and a global one at that guys from the us canada germany greece australia same stories wait it actually cross cultural it happens in african and asian and south american countries too what the fuck is this so us men get talking we share experience we make experiments and observations we gather data and some of us further along the way come back to the others and say we discovered the truth girls are attracted to the man who is socially and personally dominant the man who does not take women shit it does not make sense to us why but at least we finally understand why you have been attracted to the jerks all along you tell us that not how it works but it explains perfectly everything we ever witnessed it all finally makes sense you tell us you are great as you are you just have to find the right one for you but how come we never found the one in years of being kind and genuine while you have been finding plenty of them in the meantime so we decide to go and try being a jerk you tell us it does not work but somehow we get a girl several many actually we find it does work we personally experience that this is how it works you tell us it only works on some types of girls with a low self esteem but we find it does work on all types of girls you tell us you must be desperate miserable to do this but for the first time in our life we are finally happy getting what we want cannot you see it cannot you be happy for us you tell us that not what women really want but very obviously our experience tells us it is so there comes the day when we finally realize that you are lying to us and we start wondering why do you do this we continue our research combining the practical results of pick up artists with modern science in psychology and timeless philosophy we slowly understand why we start to understand how women work why they do what they do including why the lying it frightening but it the truth that why it called the red pill you tell us ok i used to like that kind of guy but i was young and naive that not what i want now but where you try to sell us maturity we now see the real lack of options behind you got old and you cannot get the hot stud anymore so you need to convince the faithful and kind friend that he was the right one all along you need to settle but you cannot have faithful billy being aware of that so you lie to him my sweet and caring friend billy it you i wanted all along and if faithful billy cannot see through the deception and deign marrying you you cheat on him a few years later with that hot guy that looked at you with lust from the other side of the bar and then divorce him taking half his assets thanks to divorce laws and preventing him from seeing his kids if you feel like hurting him again thanks to divorce laws honey we finally got it all figured out no need to advise anyone on this sub we see through your lies very well by now we know when you lie and we know why you lie we even know how you lie to yourself too in order for the deception to work even better we understand how your attraction to men works more than you understand it yourself based on your comments on this post i can tell that you are late 20s early 30s i can tell that you are starting to feel a light dread that you may not be able to find someone suitable to settle with i can tell that you are stressing out that your sexual experience turns off a lot of relationship prospects and you are probably already starting hiding it to guys you meet on tinder i can tell that you call yourself a strong feminist because you are aware most men are turned off by your sexual experience and feminism conveniently shifts the blame for your dating issues off your shoulders because there nothing wrong about it and men should be ashamed to think that way i can tell that you are looking for a kind sweet sensitive man right now not because it attractive but because you need someone you feel you can rely on someone who will not dump you after he discovers your past someone who will agree to buy a house despite your shitty credit to stand by your side when you are pregnant by him or not does not matter to work extra shifts to pay for your future social studies and i can tell that you are trying to convince yourself that this new you is the real you that this is real love real attraction it all so predictable to us ,14,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,you did awesomely a lot of classic pua trp tactics and no mistake that i can see i tried to interact with them sparingly not sticking around long enough to run out of cool things to talk about or look like i had nowhere else to go no one else to talk to 1 in any setting social proof is key to displaying high value after looking hot that why you need to stay social chatting with people the moment you are by yourself looking down at your phone is the moment you lose your chances recognizing shit tests i passed them all i think the ones i caught anyway 1 i escalated whenever i could 1 the difference between the bold confident guy who gets laid and the bold confident guy who does not is that the first shows he never afraid to get physical with the girls he is attracted to and never got too drunk i think it does not matter too much a little drink is good to lose some inhibitions and a lot is good to show some boldness the main issue with drinking is cost and of course if you drink so much that you cannot function socially nevertheless it shows good self control so good on you i never said anything overly complimentary or bought drinks unless it was in rounds 1 great habit compliments and buying drinks are two examples of behavior that show you value someone so use them sparingly about never at the beginning of any interaction and later only as rewards for your complying tests i was staying with my friend and on the second night i hooked up with his gf boss 25 great face and body she first joined the table of myself my friend and his girlfriend i introduced myself but mostly ignored her in favour of my friends 1 that is awesome game application directly taken from the mystery method and that is little discussed here anymore making friends with everyone in the set is how you disarm the set from potential cockblocking you and more importantly the true way to display social value saying how much you travel the world to a girl does not boost up your value in her eyes as much as seeing her friends laughing to your jokes or showing appreciation to your stories if your target girl sees that her group of friends see you as a high social value man you are in 1 the ignoring her mostly is perfect neg application negs are often villified by bue pills as backhanded insults but they are not neg theory is basically a combination of 1 making her feel that you do not necessarily value her that highly 2 appearing not interested in her at first until she proves herself and 3 being really subtle about it all mostly ignoring her in favour of your friends is one great application of neg theory making sure i influenced the flow of conversation as much as i could 1 controlling the frame is not only between you and her it between you and everyone you be the leader this is my reality and you are all guests in it i would occasionally turn and engage her calm and slow voiced but light and jokey maintaining eye contact throughout 1 that the beginning of proper kino she responded to this very well but kept saying how i was a bit rough and not very nice to her at this point my natural reaction would have been to apologize for upsetting her and start being nice to compensate but this time i doubled down playfully teasing her for her thin skin and generally acting like i did not give a shit if she liked me or not she made fun of me a few times after that but i held frame pretty well 1 that was a shit test and you perfectly passed it the translation is this she was attracted to you thanks to your perfect and consistant dhv neg combination her attraction started making her feel uncomfortable about her losing control of her desire that what attraction does it not called sexual tension for nothing she voiced this uncomfort in a way that would test your congruency and you answered in a way that was perfectly consistent demonstrating to her that this is not an act it the real me i was later told at the bar by my friend girlfriend that she said she found my personality too strong and that i am an asshole or whatever cannot remember exactly but she could not help but be drawn to me this is attraction spelled out right here girls hate you for inducing that roller coaster of emotions that they cannot control ontop of being a higher value person than her ontop of living in your own reality and refusing to enter hers frame that why you were an asshole that why any guy hearing this word should grin because it very positive for the next steps and that why girls love what they call assholes but really mean mysterious guys who do not take my shit upon hearing this kinda drunk and in brand new territory i could not believe that my actions the opposite of everything i would previously believed were working an absolute treat i began escalating physically at this point resting my hand on her lower back or abdomen whenever i was talking into her ear could not think of anything else haha 1 kino escalation again the difference between the man that gets laid and the one who does not she did not respond negatively so i took it as being ok 1 absence of red light is a green light in a way your kino is a compliance test you are asking her will you not mind my hand here her not rejecting it means she complies with your request good moment to reward her compliment more kino etc skip to leaving the bar i have been holding my frame well all night and openly flirting with other girls including her friends in front of her 1 pre selection the most potent of mystery 5 attraction switches to the point where i could have told a dad joke and she would have laughed seriously it got to such a degree that i felt i could do no wrong in her eyes like she had made up her mind about me fucking her and that was that not suprised given everything before i avoided asking a question instead saying come back to will with us we will get some more drinks 1 even though she was super keen by now you still offered her plausible deniability to disarm asd lmr and in a way stating not asking that does not leave room for the hamster to start spinning this is a game right here good job she does not hesitate will and his gf eventually disappear to bed later i turn to put my empty glass on the table and when i turn back she is sitting up straight next to me looking me in the eye noticeably nervous i lean in and kiss her she reciprocates and it on from there notice the absence of asd lmr that because you played it perfect you generated so much attraction while avoiding triggering asd that there was no doubt in her mind as to her next actions i am convinced that 3 things did this for me her seeing me flirt with other good looking women and get positive responses from them slow dripping attention to her short bursts but exciting and escalated every time assuming charge of group decisions conversation drinks music places to go etc or in pua terms preselection push pull kino and frame a great fr

Auvergnat, the numerous alpha boys i have fucked who for the most part do not seem to give a shit about the other person enjoyment then why did you fuck them all the numerous of them ,6,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,ok ok i finally get it you are a pure mgtow asexual or gay or conflicted or whatever but you came to trp to state hey guys i am not interested in girls at all but i would like to let you know that when you are fit you happen to obtain girls attention alright fair enough then i will just say that since people on trp are into girls subreddit is about sexual strategy after all it is unfortunate that people here automatically assume any poster does despite any warning that you might write on top of your post as you actually did with that information i will just say thanks for passing by but we already know about lifting that our 1 tip but we also understand women nature enough to realize that women attraction is not purely on looks and that game is also fundamental you may disagree but then if you do not date and practice game what would you know about its efficiency ,1,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,i am working out too buddy we all do here i know the benefits from it yet you did not post about its health benefits you specifically posted to say how it gets you so much more attention from women and you know what i totally agree with you we all do and even though i do think that game works and is just as necessary to practice to get girls i wo not argue your decision not to practice it you do not have to if you do not want to date you go your own way totally ok with that what is weird is the fact that you do not seem to have any dissonance holding those two concepts on one side you work out to impress girls or you feel happy enough about that consequence to post on trp about it and on the other you say you do not want to get girls for anyone who is either actively into getting girls or actively into avoiding them that sounds weird u hakametal listed the very few possibilities that could explain how you can hold both concepts in mind ,2,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,no if she knows you are doing that in order to get her back she would lose all respect that she has left for you see the problem is that if you do anything for her it comes off as you valuing her more than you value yourself and when she picks up on that feeling of yours you are gone what you want is for her to want you to want you enough that she would respect you by not talking to other guys ok to get her to want you she must feel that you are valuing yourself more than you value her the whole point of dread is to give off that feeling you are not being absent from her world to get her to react in x way you are being absent from her world because you feel like doing x or y without her is so much more fun than doing z with her when she realise that you are feeling like you are more valuable than her then she will start feeling it too and then she will act in such way to keep you around and one of such acts is to not disrespect you by talking to other men you can imagine that process takes some time ,2,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,and yet it got massively upvoted trp seems to be turning into a nest of social retards who want sex like every man out there but are too afraid to talk to girls they hate on game without trying saying pua do not work because that much easier to do than admitting they are not good socially and to work on it post preferably on mgtow rather than incels because if you are going to be sexless from not approaching girls it better for the ego to pretend you actually want to be sexless sometimes find the motivation and discipline to work out to obtain the good looks that will give them the validation they crave and get girls to approach them without them having to approach u doncarlione if you truly did not care about women dating or sex then you would not care about the validation and attention you get from people because you are ripped if you really did not care you would be better off not lifting so that you have more time for the things you really want to do except you wo not because you love the validation because you want sex you were motivated and disciplined enough to realise you are physically weak and do something about it but you are not strong minded enough to realise you are socially weak and do something about it you will get there ,5,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,finally the voice of reason in a thread of social retards thank you ,2,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,op if what you wanted to do was prove to yourself you can resist temptation or fuck with a woman mind or cover your ass against an unlikely false rape accusation then good on you you did well for any other reason you are a bloody idiot girls saying we should not be doing this as you take their clothes off is par for the course this did not mean that she did not want to sleep with you at all this is absolutely not to be taken literally she wanted you to say you are right we should not but you are sooo desirable i cannot control myself it like people asking you how do you do when you meet them they do not want to know your life story they do not want to know you are feeling unwell at the moment because this or that they just want you to say good thanks and you to indicate you are not a social retard that you acknowledge the ice breaker and that you are ready to move to the actual conversation your story is the equivalent of you meeting someone who wanted to chat with you by starting the convo with how do you do and you answering well i am not well my balls have been itching all day plus my banker called me to say my request for a loan has been denied because cue the awkward moment when the other person feeling that they have stumbled on a social retard is trying to find an excuse to cut short the convo while you smugly think well he asked so i answered ,35,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,thanks for the post this is a great illustration of female manipulation the why is simple all relationships contracts are power dynamics men and women evolve different more or less conscious tactics to take maintain power because of their physical differences men are physically stronger so we evolved mental modules to attempt gaining power by physical means aka susceptibility to violence and intimidation women are physically weaker so they evolved mental modules to attempt gaining power by psychological means aka manipulation all in all it very similar dynamics as parents children parents threaten to punish their children and children manipulate their parents puppy eyes crying etc the how is complex check this out http archive is dqzpo,2,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,i think more fundamental is the fact that women are victims of men is a core dogma of feminism that must be protected or else the whole mental edifice crumbles down the responsibility that would come from admitting that there is something that women can do to avoid getting raped is not so much a problem of women wanting to avoid it as much as feminists wanting to protect feminism i see it a bit like fundamental christians rejecting the idea of evolution it not that they are idiots it that if evolution were true then the whole christian thought system would become obviously indefensible so they must keep on fighting the idea despite the fact it true and despite the fact it saves lives ,26,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,i think you pushed the ngaf attitude too far if you are in it for the bang you should take it as far as you can on the moment if a girl gives you iois like that lets you kiss her and tell you i am not sleeping with you tonight then you can be sure that you can sleep with her tonight if you continue playing a good game if you had stayed a bit longer kept playing her like a fiddle gave her some good plausible deniability to bring her home you would have slept with her that same night i understand that you wanted to do nothing else but what you wanted to do the whole time and that a very positive attitude to have about oneself ontop of being a very attractive attitude but the fact is you have not slept with her and girls are really good at completely changing their mind about wanting to fuck you if you leave them the time to in the words of roosh don t be just satisfied with a number or a kiss push the interaction as far as you can by changing venues or asking if she wants to go to your place for a drink in the history of the world there have been billions of number exchanges that didn t go anywhere so view phone numbers as a last resort when you can t go any further it pains me to see a guy just getting the number of a girl who obviously wants to fuck that night only to have him call in a couple days and never get a response assume that you ll never see her again because odds are you won t i hope for you that you can conclude this thing with a bang but if she goes radio silence on you because she found a chadder chad in the meantime or simply changed her mind may it be a lesson for you to always take it as far as you can go on the moment ,10,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,this sure enough there are many more weak fathers out there than there ever was but when the few fathers who are good masculine role models also produce weak sons you know something else is at play and that something else is feminine influence in boys education traditionally sons are raised by their mothers sheltered from the hardship of reality up until early teenage years then the father traditionally steps in and turn him into a man by exposing him to the harsh reality despite protests from the mother the problem nowadays is that mothers have won when boys hit 12 13 they remain in the feminized education system ,34,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,do not play dumb nobody likes being insulted even if there something in women that make them sexually attracted to a man that do not take her shit doing it with insults will also result in her insulting back calling the cops or her friends on you etc u vandaalen just told you how to create the same effect looking like a man who does not take her shit without having to use insults and suffer the negative consequences ,6,asktrp
Auvergnat,then count me out i am not here because i am against women as a group but because i want to understand them and learn to deal with them thanks to that knowledge awalt is not anti women and it not against women according to your definition awalt means do not make the mistake to think that your girl is somehow different than other women i would gladly endorse saying amalt to mean do not make the mistake to think that your boyfriend is somehow different than other men because it means that yes all men think about sex yes all men are attracted to youth and beauty and yes all men would love sexual diversity whatever the few exceptions it better off thinking all men follow the basic male behaviour pattern that their hormones and brain development drive them to follow women who would say amalt would not be against men they would be trying to understand how the male mind works the fact that newbs here use awalt as an automatic answer to any post a newb makes to cite an anecdote of a woman making something horrible does not mean awalt is mysoginistic it only means many newbs still have a long way to go to get out of the anger phase also you are talking about humanizing with another definition as op op meant they are not angels they are humans which is true while you mean to use as if op had said they are not all the same they are individuals which as you say goes against trp dogma but absolutely is not what he implied the rest of your post is good but i cannot agree with your idea of owning the qualification of being misogynistic it like feminists owning the concept of being nasty women or bitches or drinking male tears it a fun rhetoric to use but it just a dumb idea that will only make them more enemies ,21,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,i certainly agree with a lot of what you say especially as how your behavior influences her desire to stay in the relationship or not what i oppose is the concept of relationship equity the idea that somehow what you did in the past gives you brownie points to offset problems in the present is just about the most dangerous blue pill delusion there is it so important it actually in our sidebar as one of briffault law corollaries guys who believe in the concept of equity or some variation on it are headed for relationship annihilation what op did is state at the beginning how beta barry is stupid to think there is such thing as relationship equity only to suggest an acceptable variation of relationship equity think i must act alpha to keep her attracted as much as you want that redpill 101 of course you cannot avoid doing mistakes so you will never think i must act alpha 100 of the time to keep her attracted but the moment you think i must act alpha at least 90 of the time to compensate for the 10 of the time i make mistakes is the moment you step on the slippery slope next you will be thinking ok i have made quite a few mistakes recently but that ok because i have been mostly alpha before and that must count for something and there you are in full violation of briffault law although the practical consequences of i must act alpha to keep her attracted and i must act alpha at least 90 of the time to compensate for the 10 of the time i make mistakes are similar ie you act alpha as much as you can the end result on your mindset are very different because in the first you feel that she can walk away at any time despite me doing my best while the second makes you feel that well i certainly deserve of her not walking away since i have paid my dues and that why op added that part about the fact that you can never rule out hypergamy because he realized the flaw in his equity idea the risk of starting thinking you can expect something from her in conclusion between thinking belief in relationship equity is foolish but there is such a thing as another altered form of relationship equity but she can totally violate it at any moment because hypergamy you are better off thinking there is no such thing as relationship equity it simpler to keep in mind and it will keep you mentally ready for the day it wo not be your turn anymore ,1,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,i am a red pill man and i 100 approve of this message example 1 women divorce or deadbedroom their husbands because they were never really attracted to him to begin with notice the assumption that the woman attraction is constant over time if she is not attracted now then she never was attracted to him to begin with notice that the alternative ie her attraction changed due to changing circumstances is never given any consideration i do not think i am the only redpill aware man who believes women often manage to marry a man they are attracted to who slowly but surely becomes unattractive principally due to her incessant manipulation at getting him to provide for her only it a process we call betaization and that been red pill knowledge for a while i think your view of redpill men believe women marry men they were never attracted with is somehow of a strawman fallacy sure there are girls who settle for an unattractive man because they settled too late but that definitely not the majority of women and i doubt that what a majority of redpillers think example 2 women fuck hot sexy men in their youth then settle for a boring beta notice that again the assumption is that women sexual preferences are constant over time men are sexually attracted to 20 year old women their whole lives so they assume that women are also sexually attracted to the same type of man their whole lives notice it is never considered that what women are sexually attracted to changes over time i do not see how that example illustrates the assumption of constant female sexual preference about your comment i must say i never made the assumption that a 17 years old girl crushing on one direction will become a 47 years old woman crushing on one direction and i never saw anyone on trp making that assumption and if they do they are definitely idiots example 3 once women sleep with chad she will never be satisfied with a different man who is not equally as alpha again this assumes that her sexual preferences are fixed in time if she was really into a type of guy once she will want him for all time it is not considered that she was attracted to that man in that specific context but is not attracted to him outside that context ancedotally i know several men who still pine over their ex but only one woman and she never even slept with him the example is truly what we think but your interpretation of why we think that way is off we are not assuming female sexual preferences are constant to explain that phenomenon we invoke her own estimation of her own value if she been with a 10 hot guy she values herself as a 10 hot babe and therefore anything below that is unsatisfying it a bit simplistic but the gist is hard to deny and by the way men work like this too example 4 women are all attracted to the top 10 of men this one has fallen out of fashion somewhat but there are still a few stragglers that believe this men are almost universally attracted to beautiful women and the more beautiful the better in constrast the type of men a woman likes depends on her social group and situation she likes the top men but the top of what depends very much on her particular preferences and situation again the mistake is assuming that female sexuality is as fixed as male sexuality this one i like because it falls right in line with my own comments on trp about value being context dependent everything but your last sentence i wholly agree with and often encourage on the trp sub men need to find the social context in which they can reach the top 10 similarly that why i always try to stay in a context that is in my favor doing activities i excel at and going out in contexts where i am near the top of the hierarchy overall i think your post would look great on trp itself to teach some of the newbies of the subtlety of women attraction being dependent on context although your view of redpillers somehow believing that women sexual preferences is fixed is a bit unwarranted at least to my knowledge of the sub ,29,PurplePillDebate

Auvergnat,sorry mate but you get it very very wrong this time there is no relationship equity for women the only things that counts for a woman are 1 mainly what you can do for her right now 2 as an afterthought what you can do for her in the near future what you did for her overall this year does not count what you did for her this past couple months does not count you figured that out very clearly so why do you make yourself believe there is after all some subconscious scoring system at play how alpha you behaved this past three months does not count how many beta mistakes you made this past three months compared to how good you fucked her does not count if you fucked her well these past few months it counts only in the sense that it is evidence for her to expect that you will fuck her good right now or in the near future you stress the point of masculine sex but what about beta relationships in which women stay with a beta man even though he unattractive and as she tries desperately to diminish the frequency of sex to zero she stays with him depending on what he can provide to her right now if right now she may be unable to survive without a breadwinner or if she is in need of a child as soon as possible and beta barry can provide these all right now and she has no better branch to swing then she will stay with beta barry ultimately the consequences of what you say and what i say are not too different but you would better stay way fucking clear of saying things such as there is a subconscious scoring system at work where points do accumulate when the correct behavior is displayed or the credit you accumulate with your mad sexual skills etc there is no subconscious scoring system there is no credit you do not accumulate anything she only cares for what you can do for her right now and in the near future and if what you did right or wrong in the past three months obviously influences her expectation of whether you can do right or wrong for her right now it still is not credit or accumulation or any score being counted and the proof is damn simple imagine you have fucked her great for three months straight and you have been the best emotional support she had and you have not made a single beta mistake well if she finds another guy whom she thinks can fuck her better or support her better right now then you are out and she will just rationalize her choice after the fact because you had no sex or relationship credit in the bank there is no bank ,11,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,i am not using wolf pack hierarchy concepts the alpha beta dichotomy in trp or sometimes the extended version alpha beta omega is not how biologists define alpha in animal hierarchies in animal hierarchies such as wolves and some apes there is one dominant male fucking all females and all other males try to get to that spot as you correctly describe i do not think biologists even talk of beta males the manosphere appropriated the concept of alpha to describe the dominant man who fucks plenty of girls but being non biologists they probably later came up with beta to describe the males who are less dominant but get sex nonetheless in exchange of their providing to the female even though again as you correctly describe it does not apply to animal hierarchies such as wolves or gorillas the modern use of alpha beta in the manosphere is best explained by the saying alpha fucks beta bucks implying there are some men who are sexually attractive and get sex and there are some men who can provide and get some sex in exchange for their providership more accurately they refer not to men but to the dual sexual strategy of women there are some men that women want to associate with purely for sex and there are some men that women want to associate with for their dependable providing if you still take issue with this redefinition of the biologist concepts of alpha you are welcome to use the terms of short term sexual strategy vs long term sexual strategy that are used among evolutionary psychologists these are what we actually mean by alpha fucks beta bucks ,4,TheRedPill

Auvergnat, first do you all agree that every alleged father should get a paternity test of course second how can my generally red pill friend who knows and talks about how often women cheat and how many men raise bastards unknowingly disagree that all men should get a paternity test this my friend is due to the prodigious groundwork by the feminine imperative on affecting the morals of modern society women sexual strategy is to get beta bob to raise the child she had with alpha chad while men collective sexual strategy is to get children women on the whole have been steadily enforcing through manipulation of men on the whole a set of morals on society to better effect their strategy the result of decades of manipulation is that despite men knowing in their guts that it not ok for them to raise another man child their society imposed morals are that they should do the right thing if they were to discover the truth this is enforced through such a huge number of social conventions think of the child the father is the one who raised the kid we must protect the stability of the families that it little surprise that even otherwise red pill men are affected by it third what is the best approach of informing your harlot that you need a paternity test do it pro actively and covertly by hinting to your girl way before the idea of you having children that cuckolding is not an option and that you would always make sure in the event you ever have a child whether you did it or not do not feel like you have to tell her get the paternity test done if she unhappy and sulking about your lack of trust just treat it as any comfort test she just had a kid it not like she going to leave you anytime soon say things such as i knew i could trust you but i have heard so many stories i had to put my mind at ease but i never had any doubt babe ,2,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,op i think this is awesome draft material but you need to think it through a bit more you defined creeps as emphasis mine those men whose sexual expectations explicitly exceed their utility to females a good guy as emphasis mine a man whose sexual expectations are not as great as his utility and assholes as emphasis mine those few men whose sexual attractiveness exceeds their actual usefulness see what you did here you replaced expectation by attractiveness had you kept the word expectation your definition of the asshole would have matched your definition of the creep so if sexual expectation utility makes one a creep while sexual expectation utility makes one a good guy where does the asshole falls in terms of his sexual expectations what about the fourth case you did not mention sexual attractiveness utility sounds like that would be a creep but then where does the nice guy falls in terms of sexual attractiveness your classification does not work here how i would suggest you fix it other people have commented about the alpha beta omega classification some even to say what you wrote is exactly the same it not your details are slightly different this classification is the standard red pill theory and has stood the test of time the classification goes as alphas are the men to fuck they are valuable because they are high in sexual attraction though they might be low in dependable providership betas are the men to marry keep as beta orbiters they are valuable because they are high in dependable providership though they might be low in sexual attraction omegas are the men to kill they are not valuable because they are low in both sexual attraction and dependable providership so where does your creep goodguy asshole terminology fits in creeps omegas that for sure that because by both the omega definition and your definition of creep they have zero value so any form of sexual expectation is an insult interaction with them must be avoided at all costs hence the social shaming but good guy and asshole as you define them do not entirely fit the beta alpha dichotomy your good guy definition in the case of the beta works in the case of the beta sexual expectation is for her a price to pay in exchange for his providing utility as long as the price is lower than the service the beta will be a good guy one that why beta orbiters and friendzoned guys are always good guys but the faithful and wealthy and supportive husband also is but what about the orbiter who one day decides to stop orbiting what about the boyfriend who steadily refuses to propose these good guys become assholes because the price now exceeds the beta service in the case of the beta an altered definition of your asshole works a beta man whose sexual expectation now exceeds his utility what about the alpha well in that case your expectation vs utility equations break down that why you replaced expectation by attractiveness in your asshole category because in the case of the attractive man sex is not for the woman a price to pay in exchange for a utility sex is what she wants sex is the utility so why are these attractive men called assholes as you pointed out it because women do not get all of what they want from these men from an attractive man women want sex and sexual exclusivity and commitment but since these attractive men can afford not to give them they become bad guys for not giving them what they want conclusion good guy or nice guy and assholes are only women terms for guys who provide them what they want or not it quite normal when you think of human relationships as standard human contracts if your client pays in time or if your contractor provides ahead of schedule they are good guys but the client who fails to pay on time or the contractor who under performs are assholes for giving you a bad deal but this dichotomy should not be confused with the foundational alpha beta one if your value is in sexual attractiveness you are alpha if your value is in dependable providership you are beta if you are seen as a beta as long as your dependable providership utility exceeds your sexual expectations the deal is a good one for her and you are a good guy but if it dips below the deal becomes a bad one for her you become an asshole if you are attractive or a creep if you are not if you are seen as an alpha and she wants extra utility commitment that you refuse to provide she will attempt shaming you asshole into giving her the deal she wants but even if you refuses she will continue fucking you because that part of the utility you are providing to her anyway ,6,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,it not that it not your place it that you cannot teach encourage someone to be dominant since the very act of teaching encouraging by definition puts you in charge and prevents the other one to become dominant that person needs to come to it by themselves or taught encouraged by someone else than the person seeking to become subservient to that potentially new dominant person i would say arrange somehow for him to make friends with dominant men who can teach him by example ,1,asktrp

Auvergnat, the argument you exposed to the first opinion is legitimate but does not stand to the arguments of the second opinion toward what trp advocates yeah they both expose the flaws of each other see the last sentence of the paragraph on the second opinion but thanks for your evidence backed opinion there might be indeed a possibility to do a bit of both also there is always the option to frame your relationship from a position of dread from the get go constantly showing that you are only looking for an occasion to walk away from that relationship would make very loud and clear your intention to immediately leave her at her first disrespectful action ,1,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,girls creating drama is just normal female behaviour and yeah it always best to deal with it not by communicating but through power talk keeping composure controlling the frame passing shit tests etc so you are doing right but my question was about setting boundaries aka for example how do you make your girl understand that it not ok for her to meet her ex bf for coffee drinks or that it not ok for her to go get drunk with her girlfriends at the club while you are on a work trip there often competing opinions on trp on one side you could want to talk to her before the fact in order to make that boundary very clear proponents of that option would say it necessary because feelz before realz even though she may want to conserve her relationship with you she will follow her feelings and rationalize her stupid actions if you have not made it clear there will be consequences they will tell you that if do not make it clear she can use plausible deniability as part of her rationalization if it was a problem for you you should have said something and is therefore more likely to follow through if you do not say anything proponents of that option would also say that leading by the word and stating boundaries clearly is how males communicate on the other side you could want to not say anything and simply punish her after the fact by withdrawing your attention time dropping her down ranks as per the guide http archive is iyxcr or even nexting her altogether proponents of that option would remind you that talking to her to try control her behavior is mate guarding and that there nothing as anti attractive than this they will tell you that even if talking to her prevents her from using plausible deniability she will rationalize anyway by painting herself as a victim of your insecurity and then likely go and follow her feelings anyway and cross even further boundaries since you displayed so much anti attractive insecurity by voicing your concerns to her proponents of this option would tell you that the only way to pro actively prevent her following through on her destructive feelz is to be so attractive that she would not do something that involves the risk of losing you in the first place to which the others would reply that feelz before realz makes this logic moot after two years on trp i am still unsure which is best seems like a double bind to me looks like you lose in all cases so perhaps option 2 is best ,3,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,i think your situation is quite typical of many trpers you believe you have a high value by your standards not realizing the value of a man is in the eye of the women women determine the sexual market value of a man not you we all kinda make the mistake if you are good at x you are quick to assume that x makes you high smv hence attractive in your examples making good money jewelry and fixing cars is high value in your eyes and therefore you think you should attract girls but as you pointed out arrogant shits who approach women and do not give a fuck have higher sexual value in women eyes they are high smv ,61,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,i find anti slut defense and last minute resistance a fascinating red pill topic to explore both in theory and practice you hit on a woman and she attracted to you as you interact with her her anxiety rises quickly as two conflicting ideas go through her head one one hand she attracted to you she horny it that time of the month she absolutely loves the feeling of being sexually desired she loves the feeling of submitting to the lust of an attractive man she loves the mystery of not knowing how and how good you will fuck her she wants to get fucked by you on the other hand she afraid of her attraction to you and the loss of willpower it implies she not sure you are not a serial murderer she not sure if you are really alpha or are just a disgusting beta that she completely misreading she afraid that sleeping with you too fast is going to make her look bad in the eyes of her female social circle she afraid that falling for you too quickly is going to make you lose interest in her on the longer term she afraid of losing her main power card so early in the game she wants to not get fucked yet by you the dissonance is intense to attempt solving it she rationalizes like crazy but the feelings are too strong the hamster spins faster and faster then brutally stops and then start spinning the other way around faster and faster that is the crazy mind storm that you find yourself in and your chances to make it successfully to port depend entirely on your experience skill at navigating through it the navigation theory is to let your respective lust interact and build freely under the surface while you are assuaging her worries on the surface the practice is pull push two step forward one step back saying you are right let not go too fast as you slide your hands under her shirt further saying no with your words but yes with your eyes genuinely show that you think it best not to do it tonight but genuinely show that you are unable to resist your lust for her fuck i love that part of seduction just that part is why i will never be able to go mgtow ,165,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,to me it such a good fundational redpill post that i would be very interested to know from its author what needs to be amended women feed on drama so feed her some a bit cause drama without being would ramaful that goes without saying and actually women are designed to create drama out of thin air so you do not quite need to create any it enough to just wait for it to happen not be so quick to de escalate the situation aka being appeasing aka what i have been doing all my blue pill life and was fucking proud of it despite it fucking up my relationships but was too blind to see the connection ,1,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,i think you both have valid arguments ultimately the red pill is simply the awareness of the reality of intersexual dynamics the discussion of sexual strategy in the sub definition is not a prompt for comparing different possible lifestyle options sexless mgtow vs monogamous ltr vs plate spinning etc it just a prompt for discussing the consequences of the fact that the male natural strategy maximize sex minimize investment and the female natural strategy maximize sex with alphas maximize investment by betas conflict that why there can be subs for red pill women subs for women who are aware of the truth of intersexual dynamics aka conflicting sexual strategies and want to discuss what it means for them so yeah mgtow is a possible lifestyle option for red pill aware men specifically the lifestyle option for those men who cannot be bothered putting in the efforts that are necessary to win at the game that is the reality of intersexual dynamics the option of the lazy the option of the losers and the option that will bring the least happiness but an option nonetheless ,3,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,why are you so condescending to someone giving you a pretty valid counter point an ad hominem fallacy is an argument that seeks to discard an argument by attacking the person glo did not tell you your argument is moot because of this or that aspect of your person he attacked your argument in his first post at least if anything it is your comment making fun of his username that is actually a good example of ad hominem fallacy because you implied his argument is unvalid because his username is ridiculous what glo told you is in his own politically incorrect style depends on tastes what a lot of other people just told you even if we pride ourselves to be rational humans typically respond more to emotions than logic so that a more accurate red pill theory would fly over the head of everyone if we insisted at keeping it academic the result of this human nature about the communication of information is that we are facing a trade off do we want to insist keeping red pill accurate open and rational with the price to pay being that the information would be then limited to a very underground club that includes just a select few with the intellect to understand the drive to learn and a passion for logic or do we allow ourselves to let the red pill be open to any anger partisanship exaggerations and approximations so that at least we reach a larger number of men who needs it so desperately you are in one camp glo and the red pill mods are on the other as a perfectionist scientist who would have stayed beta if it were not for the sheer size of this sub that allowed my stumbling on it i am balanced ,8,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,picture yourself at a bus stop and there an ugly obese girl who starts looking at you you are definitely not attracted to her what is your reaction right you look away you make it look like you did not even notice her that how girls react to you when they find you unattractive which means that any other behaviour towards you by a girl that is not looking away from you is an indicator of interest a girl looks at you for more than a second she interested she initiates conversation she very interested she continue to try to get you to make small talk she very very interested you were hit on by a girl and you did not understand it and her attraction for you was there even before she noticed your dgaf mood and yes dgaf mood can be attractive specifically the attitude that you are not interested in a girl communicates that you see yourself as higher value than her that why in the early phase of attraction in the mystery method it is advised to ignore your target that part of the infamous and efficient negging toolbox do not go believe that i said you get girls attracted by ignoring them negging only works in conjunction with displaying high value here your dhv was probably all in your looks ,5,asktrp

Auvergnat, haha well it actually a small enough population that poisson noise is significant yeah i do not mean to claim that it was the answer in this specific case but i used the example to comment on how that quite obvious possible explanation was completely absent from the discourse yes and i am concerned about the echo chamber effect along with cherry picking we are exposed to the posts that are posted and they are necessarily not an average of male experience i wish there was a more balanced forum sometimes in which free discussion was allowed but step outside of this forum and you are faced with endless blue pill lies bias and rhetoric my thoughts exactly i came here by curiosity stayed for the predictive power of red pill theory on the outcomes of my relationships with women and got to appreciate the wider consequences of pc culture on all sorts of intersexual issues but there an evident echo chamber effect that i am aware affected my patience for the arguments of the other side even when they seem sound the purple pill debate sub could have been such balanced place but the participation there is too partisan it looks like blinds debating deaf people i would love to leave the information space altogether but even outside of it you are still bound by your prejudices anyway and there too much practical gold on this sub on a regular basis oh well being red improves my life significantly so fuck it i will stay red biased ,2,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,or less cynically the problem is that human beings typically have moral prejudices that bias their opinions and their reaction to cold hard data it some sort of reversal of the is ought fallacy human beings believe that x ought to be true therefore x is true and scientists and r science mods are unfortunately just as prone to it as other human beings it may actually be worse in their case because scientists view themselves as objective observers of reality so they are completely blind to their very natural and very human moral bias i have attended an animal biology seminar once where the feminist chair used the opportunity to do some feminist propaganda at the end of the seminar she presented one of her little feminist pet project study consisting of a gender equal panel judging a few hundreds student research proposals in a gender equal ratio to find which ones should be funded without knowing the gender of the proposal author judging criteria were as objective as possible to target the quality of the proposal only the 12 best proposals were selected and it was expected that the result would be gender equal they were not 10 out of the 12 best proposals had been proposed by male students the chair and the presenters discussed this puzzling result with the audience for over 20 minutes how could such result be they had controlled for all confounding factors these were all good scientists multiple grants receivers renowned authors qualified statisticians yet none could even start to guess that maybe this perfectly controlled test had just disproved their null hypothesis that in our pool of students male and female research proposal quality is equal they ended the presentation begging the audience to propose what confounding factor they could have missed all this to say r science is made up of human beings with moral biases leftist moral biases here at trp we are humans too and have biases too but we are not the official science section of the front page of the internet ,5,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,not exactly you would do well to forget any beta gentleman behaviour if your goal is one night stand or non exclusive friends with benefits but in the case that interests you a relationship with good sex it is a balance that is required the idea is that some attractive traits are not good for relationship and that some beta traits are not good for sex therefore you must max out all those attractive traits that do not affect a relationship lift dress well get high social status you must minimize those beta traits that affect sex deferring to her forgiving her mistakes and in a general manner showing her that you are more invested in the relationship than her play carefully with the attractive traits that affect the relationship dread readiness to walk away it a fine game to play and you learn the rules as you go and read the red pill and it can be confusing at times in any case the most important thing to keep in mind at all times is the cardinal rule of relationships you must need her less than she needs you the moment you catch yourself being more invested than her pull away ,2,asktrp

Auvergnat,i only mean it really clear that you are in an exclusive relationship the fact that she begged for it several times and you finally reluctantly agreed means she cannot use the but we never said we were exclusive talk the reason you want to reluctantly agree to sexual exclusivity is that it your main bargain in the contract that is a human intersexual relationship you want sex she wants your exclusive resources so you delay as much as possible your giving your side of the bargain because not only it means that until then you have the most power in the relationship hence female attraction and it also communicates that your exclusive resources are very very valuable does not prevent her from cheating one day because feelz over realz but could be enough a few times to make her think that maybe just maybe i should not accept to go get a coffee with my ex who just contacted me because although i am doing nothing wrong it been so hard to get bf commitment it would be stupid to do something that would make it change his mind ,3,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,forget what you think beta means for a second and try adopting the following definition beta adjective qualifying males actions and behaviour towards women that are what women want from a man apart from sex emotional support consideration financial support deference respect sounds pretty much like all good stuff right sounds like you could basically say that a very gentleman persona that because it is beta is all good it all very nice it just that it wo not get you laid because that not what women are attracted to that what they want from a man in a relationship that actually what they want from all men everywhere whether they are in a relationship with them or not but that not what they sexually desire be a classy gentleman if you want it not really a problem being a beta it not bad what is bad is that you may expect sex in return wo not happen to get sex you need to be and do what women are sexually attracted to unfortunately a good bunch of these things are quite opposite to gentleman behavior ,10,asktrp
Auvergnat,oh maybe you did a lot of stuff right to her but the things you did very wrong are about yourself 1 you let yourself get more invested in the relationship than her 2 you forgot or did not know that women just like you are in this for themselves and owe you nothing so you let yourself getting expectations that your niceness will be rewarded somehow 3 you forgot or did not know that women are governed more by emotions than rational thoughts and that in her mind it could be absolutely normal and innocent to date you while trying to convince her exbf to come back to her 4 you got happy with her making it look like you were exclusive thus binding you into exclusivity while leaving her the plausible deniability to continue dating her exbf on the side look i understand it does not make much sense to you now that you are angry that you cannot believe someone you gave so much to can stab you in the back like that i understand you because i have been you so many fucking times and now i am not anymore girls mostly do not disrespect me like that anymore because i know how to play the game and for the few that do i just discard them without a second thought after wishing them well and i am not angry about them because i understand why they did it you wanna know my secret reading about red pill theory sidebar 10 times best of rational male blog year one 3 times rational male book 3 times chateau heartiste and return of kings blogs etc the more you will read the more you understand what you did wrong and the less you will do them in the future for example those 4 mistakes that i just listed they all come from your lack of knowledge of respectively briffault law covert contracts hamstering and female manipulation leave her and start reading ,9,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,if you are not the most sexually attractive man she can sleep with then she will lust after a more alpha man than you your woman is hypergamous like all women every man should try to be the most attractive possible but thinking you will always be the best in her mind is a grave delusion about women nature your condition for a relationship should not be her not lusting after someone else because that ai not going to happen often but her satisfactory providing of frequent and exclusive sex and female nurturing ,44,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,and give her a licence to bang her physio therapist she been lusting after for months no way you do not negotiate with terrorists and you do not try to outwit them withholding sex is a grave fault that should be immediately punished by the standard withdrawal of your time attention and money basically exactly what u battle scars suggested edit just read the end of your post on your blog you describe very well that e proper response is an embargo of your own except that sexual exclusivity is not the primary bargain chip of men it your resources in the form of time attention money and emotional support that what you need to stop giving because as i mentioned if you stop sexual exclusivity she can easily answer with stopping sexual exclusivity on her side too which she would be more than happy to do and possibly more efficient at it than you ,163,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,great post kind of stuff i like to read on trp one thing to mention though the withholding of sex as a manipulation tactic implies that for this woman sex in that relationship is not a genuine desire from her but a bargain chip aka the husband is not sexually attractive so it is very likely that the woman is also using this as yet another excuse not to have sex with her unattractive husband not tonight darling i have had a long day i am tired i have a headache the stars are not aligned as they should you voted trump so while i agree with you that withholding sex is textbook female manipulation to obtain the desired behaviour from her partner it way more obviously the case when it a threat proactive aka if you do this i will withhold sex than when it a punishment retroactive aka since you did this i am now withholding sex because it might be difficult to make the difference between a punishment and a convenient excuse not to give something she does not want to give in the first place ,86,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,fuck that was painful to read ok here the thing you do not understand red pill theory you say red pill does not work when in fact you failed to realize you were not applying proper red pill theory because you do not get it completely acting alpha is what makes girls sexually attracted to you it does not make them acting nice it does not make them wanting a relationship with you it does not make them stop trying to grab power out of you from your report you have been acting very alpha and you have got a girl very sexually attracted to you to me this spells as the red pill works you put alpha coins in and you received sex as a result now you need to understand that alpha is not the totality of what the red pill is about if you want a relationship you need to throw in some emotional support some personal investment some relinquishing of your power that some beta traits from your report i gather that you have been acting anti beta i frequently heard statements such as i bet now you are gonna go around fucking tons of other chicks and you are going to leave me i would never fully entertain these discussion and i just laughed and played it off as if she was being a child that was a comfort test and if that girl was anything but a one night stand it means you blew it she started doing everything in her power to make my ed come back infrequent sex wearing condoms constant excuses she figured if she could get it to come back shed be safe again she would find ways to to try and keep me from continuing these positive habits like staying at my house during gym hours and bitching if i wanted to go to the gym yes that is classical behaviour of a woman under intense dread exactly as the red pill theory predicts that when you need to give off some beta traits if you want your woman to stay with you which was met with me telling her that she was going to stay at my house and i was gonna go to the gym and when i got back if she wasnt there it was over and she was free to leave perfect rp right no that not perfect rp however that perfect dread application perfect rp would be to know when to dread and when to ease it off wrong she couldnt handle not having the power or control it drove her mad fights started verbal and physical abuse became a regular thing and any calm attempt at controlling it with rp tactics was met with furious insanity almost as if she had a built in power switch detector and here op and dear readers is what happened when you lay so much alpha that your girl is very sexually attracted to you but lay so little beta that her anxiety levels reach insane heights op you made your girl crazy by failing to apply proper red pill theory we went out one night with the girl and another girl who was also afriend of mine since i was in pre k drunkingly came and sat on my lap my gf blew a huge fit but i ignored her because i knew that she had slept with other guys during a break we had so i wasnt about to be rude to a girl i really cared for to save her feelings that she didnt deserve to have saved aaaaand you add some more nuclear dread ontop of it dread is usually good but if your gf is insecure about herself then most dread will send her into pyscoland there you almost get it dread is good if your woman does not respect you or is not sexually attracted to you if you apply dread to a girl who is already dying with anxiety that you might leave her then this sends her into psycoland dread works on girls that appreciate your value it will send pyscos over the edge though women are prone to crazy yes but your stupid actions are what sent her over the edge you basically had a fire starting and you threw oil on it in attempt to drown it and when the fire went wild you failed to see it as the direct result of your actions but rationalized as well that what fires do get wild maybe i should pour more oil on it whenever she really acted out i would ghost her and focus on myself sounds normal right no you ghost her and focus on yourself only when a woman does not respect you and does not want to sleep with you tldr if you want relationships you are absolutely going to need to recognize comfort tests or you are going to see a lot of girls acting crazy in your life again the red pill is not only act alpha it is act alpha to get sex and act beta to get relationships if you just want one night stands or spining plates non exlusively then by all means just act alpha and enjoy the pussy carousel but if you are trying for a relationship this is a recipe for disaster ,40,TheRedPill
Auvergnat, i hope you understand that the extreme opposite of an irrational position is not a rational position it an irrational position from an opposite perspective i agree but i did not define my position as the extreme opposite of an irrational position the red pill is not defined as anti feminism or anti tumblr so i do not think that comment applies to us which of course still does not make us automatically a rational position our claim of rational enlightened position comes from the fact that the red pill works a man who is sexless can read understand and apply red pill theory and it results in him getting sex a man who is married and in a dead bedroom situation can read understand and apply red pill theory and it results in him getting sex from his wife a man who do not understand women can read understand and apply red pill theory and it results in him understanding women which then allow him to befriend them or work with them or have sex with them or marry them with less bad consequences than the clueless man he was before you could say that feminism works in terms of the collective advancement of women rights and perhaps mra might work in the future in terms of the collective advancement of men rights but they do not work at the personal level like the red pill does they do not provide their proponents with a personally better life sure their proponents bind together and feel good about themselves by painting themselves as being victimized whether it true or not ps they often are because everyone is a victim at some point to some extent that life of course they do not really spend much time talking about those times when they are not victims and sure there are a hell lot of angry men on the red pill who complain about being victims of women and making it look like yet another victimization position such as feminism and mras in a way you could say that this men victim positioning is exactly what mra is which just goes on to say the red pill and mra overlap the issue is that the angered men are the more vocal as they wise up to what trp really is and the anger fades into acceptance these men shut up while they apply the theory and reap the personal benefits but once you pass the social posturing phase anger phase mra phase the red pill reveals the jewel it contains the red pill is the manufacturer manual to women mind and reading it gets me laid see i did not come to the red pill because i agree with their ideas i came to it because the theory perfectly explained all my past failures and successes with women the reasons of which were completely obscure to me at the time and that since i have learned the theory i have had no more failures at all and i understand very well all my successes the red pill is giving me more girls to sleep with when i am a bachelor and more quality relationship when i am with someone i only follow trp to the extent it works this way the day i suddenly discover a completely different theory that works better at getting me laid based on feminism social theories i will jump ship immediately even though we are aware that this vocal angst creates a target on our back and classify us as just another victim social movement we do not condemn it first because anger is often a necessary stage to understand the red pill and second because men opinion being beaten up into a socially sanctioned mold is one of the reasons that men are so out of touch with their masculine essence nowadays ,11,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,ok i get you i think you are talking about some universal status which would basically be equivalent to the general smv while my take was on local status as one of the independent components of smv as per my smv looks assets game status equation ,6,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,i think you are missing all the core components of what is status and how to gain it your post makes sense if you are talking of value not status because in terms of status as in social status as is your rank in some local hierarchy of a group of humans you are missing the mark completely maybe it was coming in part 2 so first off the bat from that definition status is entirely dependent on context with context being both the group you are currently with and the activity you are doing for example if you have a group of friends visiting your city for the first time and you take them on a tour you are top of the group but the moment you step in a karaoke bar with them because they all love to sing and not you then you are suddenly at the bottom you can have a great body and a great grooming but if you go rock climbing with your friends and you are not able to pull your heavy body off the ground or if you go diving as a beginner with a group of people who are keen divers or if you go to the bar with your work colleagues who all earn twice your salary and start talking business and assets your status will be very low in all cases completely independently from your looks therefore the main thing that should be on your mind if you wish to gain and maintain status is to control the social context which is not far from controlling the frame you must constantly be aware of what is your hierarchical rank in your immediate social context and predict how that rank would evolve if the context were to evolve then you make the context evolve in a direction that is to your benefit if you hang out with friends at home and everyone is enjoying the cocktails that chad is so good at making and that making sweet sue eyeing him with lust and you would like to bang her and you all start talking about where to go for dinner and you happen to be a connoisseur of thai food you would do very well to suggest that there a small thai restaurant you heard just opened in town from there the second rule becomes obvious become knowledgeable skilled in as many good social contexts as you can learn and become very knowledgeable and very good at dancing or cooking or wine tasting or making cocktails or attending the opera or boxing or surfing or whatever you want and like find something you are good at and control your social contexts towards those last rule and not the least important the social context in which other people are having fun are the best social context in which to be ontop of the hierarchy the moment you become that one guy who is to thank for everyone having fun around you is the moment you can basically take your pick of the women in the group examples include organizing a house party organizing a music festival leading a multi days camping trip leading any fun outdoor activity etc be the leader of a group having fun tl dr 1 status is entirely dependent on social context always be aware of and control the social context 2 become very skilled in as many good social contexts as you can 3 become that one guy who is to thank for everyone having fun around you ,41,TheRedPill

Auvergnat,since the matrix movie the taking the red pill allegory has been used by many groups of people to describe a massive and sudden change in one perspective of a topic from one that is universally accepted and socially sanctioned delusion to one that is little known and bitter truth quite obviously the allegory applies to the truth about intersexual dynamics and competing sexual strategies hence why we took on the allegory for ourselves but we are not the only ones using the allegory for example i have recently observed users on the donald subreddit using the allegory for the truth about the partisanship of mainstream media here cassie jaye used the allegory to make it about her own paradigm shift on the social conditions of men and women the fact that she would use that allegory for a movie topic that is thinly linked to our subreddit is either incidental or a good pr move ,12,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,did you pick the word egalitarianism off op review and proceeded to discuss this word in a manner that is not even remotely relevant to op post i just cannot believe the red pill mods would have endorsed someone whose 99 of comments are off topic so i can only guess that something must have happened recently that affected your mental health seriously i worry for you pal if there is not please consult a professional soon ,10,TheRedPill
Auvergnat, they want to be painted as these poor victims of censorship said the woman who complained to the theatre due to play the movie until it cancelled its scheduled showing over complaints it quite incredible when you think of it how proof resistant people prejudice can get ,136,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,because the way reddit works makes it essentially democratic a sub is defined by its users i wo not deny that the theredpill subreddit is currently a melting pot of the mra seduction selfimprovement hownottogiveafuck business fitness and getdisciplined subreddits irrespective of what the mods originally decided it would be there is so much mods can do to keep their intellectual control when the number of subscribers get so high my main issue with the current state of the sub is the simple fact that i was able to list all the above subreddits dedicated to each of these individual topics but there is no other subreddit that is dedicated to human sexual strategy and since we are men and know in our guts our own strategy specifically women sexual strategy no other sub talks about those women specific behaviours and instincts that are hypergamy af bb solipsism etc and how these influence women desires and wants in sex and relationships and how men can use this knowledge to deal with women in order to affect their own sexual strategy the theredpill subreddit was supposed to be that one sub dedicated to that topic this is what the mods made it originally about and the main expression of this topic is through exploring the theoretical basis of game fyi i think one of the fundational manosphere blog posts about the red pill metaphor is game is the red pill by the hawaiian libertarian dating september 2009 http hawaiianlibertarian blogspot fr 2009 09 game is red pill html although all the topics i listed can be linked somehow to human sexual strategy if i consider this information to be the main signal then there is surely an increasing loss in quality of the signal to noise ratio i accept the reality that this sub is a melting pot of opinions as to what the red pill is about but this does not mean i have to stop fighting for what i would like this sub to remain about with my derisory one vote per post and comments thus i will keep downvoting the posts that are muddying the water and keep on commenting to explain why ,5,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,thanks for passing by by beta provider we also mean a guy who provides his time attention and comfort when you feel bad all things that are important to women but not sexually attractive and you know this since it describes exactly your relationship with this man you came to twox for relationship tips and you got some did they make you feel better one user gave you some different ones and you discarded him because of his affiliation with the red pill he said nothing sexist just the plain difficult truth of what men find attractive in women and you discarded him because it hurt you but justifying that it was his cult like opinion that was the problem nah you discarded him because the truth hurt you yet here you are with a seemingly perfect nice guy whom you are not attracted to and you are unable to convince yourself to tell him the difficult truth that you are not attracted to him truth hurts sometimes often but you should not discard it because it does i am sure i wo not convince you any more than that user after all just like him i said absolutely nothing bad about women to you and i only offer advice yet you very well know you are better off discarding it because you suspect i am a sexless neckbeard cult addict ugly as fuck virgin right well despite your ad hominem i will give you some more relationships advice based on difficult truths simply because it pains me to see humans suffering when they could just bloody open their eyes to reality and see how to deal with it you probably wo not bother read it and it too bad given it basically saying how there nothing wrong about how you feel put simply your partner is very low value and that why you are not attracted to him he short and fat and lives with his parents and he makes much less money than you in your perfect feminist dreamland where people are to be paired depending on some magical compatibility and where attractiveness comes from the oh so important personality your lack of attraction makes you a bad shallow person and obviously it hurts you rejoice honey because in the real world of difficult truth what you are experiencing is very normal in the real world woman love for a man stems from her respecting him and respect is what you feel for a person you feel is superior to you and it difficult to consider a man superior if he combines so many deficits compared to you height weight life stage money etc and before you get triggered about me using the word superior and deliberately misquoting me as believing men are superior to women which makes me automatically a misogynistic cult asshole i will tell you that i know that you know what i mean you and i both know the difficult truth that a woman loves a man who is stronger than her who is able and willing to protect you when needed whom you can look up to proudly anyway just to say that your lack of attraction for such low value male is perfectly normal especially when you over estimate your own value because what you experienced when you were younger and more attractive has set some standards for your attraction and because modern society has taught you that you are beautiful as you are and that it ok to cover your eyes to the reality that men instinctive attraction is primarily towards young fit and childless women a reality that you enjoyed when you fitted the bill and that you reject now that you do not anymore even in the face of your own currently experiencing a lack of attraction for a man who does not fit the bill leave him you do not want to build a relationship without a foundational respect for him aka the source of women love this couple is going to crash at some point so save yourself years of misery by stopping now there are other beta providers out there whom you can respect and love even if you will never lust for them as you did the strong men of your past but if you want a high value man you are going to need to abide by the difficult truth of what men find attractive in women and guess what just like you are not sexually attracted to your partner personality men are not attracted to women personality ,2,TheRedPill
Auvergnat, please please please do not treat me as though i am this hateful human i am grappling with some insane amount of cognitive dissonance there been a lack of decent men in my life i have dated nothing but assholes and this is the first decent guy i have come across help me i truly feel sorry for her honey if you read this what you are experiencing is the unfortunate result of the combination of female natural hypergamy extreme male attention and your promiscuous past that our post feminist society has encouraged you to follow you have gotten so used to getting banged by sexually attractive males that you are now completely desensitized to the reality of the sexual value of 95 of men you will never be able to feel sexual attraction to regular men that ok you can still ensnare a dutiful provider somehow and keep your feelings for the hot pool boy ,3,TheRedPill
Auvergnat, one of the most red pill things you can do when did the red pill become a synonym for a cool self improvement tip not saying self improvement is wrong but this trend of equating trp and self improvement gimmicks such as cold showers meditation or no fap is slowly eroding the power of the knowledge that red pill awareness is the truth about human sexual strategies focus people ,56,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,did you report this post for no examples from fiction or for remaining sexless while posting ,7,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,great stuff thanks ,1,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,finally someone who gets it it feels like a village of fools arguing over the question of whether vegetables or meat are the most important part of a balanced diet while the wise man is quietly eating his meal people spend more time improving your looks and your game and less on arguing online which one is the most important ,10,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,90 of what you say is taken verbatim from joe navarro book and the rest is just common sense that is borderline ridiculous genitals if her panties are drenched after meeting you then she probably likes you or if she touching you then that good i do not want to sound too critical but i am wondering what is your personal experience of studying body language did you just read joe book and are just repeating its contents or did you read a while ago studied body language like he recommends and found nothing better to say than what joe said prove to me that you have been actively implementing joe teachings by describing one or two personal anecdotes where you identified a baseline cluster of behaviors in someone and a departure from them that told you something about their situation ,2,TheRedPill
Auvergnat,good stuff follow hsp bitch management guide and drop her one level down to fwb if you find out she is back in touch with him,1,asktrp
Auvergnat, do you realize how much you mean to me when i am willing to cut off contact with him for you she rationalized by saying that she was not sure if we were going to get serious and that she would not just cut people off unless she knows for sure in her defence we have only been semi serious for a short time so it understandable she wo not just drop everybody that a great power move she trying to make you feel guilty or that you owe something to her do not let it go to your head now i have the code to her phone have not looked at it yet so i am able to verify that she cutting him off but i still appreciate any advice you do not really want to get pinned into a mate guarding role the idea is this your ltr frame must remain one of i am very happy being single being in a relationship with her involves giving her some of my precious time precious attention and most precious sexual exclusivity these cost me a lot so i am only willing to give them away in exchange for equivalent services including her nurturing respect and sexual exclusivity the moment i am not given what i want in exchange for what i give is the moment i will be walking away from this contract from this frame everything flows if she wants you to stay with her she owes you respect that something you make clear either by telling her once or assuming she knows it and withdrawing immediately when she does not comply with that not something you should remind her of not something she should negotiate with her little power move not something that you should have to verify in my experience girls will just keep pushing the boundaries whatever you do unless you shock them by walking away that the best message so i would say do not verify by looking into her phone just continue the ltr and if at any point there is proof she has not cut him off you walk away ,5,asktrp
