coralsnake,i watched megyn kelly interview a lot of people before the election and i found her to be well prepared and quick on her feet something has changed recently one vivid example for me was her use of the 17 intelligence agencies phrase that hillary clinton used and which was debunked by james clapper himself this is the kind of underlying fact that she would never have used before she left fox this use of several instances of bad information from the democratic talking points wound up making putin look good that is quite an accomplishment although my assessment is that this was not the intended result it would be interesting to take a transcript of this interview and pull up all the debunked democratic talking points it would be even more interesting to tie them to the washington pos and new york times articles circulated to the regional newspapers this is a big project and i have a day job but a girl can dream cannot she a fundamental principle about meetings and interviews is that the interviewer must go to the meeting loaded for bear and kelly went with cap pistols ,2,The_Donald
coralsnake,the graph is meaningless without the underlying fudge factors we already know that the polling agencies have been blatantly overusing them for example are they overusing people who identify as democrats to provide negative answers if the the responses here are any indicator there are a lot fewer people identifying as democrats these days due to disillusionment with the clinton campaign and the over the top media coverage spez i would really like somebody to ask independents and republicans if they have a history of voting for democrats in the past that would be an enlightening question ,2,The_Donald

coralsnake, if you can bear to hear the truth you have spoken twisted to make a trap for fools or see the things you gave your life to broken and stoop and build them up with worn out tools if rudyard kipling yes it can be done because there are beleaguered muslim leaders who are trying to take islam back to the state it enjoyed in the 60s which is still within lives in being and is almost 30 years before the initiation of that poisonous hamas covenant 1988 and its advertising campaign the hamas covenant included an advertising campaign to convince muslims that they have an individual religious duty to murder their neighbors that campaign was intended to support a genocide of the jews but instead has wreaked havoc on every country with muslim majority rule the hamas covenant has been taken down off the net and supposedly it has been revised but i have been unable to find an english translation i wonder if the new covenant still calls for the murder of every jew on the face of the earth and re conquest of every square inch of land ever held by a muslim regime but there are other muslims who know where their religion came from and what it includes in addition to the parts the islamists like the pope benedict in his regensberg address https zenit org articles papal address at university of regensburg asked a serious question of both muslims and the secular world the muslim scholars from all of the muslim schools hit it out of the park with http www acommonword com the acw document in brief they said there was no fundamental difference among the abrahamic religions they agree that there are two commandments love god and love your neighbor all of the rest is commentary what this means is that the muslim version of the new testament is alive and well and residing in all eight schools of islam i remember posting the link to a common word at the sandmonkey site as well as a couple of other middle eastern blogs of the time and the joy with which it was received by some young muslims it was easy to tell which ones felt at home with it so yes there is reason to believe that islam can be brought back to its better angels in my opinion this speech by djt was historic and a potential pivot in world history djt speech at riyadh and transcript at c span https www c span org video 428828 1 president addresses arabislamicamerican summit riyadh transcript at reddit https www reddit com r the donald comments 6ch4wq president trumps full speech in saudia arabia this is a project well begun djt is doing his part as for the donald i expect its role is to continue to be the welcoming robust rowdy magical open debate forum that it is ,1,The_Donald

coralsnake,matt lauer question assumes that the initiatives of the obama administration were chemically well informed this assumption is wrong under the obama administration the epa completely lost its way deciding to pursue carbon dioxide as a pollutant while allowing known pollutants such as but not limited to lead into our municipal water supplies the story of flint michigan was only the first lead story the epa also got rid of a lot of its engineering expertise which may have had something to do with that enormous bp oil spill in the gulf not to mention that huge toxic waste dump into the animas river remember the animas river spill was predicted in advance by a geologist who wrote a letter to a local newspaper the fundamental engineering problem was that obvious http thefreethoughtproject com geologist warned epa intentionally poison animas river week toxic spill so the proper answer to the question is the obama administration refused to take the fundamentals of chemistry and engineering into account and the trump administration prefers better advice spez yes the commerce secretary answered most clearly in economic terms that is his expertise ,1,The_Donald

coralsnake,the current hysteria in the media reminds me of my father playing dominoes it a simple game and once we were old enough to count the spots on the pieces he would spice it up by switching out our pieces because we were little he would have to be really obvious about it he would say look an airplane and then change our pieces then he would laugh uproariously when we caught him i saw him do the same thing when my kids were young and i really got a kick out of watching him training them to notice he would switch the pieces and if they did not notice he would start asking them questions to draw their attention to the content of their hand years later he spotted a mouse in the kitchen while he was playing dominoes with my sister and now adult oldest son he said look a mouse and neither of them took their eyes off of him my sister said make your play dad he really had seen a mouse and we all got a good laugh out of it this is in effect what the media has done during this last election sure they were partisan so wildly over the top partisan that enough people learned to check their news to alter the results of an election unlike my dad the media did not have our good in mind but the effect has been the same now they have gotten even more hysterical and their own polls are showing them that they are at best persuading nobody except the former hillary voters ,3,The_Donald
coralsnake,bingo this the chandra levy case keeps coming to mind for me she disappeared and her aunt accused the congressman with whom she was having an affair the congressman got cleared of the murder but the voters still decided to call him back home somebody else was eventually convicted of the murder so in levy case an apparently random murder brought attention to other severe misconduct by a person in the government in my opinion it is still possible that the seth rich murder falls into this category i remain unimpressed by the lack of investigation ,1,The_Donald

coralsnake,i do not have a current subscription to national geographic but i magically got one to the rolling stone during the last election campaign each issue had one or two nasty anti trump articles i wondered whether somebody had paid the rolling stone for placement of these articles george soros paid one hell of a lot of money specifically to an array of media outlets to pursue his agenda it would be quite the challenge to find the connections here i would think but the information has to be somewhere ,2,The_Donald
coralsnake,this wall street journal article is like a poorly written legal brief it fails to address a decisive issue and misrepresents the precedent the article cites cases where before the us kidnapped people those individuals were convicted of crimes there was always an underlying crime in this case there is no crime wikileaks is a publisher just like the leaky washington pos and the new york times both are protected from prosecution for publishing confidential and even top secret information which leads me to question what part of congress shall make not law seth lipsky fails to understand indeed lipsky does understand and glosses over a decision by the supreme court that undercuts his position because when the us kidnapped a person indicted for a crime not covered by treaty the supreme court decided against lipsky desired result and then lipsky proceeds to pretend another case cited and not followed by the supreme court is somehow comforting to him a lawyer who tries to pull these stunts in an actual court not only loses on behalf of his client he may have to pay for it out of his own pocket and can have his name published in connection with the term ethical violation ,1,The_Donald

coralsnake,what happened is 1 this was predicted to happen at the sites where the grownups congregate the hillary campaign was that predictable we knew that there would be a bunch of women making accusations of sexual misconduct against djt in what the hillary campaign calculated to be too short a time frame for an adequate defense the charges would be as full of holes as a whore fishnet stockings yep somebody wrote that and they would have no effect on the election 2 boom they all show up in a bunch 4chan goes to work and t d reports that the women had connections to the hillary campaign big chunks of this information got passed to the grownups 3 djt says not to carry it any further and not to go after the women t d shut it down and to my surprise so did the rest of the media 4 the whole mess went away overnight ,2,The_Donald
coralsnake,the sad thing is there are so very many stories like this that have circulated about hillary over the years i lived in one of the suburbs of dc when bill clinton was president and heard far too many stories involving this type of ugly display of temper i figured she was unhappy and that bill infidelities probably had a lot to do with it ,9,The_Donald

coralsnake,this is just a little reminder that mohammed himself took care of this issue during his own lifetime mohammed always maintained that he was a man and nothing more he refused to have his portrait painted because he did not want the portrait to become an object of worship that is a false idol during his lifetime mohammed himself saw to it that no person of a subsequent generation would be capable of drawing mohammed because no accurate image of him was ever made his followers who have perpetuated this faux outrage over drawings are actually not objecting to any image but the the captions the words next to the images i find it interesting that the one famous unambiguously decent act of mohammed has been perverted in such a hideous fashion by his followers i figure it a sign from allah that either mohammed or his fraudulent followers are cursed ,18,The_Donald

coralsnake,in my opinion if you are going to worship something it should not be anything less than god a government is nothing but an agreement among a people for the purpose of securing their rights and promoting their general welfare the people have the right to alter it or abolish it so while a properly constituted and run government may be worthy of our loyalty it is not sufficient for worship my guess is that an atheist or agnostic would refuse to worship anything which is fine ,9,The_Donald
coralsnake,catholic here i get why atheists and agnostics have trouble with that under god part of the pledge of allegiance but those two words are included to make exactly the distinction between god whatever you conceive him to be and the government communism socialism and islamism all place the government in the same position as god and we say no the government is an agreement among men and not to be worshipped or allowed to use people ,7,The_Donald

coralsnake, former president barack obama told those gathered at an agricultural conference that man made global warming was already impacting agriculture on a global scale shrinking crop yields and raising food prices our changing climate is already making it more difficult to produce food obama said at the seeds chips conference in milan italy tuesday according to the new york times we ve already seen shrinking yields and rising food prices the former president said in his first speech outside the america since leaving office in january but is global warming already hurting agriculture there s not a lot of evidence for that claim in fact 2016 was a record year for crop yields which have basically doubled since 2007 this is some great meme material ,1,The_Donald
coralsnake, california rep eric swalwell was hammered on cnn monday for failing to produce evidence to back up his recent claim that the trump campaign colluded with the russian government cnn anchors john berman and poppy harlow asked swalwell a democratic member of the house intelligence committee about his statement last friday that he has viewed both classified and unclassified information showing that trump advisers coordinated with the kremlin there is fire i ve seen evidence on the unclassified and classified side of that fire swalwell said last week but when pressed to discuss the unclassified evidence swalwell merely rehashed information from widely reported news stories about former trump advisers carter page paul manafort roger stone and michael flynn i believe that the russians have surely been spying on us with zest and verve since at least about the 40s i have no doubt that some of them have had opinions about political candidates just as t d had in the recent french election that is a very long way from americans colluding with them meanwhile i also know for a fact that the dnc and the clinton campaign paid for rent a rioters to attack random american voters during this last presidential campaign we have a third world political party in the united states right now and it is the democratic party ,1,The_Donald

coralsnake,there seems to be some sort of fixation on a very small group of people who have been in the news lately they keep getting nominated for this office or that almost as if we do not have 330m people to select from what we really need is to expand the group of talented people working for us in these many different roles i like trey gowdy he wonderful right where he is he is qualified and i have no doubt he make a fine fbi director then he would have to be replaced in his current role the same is true of any number of fine people in other roles already in the administration but it makes no sense to cannibalize the same limited group every time an office opens up the optimum choice in my view is to find somebody else with some of gowdy undeniably fine traits to place in that slot so that he or she and gowdy can work together in those oversight hearings ,1,The_Donald

fellow americans and people of the world thank you we the citizens of america are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and to restore its promise for all of our people together we will determine the course of america and the world for years to come we will face challenges we will confront hardships but we will get the job done we will face challenges we will confront hardships but we will get the job done every four years we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power and we are grateful to president obama and first lady michelle obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition they have been magnificent today s ceremony however has very special meaning because today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another but we are transferring power from washington d c and giving it back to you the american people for too long a small group in our nation s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost washington flourished but the people did not share in its wealth politicians prospered but the jobs left and the factories closed the establishment protected itself but not the citizens of our country their victories have not been your victories their triumphs have not been your triumphs and while they celebrated in our nation s capital there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land that all changes starting right here and right now because this moment is your moment it belongs to you it belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across america this is your day this is your celebration and this the united states of america is your country what truly matters is not which party controls our government but whether our government is controlled by the people january 20th 2017 will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again the forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer everyone is listening to you now you came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before at the center of this movement is a crucial conviction that a nation exists to serve its citizens americans want great schools for their children safe neighborhoods for their families and good jobs for themselves these are the just and reasonable demands of a righteous public but for too many of our citizens a different reality exists mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities rusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation an education system flush with cash but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of knowledge and the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential this american carnage stops right here and stops right now we are one nation and their pain is our pain their dreams are our dreams and their success will be our success we share one heart one home and one glorious destiny the oath of office i take today is an oath of allegiance to all americans for many decades we ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of american industry subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military we ve defended other nation s borders while refusing to defend our own and spent trillions of dollars overseas while america s infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay we ve made other countries rich while the wealth strength and confidence of our country has disappeared over the horizon one by one the factories shuttered and left our shores with not even a thought about the millions upon millions of american workers left behind the wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across the entire world but that is the past and now we are looking only to the future we assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city in every foreign capital and in every hall of power from this day forward a new vision will govern our land from this moment on it s going to be america first every decision on trade on taxes on immigration on foreign affairs will be made to benefit american workers and american families we must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products stealing our companies and destroying our jobs protection will lead to great prosperity and strength i will fight for you with every breath in my body and i will never ever let you down america will start winning again winning like never before we will bring back our jobs we will bring back our borders we will bring back our wealth and we will bring back our dreams we will build new roads and highways and bridges and airports and tunnels and railways all across our wonderful nation we will get our people off of welfare and back to work rebuilding our country with american hands and american labor we will follow two simple rules buy american and hire american we will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first we do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to follow we will reinforce old alliances and form new ones and unite the civilized world against radical islamic terrorism which we will eradicate completely from the face of the earth at the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the united states of america and through our loyalty to our country we will rediscover our loyalty to each other when you open your heart to patriotism there is no room for prejudice the bible tells us how good and pleasant it is when god s people live together in unity we must speak our minds openly debate our disagreements honestly but always pursue solidarity when america is united america is totally unstoppable there should be no fear we are protected and we will always be protected we will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement and most importantly we are protected by god finally we must think big and dream even bigger in america we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving we will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action constantly complaining but never doing anything about it the time for empty talk is over now arrives the hour of action do not let anyone tell you it cannot be done no challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of america we will not fail our country will thrive and prosper again we stand at the birth of a new millennium ready to unlock the mysteries of space to free the earth from the miseries of disease and to harness the energies

coralsnake,that or lots of pepes,19,The_Donald
coralsnake,if they come here they have to see that we love one another very much in the sense of the sermon on the mount and the story of the good samaritan and the second commandment is like to it love your neighbor as yourself which man was the neighbor of the man who fell among thieves go you and do likewise oddly these are the ideals spouted by the sjws and their solution is the most caustic of hatreds by their fruits shall you know them ,7,The_Donald
coralsnake,they have to learn what a sad lesson ,1,The_Donald
coralsnake,we need the disagreements this is a big country with people who live in very different situations when it comes to crafting policy we need to encompass all of the legitimate considerations of all of our people of good will for example i am pro choice but i treasure the people who are pro life because their hearts are in the right place i watched to democrats call them racists when i knew that they were keenly aware that the abortion factories focus on killing black babies ,2,The_Donald

coralsnake,this is not a speech it is an executive order it is a written instrument with a precise meaning and a nondiscriminatory effect that a lawyer would claim it is religious discrimination is a disgusting sign of ineptitude ,2,The_Donald
coralsnake,the relevance is found in the many comments from people in a position to know that the executive orders are directed to genuine problem one that is properly addressed through executive action ,2,The_Donald
coralsnake,intent is usually relevant and would be considered where an executive order had the effect for example of banning muslims generally from traveling to the us neither of the immigration executive orders had that effect both were limited to travel to the us from countries unable to vet their own travelers there were no restrictions placed on the vast majority of muslims countries ,1,The_Donald
coralsnake,nice summary ,3,The_Donald
coralsnake,i think it is stunning that an actual lawyer would fail to recognize that a narrowly tailored executive order directed toward a specific problem namely travel by terrorists from a short list of countries that are unable to verify a person identity in not a general ban on muslims ,1,The_Donald
coralsnake,they get told it all about race a lot ,1,The_Donald
coralsnake,it was not religious discrimination muslims from many other countries who can adequately vet their travelers are not subject to the order ,5,The_Donald

coralsnake,we have a big stick several of them in fact the globalists are stuck in the past with a malthusian mindset and a desire to resurrect themselves as a new nobility they think they can play with national economies for fun and profit the welfare of the little people be damned they have made a serious miscalculation by allowing the islamists to sow the wind and yes we are all going to reap the whirlwind much as i wish we were not we will have to save their asses while we save our own the weapon we have is us we outnumber them and in our mass we have every skill known to humankind in greater abundance and stature than they do the printing press which initially allowed ordinary people to read the bible eventually resulted in trade associations and committees of correspondence followed by the replacement of the class of nobility with various forms of more or less representative governments now we have the internet with multiple forms of crowd sourcing they have vast sums of money positions of power and corrupt connections we have something new under the sun i plan on winning ,1,The_Donald

coralsnake,ah but the key is that we knew what they were doing in good time to call them on it i remember that well before the project veritas videos and the wikileaks releases people at the gateway pundit i might not yet have found the donald at that time were pointing out that the faces of the troublemakers at one rally after another were the same this is surely part of the reason why antifa tried to use masks the people who are hiding are the ringleaders moreso than their brainwashed kiddies ,13,The_Donald

coralsnake,the media blackout in the last few hours before the election was required by french election law the allegation from a 4chan post that the leaker finally turned to 4chan after trying and failing to get the attention of the french press is damning provided always it is true yes we caught the washington post spiking political stories disadvantageous to democrats in at least the last 4 united states presidential campaigns of those three different washington post ombudsmen admitted that the stories had been spiked ,3,The_Donald
coralsnake,with the women march in dc having islamist speakers and hijab sighs i would say so ,2,The_Donald
coralsnake,that leak was too little too late and far too unverified yes i know that there was a post that allegedly brought this information to 4chan as a last resort because the french press like the american press before it had chosen sides and spiked the story but too late is too late and unverified remains unverified now the only thing for french patriots to do is dig in and fight those policies or leave ,1,The_Donald
coralsnake,nope we can cut funds for them and that will be sufficient federal money always comes with strings ,1,The_Donald
coralsnake,the simple truth is djt has far more class than most democratic politicians perhaps that is why the press had to lie so much about what he said that would also explain why the democrats are so ostentatiously angry at him for using twitter he has taken control of the snippets of words the press would otherwise select with malice ,1,The_Donald
coralsnake,the whole point of weighing in on this election was out of love and concern for our neighbors of course we hope they prosper i congratulate macron for winning i hope he takes up his responsibilities and pursues successful and intelligent policies on behalf of his country i am disappointed in the outcome of this election because i think it was a very bad call by the people of france it is their country i honor their choice and i most sincerely hope i am proven wrong by future events ,7,The_Donald
coralsnake,what makes you think they are even human today big story here has gotten almost no attention in the us press i know this because i get a regional newspaper that dutifully transmits the ap new york times and washington post i can guarantee that there are very few people outside t d and a few other new media outlets that even are aware of this election ,5,The_Donald
coralsnake,37k users out of 6m when there no place else to get the news and everything they do is getting down voted got it ,4,The_Donald

coralsnake,you think that a person who accepts the right of another people to the self determination to destroy their own nation is immoral got it ,5,The_Donald
coralsnake,we wo not watch it the news will be stifled there have been friday night riots carbeques in the suburbs of paris for years and the government finally decided that instead of enforcing any law it would just stop the newspapers from reporting on them so that deprived of attention the rioters would stop burning cars it did not stop the behavior in my view a population that will tolerate that kind of nonsense cannot be roused to require its government to act in a rational fashion they are feckless and will take refuge in their version of sophisticated fatalism we think they are crazy in the us we use cartoon green frogs to elect a person outside our self appointed elite the rest of the world thinks we are crazy but effective ,4,The_Donald

coralsnake, depending on your intelligence and personality going to college can provide you more knowledge than autodidactism no just no especially in in the deeply corroded areas of the humanities i am an autodidact that graduated from a liberal arts college at the tail end of the time when liberal artis actually meant something this was at the time when they had just started to separate the requirements for different types of degrees so that a top quality english major was no longer expected to have any background in either latin or calculus i got a stem degree because that department housed the professors who had something to teach me it was not just the subject matter they also taught basic critical thinking and bullshit detection two topics that had already been replaced by various kinds of foolishness in the other departments where i took advanced classes namely english and music i was in a special scholar program so i was able to place out of history i had one excellent history teacher in high school and take honors english followed by my selection of advanced electives i did this and found myself in classes full of people who were uninterested in the course subject matter unwilling to do the assigned reading and far too willing to chew up class time trying to get the questions to any upcoming tests this last was a feature of the education majors meanwhile a vocal minority of the professors resented the mere presence of stem majors in any of their advanced classes because those students consistently blew the curve to the vast irritation of the lazy students in their own departments i was by no means the first stem major to have this experience since then the humanities departments have become infested with a large class of people whose first commitment is to political activism not scholarship the lack of commitment to intellectual rigor is painfully evident in their publications a case in point is the pathetic unintellectual response by professors and graduate students to a couple of presentations by dr charles murray co author of the bell curve at middlebury college and at notre dame instead of giving that silly book the rigorous slicing and dicing it deserved the professors at those two schools whipped up an emotional storm complete with screeching attempts to avoid discussion entirely all this told me is that none of the professors or graduate students at either school that took a public position had the intellectual firepower to recognize and explicate the fundamental errors in the book ,1,The_Donald

coralsnake,yes this is creepy but pro choice people need to be careful what they wish for although djt has said that he favors the reversal of roe v wade i disagree because that decision is a barrier to a governmental slaughter of the innocents the ultimate result of roe v wade is that in the united states an abortion cannot happen without the consent of the individual pregnant woman involved there is no way for the state or the federal government to compel an abortion against the mother wishes toward the beginning of the opinion is a discussion about the consequences of allowing the government state or federal to intervene in the abortion decision it points out that once a secular government is granted the power to intervene in a decision there is no way to control what decision will be made and there is almost no way to rescind a grant of power this means that a court opinion granting the government the power to stop abortions is also a grant of power for the government to later compel abortions at the time this opinion issued there were howls of protest that this can never happen here but it was not all that long afterward that reports of china one child policy found its way to our shores china had no problem finding ways to enforce its policy mostly through persuasion and denial of benefits the long term effects were abortions by the many millions mostly girls and presently a population imbalance with many millions of men who have no one to marry anyone who thinks that will never happen in the us should to a little hunting in the way back machine to find the horrible criticism of sarah palin for her decision to bring her baby with down syndrome into the world roe v wade remains unsatisfactory to pro choice people because the whole notion of killing a baby is offensive but it has the virtue of protecting our populace from wholesale compelled abortion ,2,The_Donald
