aolsux00, and i have not mentioned anything in regards to liberals or conservatives we had a choice of brown or whitman between the 2 i think the choice is fairly evident yes people chose the one who bullshits and lies the most i am not saying either side was great so do not try to use that argument he is one of the most dangerous people out there because he did all kinds of stuff to mess up the country and a few good but has people so deeply brainwashed that they worship him and cannot see the problems he caused he increased separation among people and increased our national debt significantly show me numbers about welfare queens or illegals stealing jobs this article shows that they are committing identity theft and stealing jobs that belong to legal residents citizens http www washingtontimes com news 2016 aug 30 irs doesnt tell 1 million taxpayers that illegal i some other stuff http www fairus org issue illegal aliens taking america jobs clinton even said it http freebeacon com politics hillary clinton illegal immigrants taking jobs they take tons of jobs under the table and we do not even have those numbers plenty of construction workers waiters bus boys kitchen workers work under the table illegals do the jobs no one else does for payno one would ever accept and often timss is below minimum wage do you want to pick berries in the fields for a few bucks an hour you are argument is going to get destroyed actually you are wrong because businesses would have to pay workers minimum wage of more if they wanted an employee to work see how that works if you cannot hire an illegal you hire a legal and pay them a fair wage we have bring some in on work visas to pick berries see how that works without immigrants and specifically illegals all that produce you buy wouldnt be so cheap work visas my friend welfare yes people take advantage of it but shitty people will take advantage of anything id much rather throw my money at the chance to help a bunch of people with some freeloaders hitching a ride than condem them to poverty homelessness horrible argument why not actually push them to get a job like help them out and find them jobs is not that a better solution then they wo not leech they wo not be homeless and they will actually pay taxes nice idea is not it you bringup hillary and obama like they are some kind of fucking royalty look ag busb senior hes so down to earth he didnt know how a fucking price scanner works bush jr is so down to earth hes owned sports teams your argument makes no sense because it does not reply to mine the point i was trying to make is that these liberal leaders are all about cutting down on global warming saving the earth using less resources penalizing us for living yet they do the exact opposite the rules and fines and fees are for me and you yet they waste the most at least the conservatives are not pushing shit like global warming and at the same time wasting if you are going to say do not fuck up the country why are you the one fucking it up more than 100 people put together see my point do not be a hypocrite is all i am saying leonardo di caprio one of their mouthpieces and al gore are the absolute biggest hypocrites and trump is on track to spend more money going to his own fucking hotel in the first year of office than o ama spent in 8 you cannot change where his family lives or where he travels to we knew that when we elected him that almost nothing compared to other wastes so before you go on trying to paint people as fucking royalty maybe you should look atthe other side as well trying to make it seem like the left is the problem who said i think the other side is so wonderful you are making a false assumption i am just more in alignment with the other side the problem with the left is they keep telling they are going to help the poor but just about every policy hurts them for example more taxes mass immigration illegal immigration higher fees handing out welfare like candy etc and these are just a few im not saying they do have problems but holy shit man look around stop thinking only about yourself help people have faith in people i do my fair share of helping when someone pays 500 for a red light ticket it is not actually helping the poor or homeless you do realize that right also i help people that want help and want to help themselves they gotta put the effort not just their hand out i rather make people self sufficient rather than lifetime beggars that how you actually help people but the liberals lol they want lifetime beggars so they can control their vote they are not really giving money out to help people nothing in life is 100 free ,1,LosAngeles
aolsux00, clearly liberals are the problem and any neighborhood that is not rich is a bad one like koreatown its not because its not rich its because it has crime and its not safe and many of the people there i am not saying you since i do not know you are not the most law abiding peaceful considerate or nice people out there get outside of your west side for once and maybe you will open up a little bit lol i have and i do all the time and realize that a lot of other places like east la parts of downtown south la etc are like shitty 3rd world countries like seriously they are dumps not all parts of the areas i mentioned but many parts definitely are high crime rates people dumping trash all over inconsiderate as can be looking for trouble etc you have so much anger in you you should move out if you do not like the liberals that live here i am just putting the truth on the table i am laughing at you right now actually ,-2,LosAngeles
aolsux00,the problem with dumb people like yourself is that you do not question and let them do whatever they want you do not wonder why a ticket is 500 here and its 150 someplace else that why you are an nothing and never will be something in your life because people steal from you and you do not even know it you are a puppet you do as you are told you are a follower who cannot think ,1,LosAngeles
aolsux00,i never said that i have no problem helping people that actually try we have too many welfare queens and freeloaders in this country that choose not to work with that said liberals are the only ones that say fuck everyone else with their policies that make poor people poorer while they say they are helping them how many liberal leaders or big shots with big mouths actually follow a single policy does hillary or obama live in a small house and conserve water and gas do they all have electric vehicles they have the biggest and most wasteful of everything the rules are just for us not them ,0,LosAngeles

aolsux00,so you still cant defend brown right its not so much the stuff i have to deal with here its the people that support him when they cannot even defend him you guys are mostly broke and are okay with giving away your money,1,LosAngeles
aolsux00,like i said you are wrong and you know it you cannot defend a single argument and you have been walked all over by my arguments so you keep trying to manipulate the situation but you are not slick or smart and i wo not let you do that if you are right defend your argument or admit you are wrong and brainwashed seriously this is why our schools are terrible we do not teach people like you how to think before supporting something you just believe what you are told ,-1,LosAngeles
aolsux00,just about everything you said was an excuse and not an argument to support what you have been brainwashed into believing and accepting koreatown is the ghetto really have you ever been to koreatown i can assure you that koreatown is not ghetto yup definitely not a good area compared to many parts of la maybe if california leaders were not taking away so much of your money and actually cracked down on crime you would be able to live in a nicer area or have less crime in yours not everyone is some rich asshole like you who can afford to live in affluent neighborhoods oh so everyone who is rich is an asshole because they make more money than you good to know i am actually not rich yes there is a ton of crime here oh wait i thought your neighborhood was so great a second ago but maybe look into the history of why we have lots of gangs due to the racial tensions and segregations that went on in la history before asking why gangs are not being crushed those problems are no longer present like they used to be so there is no need for that so your argument is completely invalid for today they could have dismantled their gangs the leaders but they are just terrible people so cops cannot do their jobs because segregation used to exist are you dumb enough to think your argument is a good one or valid you have a solution to this just get more police and send them into gang territory to just start arresting anyone that how you reduce crime you get tough on it there has not been a time where it has not worked you infiltrate gangs and arrest everyone you make tougher laws please explain why and provide proof as to why it would not work since you are so sure of it there are other things that need to be done as well but this is a large part of it drug issue is a national problem this is not a problem that is simply related to just la same with homelessness and rising housing costs do not try to say other places have this problem too as an argument because it is not a valid one we collect more money for homeless people than other places yet we are not helping them rising house prices are some of the highest in the nation in la so do not come up with dumb excuses its going up more and faster here than almost any other place schools do suck here i will give you that yes but they should not when we have some of the highest property taxes simple red light is 500 is what the price is do not go through the damn red light in the first place i have never gotten one but the point is that its just a money grab and does not need to be so high i can use your dumb excuse for anything a parking ticket is 250 do not get one would be your excuse if we raised the prices of parking tickets its ridiculous not to destroy your argument once again plenty of fraud and cheating has occurred with red light tickets educate yourself on it a bit like making the yellow lights shorter lets also not forget that some things like parking tickets are in the hands of companies like xerox which reject virtually every claim even if its a valid one if you are so damn unhappy here you are free to move california and la is not perfect but we can continue to work to make it a better place all these liberal policies keep making it worse not better that the problem if they made things better i would consider supporting some of it ,0,LosAngeles
aolsux00,oh so you cannot defend brown is that what it is so you have to change what is being discussed ,0,LosAngeles
aolsux00,i want to thank you for not being like other redditors here that are all about attacking even though in most cases they are wrong the point is that brown and other liberals claim to be collecting all this money to fix these things such as the homeless problem roads infrastructure etc but yet they are not improved noticeably or at all which ones of these cannot be fixed by brown then why is he actually promising us that they will be if he takes more money from us just about every single issue i see could be significantly improved with money and better policies it also falls on the people themselves to make some sort of push to better themselves and then in turn will better the community this is not going to work when you flood the country with the lowest class people with very little to no morals no respect or knowledge of the law etc these people come from places where they have to cheat steal break every law etc to survive so they do it here 99 are far from civilized and angry and battered people ,-10,LosAngeles
aolsux00, if the problems you keep nammering on about are california only problems stop right there with the bullshit and manipulation we collect some of the highest taxes and fines in the country that is why it should be less of a problem here but they arent college costs are astronomical across the country we were not talking about collect costs it was about k 12 providing a terrible education but once again if we collect the highest taxes it should reduce college costs see how that works students are saddled with debt jobs dont exist because boomers are going after the same jobs nope ask any boomer very few are willing to hire them because they are old and a company does not put money into old people that will retire in a few years they hire fresh people with fresh ideas that will stay at the company for long term you have absolutely no idea what you are talking about the issue is that we are letting too many people that are competing for the same jobs into the country whether its legally illegally etc lets not forget h1b visas are supported by liberals and not conservatives at least at the moment do not forget that infrastructure speding from the feds has been cut drastically since reagan this is somewhat irrelevant since other states collect less gas taxes and have better roads and bridges what your saying if true would affect every state and not just california california gives more to the feds than we recieve if you want to blame someone blame the broke states that cant carry their own weight this has always been the case so its not a valid excuse since we collect tons of money and do not spend on what we claim to collect it for every state does a better job for less liberals love to collect more and more from mostly broke californians if you want to talk about pushing their own weight then lets talk about me not subsidizing every else life because they decide to have 4 children that they cannot afford if you want to go there lets discuss this as well and all the freeloaders our biggest issue is the number of illegals and freeloaders in the country we give constant handouts we give free diapers for what fucking reason if you cant afford diapers do not have kids ,2,LosAngeles
aolsux00,you cannot even defend against a single thing i listed because you know brown is a failure your argument is worthless because you cannot just ignore problems to make yourself look good by making it seem like we are balancing the budget or saving money what he did is ignore the roads ignore our broken infrastructure ignore freeways and bridges ignore just about everything to make himself look good then we things get bad and the infrastructure gets more messed up it will be someone else problem sometimes you fix things early on so they do not become a big problem later on he just ignores things and pretends everything is ok when its not people like you who cannot think for yourself and believe every lie you are told fall for this type of stuff since you think you are so smart and educated why do not you do some research and look at the facts on both sides before being arrogant and thinking you are so smart and right ,0,LosAngeles
aolsux00,really explain then why you live in the ghetto you live in a poor area so you should not be defending his policies since they take a large chuck of what you make please explain why we have some of the worst roads and the some of the highest gas taxes even before the recent raise in gas taxes explain why we have a lot of crime even though we ignore much of it why gangs are running the streets and are not crushed explain why we have such a drug issue such a homeless issue etc why we have such terrible schools and schools that are always broke when we collect so much in property taxes explain why we have double standards where illegals get a free pass on licences like health licenses and business licenses that are required by every business except food carts and fruit stands owned by illegals explain why a simple red light ticket is 500 when it is less than half of that in some other states explain why my registration is over 300 for no good reason you cannot support your false claims he is a disaster he needs to be recalled all he cares about is grabbing money from us ,-24,LosAngeles
aolsux00,and yet everyone is broker we have more homeless people more young adults that cannot afford to move out more adults that cannot afford homes etc we already paid one of the highest gas taxes in the country but have some of the worst roads before he raised it some more he has completely ignored our broken infrastructure that needed repairs 20 years ago care to explain why he is so wonderful ,-6,LosAngeles
aolsux00,all gov brown cares about is making more money off of us it just been a huge money grab just about every single policy has been to make californians poorer most people here cannot even afford to move out or live decently but support his money grabbing policies that do little good compared to what he claims he needs to get recalled ,-40,LosAngeles

aolsux00,yes exactly what i was trying to say the point of automation is not to replace 100 of employees even if it can replace a few its successful in many cases it replaces a pharmacist and you need one instead of two a low paid employee can maintain the product when needed they can do it in their spare time when things are slow and having a scriptpro did not affect our staffing volume whatsoever so you are saying it counts the top 200 for you and it made zero difference in the number of employees i really doubt that unless the number of scripts a day went up which is probably what happened ,1,pharmacy
aolsux00, get elderly people to trust it i have tons of patients who wo not even use the automated phone refill system or a credit card because they do not understand trust the technology those people may go to independents since many independents may not be able to afford it at first ai is not meant to replace 100 of employees at first even if it can replace 50 of people initially pill counters do even less it will be a huge success all you need is a low paid person to help people use it ,1,pharmacy
aolsux00,wow took you a month to find that lol its ridiculous that you have so much anger and hate that you would come back and argue over this after a month the law is clear he should not have gotten himself in trouble just because in the past we did not throw people out for laws we have one the books does not mean that we cannot at any point sorry kid ,1,inthenews

aolsux00,before telling us about your incredibly dumb ideas why do not you host an illegal at your home permanently pay for all their expenses and be fully responsible for every crime they commit youre a fool that would completely destroy the country you are letting freeloaders in that take other people jobs most often do not pay any taxes have 5 children and get welfare and all kinds of benefit etc they even raise rent and prices for everything we already have insane amounts of debt and high unemployment you would just make it worse ,2,California
aolsux00, the public sentiment at least in ca is that practically anyone should be able to come lets be clear about this we give illegals from south of the border special privileges and say fuck everyone else its ridiculous and a joke illegals should be punished not rewarded these illegals get to break tons of laws that me and you would never be allowed to break we would be thrown in jail but these illegals get a free pas everytime some examples are identity theft tax evasion running a business without a license not having proper food and health licenses etc ,0,California

guns are the problem so i am sure you are for the gun bad since you are saying they are only used for murder why do not they crack down on crime hmmm not enough cops constitutional restrictions gang crime culture that makes it difficult maybe you should consult with the lapd chief i am sure with all of his years of service and education to back it up you can show him the light dumbo they have plenty of cops they see crime and they just let it go what constitutional restrictions explain why they give such light sentences for serious crimes all day long why do not they crack down on crime hmmm not enough cops constitutional restrictions gang crime culture that makes it difficult maybe you should consult with the lapd chief i am sure with all of his years of service and education to back it up you can show him the light this does not do a damn thing it just looks good to dumb liberals like you because the people at gun buybacks do not use it for illegal purposes they are not the gang members and the murderers they have straw buyers get them they steal them the people that brought in the uzi could have sold it on the street they did not they did the right thing straw buying is illegal already so you are going towards wanting a gun ban uzis are banned in los angeles first of all and if the person was a criminal they would sell it on the street and not take it to a buyback can you think you moron most guns start out being purchased legally and many find their way through the years onto the street provide some evidence that isn t from a bullshit liberal site i would love to see it crack down on criminals again you should offer consultation to the lapd you see to understand the street more than guys working it every single day as a job shutup you moron lapd is a failure and corrupt not many people disagree you are trying to say there is not a single cop or anyone in a higher position that is not on a criminals payroll tons of documentaries have come out where gang leaders have said it and that the police wo not touch them half broken how what makes them half broken do you have a list of the 800 several not even guns out of the 800 tell me exactly how many were half broken and then tell me that the trained lapd armorers did not know what they were doing they take any gun broken or not so shutup idiot lapd does not have armorers and they do not care if its broken you are so stupid and wrong its ridiculous these studies challenge the effectiveness of gun buyback programs because by their understanding the people who bring firearms to a police buyback event differ on the whole from those who commit gun violence at the same time the lapd stands buy its decision to continue hosting its gun buyback program because it reduces the raw number of firearms possessed by members of the general public oh no another source you moron https www thetrace org 2015 07 gun buyback study effectivness yeah a rocket launcher that cannot fire http latimesblogs latimes com lanow 2012 12 two rocket launchers in gun buy back inert lapd checking origins html they needed you there to guide them in what they feel is a threat to the public or not you are making things up again you have no idea what you are talking about actually i have proven you wrong with multiple sources right above your dumbass is making things up claiming lapd had armorers on site to check the guns etc you are a moron if you are a cop and you see somebody aiming a rocket launcher at you you are going to shit bricks and that person may end up dead the cops may not realize its inert or empty when its aimed at them so buying empty rocket tubes is not a bad idea you mentally retarded moron they are available on ebay you idiot laaws rockets were used by the cartels against the mexican army in juarez just a couple years ago a laaws rocket killed two guys in an apartment off of broadway in la in the early 70 they were black panther affiliates they were fucking around with it and it went off killing them both we are talking about inert rocket launchers idiot you do realize that right dummy and people that steal those do not steal them from homes but no you know better than police officers its all show the studies show that its bullshit too dumbass all a gun has to do is fire one time time kill somebody all a broken gun needs to do is make somebody believe its not broken when its aimed at their face in a liquor store yeah same with model guns that cannot shoot dumbass so you are just mad because your beloved guns will be melted down i do not care nobody does i actually do not care you are just an idiot and i want to make a fool out of you over and over till you cry let me make a fool out of you one last time the places with the strictest gun laws and even

aolsux00,another way to give illegals and the biggest violators an almost free pass interesting how there is such a double standard when it comes to enforcing laws for the average citizen vs illegals they can not pay tickets not get proper permits not pay taxes not follow food and safety laws sell whatever they want from a cart etc and get away with it when an american citizen or legal resident that pays the bills actually cannot do any of that and we do not call this discrimination if a white american had these privileges over other people everyone would be protesting and yelling discrimination ,0,LosAngeles

aolsux00,how can you come here and lie and feel good about yourself the problems i described above have very little to do with educating illegals the wholesale destruction of the public school system in arizona is going to have huge ramifications on hundreds of thousands or perhaps millions of students as we move forward i have a solution how about we stop wasting so much money and letting them steal it and overpay administrators so they actually have money to spend on the kids ever thought of that if we get rid of buses and the drivers we save a ton of money already this esa expansion is about wealthy individuals raiding the tax base that supports public education so their own children can go to the most expensive private schools in the state free of charge free of charge my ass do not sit here and fucking lie a good private school is at least 30 000 a year if its free of charge then the kids left over can go to private schools free of charge also and also the fucking parents of the rich kids are paying property taxes and a lot of it so its not free of charge and they are still paying a lot this is about schools falling to critical funding levels and being unable to properly compensate teachers get rid of illegals and they wo not be so broke until the teachers actually teach they do not deserved proper compensation i have been to great public schools and the teachers will still mostly shit my last school was in a neighborhood that no house was under 2 million some over 10m and the teachers were still shit this is about the destruction of teacher job security and the loss of the state most highly qualified and dedicated educators lying again they are not highly qualified or dedicated they are terrible teachers who do not really provide a quality education its rare that a winner becomes a teacher at a public school for 40k a year can you get a great education in arizona today sure you can if you happen to live in a high socioeconomic neighborhood near an incredibly high rated charter school that deliberately manipulates enrollment to keep out the bad kids lying again its mostly the student fault at crappy schools and the parents they could get almost the same education if they cared tried studied and had parents that told them its important they rather cause trouble ditch and become losers they do not have to manipulate enrollment to keep the bad kids out but make no mistake you are getting that education at the expense of thousands of students just like you who were unlucky enough to be born into poverty except the ones that live in poverty and try become successful and the rich ones that do not try become losers we should be doing what we can to lift up the poor and the disadvantaged we do plenty they do not want to help themselves you cannot help people that do not want help i am glad you got yours but kicking the ladder out for everyone still trying to climb is generally regarded as a dick move i did not kick the ladder you mentally retarded moron they did it to themselves the only dick is you that wants to blame everyone else maybe you are one of the losers who do not want to take responsibility dumbass liberal retard ,1,politics

zero proof for your anger and hatred towards liberals our views are based on science and facts they are driven by emotional anger and a sense of white supremacy actually this is far from the truth your views and opinions are based on emotions brainwashing and manipulation for example letting illegals in when it is clearly illegal based on its good to help poor people even though it hurts our

back advancing our nation with tons of crime that social justice lol increasing the wealth gap in these areas feminism where women want to take away men rights rather than equality socialism is a

to do this once again you are spreading lies the names of the parties change from era to era but it always been liberals dragging conservatives against their will into a better future actually people were better off 20 30 years ago especially the younger generation that was 18 30 now they are still living at home and struggling less jobs higher unemployment etc i am 32 i grew up in one of the in between eras where we all thought that compromise was a possibility but i am more and more realizing how mistaken i was about that it time once again for liberals and progressives to stop being nice and drag our country into the 21st century its time for you to learn how to think and not believe everything the liberal movement has brainwashed you with people are doing worse off not better but the simple fact of the matter is that conservatives just are not offering any good ideas any more yeah lettings illegals in was a great idea right conservatives has brought good ideas as well it like being in a group project with someone who did not read the book and expecting them to do their share of the work or being in a group project with someone that only lies and makes up data and

aolsux00,thanks,1,excel
aolsux00,bottom line is that they should be paying more maybe not a 1000 but more than they are paying maybe you drive in zero traffic in perfect conditions but what you are claiming is very high for a 2005 they claim 19 city 28 highway and those numbers are exaggerations with cheating yes they cheat and its well know like taping the windows so maybe you do all highway with zero traffic but bring your ass to la and you wo not get 15mpg in that car ,0,California
aolsux00,except that they have been ignoring both of them not just one of them ,1,California
aolsux00,many cars do not get anywhere close to 25 miles per gallon i have a medium sized car and i get 20 mpg and i do not get stuck in heavy or serious traffic often i do not even have a big engine your number is not the real average unless you are trying to take the average of what car manufacturers claim which is a complete lie ,0,California
aolsux00,you are a fool seriously you do not know what you are talking about other cities collect way less and have more than enough money and great roads we collect almost the most and have almost the worst roads they keep siphoning the money to a general fund and probably to the illegal immigrant fund,4,California
aolsux00,liberals do generalize them as that since they cannot defend anything that is against the way of thinking that theyve been brainwashed into ,1,California
aolsux00,ev users should pay much more than they are paying the damage to the road is equivalent to the same size and weight car ,2,California
aolsux00,it should be 10x more than that ,3,California
aolsux00,that the stupidest thing you can do give the companies all your driving data so they find 10 other reasons to charge you more they will tell you that you drive too fast brake too hard turn faster than you should etc and jack up your rate they wo not even tell you why and you wo not be able to argue it they will just tell you you are not a safe driver ,3,California
aolsux00,you need to realize that they would make that method cost the average person much more we are dealing with crooks that siphon off the money for other purposes like transferring it to the general fund or illegal immigrant fund how do you think we pay for illegals most the damage is done by big rigs anyways not our cars ,5,California

aolsux00,i am not saying all of it is good and it does create some high tech and high skilled jobs but it will definitely crush the poor people first and move its way up i welcome some automation for several reasons including not making prices get out of control due to high minimum wage for no to very low skilled jobs accuracy customer service and hopefully lower population in areas like los angeles if the no to low skilled jobs dry out many illegals will hopefully go back ,-3,California
aolsux00, so all these compounds are never covered by insurance so patients pay a cash price some do for some medications i just know at our pharmacy we do not bill and i know some people that have come in and asked have gone to other pharmacies that do ,1,pharmacy
aolsux00, do us pharmacies we tend to say chemist here make a lot of money on compounding if they decide to not bill insurance and take cash only usually yes i could make something like a testosterone cream that costs me probably less than 5 and sell it for 120 for a one mouth supply there were also some compounded items that some pharmacies got reimbursed from insurance companies for thousands that cost very little to make i just cannot remember what they are but i think they stopped paying out so much it not really done in uk pharmacies i think if a patient needs a compounded drug then it has to be ordered from a manufacturer they will make something that is not commercially available as a custom dose for just one patient that interesting what kind of stuff would be compounded in a america pharmacy and why do you think it is really necessary most of the time all kinds of stuff but its not very common testosterone creams gels etc custom mixes of creams for pain inflammation custom doses and mixes of thyroid medications hormones and some other stuff the problem is that drug companies only make certain doses that will work well for most people for thyroid hormones for example someone might need a dose that is in between 2 doses that are commercially available so compounding is beneficial to them they also do not make some things commercially that can only be purchased as a compound take a look here http ipscompounding com ips pain compounding the doctor can pick and choose ingredients that may target pain better than what is commercially available some more info here http www medicineshoppe com media images sites the 20medicine 20shoppe 0279 pain 20management 20compounding 20ideas ashx i do feel like my customers benefit from it but keep in mind only a very small percentage of my customers are prescribed compounded items ,2,pharmacy

aolsux00, i do not think you actually understand how drug dealing plays out in real life please explain because i think you are wrong there are good people that sell drugs and there are bad people that sell drugs its illegal and deadly therefore they are not good people i did not know criminals were great people and fucking heros it certainly attracts some types of people but again it does not always involve gangs and violence as is often portrayed in the media no not at all drug cartels do not exist gangs do not exist and there are grandmas selling drugs that will pick you up from the street and take you into their house and take care of you if you od right what a stupid argument ,1,NoStupidQuestions
aolsux00,no i actually do not and find them to be very necessary the issue is not even the job that they do its the fact that many have a sense of entitlement and wants more than what they deserve because of their extremely poor decisions if i was using your argument which is not valid at all i could say that you hate children since you expect them to suffer and think its okay for a parent to have many more children they can afford you cannot make a single valid argument that is not emotions based you like to throw around emotional bullshit like you hate the working class even though you know its a bullshit argument to try to get people to side with you try a real argument that is valid ,0,California
aolsux00,they do very little about gangs they do not even care about break ins cops came to my friends store that got broken into they said its low priority and nothing will come out of it since it not important even though they had this guy on camera not arresting people for property crimes because it too much paperwork and they wo not spending more than a couple months in jail is a joke the police chief needs to be fired he encouraging crime since he not penalizing it ,16,LosAngeles

aolsux00, brown has been the only person to even somewhat act like an adult with the states finances not spending money that needs to keep the infrastructure safe and it costing more is far from responsible i was reading about road repairs and i believe it was caltrans that said that for every 1 they spend in prevention they save 10 is brown doing that absolutely not all he wants to do is raise taxes instead of focusing on efficiency make the same people that are doing half the work they should be doing actually do work fire the worst workers i know that a hard thing for you to figure out that with your hysterics but with limited resources not everything can be done at once and things get priority based on ability to complete cost use and location limited my ass they have too many people working half as hard as they should he has extra money that he should be spending on infrastructure what limited resources you are the one whining about the cost of gas yet it not a 1 tax it currently in the mid thirty cents which is in line with most populated states in the nation you are an idiot most people whine about it you are just ignoring that because gas taxes have not kept pace with inflation or fuel efficiency our roads are bad because of deferred maintenance and overpopulation yes overpopulation so why is he letting millions of illegals in and why are we a sanctuary state let me teach you something since you are a retarded kid we pay more than almost every other state why do they have better roads they deal with inflation also and yet almost every other state pays less right and they have better roads right yes its been deferred because your corrupt piece of shit party needs to be locked up our taxes are in line with most other large states like pennsylvania new york new jersey and michigan yup and every single one of them has better roads ,0,California

aolsux00,only liberals are dumb enough to pay more than everyone else and get less they never want to cut down on fraud and waste ,-13,California
aolsux00,wtf are you saying what does this have to do with trump this has to do with power tripping brain washing corrupt liberal leaders who want to milk us for more and more and they get away with it this kind of bullshit and brainwashing only works in highly liberal states like california why do you think we also have the highest sales tax ,0,California
aolsux00, in your ideal world only you and people you trust would have guns i assume no i am ok with sane people that are going to use it for good purposes having guns i am definitely aware of the possibility of illegally carrying people but that more reason for you to want a way to protect yourself legally this is not about illegally carrying people those people carry either way i am worried about the wackos that previously did not carry because it was illegal that will carry if its legal those wackos may use it to hurt someone if they get really angry,1,CAguns
aolsux00,we pay more than almost every other state so explain why almost everyone pays less but has better roads i would love to hear the bullshit you are gonna say we are also one of the few states that extracts oil without taxing it what difference does this make it comes from overseas mostly and i am still paying more taxes than everyone else we pay 1 more a gallon than most states does not taxing extracting oil make any difference in this case no it does not change shit for me and you and this adds in fees on electric vehicles that utilize the road without paying for it charge them more why charge us more ,0,California
aolsux00, why would we impeach the one fiscally responsible governor we have had in the last decade i did not know ignoring roads bridges sewer systems etc to fake the numbers was the right thing to do yeah lets not maintain anything that should be maintained we pay more than other states because of our fuel quality regulation and because the market can bear it what does fuel quality regulations have to do with taxes a 12 cent tax is out of control you are a fool we already have some of the highest its an additional 12 cents why the do we pay so much already and have the absolute worst roads ,-13,California
aolsux00,we are near the very top of the list so yes you are right and i corrected that in my previous post so you are saying that a single penny is not stolen or wasted interesting how construction workers go have breakfast while on the clock its been on the news several times investigative reporters have caught them then how is it we have the worst roads when they collect more in california than most other states some of the money goes to a general fund http www mercurynews com 2015 06 02 roadshow how much gas tax money goes to california roads ,4,California
aolsux00, what it then boils down to is good people never being allowed to legally carry to protect themselves in this state i know and i hate it too i would love for more criminals like bank robbers to get stopped by someone that is legally carrying but in someplace like la i feel i could be wrong that it would cause more people to get hurt than it would help i definitely would give it out to people that leave work late in rough areas etc i guess i would have conditions on the license do not get me wrong i think in most other areas a ccw is a great thing i have just seen too much crazy shit in la even though i grew up in a great part of it ,1,CAguns
aolsux00,a sensible way how about impeaching brown that makes more sense we pay more taxes than almost any other state for gas they just need to use the money and stop stealing and wasting it or paying for other shit with it ,-6,California
aolsux00,yes we definitely need to but how about also cutting fraud and waste how about impeaching brown this is completely out of control we pay 1 a gallon than most other states ,-35,California
aolsux00,you are a puppet that okay with anything the existing money is being misappropriated we have the highest gas taxes in the country and the absolute worst roads and you are okay with them raising it even more we pay about 1 more per gallon than many states that means most people are paying at least 12 more than neighboring states each time they pump gas for many people thats about 50 a month more yet you want them to raise it even more what are you okay with next taxing the air we breathe ,-38,California
aolsux00, my point is that there are cases right now where they are not in the criminal justice system but are carrying illegally does that make you scared absolutely ,1,CAguns
aolsux00, gun control only works on people who do not break laws i think that applies 90 of the time but not always having a gun on you the whole day and having anger problems or being mentally ill increases the number of opportunities to use it inappropriately you are talking about sane people many if not most of the people in la especially in the poorer areas are wackos of course i would find it appropriate to give ccws to people that genuinely need it because they work in dangerous areas etc it would be great to give it to all sane and responsibly people but we do not really have a way to test for that i wish we did,1,CAguns
aolsux00, maybe i am wrong but i feel it takes a certain kind of person to go from stupid chest puffing to actual murder i would agree in most cases but not all just imagine if someone tries to fight me for example for me cutting them off and hits me first i defend myself and beat him down and he losing i do not see it as rare as him pulling a gun and using it sure in most cases it would end with him pulling the gun out but i feel in some cases they would pull the trigger ,1,CAguns
aolsux00, you act as if criminals and average people with anger problems are completely disjoint sets there will always be a large overlap between people with emotional problems and criminals i agree but there are plenty of crazy people with anger problems that have never been arrested or been to jail so they would still qualify instead we would just have to make more stringent policies on passing the ccl test sure but how do you really filter everyone you cannot i can take a personality test and know exactly every single answer that would make me look normal or dysfunctional many people can do the same thing its unfortunate that we have so many wackos i would love to get rid of tons of crazy people and ship them off someplace like they sent criminals to australia a long time ago but people are against that ,1,CAguns
aolsux00, you really feel that a person who has gone through the ccw process would be much more likely to pull a gun on you in an argument much more likely than the average person yeah since the average person does not carry a gun there are plenty of ccw people that have serious anger issues and the process does not change this or fix it i have read about several times where idiots with a ccw pulled a gun and got in trouble when there was not a real threat do you feel a person who pulls a gun on you in the street or in the gym wo not face any repercussions when someone is in the state of rage they do not think about repercussions in most cases do people that commit domestic violence stop and think they are going to jail almost never its an anger problem they cannot often control you think repercussions matter when you are dead you are fucking dead or have bullet holes in you and disabled sure it matters they get busted but it does not stop many people ,1,CAguns
aolsux00,its a shame they do not collect all the gang members and throw them in jail we need a law that makes every single gang member in a gang responsible for every crime the gang has committed ,2,CAguns
aolsux00,nope because when someone loses control they do not think about stuff like that its different if a robber thinks i have a gun and i will use it against him versus some asshole on the street that will shoot and leave within 10 seconds other people wo not be able to respond or do anything especially in liberal california where you do the right thing and go to jail since liberals think criminals should have more rights than the average person ,1,CAguns
aolsux00,yes but much less so than me paying 15 or 20 cents for every gallon ,2,California
aolsux00,this is where you have no idea what you are talking about you are talking about criminals i am talking about average people with anger problems the average person with anger problems does not carry a gun and does not break the law on purpose until they completely lose control the average criminal carries a gun and does not care about the law plenty of concealed carry license owners have gotten themselves in trouble for pulling out a gun when it absolutely was not necessary sometimes things just escalate and people anger does as well and we have a lot of angry ass people these people do not wake up and think they are going to lose control of their anger that day but it sometimes happens luckily most these people do not carry guns daily if they did we would have more problems and more people would die its not planned and its not legal so many of these people do not carry guns daily the guys getting out of the car beating the shit out of other drivers people fighting in parking lots etc ,0,CAguns
aolsux00,i can and i am a subscriber on this sub and have a few guns of my own and i definitely believe in gun rights this may not apply to all of california but sure as hell does to los angeles in my opinion here goes in la we have a lot more lunatics than most other areas even in a wealthier area like mine because there is tons of trash mixed in either they work in the area or drive through the area etc i am sure i would have a gun pulled on me more than once by a lunatic for some stupid shit like honking at someone to prevent an accident i have had people at my gym want to fight for me asking them not to slam the weights as hard as possible keep in mind i am not a skinny guy i would have broken some of those guys in half but just image how they would act if they had a gun they would think they are even tougher la is the melting pot but its also the trash pot i am not saying that i would have been shot but possibly but some lunatic that has no criminal record could definitely pull a gun if they were allowed to carry one with them everywhere and at all times this is the classic case of people that are pieces of shit ruining things for us normal people that are not crazy i definitely feel safer from wackos people here have no self control and are extremely angry ,-9,CAguns

aolsux00, mainly want to point out that being a legal citizen does not magically make you a capable driver i agree most drivers in los angeles are terrible being illegally in any country does not mean you all of a sudden you lose your ability to do something depends on what although i do want to throw in that the irs does not give two shits about where their money is coming from if five illegals use one social all that means is the irs is receiving money from people they otherwise would not yes but its their duty to report it rather than ignore it i am sorry i seriously do not mean to be rude but how does using a ssn literally taking over someone actual job it does though if you are not legally allowed to work in the country you are taking a job someone else who is legal would have to do you could argue that they create jobs because of more people being here but its still a job that would be available to a legal resident and not an illegal if the job had a hard time being filled the company business would be forced to pay more to a legal resident an illegal person does not all of a sudden get an office job because they chose the ssn belonging to someone working in an office in some cases they do for example if we are talking about an illegal that is mexican that is in an area where everyone or almost everyone speaks spanish they would get the job and the employer would not be scared to hire them because they do not look like an illegal because they have a social they do take many of the fast food jobs the big chains have no problem hiring them when they look legal and provide a social your thought process seems to be over reaching just to connect things not really i explained how it works i explained how it happens in the real world for everything you put on the table i have seen it happen and no i did not downvote you if that what you think ,-1,California
aolsux00, of course conservatives unable to understand facts that go against their narrative ignore the fact that undocumented immigrants pay more in taxes than they receive in benefits that because you are not counting their children that are not counted as illegals you moron because they were born here they get welfare for those kids they did not pay for the childbirth or hospital they go to school etc so in the end you are wrong and they cost us tons of money please provide evidence that these illegals the few that pay income tax actually pay more than 10k a year per child they have since its at least that much to school their children at the minimum ,0,California
aolsux00, they are taking our jobs they are criminals of course focusing on mexicans neither is true actually you are wrong there is tons of evidence that they are http www immigrationworksusa org uploaded file the 20thorny 20economics 20of 20illegal 20immigration pdf and they are criminals for being here illegally many commit identity theft and or they commit tax evasion immigrants on average are less likely to commit crimes than american born citizens not true just because they do not get caught for petty theft and other crimes it does not mean they are less likely to commit crimes they also commit identity theft and or tax evasion year after year which is a separate count for each year driving without a license etc and research has proven over and over that they are often taking jobs that are not only vital for our economic well being often does not mean always so they take plenty of jobs especially the ones committing identity theft but jobs that americans flat out refuse to do no matter how high the wage is wrong you have to pay others a higher wage but once it goes high enough someone else will do it so you are lying again even if they offer wages as high as 25 bucks an hour americans wo not do that kind of work prove it liar you are so full of shit its ridiculous without these immigrant workers who are often undocumented we would without a doubt face a major food crisis unless you want to pay 5 dollars for a single apple you want these workers here not really we can let some come in on work visas to farm i would love to see the evidence of 5 an apple you are so full of shit its ridiculous once again you are wrong like always https www youtube com watch v tbcwzcjxr i automation is coming and is already changing everything there a narrative that these people are freeloaders when they usually pay taxes without the ability to utilize tax funded programs which ones pay taxes the ones that stole other people identities there are more that do not pay taxes also tons get welfare for their kids and tons of other benefits i would like to see some that pay 10k a year in taxes for each child they have since that the minimum it costs to school them so in the end even if they are paying taxes they are not covering the cost of their kids we need immigrants we have too many people already i would like to see evidence that we need new ones demonizing them and using false stereotypes to justify treating them as subhuman is harmful and yes often racist you have not provided a single shred of evidence that any of the stereotypes are false ,2,NoStupidQuestions
aolsux00,its controversial and it should not be at all its because you have a bunch of people that are not using their brains because they have been manipulated so badly by liberals that they cannot even see straight these illegals got too comfortable and got jobs here had several kids here etc and liberals like to reward criminals rather than punish them so liberal broken california gave them drivers licenses buy cars etc so yeah its going to be a hard change but its a hard change for any criminal to be taken out where they live just like a bank robber has a hard time when they go to jail its not going to be easy but they deserve to be kicked out we are not even throwing them in jail so they are getting off super easy they are not even being punished for the tons of other crimes they commit like identity theft and tax evasion ,0,NoStupidQuestions

aolsux00,no it was so good not hearing from you that i thought you would leave me alone finally but then you decided to be annoying again but they also say the reduced competition for low skilled jobs was a boon for some native born construction and agricultural workers who got jobs or raises and that the departures also saved the state money on education and health care this is a wonderful thing gordon hanson a university of california at san diego economist who has studied the issue for the nonpartisan council on foreign relations has detailed how large scale immigration undermines wages for low skilled workers yup i have said this too proponents of doing more to curb illegal immigration say the mass departures helped the state economically in several ways government spending on health care and education for illegal immigrants and their america born children dropped wages for plasterers landscapers farmworkers and other low skilled laborers jumped because of scarcity according to employers and federal data yup everything i said before even if the size of the state s gdp decreased the decrease in immigration redistributed income from employers to employees particularly at the bottom end of the labor market best thing ever since 2007 about 200 000 undocumented immigrants have left the state which has a population of 6 7 million until obama came and changed things the cost of illegal immigration has been a big political issue in arizona for years but pinning down exactly how much it costs the state and how much is collected from illegal immigrants through taxation is surprisingly hard to do the state doesn t count it estimates vary widely depending in part on debatable issues such as whether to include the cost of educating america born children of illegal immigrants you have to count it since they would not be here if their criminal parents did not come here in 2004 the federation for american immigration reform a washington based group that seeks to reduce immigration calculated that undocumented workers cost arizona taxpayers more than 1 billion a year for education medical care and incarceration after subtracting the estimated taxes they pay another slap in your face with your own document lol do you really want me to keep reading damn just imagine how much more it is in 2016 2017 and across all states these days construction landscaping and agriculture industries long dependent on migrants complain of worker shortages while competition for some jobs eased there were fewer job openings overall for america born workers or legal immigrants this is the opposite of what you have been saying dude i have not even finished page 2 i think this is enough for now i do not want to keep embarrassing you with your own document ,1,inthenews

aolsux00, while it was not the first thing you said i wanted to address your liberals and personal responsibility comment i am really not sure that a defensible stance here just like as a conservative i find issues with numerous conservative and republican backed policies i think lumping all liberals into a little convenient box that makes them sound silly is maybe a bit disingenuous not unless you want to admit that all ideological conservatives are greedy and selfish too i would not make that claim and i think you would not either of course what i said does not apply to all of them but many of them have the same beliefs and lack personal responsibility they make poor decisions but want to blame others or the system sure the system is horrible and corrupt but there is a chance for example they chose not to get educated but its somehow not their own fault its everyone else fault it was not trayvon martin fault even though he attacked zimmerman and beat him mma style apparently criminals have more rights than non criminals no one is arguing that its not harder for poor people to get educated it is but most of them choose to make the worst decision possible when there are tons of other options available the system helps poor people and gives more handouts to poor people than anyone else some can even argue its an uneven playing field we used to have affirmative action and they still could not compete even though they were put ahead of everyone else even if they have lower grades not all the people competing were ultra rich plenty were from middle or lower middle class families that also had to work and go to school at the same time and could not afford private tutors plenty of people come from other countries and do not speak the language but choose to get educated its not harder for someone that does not speak the language and is also poor now one major issue i have with your comments on personal responsibility this is not the same as buying a taco health care is complicated i was talking about in general many people choose to make the stupidest decision possible and blame others especially liberals we have more free information than ever people choose not to be resourceful most normal people are not capable of wading through or understanding complex medical terminology and reading and understanding the fine print is frequently not a strong point then they should not sign up i ask questions i never sign anything without reading it and asking questions and doing my own research they should do the same i cannot sit here and blame banks for the idiots that took interest only loans out same thing you mentioned several things like cancer that could be excluded that are serious something like that would not be in the fine print it would be pretty clear and about the high deductible plans with very little benefits well we have those now anyways your list of probably is not going to happen type of stuff defies logic if you spread the cost of a service over a smaller number of people who are more likely to use the service the cost to each individual is guaranteed to increase period that simple logic using the common example if you have 100 people buying into a pool to cover against the possibility of an expensive event and statistically only 20 of those people will have that event happen the cost is relatively low to each person if you change the pool by allowing people to pick and choose and only those at high risk choose to buy in suddenly you have a pool of 20 or maybe 30 who are all likely to need coverage suddenly the cost per individual increases dramatically because you end up needing about the same amount of coverage but the risk is spread over few people who are all likely to need it this is bad for the individual and for society at large though it benefits those who choose not to take the coverage further because those 20 people will all need the service they will essentially be paying full price plus they will be paying for the insurance company to administer the plan overhead it fiscally smarter to just opt out for them too and pay out of pocket except this economic calculation is never as clear in real life in large part because health care costs are incredibly opaque again as a pharmacist or other healthcare professional you should be especially aware of this if you are not sure i challenge you to look at the difference between how much cvs charges a patient out of pocket for 7 levofloxacin 500 versus how much they pay versus how much they accept as reimbursement from insurance through a pbm not only is this information not readily available to consumers but the actual figures are a bit disconcerting i understand how it works i just disagree with it i think it should be a choice i think what needs to be focused on is fraud as a pharmacist you should know that it happens at many if not most independents many here in los angeles would never be able to survive with high rents serious competition from chains and low reimbursements why not crack down on fraud a friend of a friend was just recently caught he stole millions got to sell his pharmacy the customer list to a chain and got to keep every penny he stole he did not lose his house or anything else either he went to jail for about 6 months millions of doctors do unnecessary tests or fraud all day long why is nothing done why are not insurance companies fighting drug companies they negotiate with hospitals and bully everyone else why am i allowed to sign up for insurance today abuse it and cancel next month if i have pre existing conditions there should be a waiting period if some of these things were changed it would save much more money than what you are talking about and would cut costs i do not believe in bullying

aolsux00, the whole idea of insurance is based on the many paying into a system so there is a large pool of money to draw from to pay for medical problems for those enrolled yes but the problem is that some people do not want it at least for some years of their life and should not be forced to get it if they want to take the risk let them everyone will need medical attention at some point in their life true but if a 20 year old cannot afford it and feels like they do not need it for a few years why should they be penalized it only fair they pay in fair to who if they are healthy its not fair to them or they just to take the risk forcing them or penalizing them definitely is not fair to them it was never a requirement before if you let everyone chose to not pay or only pay when they are old or never pay and then let the hospital eat the bill and pass the cost into other patients the whole system falls apart and is useless it worked before they did forced it sure some people got screwed but thats a risk they wanted to take hospitals did not start charging less because more people signed up the more people that do not buy it the higher and more unobtainable insurance becomes more people bought it and it became even more expensive i understand your argument but some people should be allowed to take the risk they can pay cash for much of their needs its only when something serious happens to them that it becomes a problem if you want to blame someone for hospitals eating the bill blame the illegals that have made some hospitals go out of business the main problem is pbms making profits off these premiums make it single payer and not for profit the cost needs to be driven down and insurance companies should be bullying drug companies and other medical related expenses that overcharge they should also focus on evidence based medicine rather than covering the newest drugs when sometimes they are not as effective as some less expensive medications i would love for it to be non profit ,-3,pharmacy
aolsux00, that out of the way like essentially any insurance plan the point of insurance is that everyone who is likely to one day use it buys in and buys in early you hope you never need catastrophic coverage but you have insurance in case everyone needs to buy in before they get sick and then pay into the pool for it to work this is true whether it is run by private or public systems you do not necessarily have to have it as you make it seem for your whole life its more of a risk thing and some people want to take the risk or feel there is less risk at certain ages to not having it for example a 20 year old may think he is better off saving money for a few years and paying cash for anything if needed the thing with health insurance is that eventually nearly everyone will need it unless you die early from some kind of random and quickly fatal accident or you just want to get sick and not get treatment yes eventually but i never said do not have it your whole life or even most of it for some people at certain ages its a backbreaking expensive its not like it got any cheaper when they made it a requirement it is their duty and mine and yours too to pay in to the system before insurance company loving obama it was not a requirement f you leave in the bits about pre existing conditions but you allow people to choose not to buy in you are creating a situation where it is fiscally smart on the part of the individual to wait till you are really sick to buy insurance that why you have a long waiting period for pre existing conditions its not perfect but its an in between way of doing it people with pre existing conditions should definitely pay much more first people will end up buying cheaper policies not realizing that they are not covered for stuff and learn the hard way that something that is their own fault since you are a conservative you know what personal responsibility means unlike liberals this issue is not just about medical insurance people cheap out on tons of different types of insurance car home fire flood business etc and pay the price sometimes for example if i have low limits on my car insurance and i run into a bunch of cars or a house they should be responsible for their decisions suddenly only people planning to use certain types of coverage will buy it which negates the whole point of insurance which is to spread the cost of expensive stuff evenly across a broad pool for some yes but this probably is not going to apply to most fundamentally if you truly believe people should pick and choose what they want coverage for you are really making an argument against insurance conceptually if i only choose those things i need coverage for and only when i need them that not insurance that fee for service we have a big problem in this country people love seeing doctors and using insurance for everything insurance should only be for something serious it should only cover serious shit and for everything else they can pay a negotiated price discounted for urgent care or doctor visits payable 100 by the user keep in mind the price would be lower than the cash price a doctor would charge someone without insurance ,-8,pharmacy

aolsux00,i made you wrong in your first post but you continue to act like a smartass so let me make you wrong again lets start off with this if you live in a city where you do not need to drive people still drive even though they can ride a bike take the bus take the metro etc especially in los angeles what a dumb comment from you an embarrassing one at best you are a funny man see the thing is that people that want to ride a bike to work do it whether there is a lane or not whether they have to go on the street with no bike lane or on the sidewalk lets assume a small number of people 5 do switch over because of the bike lane now there is only 1 lane for cars instead of two so there is almost double the amount of cars per lane meaning they will be in the lane longer and things will be much much slower so the damn cars are going to stay idle some of the time or move slower and still give off pollution see how that works a car that is running even if idling still gives off pollution they will be moving slower as well also giving off pollution so it wo not reduce traffic it will significantly increase it even you can understand this i hope so more traffic more pollution more angry people more wasting of gas more global warming see how that works i would love to hear a single response where you do not make a fool out of yourself i do not think that possible though,-10,LosAngeles

aolsux00, you really are a piece of shit and you need to watch your stinking fucking mouth lol i upset you poor baby maybe you should see a psychologist for your anger problems they are illegals freeloaders unskilled and uneducated etc and those are all facts for 99 99 of them so i am going to say it all day long whether you cry about it or not and they dont legally belong here so if you want to be a liberal sissy you are going to have to deal with the fact that we have laws in this country and they are being enforced and all my responses are in direct retort to your suggestion that illegal immigrants are ruining the country on the contrary we are paying slave wages and making money off the backs of people and reaping the benefits in lower product cost no actually they are not illegals cause more traffic more pollution use up our limited resources cause rent prices and all other prices to go up they also commit crimes did you reply to a single one of them nope because you know everything i said is true increased car insurance prices increased medical costs making hospitals go out of business etc some people have lost jobs to them they have had their identities stolen some people have even become homeless because of them all those are facts as well schools are overloaded because of them they reduce individual attention disrupt class and generally do not become shit they in most cases never go to college you cannot defend against the fact that they are collecting thousands a month in benefits like child care school esl classes food programs at schools food stamps government housing insurance etc again with the they meanwhile the irs report referenced by your shit article says nothing about illegal immigrants you are adding in your own fuckwad way of jumping to conclusions and you are source is the washington times seriously man your face must really hurt from getting bitch slapped so many times this time its from forbes and mentions illegal immigrants you are an embarrassment they need to get the fuck out of this country https www forbes com sites robertwood 2016 04 13 irs admits it encourages illegals to steal social security numbers for taxes 2261a1514c04 can you imagine if there were a population of unschooled children running around the us i would send them back with their parents they do not belong here please for the love of god provide more education to ensure that people are actually prosperous and contribute to society actually i would like to see how many of them become things like doctors or lawyers they ruin school for others not many of them go to college its a waste of money that could be spent on american children that are actually going to become a more productive part of society now there is a clear and concise interpretation of the problem there is a demand for low wage workers a supply of low wage work but no viable program for the two to be connected you really like being bitch slapped lol the demand and need is only in agriculture and its diminishing with automation we can let more in on guest worker programs that something that can be fixed so what that guy said does not change or mean anything in this case because there is an easy fix but we would only apply to fix to agriculture capitalism finds a way but you demonize the worker and not the employer for that fuck you if you were not so much of a moron you would know my exact position which you do not who said i would not punish employers i would fine employers 50k year per illegal immigrant they hire i would also punish landlords and i would punish morons like you that aid illegal immigrants employers would not hire illegals at low wages if they were not available they would just raise wages to the point where our own people would take those jobs see how that works dummy if millions of illegal immigrants were deported you would have massive labor shortages said university of michigan labor economist donald grimes easy solution you do not get rid of them all at once you do it in stages automation is also taking over so its not an issue your quote which does not even come up on google does not come with a date either it could have been said 10 years ago but either way automation is about to replace half the people working at mcdonalds in the next couple years we have tons of automation replacing workers in other fields that could fill the jobs as well you just got shut down again also with 20 million illegals gone you would need slightly less employees as well does your dumb ass know better than a labor economist the answer is of course the fuck not lol automation its coming there is no argument against it no one disagrees not even elon musk or bill gates http www cnbc com 2016 11 04 elon musk robots will take your jobs government will have to pay your wage html https www engadget com 2017 02 19 bill gates calls for robot tax the liberal economist just got bitch slapped too cause you are a dick wipe who should have been left as a stain on back seat of that shitty car you were conceived in lol listen my parents are not cheap trash like yours your parents probably had you when they were 16 in the back seat and unmarried my parents were married and did it in a bed but somehow avoided becoming the abortion you so rightly deserve lol you are poor dumb and cannot make an argument that does not get destroyed i provide value to this country you do not allow me to conclude by saying that its a comfort to me to know that no one truly loves you and if there is a god than you will have been prevented from laying seed on this earth and while i wish you no real harm it will be joyous day celebrated by millions of dancing happy illegal immigrants when your hateful vapid lineage ends with you now piss off lol its funny how mexico does not want illegals in their country and severely punishes them but they want us to take their trash oh wait its because illegals send billions back home a year taking money out of our economy listen i will gladly pay for you to go to a psychologist actually a psychiatrist as well since you definitely need some meds maybe even an insane asylum because you have no control over your emotions and you are completely out of control lol you are trying to argue something you are wrong about and losing you are arguing with zero logic and all emotion that why you are

aolsux00, you may want to take your own advice here the fact of the matter is that most illegals do pay into the system and cannot get social security benefits out of it are you stupid or something your own numbers prove that they dont your numbers say 3 1m pay in but there are over 11m there are probably way more than 11 million probably more like 20 million they may not get social security but but income taxes pay for many many different things which most of them do not pay say like michael greenstone phd and adam looney phd did then you would find out that according to their study on immigrants plenty of other sources say something completely different they cost us 113 billion a year from a study thats was on cnn your favorite station but they dont put nearly anything close to that in http ireport cnn com docs doc 469465 then let not forget about car taxes gas taxes sales tax etc so what most the money comes from income tax which they do not pay i was talking about income tax the whole time its like there are 4 friends at someones house you order 2 pizzas the 3 legal friends put in 7 each but the illegal puts in 1 that whats happening administration also said that they withehld around 420 billion from the earnings of immigrants who are not in a position to claim benefits most of it was not from illegals many die and never take out either you are not making a point they are using more than they are putting in furthermore payroll taxes are more often than not paid by the employer that not what everyone else is saying lets see some proof for california also i do not get how suddenly these people being paid under the table so they do not have to use a ssn or itin suddenly are becoming identity thieves getting ssns and itins the ones that are using other people socials which is almost all of the ones working legal jobs are identity thieves its extremely common very very few use itins actually ,0,inthenews

aolsux00, there the spirit of the law and the letter of the law learn the difference between the two i know you have got a loose grasp on anything that remotely complex but the fact is law and morality are we are talking about the law you have a moral issue go tell mexico that the country that does not want their own people and has the cops murder them we do not owe mexicans or south americans anything we do not have to support them you are oversimplifying things because you cannot have a more elaborate conversation about morals and the details of policy nope just another thing you say when you do not have an answer you fail to discuss it and ask questions because you know you are wrong if i am oversimplifying ask for details or provide to the discussion not try to shut it down but you clearly do it because you know you are wrong and do not have a valid argument it hilarious when stupid people on the internet start talking on discussion boards even though they have no clue what they are talking about there is something called projection you are stupid so you call people stupid its you my friend someone that has been wrong about just about every single thing but are not you one of those individualist types who all about everyone doing things for themselves doing things for other people is after all socialism they are adults like you said they should be able to take care of themselves and support their family that is why they came here right so why are they leeching off of us by signing up for every single government program more oversimplifications you just keep on repeating these things to yourself it a hateful mantra that you use to make yourself feel about your own failures in life lol see the thing is if they had any of the above they would not be so poor and doing so poorly in their own country when tons of people are still there and much more successful lets just assume they are in a shitty area if they have a brain if they have a skill if they are educated if they can count to 10 in their own language they would be able to get work in another part of the country in almost every case but they cannot ,1,LosAngeles
aolsux00, their own country might not see the problem with oversimplifications and generalizations they are useless because obviously there are some illegals who do not have that option its not an oversimplification if it is why not ask questions and get answers you just do not know what to say so that what you say to attempt to shut down the argument you play this game everytime you are losing if they can come here they can move someplace else in their country much easier seems like their own people do not want them either they do not want their own trash they want them out of their country not wrong it still 4 of the entire population obviously they are more concentrated near sanctuary cities the part you are completely 100 wrong is that they do not have an effect they absolutely do and they ruin sanctuary cities what kind of argument is that why would i have to pay for them if they are adults they can go make money its the kind of argument that is about to eat you alive if they are adults and they can go make their own money then why do not they they freeload off of us and get tons of government benefits see your whole argument just fell apart why do taxpayers have to pay for them when you wo not oh i understand you do not make much money so you expect people who do to completely support them right they terk er jerbbbbbs are you high wtf does this even mean lol christ im weak at how much like a school bully you sound like it like debating with a 6 year old never was a bully just smarter than you i do feel like you are a 6 year old because you cannot make valid points you go by emotion rather than using your brain but i guess it worse you are probably a grown ass man which means you are just an angry and inadequate manchild lol would you really like to compare lives or success or money or education did not think so explain i have explained this to you in several posts but i will go a bit more in depth you fine every employer 50k per employee per year for hiring illegals they would have lets say 3 months to replace their current illegal immigrant with a legal resident they would use a system we already have called e verify to check the status to see if they are a legal resident then you would fine landlords for letting illegal immigrants move in or stay with someone that is legal you could let them use the same system or similar system people that let illegals stay with them get jail time if caught you also do not let illegal immigrants send their children to schools schools would kick them out no they are literally encountering fewer people crossing department of homeland security fiscal reports prove that obviously they were way understaffed that trump was able to hire multiple times more border patrol people i forgot the numbers but i think he tripled them many do because their employers require it require what they can use a tin number to pay taxes if illegal ,1,LosAngeles

aolsux00, it not a waste to use money on illegals if you want to combat waste look into our massively inflated defense budget or look in lost tax revenue due to corporate tax evasion yes it is their own country can take care of them the american people think its a waste you got a problem with it you take care of them and give them money our defense budget is a separate matter but these people are a waste we do not want or need a lot of people in this country cost us money and are burdens in some way americans in poverty are just as much of a burden on the system they cost us and taxpayers money and there 4x as many of them as illegals yup and we can use the money on them not some illegal freeloading people who are from a different country that have zero to offer us and that we do not need how do you make them leave without rounding them up easy fine employers and landlords use the e verify program we have explain how you cannot just send letters to them all asking them to leave you need to send people to make sure they do cannot just send one two people and not just any two people that two ice agents they make upwards of 96k a year at least two why do you ask the same question twice you fine employers and make them use e verify you also fine landlords that house them and not allow their kids to get an education how is this costing very little what if the people wo not go willingly what if they are not home what if you cannot find them what if they leave and being illegal have no problem assuming a new identity and getting new fake documents what i said does not cost that much if they do not go willingly they will then you keep on making things harder and harder for them we are not searching for them dummy what if they leave and being illegal have no problem assuming a new identity and getting new fake documents e verify works instead of throwing them out track them down and make them become citizens and start paying taxes why cannot we do that they are already here it easier for everyone no its not tracking them down and making them pay taxes is free lol no we do not they owe us so let make them do the paperwork and get all legal and start paying taxes why cannot we do that because they wo not ever they will still freeload and have a greater ability to do it they are poor unskilled dumb etc they will leech off the government more if they are allowed to see how that works yet you are willing to go to much greater lengths and spend much more time money and resources altering things to make it allegedly harder for them nope it will cost us much much much less than the benefits they suck from this country in a single year this shit taxpayers have to pay for um i have made numerous arguments i am not being sneaky at all i try to bring everything out into the open and be as clear and up front as i can you did not answer the question i had and said complete bullshit that was not related that means you do not have an answer or argument empty and unimaginative attempts to psych me out i guess completely off base how am i getting caught caught in your bullshit and manipulation game of changing the subject when you do not have an answer they are not coming in to freeload they want to have a better life they are not gonna get that by freeloading are they absolutely they freeload they have a ton of children and collect a ton of benefits that freeloading many immigrants have skills those that do not can learn and their children born here are all just as able as other american born children to acquire skills by growing up no they do not they are unskilled workers that can be replaced the same day that why they get under minimum wage if mama and papa immigrant do not come to the usa their kids are not born here and do not grow up to be productive members of society many are not productive anyways and they are committing more crimes this is meaningless us and them type mentality we are all still here working and paying to live here its not meaningless because its mexicos problem not ours well it wont be when we throw them back over they are not really paying much they are freeloading a whole lot though i help the poor as often as i can whether it giving them change or showing them some dignity or giving them food or donating to my local church food pantry yeah yeah thats pennies and garbage you do not want let me see you give 500 a month and then come talk to me these leeches consume a ton of my tax money i cannot open my door to them because i live in a studio with my girlfriend and legally we cannot have 3 people living in here if i had space and money however i do one day want to create low cost but dignified and solidly built housing for people well guess what many people do not have the money either or do not want them in their community where they do not belong but they have to pay for it they are forced to pay for them when they should not have to oversimplification proof that you do not have an argument when i start bringing up the complexities and the realities you backtrack lol you said they do not cause any problems i am saying they do and there is a ton of proof the biggest problem is them leeching off the government but they also increase rent prices prices on just about everything else commit crimes etc ,2,LosAngeles
aolsux00, they were in life or death situations that you apparently do not think exists in the world why would they risk their lives to sneak into the country on a shitty boat not everyone is in that situation actually most are not we are all legal citizens now and contribute to our communities and society that the difference between you and them they continue to have kids they cannot afford and get government benefits ,1,LosAngeles
aolsux00, those babies are americans as full of potential as any other american born babies but if the illegal parents were not here illegally they wouldn t be born here they do not belong here create a legal pathway for them to get ss and then they will be taxpaying citizens why cannot we legalize and integrate and tax them there is a way to tax them its called a tin they do not use it they continue to cheat us more alleged anecdotal evidence low income welfare recipients food stamp users and freeloaders are eligible for this program ,1,LosAngeles
aolsux00,hah prove me wrong on something that right you cannot loser,2,LosAngeles
aolsux00,everyone in the world wants help yet do you help them do you spend a ton of money every month donating to african indian or other adults and children when was the last time you sent money to a poor mexican family in mexico that you dont know that right you have not done shit for them you just want the rest of us to do it we have our own people our own problems and its not our responsibility to take care of everyone else ,1,LosAngeles
aolsux00, for many illegals it is they realize they cannot build a life where they are that their children will grow up poor and uneducated when a family or individual is making the choice to illegally immigrate into america and attempt to start a life with all the obstacles that face illegals it is most certainly life and death to a certain degree plenty of people move because there is much better opportunity elsewhere and they thought they would be able to get away with it since many people have for 20 years their own country has better parts than the part they live in they can move to those parts we do not illegals make up less than 4 of the entire population they mathematically are not able to cause as much suffering as you are acting like they are wrong in many cities they have a much larger presence like 20 in california and ny http abcnews go com us wirestory immigrants us illegally nyc la areas 45377947 your arguments are so stupid my family and i have hosted students from other countries at least half a dozen times in my lifetime why would illegal immigrants need to be taken care of by americans they are not infants they are illegal immigrants that was not the point you would not host an illegal family pay for them equal to the benefits they take from our government and take full responsibility for them we should not have to either we do not even want them here t not much of a burden it would be a far greater burden on taxpayers to pay for the government to try to deport 11 million people or spend tens of billions on a wall when southern border crossings are at an all time low wrong stupid answer from a moron again we would not need to deport all of them we just change a few laws and they will run back border crossers getting caught are at an all time low because obama did not have enough agents give illegals a pathway to citizenship and they will become taxpayers how is that a bad thing then we have more taxpayers they can pay taxes legally without citizenship they just choose not to ,2,LosAngeles
aolsux00, language does not matter hell around these parts spanish is more prevalent in many areas no need to start insulting because you realize you are being proven wrong you have not proven anything wrong by saying spanish is more prevalent yes english does matter since almost everyone speaks the language but this is america for decades we have prided ourselves on letting more people in and being a melting pot legals yes it does not make the law disappear because you want it make an argument that does not cause people to laugh at you and there nothing wrong with giving illegals a legal way to attain citizenship there a legal way to do it anyway just because they were not in a position to do it does not mean they should be run out of the country there is plenty wrong with giving criminals and freeloaders anything at all no illegal immigrant is doing that all of their costs are still here in america they are putting in by paying rent by eating by working even if they are not paying taxes they are still consumers are you stupid they sent billions back home they are taking money from our government and our people it does not matter if they spend part of it here they are freeloaders many millions more crimes are committed by american citizens yeah so we do not need illegals adding to that they do not belong here yet they do not respect the land people or laws it wo not help in any substantial way prime age employment is at an all time low and has been since after the 2008 crash it shows no sign of recovering and due to globalization and automation it only going to get worse wrong you kick the illegals out people will have to take some of those jobs persecuting one of the weaker subsets of the population in the vain attempt to get back a handful of jobs that will likely be gone in less than a decade is not a smart use of time money or resources criminals should be persecuted especially when they stole jobs and should never had gotten them how so education is poor when schools are underfunded not when children of illegal immigrants are in classes they are just as capable of learning as any american born child i can tell you did not learn how to think or argue in class you are a fine example illegals are kids that schools need to teach and that costs money that our underfunded schools dont have they are not as capable of learning because first of all many do not speak english at all or well enough and second they do not get the help from their parents ess than 4 of the population and you are talking like there gonna be some huge changes yeah in areas where they are 20 it makes a huge difference some areas are much higher and throwing blanket accusations at immigrants for the crime in the streets and even the fucking traffic christ have the responsibility to not just blame another group for all your problems they get blamed because they do not belong here just like you do not ,2,LosAngeles
aolsux00, did not think i had to google for you instead of accusing me of being wrong like an idiot how about trying to verify if what i said was right second the removal numbers were driven by the dramatic decrease in those apprehended at the border in fy 2015 337 117 the second lowest apprehension number since 1972 reflecting a lower level of obama wanted them in and he did not have enough border patrol so of course less were caught it does not prove a damn thing how taxpayers are going to be paying for a 16 billion dollar wall when they costs us 100b a year its going to save us money http abcnews go com business illegal immigrants cost us 100 billion year group story id 10699317 whatever it is the wall costs us less than one year of having them here well we have got an employment problem in this country why not employ more patrol agents does not make sense and is not required given the lower level of attempted illegal migration at our borders obama hired tons of government workers yet decreased patrol agents your numbers do not prove a damn thing because less agents also means less people caught what are you talking about what about the wall street bankers who defrauded a nation those people have political connections i am talking about the average person average criminals get caught and do not get rewarded for their crimes criminals are criminals if you are here illegally and that was your only choice but you still have not committed any felonies or anything then all you are guilty of is bypassing bureaucracy identity theft is often a felony its still a crime you cannot defend a criminal not being punished unless you are a moron like yourself people are still people we have not devolved to be less smart in fact we are slowly getting smarter ahhh you are an illegal too they are morons no brain no education do not think about the future worthless morons is what 90 are they are people but they do not belong here how big or small does matter when making decisions about government and the livelihoods of citizens how big or how small something is does matter go tell that to mexico if you want to talk about livelihood and these people are not citizens they are freeloading illegals freeload how if they are in la they are still paying the outrageous cost of living that everyone else is freeloading off taxpayers and the government getting benefits using resources they do not pay into or do not pay enough into etc increasing traffic section 8 housing food stamps free insurance etc how can innocent children in public school would estroy it the kids in public schools are all americans they are not destroying it they are suffering because in many places the government is defunding it its not the american children its the illegal children illegals are not americans they would not be so broke if the illegals were not there illegal kids often cause other problems and are more violent ignorant ramblings of someone with misplaced and irrational hatred i do not know if you are stupid easily brainwashed and susceptible to fearmongering or just a bigot i have proved the fact that they are criminals cost us tons of money etc no question about it you just do not want to accept facts hey your mom did such is life except i am more educated than you smarter more talented contribute more look better and make as much money as your whole family combined prove me wrong i would love for you to try ,1,LosAngeles
aolsux00, 4 kids that they have to spend money in the us economy to take care of that a lot of money they have got to earn that money and spend that money and those 4 kids are all americans and can grow up to be useful that government money coming from a broke ass government with a huge national debt they should earn the money that they need to have kids not freeload and leech off of others and those 4 kids are all americans and can grow up to be useful can but almost never do they often have kids at an early age and jump on the welfare bandwagon as well childish oversimplifications from an angry and misguided fool lol you do not have an argument just say it you are the only fool criminals should not be rewarded i mean the best way to stop them from coming is to just keep our country shitty and since our country has been getting shittier these past few decades economically at least they are coming in at a lower rate than ever yeah due to them to some extent some areas are like 3rd world countries especially areas where there are a high population of them the numbers are bullshit obama did not have much border patrol to catch them so your data is bullshit it does not take in account how few border patrol agents there were so less were caught definitely a potent combination of stupid frightened and a wee bit of good ol fashioned american bigotry yet you are the one that cannot defend your arguments with logic and you are the one that discriminates in favor of mexican illegals ,1,LosAngeles
aolsux00,they are still criminals and need to get the hell out we have the right to target any of them violent or not ,2,LosAngeles
aolsux00, but does it prove how many jobs were taken be illegal immigrants it proves that they are taking jobs does not matter how many there is proof they are taking jobs also you purposely ignored the fact that they are taking jobs where they get paid under the table so there are a whole lot more there do our unemployment statistics show that we are underemployed as a nation absolutely you are completely wrong we have high unemployment and underemployment rates we just stop counting people as unemployed after their unemployment benefits run out http stateofworkingamerica org great recession unemployment and underemployment here are many illegals who have been here 20 years who have family here legally who have children legally who have been paying taxes who have been contributing to their community who have been chasing the american dream who have been putting down roots here it not like these people do not want to be citizens it that under current laws they are not able to become citizens it does not matter the law is the law and they broke it they just got away with it for a long time i may get away with speeding for a long time but when i get caught there is a penalty they have been taking advantage of the system for too long they got too comfortable someplace where they do not belong many people want to be us citizens that do not live here also we do not owe it to everyone especially not criminals oh so you say they have been paying taxes in other words they have been committing identity theft another crime you are rolling downhill man stop being wrong to say that we should effectively smoke out the illegals like bees in insensitive and un american it not what we did with the irish or any other group of immigrants that now have become a backbone of this country back then we needed people and they had something to offer illegals do not have anything to offer and we do not need them its not un american what is un american is rewarding criminals oh you know what else is un american discriminating in favor of mexicans and south americans that un american do not tell me that shit that just simply untrue we have always had cheap labor here and will always need cheap labor we as a nation are not willing to pay more for things to provide higher wages just look at the pushback for every single minimum wage hike proposal does not matter its illegal we can import shit or make 2 people do the work of 3 once again discriminating in favor of mexicans my point was that immigrants committing crimes aside from their immigration status should and do get deported good perfect you just got yourself in the head illegals are committing a crime by being here and more crimes by living here and committing identity theft or tax evasion they need to get the hell out because they are criminals and freeloaders ,1,inthenews
aolsux00, these are empty platitudes they are true you just cannot make a valid argument once again what is wrong with having kids it increases how much they have to spend and helps assimilate them into american culture you keep on avoiding all of my questions i have not avoided questions you should not have kids when you do not know what your future is when its uncertain when there is a high chance that you might have no job no money and no food on the table in the future citation needed you need a citation for it being better in the us than their situation in mexico then why the hell are they coming here you are quibbling semantics we can open paths to people who have been forced to come here illegally we do not reward criminals sorry we do not reward people that are wrong like you also so sorry you do not get a cookie do not cry maybe if you are right some day i have listed many i have talked about them as consumers as people who work and live and put down roots in this country they can consume american goods in their own country we do not need them we do not need more people living and working in this country they are stealing from americans they are cutting the line they are cheating others there millions of americans who just do not work at all are you just going to throw them out because they do not contribute they are americans we can change some laws but that a different subject what about the millions of drug addicts they do not contribute much certainly less than illegal immigrants as a subset of the population lol using your argument they consume and spend money that money is later spent down the line also many drug addicts do work actually help the people here simple as that make the country better for everyone it not hard goal to aim for but it is when angry and bitter manchildren like you need to find a scapegoat it does not make the country better for everyone it does not make it better for most americans it just makes it better for the illegal freeloader that all the same way other criminals should be punished so should they until you want to pay my bills the extra rent i have to pay the extra money i have to spend because of illegals you need to stfu because its not making my life better once again they do not belong here and you probably do not either ,2,LosAngeles
aolsux00, of course we can control those it about enforcing tax law and reforming corporate tax policy its not illegal from what i understand and yes we need to do something about changing the tax policy either way the consumer loses if we put too much pressure on them and do not work out a deal either way it still does not make the illegal immigrant situation go away you tried to manipulate the conversation again and you failed meaningless oversimplifications yet again they still lost jobs it does not change that um yes it can because average minimum wage earners are 35 88 of all minimum age earners are 20 or older yup we have full time losers but it does not mean college students still do not work at those jobs or apply for them you keep saying that yet you cannot refute my arguments or point out how i am lying i proved you wrong before and i have until this point i will continue to do so i say that illegal immigration is not as pervasive a problem as you think and that it should not be a priority its still a problem you choose to ignore big or small its a problem just like any other crime the removal numbers were driven by the dramatic decrease in those apprehended at the border in fy 2015 337 117 the second lowest apprehension number since 1972 reflecting a lower level of attempted illegal migration at our borders that could easily mean less were caught especially since obama did not have enough people working at the border at hs we both know that so yeah it does not make you right it solely the fault of the employer not the illegals being exploited for cheap labor the ones being exploited are obviously victims as well because you know they are being exploited opinion not fact thanks for trying the jobs are not there anyway prime age employment was decimated by the 2008 crash and it has not and wo not recover your article proves nothing these people are being employed so they are stealing many jobs its that simple more oversimplifications elaborate stop acting naive they increase classroom sizes require more effort and time to educate they reduce individual student teacher time they costs schools money they get government benefits that cost us money they commit crimes they do not follow some laws and usually do not have car insurance they bankrupt hospitals they suck up limited resources they increase population traffic and pollution they increase almost all prices including rent prices please do not act retarded and ask for a source for every single thing that you know is true ask only for the one you do not think are true even though we both know all are true 11 million is a few million in a nation of 324 million it less than 4 of the population mathematically they cannot be the cause of all your problems no one said they are the cause of all problem but they contribute to many you might just have to take responsibility for your own fuckups and those would be what ,1,LosAngeles
aolsux00, you really need to find news sources other than fox news or breitbart that information is not from either and its the truth that has been verified talk to your republican run obstructionist congress if you want to know why heath insurance costs increased hah they donated to obama campaign that why he knew costs were going to go up like crazy he just lied to us then he forced everyone to have it or get penalized fuck that take a lesson in economics of you want to know why the deficit being driven so incredibly high by bush effected our economy for years afterward maybe you should because he could have cut back instead he wasted even more and grew the shit out of the government and you really want to blame obama for increasing racism blame the rabid stupid racists for that one he fueled it he increased separation he supported racists groups a statement of opinion does not need to be backed up you would know that if you understood literally anything sure it does if you think he was a good president you should have reasons for it that make sense you do not you have been wrong about everything once again and you cannot defend him at all he done so many wrong things ,0,LosAngeles
aolsux00,does not matter we do not need any additional crime ,1,LosAngeles
aolsux00,less accurate than the ones on your arm,1,AskDocs
aolsux00,no they are not law abiding citizens they are either committing identity theft or tax evasion most drive without drivers licenses many commit petty theft which they are not caught for like stealing small shit or from work they do not often follow traffic laws because they do not know them ,2,LosAngeles
aolsux00, no i am not i am proposing extending the vetting methods that exist in legal avenues to those who enter illegally no reason to reward criminals criminals should pay for their crimes the same way a bank robber should if we are vetting and bringing in people who want to be american and contribute to america then that good these people do not want to contribute they are doing it for themselves not for us they have no skills no brain no money some are criminals they do not speak the language and want to freeload immigrants are people like anyone else sure but illegals do not belong here go complain to mexico about how bad the conditions are its not our fault ,1,LosAngeles
aolsux00, about about the trillions hidden by corporations and the financial elite in panama and elsewhere what about hundreds of corporations effectively paying no federal income taxes we cannot control those but we can control freeloaders aka illegals that not true plenty of americans are in those jobs that a tired old oversimplification and the idea that kids and students do minimum wage jobs is long since done with plenty of americans lost those jobs if the illegal has the job someone lost the job period kids and students do minimum wage jobs that something that cannot be argued almost everyone first job is a minimum wage job youre arguments are so stupid and such lies its ridiculous you are full of shit and cannot prove a single thing you say blame the employers hiring illegals for less than minimum wage do not blame the poor saps being forced to take that shitty position that perverse and completely counterproductive employers would not be able to hire them if no one was willing to do it so its also their fault they also steal tons of jobs with fake socials jobs that belong to legals and citizens like learn that it mathematically impossible for less than 4 of the population to be the reason for all of these problems that you think they are they contribute to plenty of problems the job market is crap because of the 2008 crash globalization and increasingly automation not because of a few million immigrants hah few million over 10 million probably closer to 20 million poor baby are you getting mad because you are wrong stop being an emotional wreck use your brain ,2,LosAngeles
aolsux00,deal with it the same way i do not have the resources to do a lot of things plenty of poor americans do not have the resources either they should be the first to get benefits rather than illegals and their families maybe they should stop making stupid choices as well like having a bunch of kids when they are completely broke ,1,LosAngeles
aolsux00, it not right to deport people who have lived here almost their entire lives for a bullshit excuse blame the parents not us its completely their fault they knew what they were doing was illegal now they need to get the fuck out,0,LosAngeles
aolsux00, if there is such a backlog we need to address it through congress to give the uscis the funding it needs no we do not then they would let hundreds of millions of people in very quickly that something we do not need ,2,LosAngeles
aolsux00, seriously all these people so ready to call illegals criminals and lawbreakers when all they did was skip doing some paperwork they are criminals and lawbreakers that what these types of people are called its not a small thing its a serious thing they break several other laws as well so do not give me that bullshit and they leech off the country they want to be here after all and being a citizen allows americans to make the most out of being americans you mean the most welfare and the most ability to freeload ,4,LosAngeles
aolsux00, some people do not have the money or ability or papers to jump through those hoops what other choice to they have i do not have the ability to do a lot of things in life i do not make it your problem and i do not make you pay for it the choice is to stay there and not have so many kids wait until their situation stabilizes enough to move if people are crossing illegally they are doing so in dire circumstances and typically as a last resort not in most cases they just know its so much better here if there were paths to citizenship then i imagine all of these illegals would choose to take them they obviously want to be in america bad enough to risk breaking the law or losing their lives there is a path one that everyone in every other country in the world who wants to be here is on come here legally and then become a citizen but if they come in and feel persecuted how is that helpful every criminal should be persecuted we should welcome illegals as well and just make them go through the bs hoops at a different time you mean never i do not support freeloaders and people that take more than they give this country is broke it does not need more leeches you cannot come up with a single damn valid reason they should be here other than its better here ,5,LosAngeles
aolsux00, 65 onwards is what is important why are you ignoring it 65 onwards proves that immigrants can come in large numbers legally or illegally and ultimately still contribute to the fabric of society there is a difference between the ones that came in the past and the ones that came now the ones in the past were decent educated people that had some skill and brains these people have none of the above they do not come to contribute they come to take you see that when they have 4 kids here while they are illegals and all we have to do is make it easier for illegals to become legal do not punish them simply because they made the difficult choice of having to immigrate illegally no we do not criminals should not get rewarded that a juvenile and unrealistic way of thinking the illegals will come regardless persecuting them does not help welcoming them and allowing them to go through the same process as legals will integrate them into america no welcoming them makes more of them want to come and says that committing a crime is ok we need to put them in a catapult and shoot them over the border the same way they shoot drugs over ,2,LosAngeles
aolsux00, anyone who thinks building the wall is a prudent and effective use of taxpayer money is stupid frankly department of homeland security apprehended fewer illegals attempting to cross on the southern border in 2016 than any year before you have zero evidence to support it and you are talking out of your ass it will save us tons of money lol in 2016 because obama decided to let them in he was not enforcing shit even the border patrol agents were mad and said they were understaffed it a waste of money it does not matter if some people step foot into the country before finishing the paperwork just extend it to them like everyone else its not a waste and you cannot prove it over a few years it will save us money we do not give special privileges to criminals or illegals all this works without an utterly useless and wasteful wall and needless persecution of those already here criminals should get persecuted they should be treated worse and not accepted or hired and housed at all since they are criminals the reason our country grew as much as it did was because of our open immigration policy that when people had skills to offer and were not uneducated morons that do not even speak the language and come to freeload llegals make up less than 4 of the population they are not a cause of any nationwide problems how big or small does not matter they are a problem actually in la they are causing huge problems 20 are illegals and they freeload do not follow many laws they have destroyed our school system they have cost us tons of money they commit tons and tons of crimes etc most of them are just suffering from the same economic realities everyone else is yet the morons keep having kids ,2,LosAngeles
aolsux00,illegals cost us money and its money we dont have to waste we can use it on americans no one should be obligated to pay for it the same way you wo not sponsor and family and let them live with you and pay for them not if while focusing on your papercut your bones heal improperly because you did not get that injury set also papercuts are not that bad point is the cost of rounding up 11 million far exceeds any lost tax revenue we do not round them up we make them leave it will cost very little to get rid of them far less than what they steal from us every year there plenty of money in the defense budget to take from to help those vets there no need to persecute a subset of the population that also struggling in the name of lifting up another struggling subset vets did something for this country illegals just take from this country we do not owe them anything pieces of shit have a sense of entitlement we should not have to alter a damn thing either to help them they can go back and blame mexico for their problems no it does not they still have to deal with the same immigration shit just after they have arrived no big deal they get pushed back in line you are discriminating in favor of mexicans why are you complaining about some poor illegals sending back chump change to developing nations when you have got immeasurably wealthy corporations stashing trillions overseas every bit counts and it does not make it not matter that mexicans are doing it they are still sending money back you do not have an argument so you try to be sneaky and manipulate things you are not smart do not try you are constantly getting caught and that not really a big deal all societies will have burdens and as far as people go illegals are not the worst burden at least many of them are still working to make money and they are spending it its different when its an outsider than is only coming to freeload they do not provide any skills at all we have our own problems and our own people to take care of we are not babysitters the same way you do not help anyone poor i would love to see you have your door open to poor people you have bought into fearmongering and you assume illegals are a greater problem than they actually are they are a problem period that all that matters i see all the problems they cause here in los angeles ,5,LosAngeles
aolsux00, if it die at home or technically be a criminal by skipping some paperwork that the only crime they committed skipping the paperwork then that an easy choice and one that you would make in a heartbeat so do not get so cavalier no its not you dumb liar they commit identity theft and or tax evasion all day long along with tons of other crimes calling people who did not do paperwork criminals when real criminals cause real problems is not helpful in fact it counterproductive its still a crime it does not change anything the same way a bank robber still does time when there are murderers out there they do cause real problems as well tons of them stop oversimplifying things i told you to make an effort not degrade the conversation you are the only one that cannot make a valid argument either you are a mexican or a dumb neo liberal with no brain ,-1,LosAngeles
aolsux00, it not like the illegal immigrants are going to be eligible for any welfare that intended for citizens you are 100 wrong they get plenty of benefits because of their anchor babies and as far as i am concerned when an illegal comes to america and makes that choice he is an american then maybe you are braindead someone here to freeload and that does not speak english is no american if he wants to live and work in america and spend money here and raise a family and buy a house and drive a car and do all that then why cannot he be an american why cannot we treat him like other americans for the same reason i cannot be a canadian a mexican etc we have rules like every other country in the world we actually have the most lax rules out of all the countries in the world he wants the same things as us wants the same things as many native born americans why make him secondary just because he happened to be born somewhere else he here now and we are all in this together we are not in it together when they are freeloading off of us and taking more than they are puttin in then turning around and committing crimes not following the laws etc illegals make up less than 4 of the population they are struggling just like a lot of americans attacking that 4 is not going to help the struggling americans it will definitely help some people who lost their jobs to them it will help tons of students get a better education less crime on the streets less population traffic more resources etc it will help everyone ,1,LosAngeles
aolsux00, the fact that we continue that policy is one thing but the idea that we would destroy families and ruin the lives of otherwise productive members of our society is unamerican and inhumane we do not destroy anything their family can go back with them they should have thought about it before they broke the law if you look at any criminal their family gets broken up when they get caught that what happens to criminals they should have thought about that before committing the crime they should take personal responsibility for it they should have known they can only be here temporarily and should not have had a bunch of anchor babies,5,LosAngeles
aolsux00,its not life or death do not be so dramatic we do not want them here they can go elsewhere or come legally we should not have to suffer because of them i am absolutely positive you say this garbage but you would never sponsor one and let them live at your home and be responsible for their costs and actions yet you want the taxpayers to do it ,-17,LosAngeles

aolsux00, what is well known if there has not been a study then how can u prove it irs knows of 1m so its well known does it need to be 3m for it to be well known they commit identity theft that one million compared to 50 percent of illegals using itin to file for taxes http www itep org immigration the link does not show anything about 50 i do not see where you saw that then that limits these people in trying to get more jobs and therefore struggle even more we have transportation here busses if they are so poor they can get a ride or take a bus right a car is very expensive limiting their opportunities by being illegal is what forces these people in getting government assistance bullshit its having 4 kids they can get by without it if they do not have 4 kids but they get money for having more and more kids so the kids should be held accountable for the law that their parents broke and then expect the kids to blame the parents yup the same reason a son with a father in jail should hold him accountable for having a messed up family and being poor ,0,California
aolsux00, they go early in the morning bang on the doors or stake the place out to get the people wren they are walking to their car for work yeah the same way any other criminal is caught there is nothing shady about that ,2,LosAngeles
aolsux00, in what ways no violent crimes were committed child endangerment does not need to be violent i do not want to see kids suffer so why do not you encourage educating retards that are below the poverty line and keep having more and more kids never heard you talk about that mr humane and good hearted i am not a liberal sorry neo liberal ,1,California
aolsux00,there a lot of things he cannot say since all the protesters that support illegal activities will destroy the city i would like to see that interview if you can find it,1,California
aolsux00, that not true u can use an itin number which allows you to pay taxes and i would like to see that almost every case source yes you can but almost no one does i would love to see the numbers on how many do no one has done a study showing it but its well known http www washingtontimes com news 2016 aug 30 irs doesnt tell 1 million taxpayers that illegal i how can u acquire a license if u cannot even apply for one in california an enormous amount of people have applied for licenses already you do not drive see how that works if its illegal to drive you do not the same way the guy with the suspended license does not keep playing victim like a little child who do not deserve the kids the kids do not deserve citizenship because their parents broke the law ur right maybe these kids should have kicked hard while they were in the womb and somehow communicated with the mother from the womb so the kids would not be held accountable for their parents actions the only people that should be held accountable are the parents which knew they were breaking the law if you or the kids have anyone to blame its the parents ,1,California
aolsux00,i am build a few computers and upgraded several of mine never had an issue and i do not go thru all that trouble i stand on carpet or work on carpet its not an issue 99 of the time as long as i touch the case once before i start ,-1,computers
aolsux00, that why i think reddit should have paid mods for politics and news subbreddits with strict impartiality and public mod logs dude i am almost sure reddit gets paid by organizations that have an agenda one of them being pushing liberalism another being trump hate and pro immigration ,1,uncensorednews
aolsux00,they should enforce child endangerment laws in some ways it is you claim to be a humane person right then why the hell do you want to see kids suffer guess liberals are not the great people they pretend to be ,2,California
aolsux00,lol he not said a single thing to indicate that we will see ,1,California
aolsux00, yes the parents so how does that change the fact that the kids were born and raised here and are americans and what do u mean by several crimes we have discussed this before coming here is illegal if you pay taxes you are using someone else social in almost every case if you are an illegal if you do not pay taxes which most do not that also illegal driving without a license is illegal and most did this but now some of them got drivers licenses driving without insurance is illegal too and most do not have it especially since they drive shit cars and cannot afford it yes so what they would have kids in any other country legally or illegally yeah thats the argument for not giving them citizenship they do not deserve ,1,California
aolsux00, clerks city carriers rural carriers and postmasters are all bound by different union contracts mous regulations sure but the business as a whole does not put pressure on them to work hard and the union backs them up even if they decide to be lazy nearly impossible to fire these guys no safety regulations say no headphones ok no headphones does not mean he needs a bluetooth speaker that is blasting the music i have been accused of mail theft by customers everything from their welfare disability checks to w2s to gift cards which ended up being destroyed by a machine since they were packed too stiffly into the envelope to personal letters and even a dildo does not make it true do all fast food employees smear their genitals on meals no have some been caught yes does not mean they all do did i say all do no i did not but its too common and its not caught often enough you call to complain and they do not give a shit the people that takes the complaints or the manager or the inspector is worse than the employees he cares less barack obama is a lizard person returns 1 840 000 results not my favorite guy but apparently he definitely a lizard person since there over four times more hits than mailman throws away mail 30 400 000 for ups lost package 457 000 for fedex lost package maybe you missed the videos you should look at them its should not be happening at all but your union probably thinks its not a big issue like you correct they will still protect someone like that even though they should not they wo not just protect them they will just about make the usps keep the employee ,2,USPS
aolsux00, once the wall is done and the self deporters never decided to come people dust settles he will legalize who is left he not legalizing anyone ,1,California
aolsux00, nope farmers are forced to pay the wage that the law requires them to it still cheaper for farmers to pay minimum wage rather than a higher wage that americans ask for ever hear about automation its coming and i cannot wait its going to be a great day the reason that these people are taking in government benefits is because job opportunities are limited because they are illegal no its because they get rewarded for having more kids if they did not get money they would think twice about it their job opportunities are limited because they have no skill no education no brain its that simple sure illegal plays a part but many of them fake being legals by committing identity theft and stealing socials so do not lie and give me that bullshit its because they cannot compete because of lack of education and skill they have near zero value these people just want nothing but to work and provide for their families being illegal and living in the shadows limits their ability to find higher paying jobs to provide for their families they would never qualify for a higher paid job if they qualified they would stay in mexico these are the least skilled and least educated people who are coming here you do not see doctors and lawyers coming here illegally again you cannot say that these people are on federal assistance because they do not deserve it these people are working 2 to 3 jobs under paid to try and provide for their families they still do not make enough so technically they live in poverty t lol if you have 4 children even a 25 a hour job wo not cut it so stop lying and being full of shit the problem with these people staying illegal is that they cannot even get better jobs to get out of poverty they are broke because of bad decisions mostly ,0,California
aolsux00, they do not self deport of course now they have six kids and can make sure each of them has government benefits because they are american citizens yup in which country in the world do they reward you for having more kids other than the us its ridiculous if you are in poverty and have kids they should lock you up ,3,California
aolsux00, easy close the border deport the violent ones legalize the rest yeah lets reward criminals especially after they committed tons of other crimes such as either identity theft or tax evasion what is next are you going to let bank robbers keep the money and not go to jail also allows them to do what they came here to do work you mean the many jobs they stole from americans they can continue to raise their children so we would not have to send millions of children into the foster care system you would not send a single one in foster care they would go back with the parents shit with this kind of bullshit you should work for places that produce fake news you would be 1 they can get paid fairly since the labor laws would now apply to them and they can report any slave abuse jobs can you speak english no do you wash your hands after using the restroom no can you count to 10 in your own language no is your iq higher than 50 no and you want them to get paid fairly they are getting paid fairly for the skill education ability to think wages will go up finally we will never leave the border wide open ever again so we will never have this problem again in the future lets forget about the 4 kids each they have not a problem at all right especially since their kids are much more likely to be criminals than them ,0,California
aolsux00,some non liberal numbers show about 20m its crazy abc just did a recent article that said 1 in 5 are illegals in a few major cities probably higher but even 1 in 5 is crazy ,0,California
aolsux00,are we going to disregard that they were here illegally parents and they committed several crimes if they were not here illegally they would not have the kids here right ,1,California
aolsux00,lol dude look into oversampling the polls were total bullshit hey lets ask 20 democrats 15 republicans and 5 independents who they are going to vote for clinton or trump see where the problem is of course its going to show clinton as being way ahead ,0,California
aolsux00,they should not start a business if they do not have the cash it not worth them destroying their credit most people are not cut out to run a business and even the ones that are do not always succeed on their first rey ,2,smallbusiness
aolsux00,i would not even use a credit card starting a business on credit is a bad idea it should always be done with your own money or someone else who is willing to take a risk most businesses fail you do not want to destroy your credit in the process and pretty much ruin your life ,2,smallbusiness
aolsux00,good,2,inthenews
aolsux00,yes you can work almost anywhere and i have never used a mat just touch the case do discharge yourself ,5,computers
aolsux00,your situation is different if you are dealing with pain and you are in a rural area what i have seen is in los angeles where there are 10 20 people in like waiting at the post office ,1,USPS
aolsux00,lawyer up these people should just leave on their own if you are here illegally just leave they had their free ride and freeloading for enough years they probably broke at least 5 other laws the deportation forecast says 1 million illegal immigrants in socal and 8 years of ice activity what makes you think trump will get elected for a second term just curious ,6,California
aolsux00,anchor babies should not be considered citizens because their parents are here illegally ,9,California
aolsux00,how so its completely broken the whole system needs to be changed there needs to be a minimum performance level pay people more for performing better as long as their accuracy is maintained and customer service is good constantly cut the bottom 10 as many companies do its a win for the government its a win for people and you everyone saves money especially the government ,1,USPS
aolsux00,i have to say i am truly shocked that so many hard working americans do not get a pension for equivalent jobs but the least hard working government employees do its really shocking ,1,USPS
aolsux00, those are clerks expectations are no different for just about any government position true but some or maybe many carriers are no better the one that comes to my house is blasting music with a bluetooth speaker how professional cannot use headphones as far as sorters or carriers in r losangeles there was just a thread about how the post office worker or workers were stealing debit cards credit cards checks etc probably much more than that is being stolen there were several people talking about it happening to them edit https www reddit com r losangeles comments 5st0w0 debit cards and checks being stolen from usps in then there are people i have heard from that do not get their mail everyday the mailman works when he feels like it and of course mailmen have gotten caught throwing away peoples mail mailman throws away mail has 436 000 results on google really good and hard working workers right i am sure there are some good ones but its not the norm they do as little as possible and would be fired from just about any other job ,0,USPS
aolsux00,these are the same exact people found elsewhere so its not much different you do not think the customer gets frustrated that an employee is working at the pace of a snail and does not give a shit any other place and the same employee would get fired or they would work twice as hard be nice sweet and considerate there a stigma attached to being a usps employee for a reason their job fucking sucks not really they are just lazy and do not give a shit about the customer when its a government job with not much real competition and poor management they do not give a shit about you but it provides benefits they probably would not get elsewhere and stable employment for the most part because they do not deserve it or else they would get it elsewhere they would be fired anyplace else even if they were getting paid less why do not you think these people never get better jobs if its so bad that what i thought then you have got people worried about their package bitching you out day in and day out you would start thinking about recreating the movie falling down it thankless soul sucking employment and if you keep that bottled inside you will die before you are 60 lol so why does not ups or fedex have this problem the guys actually work and hussle at those jobs making a lot of assumptions there people are thanked for good service not shit service have you ever thanked anyone for shitty service that what i thought ,0,bestof
aolsux00, even if you work your ass off with a smile this will happen be nice to your grouchy postal workers they deserve it not sure which post offices you go to but the ones in los angeles are known for lazy people who work at the pace of a snail they do not care they are rude etc oh and plenty of stealing going on too ,4,bestof
aolsux00, we are shorthanded understaffed and overworked from what i have seen at several post offices in la most these people do not work hard at all they take their sweet ass time if it was a non government job they would be working at least 3 4x harder i have also found that these people do not care nearly as much as lets say the ups or fedex guys they provide shit service compared to them too ,6,USPS
aolsux00,i paid for this one my last iphone do i need to pay again jw do not mind paying if i have to ,1,jailbreak
aolsux00,use seagate sea tools it easy to use and it far more accurate than just checking smart values ,1,techsupport
aolsux00,you are right that does make sense now that you say it like that,1,LosAngeles
aolsux00,i did not downvote you but we are talking about two different things you are talking more about style while i am talking about quality i did not say that the stuff they make does not look good some of it does some of it does not i am more concerned about quality ,1,LosAngeles
aolsux00,i think if you call 311 on your phone they will tell you where to get the form online ,1,LosAngeles
aolsux00,all the billboards so someone does not block his view at his office ,9,LosAngeles
aolsux00,you can get the city to pay you but it may take a year or two and you have to keep calling there a form you fill out and show proof like pics of the pothole and the bill of damage to you car the guy at the city in charge of it is horrible just keep calling him ,3,LosAngeles
aolsux00,1 why they do not have the best quality which makes there prices not even that good i do not buy much furniture but i would rather pay a little more for furniture that is better they used to be a good deal when it was cheaper but their prices have gone up ,-2,LosAngeles
