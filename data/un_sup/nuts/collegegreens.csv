collegegreens,it does not necessarily qualify her many people invent languages most are not used the one she was involved in cobol is no longer used the most notable thing about miss hopper is that she was a woman i see no evidence of her actually being an excellent programmer ,1,TheRedPill
collegegreens,absolutely hacker news is one of the worst feminist shitholes on the web i frequent it because a lot of intelligent people comment there but anything that does not toe the feminist line is deleted a user compiled a list of last word before hacker news users were banned just have a quick look at the list and maybe search for some key words like women https github com kelukelugames last words in fact right now one of the top posts there is a rant by a feminist which includes the fact that she was literally shaking at something right there in the post it so predictable at this point it almost hilarious ,1,TheRedPill
collegegreens,i wish people would actually make a point instead of just pointing to grace hopper and saying look are you arguing that she is one of the best programmers that ever lived do you have any evidence to back that up ,1,TheRedPill
collegegreens,what is your point ,1,TheRedPill
collegegreens,christ if anything grace hopper just shows that women can do it if they are talented and inclined what else do you think that one woman in the entire history of computing shows us ,2,TheRedPill
collegegreens,grace hopper does not contradict anything i said i admit there will be exceptional people from all walks of life but one woman in all of history does not mean that women should find themselves equally present at every tech conference and let not forget hopper was responsible for cobol nobody uses that any more and for good reason nothing important has been written in it nobody in their right has or ever did want to write it much like ada lovelace she is lauded simply because she is a woman if c was designed by women you would have never even heard of grace hopper ,6,TheRedPill
collegegreens,my favourite book for c is still the classic k r but maybe you would prefer something more fun python has many libraries available which helps you get stiff done quickly if you want to be a really good programmer and also have great fun then common lisp is the way to go but whatever you do have a project in mind it is only by actual practice that one becomes good ,2,TheRedPill
collegegreens,trp is not a good thing it just is like any knowledge you can use it to your advantage or not it up to you if you want to have sex with women then you now know more about their nature and that can help you if you do not then you now know why you do not if you groom dress well lift and are educated then i doubt you are in the bottom 30 even if you have some kind of disability that just makes you more interesting than the pathetic men at the bottom look around you really pay close attention to the competition not the top half look at the bottom half your comments about feminism are interesting you say that women will be able to more selective and that true but brad pitt can only do so much fucking some women will have to settle for only a top 20 male but yes of course the bottom 80 wo not get a look in this is great for a species in fact it probably the entire point of males to be a wild card some being utter shit and some being great the great ones passing on their genes but ask yourself is this good for civilisation are gorillas building cities i urge you to watch this video https www youtube com watch v uxpvwbzfakw,5,TheRedPill

collegegreens,there was a recent ama 1 about girls making hints to guys and guys not being able to pick up on them this is kind of funny because one of the first things you have to learn with game is how to see iois it seems that guys tend to assume that women would never be interested in them while women often assume the opposite there is also the fact that women do not have to learn to overcome the fear of rejection so many of them never do but it got me wondering do i really want girls to be asking me out the answer is no if a girl does more than show an ioi to me i immediately assume she is a slut personally i have no interesting in fucking sluts for several reasons if she will actively seek me out she will do the same for others and most guys will of course have sex if it is offered to them then i saw this thread in seddit 2 my god what a shithole that place has become the tl dr is a girl offered a guy sex and got it surprise surprise but this in a subreddit about seduction that is not seduction the few who did call out the post got deleted or banned for slutshaming there were several posts in the thread saying slutshaming is bad and that it would be better if more women would ask guys out can you imagine the rate of stds and pregnancies if all women would just look for sex when they want it these guys seem to have no problem with it am i crazy for wanting a woman with a low n count and no stds 1 http archive is vymbo 2 http archive is pzdhz,10,TheRedPill

collegegreens,i have had a similar experience to you i am 180cm and was 105kg at my worst that obese i was so unfit i could not walk a mile without feeling sick it took my about five years to get better i started cycling and intermittent fasting and got to my lightest which was 70kg i did not feel great at this weight and was very skinny but i had a six pack i stayed around 72kg with a six pack for the next few years as i sorted out other aspects of my life people did tell me i looked good at 72kg but it was not until i sorted out my wardrobe that i was able to fuck hot women of my choice i am currently at my best and getting better i am 82kg now and still have a six pack i have got a bit of fat around the hips though so i am currently cutting and think i will get to around 78kg when i am done i now get compliments on the size of my arms etc more compliments than when i was skinny so yes being fat is bad and being normal is better but at the end of the day lift ,8,TheRedPill
collegegreens,if works great for me i actually realised that my approach is even simpler i eat two meals per day lunch and dinner other than that i do not eat fatties cannot understand this concept i literally do not open my mouth and put things in it except for those two meals because it is only two i can eat rather large meals i can eat out without worrying too if you stick to three meals per day you really have to think about the size of the meals more not eating breakfast is a no brainer fatties tend to eat sugar and milk for breakfast which is unhealthy and just unnecessary ,5,TheRedPill

collegegreens,tagging on to this correct comment to try to explain why merging later is better tree imagine a road with a single lane with a tree on the side the cars travel at a speed such that one car passes the tree every three seconds there is no way to increase the rate of cars passing the tree except to increase the speed limit or drive dangerously close together the road is given a second lane now two cars pass the tree every three seconds you have doubled the capacity of the road every new lane increases the rate of cars passing the tree now there is a lane closed for a small section of the road at this point the road capacity is halved but the majority of the distance it is still the same if you merge early you are effectively making the closure longer like this it should be clear the a longer lane closure is worse do not merge early ,-4,videos

collegegreens,merging earlier is stupid it reduces the capacity of the road for more miles than is necessary thus it is less efficient ,4,videos
collegegreens,merging early is fucking moronic use the entire road until you have to merge everyone will slow down for the bottleneck but this way you all get to the bottleneck more quickly unfortunately most people on the road are copycats unable to think for themselves i was in the left lane on a road and all of a sudden everyone got into the right lane i could not even see why so i just stayed in the left hand lane turns out police were escorted a dangerous vehicle off the road in the left lane further up and literally hundreds of morons got in the right hand lane and slowed to like 30mph i never even had to move from the left lane ,6,videos

collegegreens,i hope you are cutting you can train the bodyweight movements namely dips and chinups using negatives and as your bodyweight comes down you should meet in the middle and rep them before you know it forget heavy benching or chest development add these two bodyweight movements to your goal list now ,1,Fitness
collegegreens,yeah but dips is an excellent strength builder and many would argue superior to bench press however bodyweight dips are hard so a newbie may require bench press to build the necessary strength for dips ,1,Fitness
collegegreens,dumbbell press is superior if chest development is the main goal however a big problem is it hard to gain strength using it because many gyms have dumbbells in 2kg increments which is way too much but once you are strong dumbbells allow a greater range of motion and force you to use your chest throughout the movement ,1,Fitness

collegegreens,yes we do have this irrational desire for freedom and in totalitarian countries the people are generally not happy there is some sort of global maximum where individuals are just free enough but not so free that they do not respect the freedom of others but this desire is irrational and unnecessary since we do not know if free will actually exists at all the real problem with pursuing individual freedoms is it drives people apart feminists are destroying the concept of marriage and family a lot of men simply do not want to get married any more because they are seeing how much of a bad deal it is for them it is this is a real problem meaning of life is a problem raising families has been the meaning of so many people lives for basically all of our history so when you say that people should have the freedom to take on those roles i do not necessarily agree i think there is definitely a case to be made that we are happier if we are not as free as possible and if our life is given meaning by some system ,0,gifs
collegegreens,i probably would not know what hit me if i got periods my point is that if women want equality then they get all of our problems there are some nice things about being a man but there are a lot of things that suck women generally do not care about these things hence why they would not know what hits them if they got them but there nothing hateful about it i have been with so many women i love them they are not men and that why i love them ,0,gifs
collegegreens,the original trilogy is an all time classic but definitely continue with the series cannot go wrong with asimov ,1,gifs
collegegreens,i would recommend reading it but essentially if you pursue individual freedom to the extreme you will discover that you cannot even live in a society with other people there is only so far you can take your own freedom before you start infringing on the freedoms of others we actually make quite large sacrifices when we live with other people the closer we are the more we sacrifice ultimately freedom and happiness are not positively correlated thinking about it i guess it an overarching theme in a lot of asimov work this conflict between freedom and happiness i believe like i think asimov probably did that humans are happiest and most productive when ruled by a benevolent dictator but due to an irrational desire for freedom we would not be happy if we are actually aware of the dictator it has to be secret ,-1,gifs
collegegreens,yeah they would say that to you but what they do is a different matter but you are probably right hence why i would never say any of it to women ,1,gifs
collegegreens,well maybe your government does but it does not mean that children have a right to proper education ,1,todayilearned
collegegreens,for me taking away somebody rights is owning them you can argue semantics but i am talking about taking away people rights ,1,todayilearned
collegegreens,they certainly do but a lot is also because less needs to be done around the house washing machines dishwashers electric cookers etc there is no longer a need to have a housewife apart from looking after children ,1,gifs
collegegreens,it in one of the later books not the original trilogy i cannot remember because it been a long time i think there are two sequels and it one of those they end up going to lots of different planets because they are looking for something and this is one of them i used to think freedom was everything before i read it changed my life ,1,gifs
collegegreens,i am sexist but i love women there nothing hateful about what i said ,-1,gifs
collegegreens,no it way more nuanced than that asimov speculated about what a civilisation that took freedom to the extreme would be like in the foundation series they were reclusive hermaphrodites freedom is not the be all and end all ,1,gifs
collegegreens,it amusing to me that i am quite possibly the complete polar opposite of the type of person you describe ,1,gifs
collegegreens,that is my plan ,-5,gifs
collegegreens,yes as long as it respects the rights of the child do you realise how many illiterate people there are even in developed countries they are incapable of communicating as we are now can you imagine a life like that compulsory education is there to stop that kind of thing happening because in today world you are hugely disadvantaged if you do not have a basic education access to the internet is now considered a fundamental human right in many parts of the world you are basically saying is up to parents to give children this right ,4,todayilearned
collegegreens,but freedom does not seem to equal happiness hence the paradox ,2,gifs

collegegreens,oh there is a reason for the gears being like this what engine do you have mine is a k20a3 which is like the type r engine but tuned differently 160bhp as opposed to 200 in any case in general honda engines like to rev high the video mentioned efficiency of the engine being best at certain rpms but you also have to consider power my engine does not like to be at 1000rpm it will not have much power it likes to sit at at least 2500rpm the redline is at 6800rpm which is a lot higher than most non performance cars if you drive in a too high gear like 5th at 30mph you wo not have as much control over the car you cannot accelerate well nor do you have much engine braking i am a big believer in always being in an appropriate gear i also skip 4th a lot general patterns for me accelerating to 70mph in 3rd then straight into 5th sometimes i keep it in 2nd and shift to 3rd at about 60mph if i feel like some fun i use 4th if i am cruising at about 40mph when slowing from 50 to 30 i will downshift sequentially through 5 4 3 without using the brakes to slow me at all if possible ,1,videos

collegegreens,no you should not do this you are driving correctly there are so many reasons why putting the clutch in while you brake is a bad idea you will have no engine braking so the brakes have to do all the work of braking which increases brake wear when you engine brake with a fuel injection system you use no fuel at all if you stop engine braking then the engine needs to keep using fuel to idle you are not only actuating the clutch but keeping it depressed which wears the clutch you should aim to be in a suitable gear at all times if you are not then you are not fully in control of the vehicle ,11,videos
collegegreens,it also highly dependent on the car and the way you drive it in my 2 0 civic i find it quite difficult to shift smoothly between 1st and 2nd this is mostly because the first is quite short so i rev it up to like 3000rpm then shift it smoother if i just get the car and shift to 2nd almost immediately but i lack the discipline ,8,videos
collegegreens,do not they usually have two gear ranges with several overlapping ,2,videos
collegegreens,more power is always good to an extent more torque makes driving manual easier a lot of people find driving diesels easier for this reason but it does put more strain on your drivetrain and seems to encourage a jerky driving style but yeah driving a 1 2 petrol that feels like it will give out if you lift the clutch slightly too fast is not much fun ,1,videos
collegegreens,as someone who enjoys driving even driving to work i really wish those people would find ways to stop driving they do not enjoy it and they are making it worse for me why do not they find an alternative edit why the downvotes seriously you do not agree that people who do not enjoy driving should find alternatives ,-2,videos
collegegreens, if you are starting to accelerate too much you can lower the clutch to slow you down if you lower the clutch you coast all you need to do is close the throttle and the engine will brake you down to idle speed you only need to depress the clutch to slow the car to a speed lower than the engine idle speed ,1,videos
collegegreens,it not that bad it just that people do not drive properly if you drive at the average speed of the traffic you will never be in a bumper to bumper situation people always accelerate to like 10mph as soon as they can then have to hit the brakes a second later that stupid what you can often do it put the car in first second or even third if it flat and let the engine idle then you will just chug along happily without touching any pedals sometimes i end up going a bit too fast and start catching up to the car in front so i just put the clutch down a bit let the car slow then slowly engage the clutch again when i am far enough back no brakes no accelerator i often notice that the car behind will begin to drive in a similar way as they never see me speed off in front of them then hit the brakes which is what causes traffic jams in the first place ,1,videos
collegegreens, manual transmission will never be a smooth experience excuse me i like many manual drivers take pride in the smoothness of my gear changes if you do it right you can upshift and downshift without any perceivable change also the bit about braking is a bit weird you should not put the clutch down when you begin braking only when coming to a complete stop if you leave the clutch engaged then the engine will assist in braking and you can also accelerate again easily as a british person who has never driven an automatic i do have more of an appreciation of automatic gearboxes now though it just a shame about the torque converter ,2,videos
