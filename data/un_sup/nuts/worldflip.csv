worldflip,i remember asking my 5 2 ex girlfriend that question and she said she would not date shorter she has dated other short guys besides me who are taller than her before though ,2,short
worldflip,to be fair lots of men do not want to date a chick taller than them too lots of insecurity to go around although men on average care less about height they too are part of the problem to some extent as well ,1,MGTOW
worldflip,stop living for women and you will care a lot less about your height mgtow ,0,short

worldflip,just means us actual short guys are subhuman to them ,15,short
worldflip,dunno society just determined it to be so ,6,short
worldflip,except women can still find you attractive despite not being tall ,11,short
worldflip,and some jabronis here still think it primarily driven by primal instinct get real guys stop giving women free passes all the time ,8,short
worldflip,can you imagine if you openly said something like i am glad you are not overweight or i am glad your breasts are at least x size you would be judged so hard and probably would never hear from them again ,4,short

worldflip,dunno brah,5,short
worldflip,i am not so sure about that and i find it usually the not so pretty girls like 4 6 range that prefer tall average ugly looking guys over a handsome face anyways so whatever it like they know he better looking out of their league so they at least try for just tall xd,5,short
worldflip,he probably just not attractive enough online to get attention from women you can be 6 3 and ugly face matters too i am short you can tell in one of my pictures that i am not tall yet i still have over 500 matches and plenty of very attractive women messaging me first,7,short

worldflip,i am in the same boat as you op i do not know what to do regarding my height on tinder i have accumulated close to 400 matches in a month and i really do wonder how many less i would have if i listed my height in my bio i met up with one girl a couple of weeks ago and she was about my height give or take a cm or two in heels i got the vibe that she was disappointed by it really sucks that we have deal with this hah list and and you sound insecure and get less matches or do not list it and potentially meet up with someone who thinks you are too short for them that look of disappoint hurts the soul ,11,short

worldflip,bro we live in a world that considers 5 11 too short by some women it funny because they only think that way because it does not start with a 6 ,5,short
worldflip,yeah lots of tall guys will list their height in their tinder bio followed with because apparently that matters i have even seen some women use that line as well when listing their own height i think guys sometimes ask girls for their height too in hopes of them not being taller ,2,short

worldflip,shallow af,16,short
worldflip,how do you know if somebody is tall over the internet they will let you know ,12,short
worldflip,the men who usually care care because it makes them not feel manly enough ,1,short
worldflip,i find the whole concept of a woman needing a tall man to feel small and protected so ludicrous it like fuck working on my self image and confidence i will just take the easy way out and get someone to mask it and do not even get me started on heels ,14,short
worldflip,yes ,-1,short

worldflip,if she truly is as chill af as you say she is then 1 inch would not be a big deal to her ,2,short
worldflip,i get matches almost every swipe and my height is not listed in my bio either but never do girls ask the height question ,1,short
worldflip,i am not telling you to call someone fat or skinny or horse face just say what is the matter man you jelly or something definitely do not just hide behind the girl who sticks up for you by saying only thanks ,3,short
worldflip,that nice but you should not rely on them to do so but if they do come to your defense in front of you have a little laugh but then put those disrespectful self entitled guys in their place in a way that does not make you appear flustered upset ,2,short
worldflip,should call those guys out in on their insecurity jealously if they are saying that stuff in front of you and a girl i personally get off knowing i am unintentionally making some other dude jealous because he thinks he entitled to something ,3,short

worldflip,they are all mentally ill ,5,short
worldflip,whatever they can still get fucked i would never want to date someone who is caught up in that shit there more than enough woman to last me several lifetimes that do not care ,1,short
worldflip,i met up with a girl once off tinder who asked my height before meeting we were supposed to be the same height but she ended up being a little taller than me when we met needless to say she did not care she later invited me back to her place she even apologized to me for not being shorter i think she was insecure for being a taller than average girl apparently she was teased for it growing up ,5,short
worldflip,women who think that way suck even if i met their height requirement they would still suck fuck em ,2,short
worldflip, justgirlythings is so cringe,14,short
worldflip,i was less than 4 11 when i started high school as well but i never thought badly about it like you do in elementary school i was one of the most popular kids everyone wanted to be my friend i used to have kids argue over who got to sit next to me i remember the two most attractive girls in my class had crushes on me as well and wanted to date me but i was too shy to go out with them lol all this despite me being the shortest boy in our grade ,1,short
worldflip,i was less than 5 feet tall when i entered grade 8 ,1,short
worldflip,i still would hardly consider 2 5 3 inches towering maybe from your perspective it is,1,short
worldflip,5 7 towered lol,2,short
worldflip,at least the comments from females are civil ,1,short
worldflip,tall girls usually have their height listed as well i have actually seen maybe 3 or 4 girls profiles that say something like why do so many guys state their height on here i do not care ,0,short
worldflip,it just a preference one that has no bearing on who i chose to date ,4,short
worldflip,no i was 22 when i started to find a round behind attractive ,2,short
worldflip,yup and if you can bend your head towards your shoulder and it goes past your shoulder it over boyo ,1,short
worldflip,face and possibly higher standards ,1,short
worldflip,women need a tall man because society and social media tells them they need a tall man ,2,short
worldflip,as a fellow short guy i would never want to be that big ,1,short
worldflip,i was never bullied for being the shortest in my class everyone liked me and wanted to be my friend kids would literally fight over who would get to sit next to me ,1,short
worldflip,her girl friends probably give her shit for it hence the insecurity ,10,short
worldflip, he stands at about 5 6 which i find is quite short compared to most guys comparing his height to other men instead of her own heard many women do that ,10,short
worldflip,we celebheights now,6,short
worldflip,the comment section of that website is so autistic ,1,short
worldflip,not really if you wear shorts above the knees ,2,short
worldflip,totally it actually kind of fucked up when you really think about it asking if there is any hope to grow taller as if you have some sort of terrible disease or something the way that you currently are and all those stupid social media memes about being 6 feet or less than 6 feet do not help either a young girl could see that and easily be influenced ,6,short
worldflip,it definitely short in the nhl ,4,short
worldflip,love it ,2,short
worldflip,personally it would get me off knowing dating a girl taller than me would piss some people off let the haters hate bro ,1,short
worldflip,fucking savage do fat women get this degree of hate from men on twitter too doubt it ,-1,short
worldflip,what i do not get is why do people automatically assume taller older we are clearly both adults but since he a bit taller than me he must be the older one wtf lol,2,short
worldflip,i sometimes wish i was at least the same height as my younger brother because people always just assume he the older one when we are together but other than that meh ,2,short
worldflip,i do not think the majority of girls like fat guys either to be honest ,5,short
worldflip,https pbs twimg com media bkgex5rceaaxrcz jpg,11,short
worldflip,crosby just set him up for a sick goal ,3,short
worldflip, weirded out men shorter than me make me feel insecure about my size as a woman ,10,short
worldflip,yeah me too reading this sub and other people experiences depresses me even though my personal experience as a short guy has been pretty good ,1,short
worldflip,it articles like these that do a good job at brainwashing young women into thinking that they need a tall man ,0,short
worldflip,so she one of those bitches cannot believe you took a picture with her would have ignored her bimbo ass ,2,short
worldflip,yeah that pretty fucked up it like being short is some kind of disease ,30,short

worldflip,no girl has ever asked for my height on tinder that i have gone on a date with in a way i kinda wish they would ask just so i 100 know they do not care that i am below average i would not dare mention it to them as it sounds insecure ,1,short
worldflip,just for the record i know why guys do it they believe it will increase their matches it the tall guys 6 foot plus that do it on tinder a lot of them list their height in their bio this is not the first time i have made a topic about a girl on tinder being clueless as to why guys include their height either one time i saw girl even write something like why do guys always list their height i do not care if 4 0 or 7 0 ,10,short
worldflip,i have met 5 4 girls of many different heights haha ,10,short
worldflip,i hate that i wish i could be taller just to have a larger dating pool i do not mind if a girl is taller than me so that kind of a bummer ,4,short

worldflip,some girls like short guys ,-1,short
worldflip,what about fat men though all the girls i have known found them gross ,4,short
worldflip,i know it messed up to say but a part of me would feel really good if these women who demand a tall guy because they need protecting see their tall bf get beat down in front of them by a shorter man oh the hilarity the disbelief would be succulent ,-6,short
worldflip,should have messed with her a bit you a cop or something or better made a bet with her tell you what if i prove to you i am 18 you and i have to go out on a date ,3,short
worldflip,damn dude you should have said something to those girls within hearing range of the tall blonde chick probably would have rocked her world ,4,short
worldflip,i think some probably a lot of people think it awkward because they just do not see tall girl short guy couples very often i remember i was at the pool one time with my friend and he said to me look over there that dude girlfriend is taller than him so i said yeah so what i guess it got him thinking because the only thing he said to me after that was oh it just you do not see that very often ,1,short
worldflip,i cannot believe this ,1,short
worldflip,probably all stupid social media obsessed broads who believe in the meme what do you call a man who is less than 6 feet a friend ,15,short
worldflip,yeah but they were young teens i am talking about post puberty ,1,short
worldflip,i will never understand why people automatically assume the older brother is the taller one when they are both in their twenties ,4,short
worldflip,just lol at being friends with women especially with ones as shitty as yours ,0,short
worldflip,guess she only dates basketball players like her ex husband ,1,short

worldflip,i believe there a study out there that says people who took glucosamine sulfate at 1500 mg daily for 1 month saw an increase in height of about 2 4 millimeters that increase is so small though that it could have simply been measurement error or lack of spinal decompression though ,2,short
worldflip,it not that hard to believe she probably just noticed a lot of guys listing their height in their bios and decided to make a comment about it in her ,13,short
worldflip,those yellow teeth though ,4,short
worldflip,ok,9,short
worldflip,this is why i do not go to clubs girls wearing 4 inch heels who laugh reject guys for being shorter than them ,25,short
worldflip,add an inch maybe two but no more if a girl ever calls you out on it just be adamant that you thought you were so and so height better to come off as wrong ignorant than a liar ,1,short
worldflip,this 100 ,1,short
worldflip,no brag but just to give you an idea even though i am short i am apparently exceptionally handsome in the face department and have a nice body i get tons of matches with lots of beautiful women on tinder and when i used to use online dating sites with my height listed i still got dates and i lots of replies one girl taller than me and probably crazy worshipped my face on our first date and would not stfu about how beautiful gorgeous i was another girl apologized after our first date for being unusually shy she claimed she very outgoing because i was really really attractive and nice to really see just how attractive people saw me in person i would go on omegle and sooo many peoples both men and women thought i was using a simulated webcam it was crazy girls would shout simulated webcam and then next me guys would be like why are you using a simulated webcam bro people who did believe i was real would usually complement me and ask why i was even on omegle anyway despite all this i am pretty insecure i have never even been rejected before because of my height but i have read so many stories on the internet that it has fucked me up like oh well it happened to this guy so it would probably happen to me sort of deal i constantly catch women checking me out in person on route to school at school ect but i always just assume they are thinking shit like oh that guy really cute hot he short though what a waste i am fucked in the head man and like i said i do not know how to change how i think ,1,short
worldflip,because a lot of girls are stupid they also believe a taller guy can protect them better it like ingrained into them ,15,short
worldflip,what in the actual fuck,2,short
worldflip,i am in the same boat ,1,short
worldflip,that too for sure i also do not like dancing i find it weird awkward ,1,short
worldflip,nothing really i do not know where i would begin ,1,short
worldflip,i have been struggling with that like my mentality has prevented me from having fun it sucks inb4 just have confidence,1,short
worldflip,because feminists also want a tall man ,40,short

worldflip,nice fist bump screw those people who say to just ignore it sometimes they need to learn ,17,short
worldflip,probably not my first experience but definitely one that comes to mind i was 13 years old grade 8 i walked into this finishing room inside my woodwork class and some asshole in my grade said you cannot be in here you are too short it made absolutely no sense but has stuck with me all these years ,2,short
worldflip,well i have seen a couple girls write i do not care how tall you are in their bio before guess it was a response to all the tall guys having their height listed in the their bio ,7,short
worldflip,that thought never crossed my mind ,1,short
worldflip,i personally could not be with someone who thinks the way your gf does would have dumped her a long time ago ,5,short
worldflip,guy head is too big for his body i have seen this be the case with some short guys it like their heads should be on a bigger bodies lol ,0,short
worldflip,looking good batmanlet ,5,short
worldflip,reminds me of this story this girl once told maybe on here about this tall dude who was hitting on her at work she told him she has a boyfriend and the first thing he says is how tall is he for the record i think the boyfriend was either the same height as she was or a couple inches shorter ,3,short

worldflip,sorry but lol being friends with women especially with ones as stupid as yours ,-6,short
worldflip,calls him a midget she herself is 4 11 ,24,short
worldflip,went for a teeth cleaning when i was 17 hygienist asked me what grade i was in and i told her i had just graduated she says elementary i was like no high school awkward ,3,short
worldflip,oh look a tall guy completely oblivious to the fact that many women are height natzis ,1,short
worldflip,i cannot imagine how shitty i would feel if a girl ever said how they would date me if i was just a little taller just seems so ridiculous if that the only thing keeping you from getting with her ,6,short
worldflip,confirmed daddy issues,5,short
worldflip,funny how she shows up wearing those fat ass heels things are ugly ,3,short
worldflip,if i were to go on a site like omegle right now most of the females on there would chat with me based on my face alone i can immediately see them perk up and become interested in having a conversation which clearly means they were nexting men before me because they did not find them facially appealing no girl is on there looking for a tall guy to talk to they want a guy who is pleasant to look at i realize omegle is not real life nor are any of these women looking to date me but it should still count for something ,2,short
worldflip,those are really depressing comments to read ,1,short
worldflip,oddly enough i have never been asked this from a girl on tinder and i have talked to a lot of girls on there and have gotten a lot of numbers ,2,short
worldflip,i own a pair that make me an inch taller,1,short
worldflip,a few years back my friend 6 4 and me 5 6 met up after 5 years of no contact and he was surprised to see how much muscle i had gained he was looking at my biceps and said i feel intimated by you like you are going to kick my ass or something funny thing is i am not exactly built like a tank more like brad pitt in fight club he a bean pole btw the protect me protect me mindset some women have is extremely annoying i admit i think if a tall guy sees a shorter man who bigger the taller guy would more often than not be aware that he in tough ,3,short
worldflip,it pinky and the brain ,1,short
worldflip,i am 25 and have never been to dance for this very reason ,1,short
worldflip,guys lie about their height all the time online you really think most guys listed as 6 0 really are exactly 6 0 ,1,short
worldflip,these girls sound very immature one of her friends actually said she was proud of her haha at least you seem to have some good guy friends ,5,short
worldflip,i am 5 2 and do not have a preference for height although all of my boyfriends have been over 6 feet tall it just worked out that way teehee ,4,short
worldflip,just an insecure 6 1 girl nothing else to see here ,13,short
worldflip,probably ,1,short
worldflip,yeah being rejected for something you have absolutely no control over hurts there nothing you can do about it and it sucks ,2,short
worldflip,not a lot of girls are going to write something like i do not care how tall you are in their bio so i do not know i would have to ask the rest ,6,short
worldflip,i get hundreds of matches i am a good looking dude just short whenever i ask for a number they just give it to me never have i been asked maybe how tall are you though i suppose if we were to arrange a date they could very well ask would not you be curious how tall the girl you were talking to was one other girl i went out with never asked before meeting me but she turned out to be like 5 0 ,1,short
worldflip,i spoofed my location just for kicks one other girl i matched with some time ago said what is the deal with height up in here in her bio guess a lot of tall guys are listing their height thinking it will increase their matches ,5,short
worldflip,i meant to say that only one girl on tinder has ever asked for my height she turned out to be an inch taller than me but we still got together she seemed to have a problem with her own height though said she got bullied as a kid for being tall she even apologized to me for not being shorter lol ,1,short
worldflip,i have only been asked once on tinder and she was 5 7 and very insecure about being a tall girl herself she did not care i was a little bit shorter than her we actually went on a date and she invited me back to her place for a good time ,1,short
worldflip,genetics are weird,1,short
worldflip,inb4 op gf dumps him,0,short
worldflip,i am surprised nobody as mentioned how they look like they could be related i can see similarities in the face ,1,short
worldflip,not coming in here to brag but i have a really good looking face and i am short i am also really shy so i have never put myself out there in the real world to get rejected so i use apps like tinder and hot or not i only use two face pictures and get tons of matches with women i find attractive i swipe selectively i will get messages like are you real are you a model i just wanted to say you are really attractive ect sure it feels good but then i start to wonder how interested they would still be if they knew i was 5 6 i sometimes use omegle as well and get all sorts of compliments girls thinking my cam is fake asking why such a cute guy would be on omegle getting called hot cute handsome ect i do not think i would trade my face to be 6 feet tall any girl who looks at a handsome short guy and thinks what a waste is not worth my time ,4,short
