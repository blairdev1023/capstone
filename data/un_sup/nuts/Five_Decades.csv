Five_Decades,that wo not make a difference imo to my understanding of conservative cognition a major issue is conservatives do not like nuances or gray areas and they need for things to make sense and fit into black and white patterns this leads to simplistic conservative good liberal bad cognition because it is an easy mentality with no gray areas plus when you throw facts at them the facts bounce off because their goal with cognition or news is not to become educated or have an authentic understanding of the outside world it is to maintain a cognition framework that makes them feel safe i am a hostile world and that makes sense to them and solidifies in group and out group identities so education wo not fix this these people do not value facts or knowledge they value having a cognitive framework that is simple with clear black and white lines that makes them feel safe in a confusing hostile world and lets them feel they are the good guys their minds are like a house of cards in a strong wind they do not care about facts they care about not letting the house of cards fall down they will invent and ignore facts as needed to maintain the integrity of their mental framework that they need to feel safe to feel the world makes sense and that their sense of identity is tied into you cannot take people like that and give them more education if anything that backfires studies have shown smarter more educated conservatives are more deluded and misinformed because they can find ways to delude themselves better if you make conservatives smarter or more educated all that happens is they become better at deluding themselves and each other ,8,politics

Five_Decades,i was thinking about this today i think we need to create a culture that has a place for people who do not do well in the sexual market place the reality is not everyone has a massive social network full of age appropriate single people and not everyone brings a lot of value to that sexual marketplace as a result a lot of people have very limited options and the odds of a good outcome are not high however people are not allowed to admit to this because they will be labeled as failures or losers creating an environment where it is ok to not do well in the sexual marketplace will hopefully reduce shame and prevent people from turning to more dysfunctional ways of coping with the hurt feelings they have like misogynistic online forums that just make them angry the reality of the situation though is that a man who does not procreate sees his dna die with him we have evolved to do almost anything and everything to avoid this fate so a lot of incels will not go quietly into the goodnight ,12,MensLib

Five_Decades, and we do not honest question do you think it a coincidence that the us spends so much on private healthcare costs and also is providing the bulk of biotechnology research patents contributions in general a big part is that europe does not spend as much on r d in general the us spends about 3 of gdp on r d the eu spends about 2 that is all r d not just biomedical according to this medical r d not sure if this is for all medical or just drug discovery in europe is 2 3 the size of spending in the us http www nature com nrd journal v13 n2 images nrd4244 i1 jpg south korea has a public health care system that covers everyone and their of gdp that goes to biomedical research is probably on par with the us around 0 7 of gdp on the subject of south korea east asia is spending more and more on biomedical research while the us is spending less china singapore japan south korea taiwan etc are increasing spending while the us decreases spending https www fic nih gov news globalhealthmatters january february 2014 pages spending investment biomedical research development aspx what makes you think public expenditures for healthcare would not increase if the us switched to single payer or socialized healthcare because public health care in the us is cheaper than private medicare medicaid are both cheaper than private health care also every other wealthy nation has a stronger role for the public sector and their health care is cheaper also hr676 medicare for all would save half a trillion a year http pnhp org blog 2013 07 31 friedman analysis of hr 676 medicare for all would save billions if you are seriously doubting the efficiency of the private sector vs the public sector let me know and i will put more effort into explaining why that ludicrous but i cannot imagine that what you are actually saying there are areas where the public sector is more efficient more humane better etc than the private sector your belief that this never happens is just that a belief you may not consider it a belief because you believe it so strongly but it is just a belief there are communists who cannot fathom the idea that the private sector can do anything better than the public sector but their beliefs are just as valid as yours because they are fundamentally just beliefs some people believe in a deity who has a beard and looks like a taller version of us but even if they believe that with all their heart it does not make it objectively true there are multiple points of evidence that a public sector run health system is cheaper and better than a private run system within the us public health care is cheaper and many times better internationally public systems are cheaper than our private system studies of replacing our system with a full public system show cost savings ,1,dataisbeautiful

Five_Decades,a lot of the bad rep marijuana gets is because people who are prone to criminality or mental illness or emotional instability are driven to abuse drugs or alcohol so even if you can say marijuana users are more likely to have bad outcome x that does not mean the marijuana caused it maybe the person just had a bad life and a miserable brain and they abuse drugs to shut down the mental anguish so cause and effect are tricky when determining is it a gateway drug alcohol is the real gateway drug but again its not really a gateway drug it is just that people who have problems in life mental illness physical illness social isolation a background of abuse are more prone to abuse drugs to deal with the pain a lot of drug abuse and addiction is not physical it is people trying to mask a traumatic life anyway yes weed should be legalized spice should be illegal imo or at the very least in a different category of legal ie much harder to get with much more quality control and warnings so people know exactly how potent it is at the cb1 receptor but weed should be legalized spice seems much more dangerous but that is my view ,2,Drugs

Five_Decades,look at the long term though by long term i mean extreme long term millions billions trillions of years from now suffering comes from the nervous system the nervous system can be understood and reverse engineered it can one day maybe in 100 years be rewired to make subjective well being the default state and prohibit suffering pain has only existed for maybe 500 million years if humans do not destroy themselves our species or our descendents may still be around trillions of years from now and creating subjective pleasure and preventing pain will be child play even within 200 years of technological development point is a few hundred million years of pain and suffering on earth could give birth to a multi galactic civilization that exists for quintillions of years and that could easily create bliss at will ,3,changemyview

Five_Decades,exactly people act like you are just upset your candidate did not win nope i do not care about that i care that 63 million people do not take democracy seriously i have never felt this way before about any other election i have participated in ,8,politics
Five_Decades,but they are morons the fact that it makes them upset does not change the fact that they felt trump was qualified to be president just because it hurts their feelings does not make it untrue i have voted in many elections over the years i have never felt such contempt for voters like i did in 2016 i know i am not alone and no it is not because they did not vote for my candidate many people have chosen not to vote for my candidates i do not care about that it is that trump is emotionally unstable corrupt authoritarian dishonest dangerous hostile to democracy etc and 63 million voters either did not notice or did not care ,17,politics
Five_Decades,agreed there is a reason the gop tries to make it hard to vote democrats need to make it national policy to make voting as easy as possible mail in ballots make election day a national holiday etc,1,politics

Five_Decades,so are there drugs to agonize the a2 or a3 receptor without activation of the others the only thing i can find online is a chemical called sl 651 498 supposedly that molecule produces anxiolytic effects but no addiction due to little activity at the a5 receptor and little sedation possibly due to little activity at a1 and it binds more strongly to a2 and a3 if so the next generation of anti anxiety drugs will be wonderful anti anxiety with no addiction or sedation that will be amazing ,7,DrugNerds

Five_Decades,she said they are often meaning a lot of the gang members are superpredators you can interpret that in multiple ways i interpret it as saying the serious gang members are superpredators ,1,changemyview
Five_Decades,they have no morals or ethics other than win by any means necessary and make sure we get our way ,14,politics
Five_Decades,my understanding is that even among street gang members only a minority commit most of the violence it is not like every member is out committing murders everyday but a minority of them commit most of the major crimes however that small minority maybe 10 of gang members not sure are superpredators the other 90 can probably be salvaged with counseling job opportunities etc ,3,changemyview
Five_Decades,the rates of violent crime have dropped almost 70 in the last 20 30 years the reasons for this are still questionable lead poisoning is potentially a major cause of violent crime and its removal from gasoline led to less neurological issues easy access to abortions is potentially another reason for crime reduction but people do look at it as a mix of nature vs nurture ,5,changemyview
Five_Decades,she should not have apologized for it she was right ,1,changemyview
Five_Decades,that is not true she was referring to violent gang members http www politifact com truth o meter statements 2016 aug 28 reince priebus did hillary clinton call african american youth su but we also have to have an organized effort against gangs hillary clinton said in a c span video clip just as in a previous generation we had an organized effort against the mob we need to take these people on they are often connected to big drug cartels they are not just gangs of kids anymore they are often the kinds of kids that are called superpredators no conscience no empathy we can talk about why they ended up that way but first we have to bring them to heel,1,changemyview
