name,body,score,sub
yearp99,all of a sudden i cannot wait for the nfl season to begin ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,tomorrow they will likely brand comey as a liar for saying trump is not under investigation or that he only saying that to not compromise the investigation ,5,The_Donald
yearp99,exactly the leader the philippines needs at this time ,10,The_Donald
yearp99,yes they purchase or license it the company in this case vr software ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,wow too much of a cuck even for seattle ,3,The_Donald
yearp99,well he might be right because some a holes up are up for re election in 2018 that are blocking trump ,8,The_Donald
yearp99,so they are going to brainwash kids into believing they are a different gender and force their parents to accept it probably suggesting surgery on the kid absolutely sickening i guess the politicians will be deciding what gender a kid is in ontario ,2,The_Donald
yearp99,setting themselves up for a maddow like epic fail ,14,The_Donald
yearp99,this is the sort of news that makes you cry from happiness ,13,The_Donald
yearp99,stupid cnn we know it was not russian hackers this is all caused by man made global warming ,70,The_Donald
yearp99,48 of those surveyed could not find their own asses ,9,The_Donald
yearp99,my feelings were it was a document created specifically to plug a leak ,6,The_Donald
yearp99,it just took time for this info to bubble up that was the election of macron ,8,The_Donald
yearp99,warren does not follow her but it looks like she follows a nyt reporter ,2,The_Donald
yearp99,do not think she did but what does anderson cooper have to do with her is the question ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,because the cats get to decide what is true and false not facts cats ,3,The_Donald
yearp99,it true but that just not the full sentence our viewer numbers are up by 100 percent in london iran parts of iraq and syria ,8,The_Donald
yearp99,the probably got them printed for ramadan ,2,The_Donald
yearp99,they were actually marching against motion m 103 the islamophobia motion ,20,The_Donald
yearp99,it really looks like she was put in that place just for the purpose of leaking she started working in february so that would put the time of her hiring in mid january most likely ,10,The_Donald
yearp99,such an odd coincidence though that she would have contacts within the democratic party controlled media before becoming the leaker ,36,The_Donald
yearp99,that just what news organizations do says cnn i have no doubt msnbc and other mainstream news outlets do the same thing does not make it right ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,looks to me like the report was false and created as a blue dye test specifically to catch the leaker red handed who they knew was somewhere at that contractor and it worked ,4,The_Donald
yearp99,be more surprising if they did not yell something like that ,2,The_Donald
yearp99,yet somehow russia is the bigger enemy ,3,The_Donald
yearp99,that orc way too young to be a child refugee going to school in sweden not for another 4 years or so anyways ,7,The_Donald
yearp99,he not the mayor of pittsburgh he mayor of the world ,6,The_Donald
yearp99,as president trump said it nothing but a cash giveaway and the usa would be footing the bill ,3,The_Donald
yearp99,that pretty much what every agreement the us signs with another country turns into ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,if only frank marshall davis had thought the same thing ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,it does need re invention re invention as a free trade agreement and nothing more with borders between each country ,11,The_Donald
yearp99,most likely israel jew related looking at his comments over the years ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,he a known anti israel anti semite who spews conspiracy theories about jews blaming them for everything no surprise he hates trump ,2,The_Donald
yearp99,agree on it being a scam but it cost us far more than 22 billion ,6,The_Donald
yearp99,if i am a russian agent then they owe me a hell of a lot of back pay ,6,The_Donald
yearp99,we know they were just little people following orders let get the head of the snake in there ,10,The_Donald
yearp99,this is either proof that there was no collusion with russia or proof that trump statements can transcend space and time liberals will think the latter is more likely if cnn tells them to ,3,The_Donald
yearp99,sounds like a step in the right direction ,5,The_Donald
yearp99,macron suffers first defeat since election ,2,The_Donald
yearp99,and that what the media is stating that the republican threatened to shoot the dem they do not give a crap about the rest of the story ,13,The_Donald
yearp99,all this does is ignore the question that should be on every liberals mind which is why would the russians even need a backchannel if trump is an agent of the kremlin ,20,The_Donald
yearp99,seahawks have denied this apparently he does not have the skill to sell popcorn ,9,The_Donald
yearp99,let be fair and get rid of free health care and free housing for everyone ,104,The_Donald
yearp99,i had muslim neighbors growing up who believed similar crap despite going to school here so this is not an uncommon belief told me how people were better educated in africa ,6,The_Donald
yearp99,source would be nice for this ,8,The_Donald
yearp99,i cannot wait for megaupload 2 0 ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,nothing happening in sweden do not look behind the curtain ,12,The_Donald
yearp99,wow looking at those who walked out i guess i understand what non gender binary means now ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,actually they came up with this in the 20th century it just still has not happened yet ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,barry bowed to everyone and instantly lost all their respect ,3,The_Donald
yearp99,this is going to drive liberals nuts ,19,The_Donald
yearp99,find those leakers sherriff ,3,The_Donald
yearp99,it good they were deported but let get that wall up to make it harder for them to come back ,2,The_Donald
yearp99,but if trump were to get 1 for every time a conspiracy theory came out that was going to take him down he would be the only trillionaire in the world ,3,The_Donald
yearp99,it definitely possible that they had intel that the seth rich story was coming ,3,The_Donald
yearp99,timed perfectly ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,schumer is right though this does point to evidence of a cover up a cover up by comey of clinton crimes ,3,The_Donald
yearp99,they threaten that stuff but it would be a political deathwish with his massive popularity perhaps an actual deathwish too ,145,The_Donald
yearp99,isis was too distracted by their own macron victory celebration ,50,The_Donald
yearp99,sad but true and macron apparent plans to legalize all undocumented people in france will likely send many of the refugees into france clearly to help merkel in her upcoming election ,5,The_Donald
yearp99,then he will own obamacare if the dems and bernie vote down the republican healthcare then they own obamacare they must be starting to believe the fake polls that say americans love obamacare when it the key reason trump and the republicans are in office ,9,The_Donald
yearp99,austrian judge would rule that they could not understand nein ,2,The_Donald
yearp99,guess they forgot an e in the hashtag because it looks like she been on a feastfortheclimate ,5,The_Donald
yearp99,yep unfortunately all most of those asshats seem to care about is the letter in front of the names voted in ,2,The_Donald
yearp99,sounds good he thinks they are guaranteed to get more seats in 2018 by doing nothing and seemingly does not care what happens to the country 25 dems up 9 republicans ryan only cares about those numbers by being tough on trump policies he thinks they will be able to seduce some democrats into switching sides and voting more pubs in ,8,The_Donald
yearp99,simple because those writing and speaking about communism are usually communists ,29,The_Donald
yearp99,of course i meant afghanistan sorry bout the typo ,1,The_Donald
yearp99, surely this will get massive national attention in canada just like the syrian refugee who sexually assaulted 6 kids at the water park in the west edmonton mall on february 8th my bet is on them never mentioning she a refugee on most reports ,6,The_Donald
yearp99,var bill clinton is a rapist true while bill clinton is a rapist system out println bill clinton is a rapist ,2,The_Donald
yearp99,but she native american her family had the time life book series called the old west when she was a kid her daddy read indian stories from it that made her native american ,6,The_Donald
yearp99,that good for joss because he not even a 1 ,8,The_Donald
yearp99,payment for services rendered ,9,The_Donald
yearp99,he said for now they persuaded him in other words they made him an offer ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,not to mention how many pharmaceutical drugs are based on natural medicines ,61,The_Donald
yearp99,the timing of this they are messing with alex custody hearings ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,could not be worse than moonbeam ,2,The_Donald
yearp99,you have got exxon mobile and the association of coal producers writing trump to keep up with obama paris stupidity 100 proof that this greenpeace founder speaks the truth ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,i am not so sure if you are watching either of them then you probably cannot satisfy a woman ,2,The_Donald
yearp99,another witch hunt ,3,The_Donald
yearp99,fake soldiers is that the new nickname for isis ,40,The_Donald
yearp99, lydia is that a woman what everyone is wondering ,3,The_Donald
yearp99,the organization the democrats booed at trump speech they love their criminal illegal aliens ,17,The_Donald
yearp99,great point ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,unless you are alex jones he always reports on other people reports and gets bashed even when it true ,23,The_Donald
yearp99,yeah that crazy enough but the trump russian server conspiracy theory creators vox reporting on politico report is crazy for them ,42,The_Donald
yearp99,vox is reporting this wow ,709,The_Donald
yearp99,let hope they are way wrong for the second round ,19,The_Donald
yearp99,it just a macron getting to the second round celebration party they are showing their support for him ,3,The_Donald
yearp99,sounds like they specifically targeted him ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,he probably gets the info before the news media does ,8,The_Donald
yearp99,canada they need to be saved most of all because of trudeau ,2,The_Donald
yearp99,if that the case he should ask carlos slim to take care of mexico problems ,19,The_Donald
yearp99,that directed at you mccain ,5,The_Donald
yearp99,one of many organizations connected to soros ,3,The_Donald
yearp99,we should allow extradition of all of them even before the investigation is completed ,2,The_Donald
yearp99,just watch alex jones when he on ,20,The_Donald
yearp99,modern feminism ,9,The_Donald
yearp99,losing by 8 points is now a victory for the democrats ,5,The_Donald
yearp99,makes you wonder if pizza meant peacekeeper ,10,The_Donald
yearp99,let hope the real mr brexit endorses merkel ,6,The_Donald
yearp99,i think piers morgan just saved the daily mail 147 million ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,that no proof that this is done by muslims oh wait it is ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,the idiots at msnbc would probably only stop spouting the russia nonsense if they were looking up from hell after being nuked by putin ,2,The_Donald
yearp99,no doubt mccain will claim the russians got to the man ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,the taqiyya is from the guys responding and saying they do not want sharia law ,7,The_Donald
yearp99,disturbing lie from the ap just saw trudeau pushing for war against assad when justin trudeau the world most incompetent leader and soros right hand is pushing for war let hope that makes trump extra careful ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,they have already investigated she is simply grandstanding ,2,The_Donald
yearp99,because while cnn and the like were talking about o are illy supposed payouts he was talking about news people actually care about ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,apparently they had indisputable evidence that it was delivered from the air what i am saying is that maybe ron paul is right and he was set up they had to hit the base though so it could not happen again ,2,The_Donald
yearp99,yep and i think they were expecting trump to do what hillary wanted and bombed the whole country he took the steam out of their protest with the surgical strike ,2,The_Donald
yearp99,even if he did not personally order it it still could have been someone in his regime and they know it came from that airbase that likely why hitting the base was the best solution ,2,The_Donald
yearp99,not unless we took out hundreds of his troops in an air strike ,2,The_Donald
yearp99,no surprise they had the option of attacking many airbases and almost certainly started nuclear war with russia i guess you could call that the hillary option ,2,The_Donald
yearp99,she probably had all the intel and would have picked the 6 airfield strike ,8,The_Donald
yearp99,well their site has a lot of negativity towards it ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,well he divided the dems now especially since schumer came out in support of the strike pubs were already divided ,4,The_Donald
yearp99,they would never get the votes for that ,2,The_Donald
yearp99,she said it was something common for her to do so i wonder how many other people she did not like she had unmasked for no reason ,4,The_Donald
yearp99,wish i knew he had enough left wing cronies on too to say trump is pulling a 180 and a liar they need to get him off already ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,well apparently russia still did not want to do something according to the reporter not sure of his name ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,for anyone like me looking for more than a twitter image here a link to the pentagon statement http fox43 com 2017 04 06 statement from pentagon spokesman capt jeff davis on america strike in syria ,5,AskThe_Donald
yearp99,can someone point me to an official statement not just a twitter image about russia being notified because it actually says on the fox site that putin was not warned ,5,AskThe_Donald
yearp99,haha you got me ,8,The_Donald
yearp99,i think some trolls are trying to make this sound like we are launching missile strikes all over syria so i am posting a more truthful headline ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,all targeted at the 1 airbase the attack came from ,0,The_Donald
yearp99,update it now 3 men http www seattleweekly com news seattle times 3 men accuse ed murray of sexually abusing them as teenagers ,14,The_Donald
yearp99,anything that hurts america is their agenda ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,the only thing that would surprise me is if this one guy coming forward ends up being the only one ,8,The_Donald
yearp99,it official all the wrong people want action against assad immediately ,271,The_Donald
yearp99,if they could get assad to agree to an election like gaddafi apparently did before he was overthrown that would be a hell of a lot better than another iraq just make sure the democrats are kept in check and do not overthrow him after he agrees ,3,The_Donald
yearp99,the bloodthirsty warmongering democrats are pushing it so you know it a bad move safe zone is better move ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,was not there another sarin gas attack that turned out to be chlorine ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,the globalists see their russia play going down and their acolytes in the democrats going down with it now their acolytes in the republicans are acting up ,8,The_Donald
yearp99,in fairness to blm nobody wants those white cucks who follow them around nearby ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,bannon and trump will probably have a good laugh at it over dinner ,3,The_Donald
yearp99,we know he a warmonger but i think you will need a little more evidence ,4,The_Donald
yearp99,it definitely does not make sense who instigated the false flag if it is a false flag then becomes the question there are a number of possibilities ,5,The_Donald
yearp99,i remember some in the past just today there was this article in the observer where they get some insights from intelligence officials http observer com 2017 04 nsa susan rice donald trump and this ex nsa guy tweeted about her rep https twitter com 20committee status 849240706598260736,1,The_Donald
yearp99,any time you accuse a female democrat of any corruption it sexist let not forget lock her up was also considered sexist ,109,The_Donald
yearp99,and that cut in half they wanted 500 000 to be able to bring in their families ,20,The_Donald
yearp99,from the comments of people in the intelligence community about her it would seem this is how they get revenge on her and it seems well deserved ,7,The_Donald
yearp99,i have heard a guest say that and talk about crowdstrike but whenever the dems bring it up they never mention the fbi did not look at the servers or that crowdstrike now had to change the report ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,absolutely sickening ,9,The_Donald
yearp99,this is just more proof of media collusion with the democrats this is a response to his joke about maxine waters hair ,7,The_Donald
yearp99,here the meat of it since the observer does not play nice with archive is not to put too fine a point on it but susan rice is a deeply unpopular figure with our intelligence community her abrasive personality and overall incompetence grated on the ic her habitually coarse language was inflicted on senior intelligence officials more than once while nobody outside obama s inner circle considered rice even marginally competent at her job simply put she was the worst national security adviser in american history at least until mike flynn s dismally failed three week tenure in addition rice didn t like to play by the rules including the top secret ones on multiple occasions she asked the nsa to do things they regarded as unethical and perhaps illegal when she was turned down the nsa fears breaking laws for any white house since they know they will be left holding the bag in the end rice kept pushing as a longtime nsa official who experienced rice s wrath more than once told me we tried to tell her to pound sand on some things but it wasn t allowed we were always overruled on multiple occasions rice got top agency leadership to approve things which nsa personnel on the front end of the spy business refused this means there may be something congress and the fbi need to investigate here ,10,The_Donald
yearp99,depends on who at the top ,4,The_Donald
yearp99,if she takes the fifth then this gets 1000x bigger ,65,The_Donald
yearp99,well it kayleigh ,2,The_Donald
yearp99,why is it president trump allegation ,4,The_Donald
yearp99,most shocking in that interview was him calling it a dereliction of duty by rice to unmask the names ,10,The_Donald
yearp99,even john mccain said it was probably a dereliction of duty by her john mccain ,2,The_Donald
yearp99,well not like her husband station abc would go against her ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,so even black lives matter cannot stand those white cucks out there with them ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,thanks for the tip guess i need to explore my options but subscribing to cable tv just to subscribe to fox is a waste ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,cnn is probably still waiting for word on exactly how the democrats want them to spin it or if they will ever be allowed to report it ,5,The_Donald
yearp99,i am sure if someone did some digging between names and donors to the dnc they would find them there are certainly lists of reporters who donated to the democrats those lists who only like 1 20 donate to the republicans ,2,The_Donald
yearp99,not even close to all of them not to mention matthews literally worked for some democrat administrations ,2,The_Donald
yearp99,the depressed look on the faces of all those reporters shit trump was right again ,6,The_Donald
yearp99,they are not sending their best ,7,The_Donald
yearp99,she ordered names to be revealed on any surveillance they had that included members of the trump team names of americans are typically masked in obama last days he then issued an order allowing the intelligence to spread to many agencies so it would be difficult to track down what had happened when they leaked the intelligence ,9,The_Donald
yearp99,i have seen him re tweet stuff that turned out to be wrong but his articles from what i have seen are bang on ,2,The_Donald
yearp99,even worse it seems like they funneled money to iran so they could buy the uranium for them ,2,The_Donald
yearp99,wow maher was obliterated in that interview by stone not that it difficult to do that i guess they must have had some laugh signs for the audience because maher talking points were all just stupid and ignorant ,11,The_Donald
yearp99,judge appointed by obama just like obama schoolmate in hawaii that ruled against the travel ban ,3,The_Donald
yearp99,well you have got lynch calling for blood multiple celebrities calling for resist before real violence against trump supporters ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,no wonder the democrats seem to not want him to testify ,9,The_Donald
yearp99,the full article actually was just saying that obama and lynch stopped comey because they thought a report from all the intelligence agencies would be more damaging to trump in other words what we have seen is all they have had got ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,he either a conservative or a pawn of putin ,2,The_Donald
yearp99,now obama and lynch are in on it with trump this is funny stuff ,3,The_Donald
yearp99,i took you up on your advice and i can say she definitely looks close enough ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,obama and clinton family friend lynch stopped comey from taking exposing trump russia connection the lunacy from the left never ends ,3,The_Donald
yearp99,so this is an admittance that the obama white house was leaking intelligence to the clinton campaign ,99,The_Donald
yearp99,she seems crazy and delusional she was not even there since 2015 so unless obama officials were sharing foreign intelligence with her holy shit ,15,The_Donald
yearp99,probably you but good one ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,agreed too me there is not that much of a resemblance other than both are blonde ,2,The_Donald
yearp99,they know the idea of man made climate change inflates gas prices by limiting supply ,9,The_Donald
yearp99,stretch the picture out a little bit vertically and he becomes dr who ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,and 1 3rd of the 61 are probably on welfare so they will vote for a socialist anyways ,3,The_Donald
yearp99,yep just another hit job by the democratic party which includes the msm on nunes ,3,The_Donald
yearp99,8 hours ago and still nothing about it ,2,The_Donald
yearp99,and when i say democrats i do not just mean those on his committee but those asking him in the media ,5,The_Donald
yearp99,i think so it being investigated to what extent who knows ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,he did not want his source to suffer from any bench pressing accidents in the gym ,24,The_Donald
yearp99,we know it authentic since schumer is against it ,72,The_Donald
yearp99,there seems to be a large number of these women but the left chooses to completely ignore them ,3,The_Donald
yearp99,deport them together ,3,The_Donald
yearp99,he also wrote obamacare in a book while in prison with the goal of making it unrepealable ,7,The_Donald
yearp99,so 44 voted in support of foreign laws wth ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,how would they even have gotten the information on this server it was some professor who apparently told them about it how would they have that info ,15,The_Donald
yearp99,yep the left entire agenda has been anti american for at least 50 years ,3,The_Donald
yearp99,they are assuming he would have been on for all we know he may have had something better to do today ,2,The_Donald
yearp99,she my future wife ,23,The_Donald
yearp99,i am not sure if him not being on today was really shit canning ,13,The_Donald
yearp99,the ebola one is the fake ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,probably fake news as it states this was the latest sex attack by migrants in germany when in the time it took to write the article there was probably another attack ,95,The_Donald
yearp99,maybe he just meant that a sitting president cannot order a wiretap from him they can definitely go to the doj and have them do it according to napolitano no judge required ,2,The_Donald
yearp99,yeah it does not make sense after playing the trial i do not see what makes da inquisition a game worthy of 9 and andromeda only a 6 ,1,xboxone
yearp99,but he was great in that movie in which robert de niro played a bounty hunter taking him in ,2,The_Donald
yearp99,i should have said 12 8 of those registered to vote tracked by jury duty ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,the gamespot reviewer gave it a 6 after 65 hours of gameplay stating that they will play some more ,35,xboxone
yearp99,agreed i do not think the trial brought one deep enough into the story to think one way or the other the multiplayer was well done ,2,xboxone
yearp99,china says they would not overreact to being called currency manipulators which means they are currency manipulators ,2,The_Donald
yearp99,while i did not see it live on the west coast i do remember my neighbors son they were peaceful muslims from some non sunni or shia sect cheerfully saying to me as i went into my car saying we bombed new york and i had no idea what they were talking about till i turned the radio ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,yeah but if they think you are going to work illegally you wo not be let in ,2,The_Donald
yearp99,if they gave money to the arts how could they afford to fly private jets around the world for climate change ,2,The_Donald
yearp99,it seems like there is a media blackout on this ,2,The_Donald
yearp99,unfortunately that why they vote for the left wing cucks even though they know their countries are going down the shitter ,3,The_Donald
yearp99,cut them all ,3,The_Donald
yearp99,and in europe it is far far worse ,8,The_Donald
yearp99,well most of the migrants are not thinking islamic invasion they are thinking free stuff ,16,The_Donald
yearp99,too late already been playing it but definitely this guy is an idiot ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,cut the welfare already islamic euro invasion over problem is too many europeans are on welfare too ,39,The_Donald
yearp99,how would it do that if this is the same server as before they said was communicating with alpha bank then it is in pennsylvania ,3,The_Donald
yearp99,lol he pulled out his permitted concealed carry and showed it to juan after unloading it so yes he did pull out his gun ,11,The_Donald
yearp99,the media is going out on a limb to say the wire tapping is not true let hope trump breaks the branch and they all fall down he got 4 days to put everything together ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,this tool has been writing anti trump conspiracy theories for years ,2,The_Donald
yearp99,obama snooping on trump real trump colluding with putin false ,2,The_Donald
yearp99,well now that the dutch people have given them the go ahead ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,let hope whatever coalition they form falls apart fast and there is another election with geert on top ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,how do the seats work exactly in the netherlands is it 50 based on regions and 50 based on population ,5,The_Donald
yearp99,that turnout ,7,The_Donald
yearp99,let hope this makes the french socialists complacent ,7,The_Donald
yearp99,a few elections ago it was 2 weeks ,2,The_Donald
yearp99,one thing is for sure they count votes slow in the netherlands ,12,The_Donald
yearp99,not discouraged since i knew his party would not win a majority of the seats anyways i think some people think the election system in holland works similar to the us it not like geert was going to be president ,4,The_Donald
yearp99,yeah unfortunately i think for the netherlands this election came 6 months or so too early they are falling for all the media lies about brexit it looks like ,3,The_Donald
yearp99,pro eu that says enough ,3,The_Donald
yearp99,ergodan basically gave it to rutte up the ass he did not even expel the turkish ambassador gutless ,5,The_Donald
yearp99,how can anyone honestly believe that the current pm will take a hard line on immigration i guess we will see how stupid people are ,24,The_Donald
yearp99,rofl he had no credibility ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,there other parties that may say that but i am not sure i would believe anyone other than geert ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,i think she was beating fillon in the 2nd round but not macron so no this does not help but there is a macron controversy also that is apparently even bigger being uncovered ,8,The_Donald
yearp99,well that we shall see true pundit has broken stuff early but they have definitely gotten stuff wrong ,0,The_Donald
yearp99,yep ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,true pundit is the source which is the reason for the mark but fbi deputy director mccabe wife is strongly connected to the clintons ,7,The_Donald
yearp99,that would kill facebook ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,what matters though is the final round right now le pen is 22 points down in predictions we must help her get up ,2,The_Donald
yearp99,wow if that does not convince everyone this guy is a shill i do not know what will his show was decent until he got into the relentless trump bashing and now i guess he just decided to shill all the way ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,yep they also cross the line in becoming a cult ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,she canadian kathleen wynne this was a famous story she held a big press conference to say how muslims are nice tolerant etc then had to sit in the back and apparently the imam went on an anti gay rant ,4,The_Donald
yearp99,when does a religion cross the line and stop being a religion that is what needs to be defined if you call for the punishment of those who speak out against your religion in my opinion you have crossed the line ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,no doubt discussing what can we do to make it look like we fixed the election for trump to de legitimize his inevitable win ,1,The_Donald
yearp99,that is some funny stuff damn liberals are so stupid ,4,The_Donald
