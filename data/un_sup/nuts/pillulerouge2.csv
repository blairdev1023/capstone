pillulerouge2,ever since i went mgtow i noticed that while we were in school or at work they are becoming much more predisposed to approach you for small talk finding out what you have been up to and what you intend to do with your studies i am courteous with them and i try to keep my answers short but i found that this makes them double down on their curiosity for some strange reason for example i normally take the last row in the lecture hall and i observed a very strange and predictable pattern at the beginning of the semester it just me at the back of the lecture hall with one or two guys it always the guys who arrive late in class or the guy who just want to play video games during lectures as the semester progress the uber attention whoring females you find in any given class will come trolling for attention by changing their usual position and coming to the last row towards the end of the semester once they get bored with the average desperate chumps saying hello to her every morning they seek new stimuli elsewhere ,2,MGTOW
pillulerouge2,they are able to say politically incorrect things in public without fear from libtards far more effectively that is why feminist hate them because they fear being labeled as bullies ,11,MGTOW

pillulerouge2,turkey has offered to intervene diplomatically in this diplomatic crisis in the gulf there may be a chance to resolve this since it is a neutral country on this issue and the historical role as a former islamic empire ,1,POTUSWatch
pillulerouge2,i was thinking the same thing those are pretty unevenly matched force escalators ,1,POTUSWatch
pillulerouge2,turkey apparently is offering to mediate the diplomatic crisis in the gulf lets see what will happen in the next few weeks and months ,1,POTUSWatch
pillulerouge2,i think i see your point probably what you are describing is what a jean jacques rousseau pre social contract society looked like before the first man thought of a fence and claimed everything within it belongs to him thanks so much again for the book recommendation i will definitely check it out ,1,MGTOW
pillulerouge2,my hunch is the same as yours probably after trump visit in the middle east had to do with this decision it cannot be so arbitrary ,0,POTUSWatch
pillulerouge2,glad for the invite to the op i wish you all the best of luck in what you are trying to achieve from my end i will try to adhere to the community guidelines as much as possible it hard enough to find an online community which is not an echo chamber of people who agree with everything you believe in some things are not necessarily bifurcated on the basis of bipartisan left right stances ,3,POTUSWatch

pillulerouge2,we saw that dance being performed and i remember one of the questions we kept asking the guide was the question of the risk of hiv infection being a very small tightly knit tribe with a small population you can imagine what would happen if one person got infected with an std since the ethiopian government has started building new roads into some of these tribal areas but it still by no means easily accessible you need a 4x4 perhaps i should not have used the word promiscuity or sexual freedom since they are culturally loaded words add to that the local guide could not understand their language completely given that his mother tongue was amharic but he knew his stuff well and had a good knowledge of the region and the cultures that i could vouch for our gps position showed that we were almost at the mouth of lake turkana and the omo river but even then when i google search the inhabitants of that region i still have not managed to find the name i could ask my colleagues but they were probably so much engrossed in other distractions they kept complaining of the heat and mosquitoes ,1,MGTOW
pillulerouge2,if it was a male boss who behaved like this i would say just keep your head down and do your job and what he says without question but with a woman even if you keep your head down or even do not offer suggestions once the female hive mind designates you to particular box of ally or foe you cannot really do anything to change her mind do not ever again repeat the mistake of asking a woman why she is unnecessarily harsh with you in the work place she may not even know herself why she feels like that you watch once you keep your head down she will immediately come looking for you spoiling for provocation hang in there as necessary as possible as you look for a new job ,4,MGTOW
pillulerouge2,it an online forum for one and secondly i am willing to give men a chance to vent their anger you see for men unlike women they get to do something with their passion and from it they procure reason and logic to sometimes defend what they are passionate about that why our gender has a complete monopoly of philosophy literature religion and science indeed the most profound and thought provoking ideas that i have come to recently appreciate has been thanks to the mgtow forums some men in the mgtow communities are potential intellectual giants and indeed some may not even know it with no appeal to flattery whatsoever within mgtow i have encountered men who could easily defend their position and propose a hypothesis so well that they can go head to head with the best anthropologists and sociologists our time ,1,MGTOW

pillulerouge2,that is one aspect of climate change most eco friendly people do not seem to get why buy two cars if one can do it job well for example why have an ipad and an iphone why accumulate so much unnecessary electronic products that replicate each others functions by such simple actions you manage to create a huge trail of electronic waste ,1,france

pillulerouge2,voici leurs divergences qui ont un cons quence sur h r dit selon the scientific american however our shared habits behaviors and experiences are not genetic but are still heritable traits there are is a great likelihood we share these traits with our relatives heritability is the likelihood of getting something in other words you might get it it s not automatic like genetic inheritance but the chances look good the important thing to keep in mind is that inherited traits are directly passed down from parents to children whereas heritable traits are not necessarily genetic je me suis compl tement perdu car en fran ais il me semble comme s il n y a pas les adjectifs juste pour nuancer a ,1,france
pillulerouge2,hahaha that so funny ,1,MGTOW
pillulerouge2,you came to the wrong thread brother but since you are a still young man let me give you some advice eventually you will have to decide what you rethink your value system pussy or male sovereignty as someone in the thread has suggested take away her physical beauty and the sex she gives you and tell me if you would tolerate such kind of behavior from a man let alone your relative ,3,MGTOW
pillulerouge2,i can assure you that it would go down that eventually she is basically laying down the ground work to feel entitled enough to get angry if i refuse ,1,MGTOW
pillulerouge2,bar bar was the best in my opinion his ability to see the unseen future makes his analysis so incisive he deconstructed the skeptical community so well for example that just by watching these clowns recently fall head over heels in love immediately after lacy green supposedly took the red pill was like d j vu the female to male relationship dynamic has thrown their love for reason and logic the moment an attention seeking whore crossed over sides he foresaw this many years ago ,4,MGTOW
pillulerouge2,why do you need to keep male friends check the definition of solipsism first because by now i am starting to feel so sorry for your so called friends your imaginary big world full of male admirers and an imaginary huge audience can never allow you to make friends with your own gender because we both know women will never give you such kind of attention get off your high horse because age will catch up with you and you will be invisible to the rest of the world ,2,intj
pillulerouge2,i also think that 4x4 conversions would easily fit the same mgtow cool projects i read about a guy who converted a toyota landcruiser into an ultimate survival machine just by spending most of his free time in the garage he did a reconversion that was so badass that in one modification he installed long range fuel tanks capable of covering 1500 kms he called it end the post nuclear apocalypse survival rig that just gave me goosebumps imagining welding in the new modifications ,2,MGTOW
pillulerouge2, pc rigs are so mgtow great project to embark upon ,16,MGTOW
pillulerouge2,i was listening to an english podcast the other day and one of the guest predicted that thanks to emojis and abbreviations we would slowly be unable to describe nuanced situations using words because we simply will have opted out the possibility of bothering to find the best word ,2,MGTOW
pillulerouge2,you are welcome brother ,1,MGTOW
pillulerouge2,good for you bro you learnt the lesson and you are mgtow fuck these whores,6,MGTOW
pillulerouge2,yeah and then some feminist intellectual hacks started calling it the glass cliff effect essentially saying that when women get eventually to be ceos they are more than likely to be promoted in to the position just when the company is about to go into a financial down turn ,2,MGTOW
pillulerouge2,they cannot even ask for help in an honorable way they have to pull the manipulative card with men ironically with other female classmates they will rarely ask any female who is not in her circle of girlfriends ,48,MGTOW
pillulerouge2,i agree with you that is why am glad i found mgtow because being a pua is just another form of nourishing gynocentrism by getting pussy for the sake of it ,1,MGTOW
pillulerouge2,thanks for your sentiments i intend to just do that going my own way ,2,MGTOW
pillulerouge2,am glad that even if she wanted to move over here she is will not survive for long she simply does not have the patience to learn a new language since here hardly anyone speaks english i was even surprised that she wrote the email without using shorthand her written english was just like that of your dumb average females lots of abbreviations and emojis ,1,MGTOW
pillulerouge2,i am assuring you one day she will slither back into your life with some lame message to gauge the depth of the waters the ease to which they are prone boredom and shallowness will propel her to seek the thrill of the possibility of restarting a relationship with you or just seek attention like the attention whores they are ,3,MGTOW
pillulerouge2,you are so right they way they slither back into your life is always so well timed ,3,MGTOW
pillulerouge2,women build alliances and not friendships that is why you should never also be professional acquaintances with these snakes in the work place ,7,MGTOW

pillulerouge2,yeah she contacted me by the gmail account ,3,MGTOW
pillulerouge2,and they do it an embarassingly casual way ,12,MGTOW
pillulerouge2,it is her lame strategy of initiating contact by framing it as purely business plus the motorcyle thing that to her is to remind me she still remembers my interests ,10,MGTOW
pillulerouge2,i am in another country so that is not an option and even if we were to go back to my home country i would still avoid her like the plague ,5,MGTOW
pillulerouge2,i do not intend even to ever talk to her again no need for their games,13,MGTOW
pillulerouge2,you are right she must have purposefully put that in there so as to eventually ask for it somewhere down the line,19,MGTOW
pillulerouge2,the entitlement with these people is just shocking ,45,MGTOW
pillulerouge2,i knew a guy who was literally screwed so bad by his ex wife financially after divorce he lost his house and moved to a part of town mainly inhabited by college students just to make ends meet keep in mind he was an airline pilot with a middle eastern airline company so the money was good he literally was at end of mental sanity and he just quit his job but something happened i do not know he did it but he made a huge unexpected come back even his brother was surprised he moved to africa and he entered into a business partnership with a friend and they have a small company with some few cessna planes and they are basically bush pilots flying tourists to see animals he looks so happy it unbelievable how men can reinvent themselves particularly with a good friend by your side ,1,MGTOW

pillulerouge2,the reason why that french system of the ballot would not work in america is because france has a longer and tried history of multiple political clivages which even the two biggest parties in france are incapable of representing their interests efficiently that means there are so many politically diverse groups independent from the potential cannibalization by bigger parties because even at the legislative level they have a possibility of being represented because the number of senate seats may vary from one election to another a single department for example depending on the number of votes gotten at the ballot may end having two people from two different parties holding the same position it a delicate balance of political representation that for example farmers teachers folks in the rural areas factory workers with their powerful unions and even small catholic associations with a wide variety of interests have the possibility of representation in local government much more effectively without being a members of the biggest parties lastly political parties have limits on spending during campaigns since they receive government funding the crazy donations american parties receive narrows the political spectrum to strict bipartisanship since the big donors make more safer bets when the outcome is a 50 50 affair ,0,worldnews
pillulerouge2,bipartisanship is in the process of ending anyway the swing voters are increasingly going to influence politics and then what we will end up having is more of centre right vs centre left which means the extreme left and the extreme left will no longer dictate and bog down the republican party and the democratic party ,0,worldnews
pillulerouge2,i guess that why hippies love taoism have been watching hippies on youtube for the last two hours giving lessons on wellness and balanced life by heavily quoting the chinese philosophers it quite hilarious to watch now that you said that the chinese philosophers were sometimes deliberately vague ,1,MGTOW
pillulerouge2,she clearly showed what her priorities are in her life do not feel the need to be compelled to be the bigger man in every situation because it is not warranted every time you made the right decision ,5,MGTOW
pillulerouge2, ao te ching i am trying to read it now and i do not know whether it a translation problem or maybe reading it in the orignal language would help but you are so right it is very vague you need to read a sentence at least three times i feel sometimes during oriental philosophy lectures a chinese lecturer who is bilingual would help us get through some ideas not that our teacher is not well versed in the subject but i feel chinese metaphysics needs somebody who is good at the language as well ,1,MGTOW
pillulerouge2,you do understand this is ancient chinese history and the ruthless power politics among chinese nobility long before confucius ideas were adopted the chinese imperial court was sometimes dominated by psychopathic and very cruel tyrants all bets are off was the name of the game before the moral philosophy of confucius was adopted it was not uncommon for you to hear of fratricides for example in the imperial court which was the accepted price of doing business to get power you see raw carnal fear was how chinese emperors maintained their power by using such psychopathic power games just to demonstrate a point of who is the boss now that you familiar with the context of the time reverse the roles and imagine the same situation where your wife a high ranking official in the court is tasked with the job of killing your father because the king ordered her to do it but despite the risk on her safety she confides in you because she is your wife in this case would you rather she kept it to herself or in this case would you want her to confide in you so that what you can in turn kill her do keep in mind also the husband and the wife family are chinese nobility very close to power they could easily combine forces with other neighbouring kingdoms who were constantly at war with them and overthrow that asshole it was a very common practice back then hell even the eunuchs did conspire against tyrannical emperors successfully and overthrow an entire dynasty when the emperor went too far take the wife away as the middle man and it would have been better if the marquis had died at the hands of his father in law had he chosen to go to thim to tell him about the plot himself that we may never know off course will we ,2,MGTOW
pillulerouge2,i think that is why matriarchal religions seem for most part seem to have a great deal of affinity and bias towards sensuality or fertility perhaps buddha did not want such kind of distractions among his disciples ,1,MGTOW
pillulerouge2,in fact chinese calligraphy and characters depicted an argument as one where two women are staying under the same roof ,2,MGTOW
pillulerouge2,he is not a thinker per se but i like one particular eunuch bureaucrat who spent his time around the emperor and around the women of the imperial court he had a survival guide to navigate the daily court politics but also the drama and the manipulations of the women be it in the emperor harem or the favorite emperor mistress he saw first hand their conniving nature and manipulations to ensure their children get to the very top of chinese court for example cannot remember his name for now but he used to say something like the patience of a woman can roast a cow with a lantern i am already so confused with these names and i end up mixing up the dynasties it a very old civilization many things still remain unknown about the ancient chinese history sometimes some historical events end up taking on different narratives with time they become part fable part religion part philosophy and part spin doctors taking charge of the palace documents ,2,MGTOW
pillulerouge2,there is this cautionary tale ancient chinese noble men lived by they knew a woman obligation to her husband is not the same obligation a husband has for the wife so here is the short version of the story the marquis of zheng was given an order by the emperor to kill his father in law the marquis of zheng being the typical dutiful chinese bureaucrat of that era feels he owes it to the wife to share this information the wife upon hearing this news goes to her mother to ask for advice the mother tells her this now famous quote my daughter all men are potential husbands but you only have one father from the valuable advice she gets the wife later goes and kills the husband upon learning what had transpired the emperor laughs saying his marquis invited his own fate the moment he opened his mouth to tell a woman a secret ,2,MGTOW
pillulerouge2,you do know that at the sunset years of the roman empire there was some kind of women group a proto kind of feminist movement that loved trolling high ranking roman officials so as to be involved in decision making ,3,MGTOW
pillulerouge2,i see what you are doing there the pseudo peer reviewer trolling concerned about the fair and balanced views mgtows have on the behavior of women surely you are not concerned about the soundness of the inductive reasoning behind that post so would you have loved a list of qualifiers to show that men are equally implicated in the same kind of behavior ,1,MGTOW
pillulerouge2,star dusk talked of the male desire for non freedom that desire is something that even rational males cannot fathom moreover when females are in the picture if you want to warn him and drop some hints do not go for a face to face conversation because men rarely open to each other like that send him a link for example of the tom leykis show on the pretext that you found the episode interesting and that how you plant the red pill ideas ,2,MGTOW
pillulerouge2,to answer your question look at how women vote vs how men vote in a democratic society generally the women will because of their bilogical imperative to want security will overwhelmingly vote for leftist policies women have also been shown to equally to adapt much faster than men in totalitarian societies they will instictually choose not to resist tyrants and dictators and will largely remain passive as their men get jailed and shot why the biological imperative for females to want security to ensure survival of their children that why political freedom is not just a pressing priority for females as it is for men ,0,PoliticalPhilosophy
pillulerouge2,i would argue that the liberal thought both in the sphere of international relations and domestic policy is increasingly getting undermined by the gradual fusioning or rather the gradual dilution of the right vs left politcal cleavage in the market place of ideas that will shape politics in future i see a cold heart pragmatic approach to politics what works is the truth and what does not is false will be the guilding principle henceforth political parties in the west will eventually take characteristics of the chinese communist party it is communist only in name after all nowadays ,1,PoliticalPhilosophy
pillulerouge2,look men nobody is arguing with those statistics but every time when men get to discuss any ideas on such internet forums why should race be an issue of all places in mgtow what does crime statistics have to do with men going their own way for example keep in mind nowhere did anybody talk about the sociology of crime and race but if from those statistics you treat me as a black man as a statistic reflecting of all black men i cannot do anything about that i did not choose to have kinky hair and dark skin and for your information you do not have to like a black man to be a functional human being or mgtow for that matter go you own way my brother but do not look for an ego boost by taking cheap shots at your fellow men such kind of pettiness and backhandedness is something bitchy teenage girls do but not men ,1,MGTOW

pillulerouge2,ooooh yes computing power rocks it makes me happy to embark on this project building an ultimate pc rig is the most thrilling thing a man can do without some bitch nagging you all the time after that it the next project a toyota landcruiser conversion project this 4x4 machine has a good platform to build upon a post apocalyptic machine in order to survive a post nuclear war the way shit is going has only made me take precautions and see the unseen and no woman will be there to nag ask me why i am spending money like that ,3,MGTOW
pillulerouge2,as the more men take the red pill and becoming aware of mgtow and with mainstream media getting to define the narrative of who mgtows are am afraid these race nationalists will find a movement to cannibalise upon with their conspiracy theories,3,MGTOW

pillulerouge2,it basically all about control and manipulations that is why mgtow is helpful because you will not engage in games with these women,3,MGTOW
pillulerouge2,you are right women feed off from very many different narcissistic sources which give readily narcissistic supply for an all consuming never satisfied feminine ego and thus criticizing a woman will immediately upset her the balance of power she maintains in social interactions it s all about sly and petty games with these people and your alliance with her is henceforth terminated forever ,1,MGTOW
pillulerouge2,exactly they are from the greek philosopher aristotle derived from his works the nichomachean ethics ,1,MGTOW

pillulerouge2,mgtow changes your outlook on life completely mgtow forever brother,5,MGTOW
