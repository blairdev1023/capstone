thekonzo,dude that experiment is fully retarded of course kids are gonna prefer people who look like their parents or close family friends caretakers socially and sexually as far as i can tell they did not include mixed race or cross race adopted children but only ones that are pretty much only exposed to people that look like them all it shows is that babies are very influenced by how mom and dad look like and that we already knew i know you were trying to support the argument tend to naturally segregate by default and this article does but there is a very good chance that this is about early childhood experiences and not about genes ergo a sligthly better experiment would only really support the argument babies are strongly influenced by their surrounding ,1,WhiteRights
thekonzo, the same goes for homosexuals who in their right mind would stick their penis in the anus of another man that not only disgusting but it causes disease hence the high rate of aids in the gay community a basic theory is that they are exposed to hormones in the mothers womb and their brain and body develops differently because of it it causes no harm though they feel attracted to the same sex they are born with but can be totally happy can be a perfetly fine part of society can make perfect parents your worry about accepting mental illness in their case is very irrational judging from your comment its based on personal and cultural disgust this is very harmful and unfair towards gay people as a religious person you probably have attachement to the simple concepts of man and woman and how god planned this and how modern atheists are now going against their creator or some shit but its actually just a biological reality and its something that might have evolved because it was benifitial to a tribe sure if you feel strongly about male and female identity and gays are in conflict with that you will continue having some issues with gay people but at the very least you should tone it down when it comes to the mental illness accusation regarding transgender people its alot more nuanced way less people affected the stats are very iffy you gave a good example regarding suicide rates while homosexuality is just about basic sexual attraction and when their brain gives them a boner or a wet pussy transgenderism is more psychological about identity and who you recognise when you look into the mirror there is a chance that a bunch of them are as you say mentally ill in some form and fixate on the gender sex part of their identity but even gender type treatment wouldnt help because there might be something else going on but for a number of others just hormones seem to do wonders and it is very reasonable to assume that they might actually have been born with the wrong brain body combination and that a simple fix allows for a happy life which is pretty amazing when it works your beliefs are meaningless they have no value they will die with you that sounds very different from what you said earlier about everyone having a right to their opinion or whatever hence the high rate of aids in the gay community furthermore homosexuality emasculates men leading to a weak society that is unable to defend itself and that falls pray to excessive tolerance even when the people you are tolerating want to kill you no the west is dead you are not giving very convincing arguments here the aids thing has decreased dramatically there was just a very dramatic period of time kind of caused by men having a higher sex drive and a men men sex culture obviously being prone to being a bit rabbit like homosexuality emasculates men you again make it sound like there was a choice to begin with gay men just are born more feminin most of the time and thats just how it is doesnt mean they cant be kickass politicians or scientists or artists or athletes i would say keeping their talents and happiness down weakens society and ethics men die but the soul lives on and as a follower of christ i believe that the immortal soul will be returned to the body on the day of judgement after which we will spend eternity according to how we lived our lives if you put your faith in vanity then you will reap no reward but if you put your faith in immortal values in ultimate truth as opposed to the lie of relativism then you will look forward to your eternity or you know maybe you are wrong maybe you are following an evil god without knowing it maybe you are following a god that doesnt exist maybe you are just following what feels good to you emotionally and disregard the pain it causes for others i seriously wish you the best and am glad that you at the very least try to keep things civil i hope you make more positive experiences with people of different skin colors and sexualities i hope you have a fulfilling life with a great family and dont depend as much on arbitrary group belonging for your identity i hope you can find happiness without needing to follow ancient books written by some dudes that might give you all the answers you need in your life i hope that your slavic country and the west and the entire humanity prospers without needing to keep anyone down or out and you know what throw the eternal life in as well i hope upon death we merge back into the spirit realm of endless consciousness and witness how amazing things will be but most of all i hope you wont get a gay kid because his her early life will be a fucking nightmare unless you manage to drop your bigotry and care more about human connection and less about random ass cultural ideals ,-1,WhiteRights
thekonzo, and again you are free to think whatever you want hey thanks that makes discussions productive however which civilization do you think will still be around in 1 000 years slavic christian civilization or degenerate western civilization with no faith or identity or moral values since atheism and progressive values are a natural occurance in a more free and wealthy society then hopefully the latter will be the case again these problems were not created they were revealed and adressed can you explain how acceptance of gays causes any harm for anyone or why it would be superior to punish them and pretend they dont exist if the u k makes it past 2050 without becoming an islamic republic heeeeere we go with the fearmongering outrage and fantasy of racial wars the blacks and muslims are invading us and will take over politics and outbreed us and destroy us do you also believe this is all planned by the jews anyways pretty sad that you are ignorant about how insulting you are towards gay and trans people who did not have a choice in the way they were born and who are doing no harm ,0,WhiteRights
thekonzo,very insulting and condescending stances on atheism and homosexuality you are showing there yeah those problems did not exist when people were closing their eyes or supressing their visibility complete garabge worldviews and cultural identity if you want to see it as that luckily you are not an atheist homosexual so you arent really affected by this line of thinking ,1,WhiteRights
thekonzo,i think your children wont really have to care about any of that and rather take part in other forms of culture i have not lost any soul i take that accusation as an insult hardships tend to arise in a spiritual vacuum that part i can agree with its a spiritual bandaid though the actual fix would be education fulfilling lives health mental health among other things there are reasons for religion and spirituality and generally identity stuff to have come into existence and have helped and there are reasons for why they arent perfect or needed or good even these days ,1,WhiteRights
thekonzo,i care more about resolving that hardship more than anything else i live alot closer to slavic countries and have made some experience with nice and awful people from a bunch of those countries ,1,WhiteRights
thekonzo,sounds like a shit thing to have culture and soul revolve around ,1,WhiteRights
thekonzo,sounds like a shitty aspect of culture to me i bet that there are a good amount of slavs that feel different about it i bet things are gonna improve over time i am also mostly very attracted to whites and asians which directly correlates with who i grew up with but if i had made different experiences as a child it would probably be quite different ,1,WhiteRights
thekonzo,however there is a good chance that if you spend time with people of different looks or cultures and made positive experiences that at some point you will look back and think well i wonder what i was on about back then wanting to be around white people and serbs and maybe if you had a latino girlfriend or children with someone from somewhere you would see these attitudes that you were describing and defending as more of a threat or at least insult to your friends and family i know its just how you feel and a certain preference is not inherently racist or wrong even but i feel you are giving the tend to naturally segregate by default argument too much value its alot about personal experiences when it comes to sexual preference for example to early childhood experiences and what you are defending might just be a self perpetuating system i have not yet seen an argument against multiculturalism humanism that does not boil down to way other problems and way different symptoms where the less educated people just focus on the racial conflict and identity because it makes them feel better not saying this applies to you ,1,WhiteRights
thekonzo,i mean who are you to tell me that i cant judge people for being dickheads anyways as long as you are still capable of taking a stance and as long as you dont mistake new wave nationalism for a natural movement compared to the controlled cooperate multiculturalism and are capable of viewing them both in their best light i guess its fine for now then ,-1,WhiteRights
thekonzo,well i somewhat agree with that but i am starting to dislike any culture that is exclusive especially based on stupid shit like skin color if there is an asian neighbourhood with asian shops that only allows for asians then following your logic yeah they should maybe be allowed to do it as long as they dont really harm anyone but they are still complete dickheads and pathetic in their need for racial purity its not even about preserving culture at that point whatever that would mean anyways the i am a realist not an idealist reminds me alot of the many radical centrists these days that take outrage as proof of need for change incapable of taking a stance when the outrage dumb or manufactured even just intimidated and easily influenced by angry rants ,-1,WhiteRights

thekonzo,((())) are turning us into cucks that dont want children with their feminized family propaganda and we cant get jobs because of them and that was the plan so they can replace us with people that look differently and dont belong to us i am insecure about my identity and just the word replace triggers and bothers me greatly even when explanation is given in the same sentence ,10,WhiteRights
thekonzo,exactly i like deep stories most of the time thats why i dont watch or read the stuff that feels more like fanservice or stupid fun to me unless its supposed to be really good however there are consequences also eu stuff does afterall use resources like money and attention for the characters and bad content can reflect badly on old works it can delay things for many years it can sway public opinion and suddenly investments are more unattractive ,-7,books
thekonzo,well it might be cool but its still fanservicy and does not tell the deeply meaningful stories that the characters were crafted for i am all for expanded universe stuff for superheroes that quickly finish their character progression and defeat their villain and dont really have too much further struggle but batman watchman x men those have such large solid worldbuilding and conflicts that anything else is really just a distraction from that ,-23,books
thekonzo,exactly this is where the confusion is stemming from you have an expectation of what roadhog should be because he is declared a tank in the character selection but that does not align with what blizzard wants him to be he is a beefy damage dealer and they view all damage dealers as basically assassins also stop listing a heroes abilities to make him sound broken he is not a must pick far from it he is just a little too frustrating to play against and causes problems for the reaper balance ,6,Competitiveoverwatch

thekonzo,i loved the firsts season of hannibal i hated watching the later ones my favourite show running at the moment would be better call saul it has amazing shots also but they usually have a meaning and are worth thinking about for a second some find this show too slow compared to bb but i cant relate i think its more about it not being directly connected to crime half the time and those viewers are not looking for a great light drama but more action and threat probably i just needed the storyline for shadow to start a little differently if i am lucky i will still get hooked at some point when the actual plot starts and he has a personality and gets to make choices right right now its just divine people being a little mad and random and having their way of getting people to worship explained while shadow is confused about everything and his wife until wednesday will explain a little bit more ,4,television
thekonzo,well in my opinion the artsy production in american gods does not really have meaning in mind while showing you it which is why i call it pretentious similar to the later seasons of hannibal some people really love it i find it amateurish its not picasso to me but someone imitating it badly i will probably keep watching a little bit until there is any sort of narrative pull so i can better judge it but again so far the only thing i am impressed with is the premise and i think a different team of creators would have made a great show with it ,-3,television
thekonzo,well that scene was kinda good but overall i am let down by the series so far after having it recommended to me alot i really like the premise i always wanted something like this with gods living among us in modern life but i find the story and characters so far very meh sure the wednesday actor is doing pretty well and the protagonist is supposed to be all confused at the moment but there just hasnt been anything yet that makes plot interesting really just a few crazy people talking funny with pretentious tryhard production i liked preacher better and that show should have had like 5 episodes less because it was that slow and boring at times ,4,television
thekonzo,wait he wanted the us to lose influence and wanted the eu to be stronger you really think trump thinks like that ,7,geopolitics

thekonzo,i meant compared to breaking bad jimmys hopes and dreams change but he is crooked from the very first episode onwards he is more along the lines of the goodhearted trickster character that got alot of shit in life he will descend eventually too but i mean walter goes from family father to child murdering drug lord ,3,television
thekonzo,i agree with the guy better call saul is different from bb it is more lighthearted and optimistic more clean more about struggle than descent it has just as much creative spark as breaking bad even though the concept is a little less interesting every single episode so far has been great while with breaking bad i had to take a few breaks because it did not have enough narrative pull you keep talking about iconic lines or scenes but i think that is a very bad way of approaching the how good is this show question things that stick out here are personal and suddle and happen constantly like his bottle not fitting in the cupholder in the car he got from the new job every few episodes i am impressed with how they managed to pull off the construction of the show in a way so i could not imagine it being done better or doing it better myself this is pretty rare ,3,television

thekonzo,1 people can give feedback 2 progression models are an intrinsic part to game design its not about players being greedy its about players wanting a rewarding experience hearthstone heavily leans towards pay2win and pay2progress 3 purchases in this game are not worthwhile you dont get enough bang for your buck 4 stop using this your entitled argument it makes you look like an ignorant idiot ,2,hearthstone
thekonzo,building your business on gambling addiction and whale hunting is monetizing mental conditions ,6,hearthstone
thekonzo,we told them back in alpha the game wont work without better progression and without rebalancing they just dont care they dont want to make a good game but to monetize whales people with mental conditions ,1,hearthstone
thekonzo,i think the bigger problem is just loss of customer good will and loss of potential money in the future whoever is calling the shots with hearthstones monetization and direction that guy should step on legos for the rest of his life fucking ruined opportunity of making an amazing game ,1,hearthstone
thekonzo,i am having a blast with hots at the moment as a former hardcore league a bit of dota player and someone who is quite busy with overwatch pubg and rust this was the last thing i expected the new progression is good i think i can finally play with loads of new heroes and play around with some really interesting kit designs ,2,hearthstone

thekonzo,where does this meme come from i mean i have been saying this exact thing on reddit for many years but got downvoted constantly until 1 5 years ago when this subreddit became less of a fanboy circlejerk ,1,hearthstone
thekonzo,how could anyone have known a few years ago that one can sell a game for like 30 bucks and have cosmetics in them maybe even tied into some progression model must have been so hard for those poor souls to think all by themselves and without any other games doing that ,-1,hearthstone
thekonzo,if the game was twice as expensive and had half the progression speed youd probably still be here spouting this your entitled garbage ,10,hearthstone
thekonzo,its fine judging from his follow up comment the guy seems ot be a bit of a jerk and i understand what you mean with sometimes just putting your thoughts and feelings out there we shouldnt feel too insecure about posting something like that it is nice to be reminded of that even games that are often criticized around here might have meant a valuable experience to some people in some form i am lucky in that i have not experienced someone very very important to me dying yet and not everyone has strong friendships like that to begin with what character do you think your buddy would main in overwatch ,1,Games
thekonzo,i mostly agree but its unrealistic society still cares about the traditional concept of marriage i dont know what to tell you when it comes to this topic i care less about a look into the future than about making sure that gay youth dont grow up feeling like second class citizens asap discrimination is a threat to mental health your suggestion would only work if you made it so marriage is only an obscure catholic thing with zero meaning outside of their faith ,1,worldnews
thekonzo,dont spend money until they make purchases feel more worthwhile duplicates giving 200 instead of 3000 getting old legendaries instead of the ones from the event in general still 3000 gold costs when the event has so many more skins to collect this time i am sorry this happened to you this time but this constantly happened to people in the last events too blizzard does not seem to care about the individual experience they are okay with having the progression feel less rewarding they are okay with having purchases feel not worthwhile the only explanation is that they are back to whale hunting and abusing mental conditions for monetary gain ,2,Overwatch
thekonzo,okay lets survey people on the street and ask them if they would be okay with not being allowed to marry because of a quality of theirs and instead have the secondary thing civil union lets ask them if they would enjoy that on average ,2,worldnews
thekonzo,i very much agree when you buy lootboxes and only really get old skins duplicates and legendary gold and you those dont even come close to helping with the 3000 x 12 skins price tag its really not reliably worthwhile to purchase things in the game the progression also feels pretty bad when there are so many skins to collect but with the same short time span and same high costs ,0,Games
thekonzo,its the progression model of the game it does affect alot of peoples enjoyment with the game ,1,Games
thekonzo,i dont know why you got downvoted i personally agree and also with this many legendary skins released at the same 3000 price tag without adjustments for amount of new skins in a short event without adjustments for duplicate bullshit i just wont spend money anymore blizzard is back to whale hunting they know lootboxes are part of the progression model and dont want playing alot to feel reliably rewarding they dont want purchases to feel worthwhile it just pretty sad that they have to keep fucking up ,2,Games
thekonzo,lootboxes are part of the progression in overwatch when they meddle with it then the game feels different to play for many blizzard sold many many copies one of the big problems is not dlc but whale hunting hearthstone and this overwatch event are big whale bait which is unethical and feels bad for regular players the purchases feel less worthwhile especially duplicates and the chance of getting non event skins it can feel very bad to spend money which is why i wont spend more money on it its always worth talking about this and giving feedback and wanting to improve things for the most optimal win win i am not saying dlc is evil but i am saying its often done in a suboptimal way ,1,Games

thekonzo,why the fuck can you get non event skins why the fuck can you get duplicates why the fuck do duplicates give 200 gold compared to the 3000 they should why the fuck are they not adjusting the gold prices when they release more skins in an event especially an anniversary event that pretends to be a thank you for this year why the fuck do dance emotes cost 750 gold why the fuck do they go back to unethical whale hunting when they can just improve the progression and the feel of purchases ,4,Games
thekonzo,lootboxes are the progression model of the game how can you be blind to this are you seriously this stupid ,1,Games
thekonzo,they cost 3000 gold when the game was released the legendary skins costed 1000 gold and that was viewed as quite a bit then the first event happened and the event skins were not purchasable at all then outrage happened and we got the 3000 price tag which was somewhat accetable when people did not like every skin and there were only a few per event and there were epic skins for 750 too but now we have 12 legendary skins which means 36 000 gold the funniest thing is that you can get duplicates still and do you know how much gold oyu get when you get one 200 gold basically something that could have been 3000 gives you 200 instead and 200 36000 that takes a while i personally am not gonna buy lootboxes anymore until i cant get fucked over by being unlucky or getting duplicates it just feels soooooo bad and i am getting a bad image of the overwatch team now that they are cranking out so many so expensive skins without any price adjustments its just insulting once again lootboxes are part of the progression model you were supposed to get a real good amount of the skins if you play alot and you were supposed to have a great feeling about investing a bit of money in crates and getting great return now its back to whale hunting for blizzard and abusing mental conditions for monetary gain ,3,Games
thekonzo,the problem are the laughable duplicate compensations and there being so many 3000 gold priced skins now progression does not feel rewarding enough and purchases dont feel fun enough blizzard needs to look at this unless they once again said f it and decided to build their business on whale hunting basically abusing a mental condition ,1,Games
thekonzo,cosmetics are part of the progression system when things feel harder to obtain then the progression model feels less rewarding perfect case would be if you could get alot of things when you play alot but purchases feel very worthwhile instead when i bought crates for 20 euros i got a bunch of duplicates which give a laughable amount of currency compared to the fucking 3000 gold it costs it feels fucking horrible please stop using this argument ala people are feeling entitled its about making for a win win for a situation where purchases feel great where playing feels rewarding where the game is not financed through whale hunting bordering on abusing mental conditions but through goodwill and fun also the people who you are talking to here already purchased the game and most probably bought a bunch of boxes so we have already paid blizzards bills for a long time if being a fan alone wasnt qualification enough for feedback this sure would be ,1,Games
thekonzo,at least we know that all hope for hearthstone is lost and that its shit development overwatch was supposed to be the chosen one but then we got the summer games but that was kind of dealt with but now we definitely have too many events and too many expensive skins even when you spend 20 dollars every event that still does not give you good stuff reliably how can they seriously do this 200 gold for a 3000 skin duplicate thing its one of the worst feelings ever it makes purchases feel horrible it all makes the events feel greedy ,2,Games
thekonzo,its a legal and cultural union that kind of celebrates family and society i am not crazy about it either but as long as marriage has big cultural relevance you should care about its form even if we get rid of marriages all together in 20 years it doesnt mean we wouldnt have to fix its problems right now discrimination on that official a level something so essential to current culture its baffling when people actually think them fags already got civil unions and they still want more now they want to pretend they can be a family a building block of society ,1,worldnews
thekonzo,how is it good enough civil unions are not the same thing culturally so you would advocate for this type of inequality on a cultural level marriage is not a religious thing anything short of equality is discrimination its not that much to ask for even just treating people with the respect you want to be treated with its not some sort of bonus ,14,worldnews

thekonzo,if the bundles are not a recurring thing then the hots people are truly insane for me too it was a game changer most people coming from league or that have made bad experiences with progression in f2p games knew exactly that it would not be worth it to grind for ages in hots when its supposed to be a casual game it came across as a joke hots was a joke i know pay2progress can mean a fuckton of money from whales rip ethics but sometimes you have to think about customer good will and reputation as well the only way of emotionally dealing with how horribly shitty hearthstone is compared to overwatch is to treat them as products of different companies basically how can you make something with so much potential so horrible and get even your most dedicated fans and players to start to resent you and regret the time and money spent hearthstone is part mobile at least hots doesnt have that apocalypse wasteland territory excuse so get your shit together ,1,heroesofthestorm

thekonzo,i think there is alot of truth to that i am glad you have that kind of perspective i had some pretty exhausting discussions about whitewashing recently pretty annoying when there is an actual problem but most of the people talking about it use the wrong examples and mention the wrong reasons this whole race thing has me so confused at the moment on the one hand i see it really only as culture instead of race but on the other hand in historical stories or fantasy worldbuilding it adds so much flavor it probably comes down to traditional storytelling becoming harder in a modern setting when there are less conflicts and characters are too smart and lacking faults ,4,AskReddit
thekonzo,because its kind of an underdog game even though its blizzards it has been rightfully dismissed as failed and greedy but this has been addressed a good amount and the fans want to use the opportunity to grow the community when being very invested in competitive action games the community is half the fun super smash melee is a great game but the community around it is just as special ,4,heroesofthestorm
thekonzo,yeah most japanese movies and adaptions are garbage tier and i dont even count them you might see this as a typical western perspective or want for whitewashing but many asian anime and game characters are caucasian and its kind of important to the story attack on titan and fmab are stories where races do matter some amount and they instead slap on a blond wig ,19,AskReddit

thekonzo,some hero movies can tell a real story one where it matters who the characters and antagonists are or where the plot is going it can be more than entertaining the real good superhero movies are not about super bang boom but about individuals getting influence and taking on responsibility and facing certain meaningful conflicts the joker would be an okay antagonist in any other movie but hes only special when he represents an inner conflict for batman basically many marvel superhero movies do not work like that for the most part they are just watchable action movies ,0,movies

thekonzo,we have been calling people with severe prejudice based on race racist for many years and it makes sense that way the moment a racist person retires from a profession of power is not a moment where they retire their racism so this is what we argue about wether the old concept of a racist individual or the new concept of a racist institution has priority and i would argue for the former you can fix the entire problem by calling it institutional or systemic racism instead or by talking specifically about experience of racism so it always focuses on the receiving end where only some form of action motivated by racism matters i do not see the benefit in calling a racist a person with prejudice against blacks from now on or calling it individual racism as opposed to racism which would then mean prejudice power i think it important to keep racist and racism very close to one another in concept prejudice based on race more focus on biology than culture and assuming negative things about an unknown individual of that race that racism a racist is someone who holds these views experienced racism or institutional or enacted or systemic racism those are what describes prejudice power pretty well without destroying any functional and reasonable concepts in language ,1,changemyview
thekonzo,it seems really dumb to refine the word like that when a racist judge loses his job he automatically stops being a racist does racism and prejudice only matter when you are the victim of it it not even worth a word otherwise did not people use to call it systemic racism or something when racism power meet also i would even go further stereotype jokes can be totally fine as long as they are told by someone not racist as long as the motivation behind it is not of racial biological superiority or inferiority or dislike and assign all that broad hate into an individual because they share the same skin color with that mental image of race even disliking a races culture is not necessarily racist again and again this comes down to semantics maybe we should rethink some words but i expected that people would handle them more carefully ,4,changemyview
thekonzo,i mean the movies so far havent been very good when they land a must see movie you will view this differently and might argue the exact opposite ,4,movies
thekonzo,it looking cheap to you wouldnt matter much if it was funny or entertaining you are focusing on something that is just less relevant ,17,hearthstone
thekonzo,exactly the progression in hearthstone is already amazing what are people on about and blizzard needs to earn money too just because people have limited time and money doesnt mean it shouldnt cost many hours every day or a hundred dollars every few months to keep up in a card game with very small development costs ,7,hearthstone
thekonzo,no sometimes its not an insult but an observation ,1,hearthstone
thekonzo,spoiler but there is too little focus on eren in my opinion things just kind of happen to them few choices it works but its not as exceptional as the first few episodes imo ,2,AskReddit
thekonzo,so every developer is a gigantic one and still why not just pirate instead of giving the money to g2a who basically equate to criminals imo give it to tthe artists and the structure that supports them or pirate that shit i mean you are the one that took it personally its not my fault that most who argue like you are 15 year olds ,6,hearthstone
thekonzo,developers care people with conscience care you should pirate the games instead seriously please pirate it instead it hurts the devs less than using g2a they are that cancerous i know you are probably young and only have a little bit of money at hand but that doesnt mean that everyone sees the world as you do in a few years you might be hopefully one of the ones that care ,66,hearthstone
thekonzo,if you want to waste a fuckton of time on a game with a bunch of horrible metas if i had a time machine hearthstone would be one of the last things to come to my mind ,79,hearthstone
thekonzo,well the early parts are underwatched the later seasons are overwatched but you know what maybe i was too harsh with it looking back i am more fed up with sense8 than i was with orphan black maybe i should pick it up again ,2,television
thekonzo,well even basic things like stress unsatisfying social life little sport its not about the being too busy to worry but just basic happiness i am going down this route because your post sounded emotionally distressed so its maybe not something that logic or philosophy can help you with i just wanted to mention it because it happens frequently that people come to places of discussion and debate when they should really ask a therapist instead then they might cling to some bits of philosphy that makes them feel good briefly but they asked the wrong question in the first place or maybe this is really just about death and religion and you should look on the bright side that life can be amazing that the entire purpose of your being is to enjoy your time among others like you and that everything else really does not matter because we are not built to think about that in the first place we arent truly objective we do assign value to things to life so lets focus on that and be happy with who and what we are ,1,changemyview
thekonzo,we do not understand consciousness yet it is thinkable that it is part of something larger emotionally dealing with some of the of the questions that religion tries to satisfy kind of comes naturally with becoming areligious but in general i would recommend that you try to focus on enjoyment in life and worry less about what comes afterwards this sort of anxiety regarding death does usually not come alone but is caused by some other issue in our life meaning maybe you are already unhappy or made bad experiences and now you feel like life is fleeting and things ahead wont be good enough this sort of thing is often the case with fears in psychology if you become more healthy then in theory you should automatically worry less about things that dont affect you right now check if your fear of death is maybe a symptom of something else i dont just want to leave you hanging with even more to worry about but give you hope that eventually you may very well not feel this anxiety anymore ,1,changemyview
thekonzo,i dont think i can reply to this without attacking your entire political worldview ,-1,changemyview
thekonzo,well the enemy part of it is not necessary though education internet and basic income will hopefully lead to people feeling less threatened and unfree this leads to less need for group identity more people exploring and traveling i agree that the common enemy is a very strong concept but we probably wont be needing it if countries in the long run will move more and more towards progressive values if every human is allowed to profit from scientific advances in ai if younger generations replace older generations and grow up with less mental garbage ,1,changemyview
thekonzo,i still dislike the focus on the concept of cultural appropriation alone the problem is some past people being disrespectful discriminatory dishonest the problem is not engaging in different cultures if there had to be a term then it should be more clear about focusing on the bad kind of cultural appropriation ,2,changemyview
thekonzo,i havent read every comment maybe this has been mentioned but i think i can add to this safe spaces and echo chambers are not inherently negative unless they are well negative sometimes you just want to vent discuss and socialize among people with the same interests sometimes you are not looking to have your views challenged with every step you take if it stays at this level then we have hardly any issues anonymous alcoholics are a safe space and few people would consider them harmful thats why its important to distinguish between the good and the bad kind or healthy and unhealthy user behavior t d is horrible because of its qualities the extreme way of moderation the populism the hatemongering and narratives of competition between humans the doomsaying the group mentality and circlejerking those are not present in all other subreddits but i still agree with your basic sentiment the bad kind of echo chamber is a threat to society especially on facebook ,2,changemyview
thekonzo,well i will have to agree except for probably the season 3 villain i wrote that as a reply to another comment already but i do also think that the original avatar just has a very special feel to it them being hunted but also on a quest to safe the world aangs almost unshaking optimism and joking nature in the face of basically a nai empire i bet there are more things you can tell a very good story in the world of the lord of the rings but maybe you will never be able to have it feel as meaningful as the original storyline it really depends on the viewer also i generally dont like watching things that are only enjoyable i want media to affect me and to be impressed maybe korra is more interesting when you come at it from the writers perspective the challenge of creating a good spinoff and succeeding in that ,1,AskReddit
thekonzo,i expect way way more core plot progression meaning the mystery the stuff that make you think this is why this story needs to be told why these characters and this cluster are special we got very little of that except well in the last 15 minutes sure the basic drama and love stuff can be enjoyable but thats not what i watch this show for ,1,AskReddit
thekonzo,eh about aimed at i like media about people from all walks of lives and i wouldnt dismiss angry teens in general its not all awkward and childish but i understand if it can be a turnoff ,2,AskReddit
thekonzo,interesting that we have such different opinions on the pacing and regarding the characters i mean i can see that they can also be unlikable but its not like they chose the world that molded and pushes them it probably depends on the viewers relationship and experience with the concept of authority ,5,AskReddit
thekonzo,hmmm interesting the kind of book that is more unique to an individual culture and country i cant think of any german ones that i would like to see adapted i guess some lesser known plays hmm ,1,AskReddit
thekonzo,no pressure i will agree that there is something magical about the original avatar this positive kid and the friends he finds and how they have to travel and gain knowledge for their objective while being hunted some stories just have this special something while others do not even if those are written in the same world and are well done ,7,AskReddit
thekonzo,i recently finished watching it well i stopped in the middle of season 2 at one point because while i did consider the stuff about the brother and gangsters well made it had too little focus on the main premise of the show so i just decided to skip to season 4 5 after hearing good things i had a blast it has less absurd humor than the first season but is very indepth on characters motivations and emotions great writing in my opinion if you cared for season 1 then you should give 4 5 a try ,6,AskReddit
thekonzo,its an amazing dystopian setting where likable characters are thrown into something horrible and are struggling to find a way for themselves and makes sense of things things feel brutal and real but have narrative pull especially in the first few episodes it has an amazing pace and was emotionally devasting and action packed i read the manga and although i enjoy it the story and revelations work it just kind of lost the magic that i described above so if you did not empathize with that then its probably just not for you ,19,AskReddit
thekonzo,i just finished it the most that happens in the season happens in the last 15 minutes of the final episode shame i really like most of the characters the premise the production and for example the nomi escape in season 1 the mystery plot just is not good enough ,3,AskReddit
thekonzo,i consider better call saul better than breaking bad in my opinion its a perfect show you can still hop on that train easily i know its a spinoff but it basically defies gravity it has a very alive creative spark ,10,AskReddit
thekonzo,well you would probably like the third and fourth season alot the main plot of the second one is garbage and it has love triangle the first season wasnt perfect i did not buy into the new world right away but if i remember correctly it gets quite exciting i dont know what to tell you maybe try to finish season 1 and maybe skip the second season or maybe you havent watched some of the good animes that are somewhat similar to avatar like fullmetal alchemist brotherhood hunter x hunter 2011 version or code geass ,30,AskReddit
thekonzo,very much agree i want to like the show i can accept flaws because of how nice much of the premise production and characters are but much of the story is just so disappointing nothing happened the entire season until the last episode basically nothing about the mystery makes sense at this point alot of it feels forced and cringy and it just dropped my attention in season 1 i liked episode 2 until after the trans escape alot everything else was a mix of very likable protagonists and lame ass filler this season we had 2 okay first episodes and an okay finale such a shame once again the wachowskis are dropping the ball with the writing imagine the show had an actually exciting main plot imagine there were way more character interactions that didnt feel like we team up for the power of love everyone of us agrees with killing we are all the same but we are so different but we dont communicate much but we are the same imagine the german crime plotline wasnt garbage good actor though imagine the indian plotline wasnt streched out 4 times longer than it should have been really interesting to me because the other series i watch right now is better call saul and i struggle to find things in it that are not perfect with sense8 i struggle to find things that feel perfect except most casting and production and this feels bad for me because i care way more about this show than for example orphan black which is a pretty similar otherwise i could just drop watching it like i did with that one ,3,Sense8

thekonzo,we could talk about my premise you could for example point out that there are studies that show that slightly depressed people have a more accurate grasp of reality and predication of outcomes but you did not point out any circular reasoning so please retract your comment above maybe by circular you meant that my arguments were well connected and the comment was well rounded in that case thank you for the compliment ,1,changemyview
thekonzo,could you point out the circular reasoning for me then ,1,changemyview
thekonzo, 1 healthy humans dont want to kill themselves because it goes against every fundamental drive of our being 2 humans that are mentally unhealthy to the point of being very suicidal can not be in a state of mind to rationally think about the future or suicide the dilemma is that of course only a patient really knows how much he suffers 3 mercy killing assisted suicide should exist for extreme hopeless cases but it should be greenlit done by professionals and not just the affected patient himself or relatives 4 1 nihilism and moral nihilism are mental traps there are no objective truths or values outside of our own mind things only matter when we are attached to them and value them the universe doesnt matter without us because only we have a concept of things mattering we can have confidence in being humans nothing more without real free will without purpose without any peer alien race or divine father figure watching and can still be happy with who we are and what we do because we can enjoy life and that is enough drive for the healthy among us 4 2 if you dont value life anymore then you cant take nihilism as an excuse and should go back to point 1 most likely you use nihilism as a coping mechanism for something in your life chemistry being problematic ergo not healthy ergo point 2 and point 3 you cant kill yourself unless you are suffering alot and are hopeless and that is supported by professional opinion and not just your own affected compromised mind ,0,changemyview

thekonzo,i know this is a joke thread but from what i can tell most of the dedicated players from beta times have left by now out of frustration with the game development doesnt mean the game is dead of course financially or community wise but there are certain demographics that i as a player care about in the games that i go crazy over and when start to dwindle it makes things feel different for example in the r leagueoflegends subreddit you could often feel an age shift in the voting behaviour and thread link comment quality ,-1,hearthstone
thekonzo,but the two partys are practically the same right right left right ying yang thats how it works right but we should trust in our leader to take care of us little guys he talks in such a relatable way and says how it is and how he thinks if isps screw us over then it must be part of the masterplan and that makes them smart ,3,leagueoflegends

thekonzo,he did better in the older debate with the southern stormfront guy towards the end at least i dont like seeing destiny go easy on ethnonationalists anyone else i dotn care you can have a bad day or get bored or whatever but not when it comes to defending the safety of your fellow man ,1,Destiny

thekonzo,hey come on id like communism if it worked and felt good p sooooo i instead like socialist capitalism ,3,Destiny
thekonzo,eh i think destiny hates both parties but i still somewhat agree with what you are saying he doesnt like taking stances at the moment i also dislike false equivalnces and the current climate everywhere of tolerating party over country etc as a basic question i would ask what would it take for destiny to join a protest on the streets instead of just sitting at home with a stern look on his face i dont mean to attack him just to adress a potential state of moderation and fatigue idk my dude ,1,Destiny
thekonzo,yes and every professional would make a statement saying a while long time is a very bad way of phrasing it and means either soda is emotional and stupid right now or its reaaaaaaaally fucking severe so basically both this is basic pr ,-2,LivestreamFail

thekonzo,hmm i agree i find it disappointing that he doesnt argue harder there or from the moral perspective if his child was half black he would probably care a little more about that side of the argument i felt disappointed for 70 of the debate with the stormfronter guy from a while back with the beers and the slave woman but when destiny was about to give up on talking suddenly a real discussion happened and destiny fought well 1 you can push on the subjective moral fundament that society has and the human empathy that extends towards humans who look at little different 99 999999999 shared qualities only 0 000000000001 difference fuck this moral nihilism of course objectively morality doesnt exist value and attachment only exist within our minds 2 even if there are differences thats fine you dont want a society that does not take care of the weak we have no huge arms race or war with aliens we dont need to be exceptional at the cost of being ethical i am okay with honest race realism as opposed to oldschool scientific racism propaganda because from my perspective it does not change anything 3 push on why nazis altrighters want an ethnostate its almost always about identity and racial belonging even if you cant convince them you can at least make them retreat into their cave of self congratulation and competitive worldviews ,2,Destiny
thekonzo,yeah some people joke about it its fine those are often people that were depressed at some point or they had social problems and its a half joking reference to that i dont see what the big deal is if you have 13 year old girls shouting around i am depressed and crazy look at me sure thats annoying but idk who cares ,0,LivestreamFail
thekonzo,so a celebration parade for democracy is equally as bad as a nazi convention because they are both circlejerks also closed communities safe spaces arent always bad some times you just arent looking to have your views challenged and instead want to voice your thoughts or discuss things among people with the same interests its all about how crazy or dangerous the group is its not about groups in general sure it would be good if you at least had a visitors day a sticky thread for discussions with people who disagree or a discussion subreddit linked in the sidebar but its not 100 necessary please stop with the false equivalences the donald is garbage other circlejerk subreddits arent the same level of garbage ,1,LivestreamFail

thekonzo,did you read sodas tweet you still think its that rediculous why is it bad to speculate in the first place its not unreasonable with the way soda talked ,3,LivestreamFail
thekonzo,exactly i dont mind race realism itself i just think that society is about offering everyone a good life experience its less about identity and its not about exceptionalism i think subjective morality is totally fine moral nihilists are either retards or lacking empathy alt right nazi people for the most part are talking about scientific racism because they want it to be true because their identity and problem solving plans depend on it they want to feel like they belong to something that is greater than what is now they want some scary things to be taken care off and be able to be mentally strong ,1,Destiny

thekonzo,the joke works by just pointing towards a suspeciously close relationship and towards submissiveness as a political leader symbolized through submissive sex acts those are fine you could argue that its a bit insensitive because it could be misunderstood by bigots for a traditional homophobic insult as well as showing of toxic masculinity regarding submissiveness but its seriously fine as long as you can know hey the guy is generally trying not to be an asshole and tries to empathize with people the accusations of homophobia or sexism or racism just arent very accurate at all the context matters variation of the phrase cocksucker is just not a fair comparision or reduction ,2,changemyview
thekonzo,submissive sexual acts can be jokingly used to suggest a submissive personality which can be a strong attack against country leaders it might be insensitive towards women and gay people who might not like submissiveness being joked about in any vontext but it not inherently homophobic it just a prank brah ,2,changemyview

thekonzo,lets not be ignorant of explanations no matter how big of a dick trump is no human in this world has free will because free will does not even make sense as a concept and it is interesting and useful to learn about causes and influences to improve things afterwards and make for less conflicts he did not choose to be born into the life he ended up in and becoming the person he is he should have learned by now over many decades but sometimes a person can have a pretty fucked mental fundament but even without free will blame and punishment and dislike can exist so dont worry ,4,politics

thekonzo,these places are horrible i tried to talk to some of them i got a handful to see a therapist i follow their profiles every week just to see if they are still posting there are so many the subreddit to a decent portion consists of circlejerking around killing yourself while ignoring that suicidal people can by definition not be in the state of mind to make that choice rationally its horrible but also good because it represent how things are right now mental health is not in a good state in the west yet far from it and professionals and politicians leave suffering patients hanging when it comes to mercy killing noone wants to be an adult i recommend both engaging with it heavily but also ignoring it like the plague ,2,leagueoflegends
thekonzo,how the fuck is it slow just because fewer people die than in breaking bad the arcs and character developments are faster than in bb its pretty much perfect ,1,television
thekonzo,i like to think i can be a little too critical and i loved breaking bad but i actually took a break in the middle of the series back then because it got a little slow and depressing and i just couldnt binge better call saul is just a way more enjoyable watch for me you would think with it being a spinoff it would have less meaning and creative spark and while i think bb is special in that regard better call saul is amazing the character developments and the underlaying conflicts and plot strings just amazing i remember how i rolled my eyes when they announced the spinoff prequel who asked for that future me did desperately ,47,television

thekonzo,so what stop deriving identity from isolation ,1,changemyview
thekonzo,no i just dont care about their opinion because its unreliable i care about the professionals opinions that treat the patient the problem is that we arent there yet and people are often left without help but eventually i want everyone to be taken care off i just dont like seeing a blind person pretend like he should be running without a stick or a dog ,1,changemyview
thekonzo,woah threads about suicide always seem to attract extremely pedantic and annoying people i am not gonna tell you that its a smart thing to let a suicidal person kill himself a healthy version of that person would not tell his suicidal version that stop jerking off to nihilist bs and see a therapist ,1,changemyview
thekonzo,he was asking for a quick summary on something you seem to know more about than him he wasnt trying to get into an argument at least judging from the two comments your comment though looks like a cheap deflection overreaction so you dont get called out on not having done your research yourself and instead just blindly trust in the word of playerunknown ,2,PUBATTLEGROUNDS
thekonzo,hmm if you have played battle royale games and dont like em then i dont think i will push you on this i hope they will improve the circles of death and stretch the average game time by like 4 5 minutes i really enjoy the freedom you have every game either you loot somewhere in peace evade or survive the first fights then survive by taking the most optimal paths with a vehicle find good untouched loot areas depending on where everyone else landed or find yourself a nice camping spot or you just jump right into the action its very fluid and the experience comes from all kinds of unique games meshing together but i can see that you want to lean more towards the survival rpg side i am also very disappointed that i never again got anything like dayz over the first few weeks when people where derping around in the city and middle of the map and you truly never knew if a player would be friendly or a bandit or a killer over time all that went away and got replaced by arma roleplay and battle royale games maybe someday well get some kind of apocalypse survival mmo maybe with vr we will probably land in opposing survivor groups then and face each other in battle im looking forward to it ,1,pcmasterrace

thekonzo,i argued that perceiving the world accurately is not only not superior but its also rediculous as we cant hope to observe the world accurately in the first place the outside world does not matter what matters is our perspective and experience of life also we were not talking about moderately depressed people but about crazy and strongly suffering people ,0,changemyview
thekonzo,i dont need to proof things in casual discussions when they are generally accepted and reasonable everyone already agreed that there are differences the guy just argued that the difference is that they are more rational somehow which does not allign with the common image of a clinically depressed and suffering to the point of suicide patient i really dont feel like having basic things in my arguments be dissected ,1,changemyview

thekonzo,there is a difference between depression and being suicidal i mae3 the argukent that suicidal people are unreliable and it will take a lot to disprove that ,0,changemyview
thekonzo,its the other way around reality does not matter or basically not even exist the way we understand it without us living inside it observing it and caring about it its not a filter its what makes existing and being alive worthwhile we assign value to things thats what we do depression means things lose value to you either because your brain chemicals are fucked or you have social problems its not the standard or superior having a neutral pessimistic detached perspective on things is not superior healthy humans can be very logical and smart for example growing up and becoming boring and not enjoying things anymore and focusing on work only does not mean you lost your tinted glasses it just means you are boring now ,0,changemyview

thekonzo, when you say that ice did not cause the swat in what sense do you mean like do you mean the he was not the one calling swat to him or how yes also its not even 100 clear that ice baited the trolls you are going to strong on that assumption i meant what would the punishment be if ice revealed his location but no swatting had happened none but still over time you would have twitch work on additional rules to keep irl in check and i think we should treat the case as such even though swatting did occur if you could convince me that ice is the kind of person that would want to get his plane swatted and risk the safety of himself and others and would want to get banned from twitch for publicity if you cant and its either just stupidity or misunderstanding then i dont support a permanent final punishment and i think this is the wrong decision ,1,Destiny
thekonzo,on the world we are speaking about personal situations not about realistic views on politics or business depression is personal ,2,changemyview
thekonzo,a healthy human cant by definition want to kill himself its against our nature against how our minds work only a suffering person can judge when he suffers enough to prefer mercy killing a suffering suicidal person can never be in the state of mind to make reasonable judgement about suicide or even basic things about the future these are the cornerstones and conflicts you have exceptions some terminally ill suffering and terminally biologically unhappy people are better off getting a mercy killing but dont confuse that with suicide i dont even like the term assisted suicide in a functioning society professionals should have a good enough grip on this topic even with how impossibly hard judgement is ,1,changemyview
thekonzo,if that inpacts the appeals process then you have a very biased judicial department i agree he didnt exactly go smart about it when it comes to adressing twitch but he did well addressing fan confidence and future youtube plans maybe because twitch is a lost cause anyways for him or maybe because that should not really impact that appeal and his current perspective and reaction should be understandable to adult twitch workers or maybe hes just being stupid again in any case i did not find this video bad ,1,Destiny
thekonzo, they would find it anyway is a very weak argument after watching this video i actually disagree i think ice has reason to believe that saying his location or not saying it doesnt really change anything because its easy to find out or vague information would be enough to screw him over and based on the leaked information this was actually the case it would not have mattered he is not at fault of for the swatting period regarding the what are you gonna do anyways comment this i actually view as problematic the way he communicates there with the shitty part of his viewership it feels similar to the tyler1 situation where initially it felt like a growing cancer of toxicity i really dont like permanent punishments in general i think when punishing ice for this situation one should take the actual swatting out of the equation and judge wether the same events without the swatting would warrant punishment i could see that it would break reasonable rules of irl streaming but those just arent in place yet from what i understand ice has been temp banned before so it is understandable that judgement becomes harsher and harsher but since rules arent in place and ice did not cause the swat i dont agree with a permanent ban ,4,Destiny

thekonzo,do you know the finale to the series i have not problem with christian themes they are quite rich i like things like constantine and preacher for example ,1,movies
thekonzo,eh the first one had a great beginning and a kind of boring second half the second one is generally okay but like a kind of meh version of lord of the rings shrinked down into one movie feels too much like the first one too although the timejump and nostalgia has some emotion i cant even remember what happened in the third some ship adventure stuff with a few stages and lucy wanting to be pretty and the boy character being kind of entertaining the only thing i think that was truly amazing about narnia in general was the concept of these kids fleeing from the war onto on old collectors property and finding the wardrobe door to another world as well as the little brother being lured by the ice witch this exact story setup has alot of emotion i cant really explain why how they find something entirely different from the terror going on in the real world a place where their personal journey and development matters more how they are forced to flee and have no control over anything and then fall into a scary adventure but manage to take control over it its perfect escapism everything else seems like meh adventure and meh characters the christian preaching really bothers me except when aslan shows up for a minute and helps with a kids personal struggle like a dumbledore oh and i like the idea of the wood between worlds i think someone talented could probably turn the entirely narnia works into a single trilogy picking good themes and characters and storylines but turning them into something meaningful and coherent and less christian bullshit it would probably be about step by step aslan asking these groups of kids to help him free a few key worlds and unlock some of its powers to eventually defeat the big antagonist that is about to beat aslan and bring an end to creation and life youd need to remove a bunch of stupid shit like the kids growing old without getting kids or anything in narnia and then returning to the real world as normal immature children again someone might call it pre,2,movies

thekonzo,imo this system is pretty much perfect when you get around 3 4 of the more meaningful lootdrops skins while playing quite a lot a little less than half if you play a little bit then you make purchased lootboxes feel really good to purchase by basically guaranteeing that they complete your collection for a reasonable amount of money event boxes maybe shouldnt drop duplicate legendaries little pressure for spending money little whalehunting but high value for your money currently it is pretty close to that but i for example did get unlucky and did not get a single one of the skins i wanted in my purchased 25 boxes only got 2x the tracer skin that i dont like 1 old duplicate one legendary currency that felt real bad and makes me regret the purchase ,110,Overwatch
thekonzo,on a side note thats exactly true democracy doesnt mean its supposed to be random and people are supposed to be stupid and irrational within that system democratic voting is part of the seperation of powers its a system of checks and balances keeping politicians honest giving politicians the hurdle of appearing trustworthy and driven if you have the wrong kind of direct democracy and major catastrophy accurs and people start voting irrationally and the wrong type of politician takes advatnage of that then that can be an objective problem in that kind of scenario people vote against their own selfinterest people lose their heads people are scared and lose trust and hope even in fundamental things like science and trained professionals of all areas every person has the right to their opinion even if its a stupid or useless one but there are objectively correct positions and decisions in politics its not a magical universe of randomness where logic does not apply a party can be the wrong or the right choice objectively ergo yes democracy is only nice if a right party wins or maybe it is still good enough when a bad party will only rule briefly and cant cause too much lasting damage ,5,worldnews

thekonzo,what if the population of unowned cats is very much under control and wild life is not very threatened at that moment by owned roaming cats what if the roaming cats actually dont cause meaningful trouble for neighbours when castrated they hardly mark their territory with piss dont you think the shitting in their yard thing can be worked our case by case wouldnt it be a good thing if animals could roam as long as it doesnt cause problems really ,1,Destiny
thekonzo, larger aggressive roaming dogs would of course be a problem however reasonable owners would not let this happen and neighbours would contact them or authorities you were asking how i could be upset if a family defended themselves against my dangerous dog as long as i am a reasonable owner wouldnt let it happen in the first place and of course i would have no right to be upset times have changed traffic is too heavy at this point in most areas and it becomes likely for a dog to get run over i grew up with a doggo that on its own went to the bus station 1km away to walk us kids home every day it went well for many years but she did eventually get run over we were accepting of that risk and for example didnt let our new dogs roam but also because they had a way higher hunting drive anyways and wouldnt just be exploring chilling like the previous one we do have neighbours right now that have 4 large dogs that are allowed to freely wander the property but they are very obedient some rich fucks a bit further away at some point started walking their aggressive german sheperds without leash or muzzle and people took huge issue in that you see its a little bit case by case when it comes to the safety and regarding dogs times certainly have changed cats only very rarely get run over and they basically never attack humans i know i know you think you dont know every cat but come on its in their nature to flee or when backed into a corner have a nervous breakdown and swipe the air letting cats roam outside is just something very normal in suburban and rural areas i dont know what to tell you if the cat keeps shitting on a neighbours walkway then of course that something you need to take seriously if things dont work or cant get fixed then you keep the cat inside its as easy as that this is where you say maybe the neighbours not only dont want shit on their property but no foreign cats in general ever but this is something that probably depends on the country law in my opinion its reasonable and acceptable to have a few cats roam the neighbourhood i do think its very similar to needing to accept wildlife you will disagree but thats just how it is killing retaliation in my country being on your property does not give you crazy special rights in my country someone killing humans or animals doesnt really cross our minds we even have hunters on the crop fields almost every sunday this is when we would keep the dogs inside of course but even those would in worst case scenario not kill the roaming doggo but capture it and ask around the neighbourhood and have a word with the owner if my cat or dog was on a neighbours property and posed no danger and the neighbour would kill it then i would see it similar of course its still not the same as him killing a wandering child its not a reasonable or acceptable reaction or authority i mean its still just an animal i wouldnt murder his family and bloodline but that guy has to be a psycho and there has to be consequence and prevention ,1,Destiny

thekonzo,would tigers and wolves be okay ,1,Destiny
thekonzo,birds are threatened by wild unowned cats thats why you do population control on them and castrate or even kill them birds are not threatened by owned cats that are allowed to roam by their owners ,4,Destiny
thekonzo,this does not really work since others dont have a cat or keep it indoors so they dont relate to this situation agreement ,1,Destiny
thekonzo,look we are talking about owned cats and wether its okay to let them roam you bring up a study that largely talks about unowned cats i mean that the wildlife is threatened argument would only ever apply to owned cats if animal control or whoever is responsible has not done their job controling the population of unowned cats ,2,Destiny
thekonzo,wait the things is i have only ever heard of breeding wild cats becoming a problem in a few countries here and there and thats when more harsh measures are taken i havent heard that roaming owned house cats cause concerning damage to the wild life ,2,Destiny
thekonzo,i cant judge on the former i would have to see a picture of yours ,1,Destiny
thekonzo,okay i accept both your points ,2,Destiny
thekonzo,are you sure those talk about roaming owned house cats and not wild cats the threat to wilflife thing is fluid we do try to keep the numbers in check for a reasons population control ,1,Destiny
thekonzo,oh i did not see the link initially i am not against population control like that when its well researched and well conducted especially when its about castration and not about genocide it sucks but sometimes it has to be done doesnt mean i am against letting house cats roam just like killing 2 million wild cats is not the same as killing all wild cats its not one or the other its case by case ,2,Destiny
thekonzo,okay there is this argument of if they werent bred for their meat then they wouldnt have lived at all as long as the conditions are good at least its a life even if its a short and controlled one i do agree that i value my diet and enjoyment of food higher than having a little tiny minimal bit of impact on the meat industry by eating vegetarian i do accept that its morally not perfect and do concede that i rely on what is culturally accepted and what is natural but i do think its acceptable enough as long as the animals arent suffering i support good products of course and i dont know what to tell you i feel like i do love most animals and conscious and social beings even if i am a little hypocritical about it but i think its okay for you to use the argument sometimes in debates about being a vegetarian you do have a little bit of moral highground but this wasnt a real debate about it and it came a little bit out of the blue its a little bit of the whole how do you know someone is a vegetarian oh dont worry they will let you know meme ,1,Destiny
thekonzo,i think you can eat animals and love animals i think eventually we will want lab grown meat but until then i think morally its fine for me to continue eating meat although i respect vegetarians for their impact in general this topic like many others is a little gray and tbh its a bit awkward if you judge someones love even if it comes from a good place wanting to reduce animal suffering ,1,Destiny
thekonzo, it really depends on the situation and what is defined as acceptable i am an average person and i have killed many animals legally okay i mean this is hard to perfectly phrase in a sentence i have killed farm animals too i mercykilled lots of animals helping out at a veterinarian clinic invasive species i dont think i agree i will read up on the legal professional definitions later today this is at the crux of our disagreement i think i dont see how a few house cats roaming causes meaningful problems on average cats can carry rabies okay sure if there are lots of sick wild animals carrying disease you probably dont want your cat to become infected anyways this probably doesnt apply to most areas in the western countries though ask any person who like watching birds or hunting rabbits and they will strongly disagree with you if the bird population greatly decreases then i would accept that argument the hunting rabbits argument i dont accept at all i think holy shit am i getting baited right now how about do not intrude on somebody else property and keep your fucking cat inside not baiting you i guess we just disagree heavily because you dont consider roaming house cats natural in the slightest and he right people are fucking retarded when it comes to animals i dont think i am being fucking retarded at all in my country and in most countries i have been to roaming cats are a common thing and dont cause issues that cant be taken care of also wildlife birds squirrels etc is held in trust owned by the state and in some cases for certain species the federal government your domestic cat is not the property of the government it your property it is not a part of nature therefor you have no right to let it intrude on the private property of others okay this is where you give more meat to our disagreement situation from earlier id probably still rather look it up instead of discussing this now ,3,Destiny
thekonzo,i would agree with this i would personally think alot about physically harming that neighbour in retaliation he thinks he can kill an animal my pet without consequence lets see about that babyrage,1,Destiny
thekonzo,i dont think i agree with the killing shooting part at all even if cats are a pest then you would have professionals doing the population control and that usually involes castration more so than killing i also dont agree with the cats arent native to america argument i dont see how that would make any difference at this point there arent any threats to pressures on cats anyways and afaik its not like american birds are naturally more stupid i think the cats are native to denmark thing only has a little bit of weight in the sense that the ecosystem might seem a tiny bit more adjusted which i wouldnt know how its something that immigrants would be accepting by immigrating there and its natural whatever that means and its probably harder to make roaming cats illegal when cat ownership is more widespread and you have more historical cultural evidence of it being a non issue harder than the other way around allowing cats to roam when people in general dont care for pets in that culture and value their clean and perfect neighbourhoods much more ,1,Destiny
thekonzo,well maybe but i dont think destiny is a believer in general he probably just grew up around a certain type of hardline fundemental worldview and that sometimes leads to confusion towards the end destiny said of course i wouldnt shoot your cat and except for the we will never agree you are all too presumptuos and attached to your pets he seemed pretty willing to talk about this i was the one who wrote i lost a little bit of respect im not gonna lie and i feel bad about that comment now i was just a little shocked by the tolerance for animal cruelty it looked like that at least for the first few minutes of the talk ,3,Destiny
thekonzo,i already gave my opinion i did not mean to challenge animal cruelty law i just tried to summarize his arguments because i thought it would be helpful i linked to the video with a time stamp too im not sure about misquoting ,1,Destiny
thekonzo,well not being able to sounded crazy to destiny he said squirrels are nature cats are property pepethink in case you didnt see it he brought up the topic because one of his high school class mates posted something on her facebook about hey thinskinned neighbour before calling animal services about my cat shitting on your doorstep next time just talk to me first he is coming at it from the perspective of entitled presumptuos cat owners feel like everyone just has to deal with their pets shit on their property its insane ,2,Destiny
thekonzo,so thats in conflict with destiny comments along the lines of if an animal is on my property i feel like i could kill it could i not of course not with a gun because you cant discharge a firearm but its an animal on my property i dont know anything about that animal if its feral and gonna attack my kids if it has disease and its an animal on my property i dont need a reason why the fuck would there be an animal on my property it wouldnt be an asshole thing to do you are being presumptuos its your animal contain it deal with it ,1,Destiny

thekonzo,oh wait i dont disagree i enjoyed the idea of s5 but i fucked up i actually meant season 7 if 7 and 8 had been conjoined i think it could have let to a decent ending to the series but actually of course in an awesome version of the show dexter needed to be on the run by the end of season 3 or beginning of 4 you cant have him work at the police and have noone ever notice except doakes it needs to end with him hunted and him having his character development and good side tested in the form of self sacrifice even though i enjoyed some of the stories and the family time it was never supposed to be a generic crime or drama show there needed to be structure and meaningfully progressing arcs ,1,television

thekonzo,i mean technically it still helps the streamer as long as the system becomes attractive to non donaters and doesnt attract too many former donators you can think of it as subbing to a channel multiple times for the same month that way it feels less awkward because it just multiplies an already accepted concept like pressing the button multiple times for lazy people of course a streamers steady income should be in the interest of the followers so your suggestion is way superior probably twitch should announce that they reduce their cut for the 2x quite a bit and the 6x options dramatically all that bonus emote stuff should be optional and two extra emotes will probably feel too shitty to miss out on i would suggest having some side wide community goals or mini games that will grant extra emotes and stuff like that for everyone upon unlocking it generally playing around with the streamer communities and having them interact could become a huge thing for twitch ,1,Twitch
thekonzo,the difference is that twitch has two seperate optional subscriptions that are hardly necessary when you want to go the adblock route twitch turbo prime and channel subs people opt in the latter to be engaged in the community for the streamer and to support the ecosystem people get the former for a little bit of comfort and conscience different from other subscription services closer to donations and patreon the same rules dont need to apply ,1,Twitch

thekonzo,you should give it a try and stop as soon as you get overly bored the show brings some nice atmosphere via production and music and story themes that is worth experiencing for a little bit afterwards the superhero versus supervillain thing is tagged on in the second half and just too slow and too cheesy daredevil season 2 for example has a similar problem the first half of it is a must watch almost punisher the second half was hard to watch progressively more annoying electra and ninjas ,0,television

thekonzo,the show didnt need to be as bad as it was they had a great side kick and good enough villains just the writing and protagonist and production were horrendous at times this time not always not in the first episode and in one or two episodes in the middle but most of the time an impotent manchild the tv show and holy smokes that last scene in the final episode is one of the most pathetic things i have ever scene spoiler hey this thing was my only job but i did not do it for whatever reason actually because i just felt unsteady and saw a bird guess what me not doing my job backfired not only am i a character that gets progressively more stupid and weak with every episode it also turns out that i should have done the thing i decided to not do at the beginning of the story so i dont know why all of you even watched my story unfold but i did remember that i saw a dragon and that helped me briefly overcome my impotence so there is that did i mention that my parents died 15 years ago and thats practically my identity even though that doesnt make much sense ,17,television

thekonzo,you can still give valid feedback though i think it would be good to tone down the punishing rng in event boxes and disable duplicates and maybe even disable gold legendary drops or normal legendary skins that way the bought lootboxes might just be more attractive and rewarding for a larger group while being less shit for unlucky people who spent 30 dollars on basically nothing or feel forced to spend 80 dollars on a cosmetic event sure its all just cosmetic but people care and its a good idea to make the system as ideal as it can be for all parties involved i am okay with random lootboxes as long as its cant screw you over too much and isnt whalebait ,3,Overwatch

thekonzo,which does not fit with my idea of someone who has spent 15 years in a monastery they never showed anything about what happen in that time except for the beating he got right away and it was said that he trained every day and spent some time with his buddy thats basically it sometimes the writing attempts to make him wise sometimes trained and diciplined sometimes he mentions teachings of his masters when they are relevant but for the most part he is just confused annoying and weak and unlikable i know they tried to make him child like especially in the first episode thats were he was okay uninteresting but okay also when he starts working at his company thats were he briefly has personality took a stance was friendly and had goals or is at least looking for something good to do the biggest insult is just how doesnt improve or develop at all and at the end of the season you have that moment of oh damn i guess i shouldnt have left the path unprotected oooh noooo who could have known the reasons for him leaving were just emptiness and the eagle but mainly as pointed out by nurse him being angry because he knew that his parents pilots were poisoned while he did not actually know it there is just too much stupidity in this show to even cover i would have to rewatch the entire thing and probably write a few sentences every 7 minutes as someone who writes sometimes and has a tendency of writing along or thinking about the creative process behind it while watching something it was incredibly frustrating ,6,television
thekonzo,i wanted to enjoy it and i thought some of the choices for side characters and villains were good but the protagonist writing and production were just too bad and annoying for me i almost hated it because it could have easily been much better why did they have to make him so unlikable and dumb and weak ,16,television

thekonzo,i am talking about turks that have both passports and voted ,1,worldnews
thekonzo,the explanations are important though because its looking like over time there will be a big shift when current youth becomes older and more integrated into working culture when they start getting their kids its gonna be different from current 40 50 year old muslims and how they interact with their kids or with the countries culture they arent gonna cling to muslim identity that much ,1,worldnews
thekonzo,so what we were talking about the muslims in western countries and now you jumped to turkey we have passed the phase of world wars in human history i know its all about feelings for you but you have to sometimes be more precise about what exactly worries you is it muslim immigrants not integrating is it potential future immigrant waves caused by climate change is it a west versus east war is it a rise of terrorism is it a general threat to democracy and progressive values etc its not just about optimism for most of these topics for the most part we are gonna be fine i cant tell you what assad or putin or erdogan are planning to do long term but i can tell you that war is not in their interest and i can tell you that the destruction of western culture via infecting us with refugees is not part of their masterplan ,1,worldnews

thekonzo,ugh just finished it yikes it could have actually worked with the characters and villains but the writing was just so bad i liked kungfu girlfriend and evil stepdad in the first half of the season but later it was hard to find anything to like danny got progressive harder to sympathize with his arc was basically that dude gets thrown into the modern world then instantly becomes kind of an annoying jerk then gets more and more stupid then more and more physically weak in the end more and more angry and then in an instant ugh this reminds me of the dragons eyes nevermind i am not gonna kill i am better than that except nevermind and then a scene later oh no everything i have done was a mistake i left my city unprotected and who knew it would actually get attacked in the end oh noes laughably bad holy hot damn i thought luke cage was barely watchable with a pretty boring second half iron fist was even less barely watchable had no real story to tell even and then went down the gutter ,1,Dexter
thekonzo,someone who wants to commit suicide can never be in the state of mind to be able to make that choice rationally respecting someones suffering and be able to mercykill is a sign of a progressed society agency doesnt exist to begin with ,1,Destiny
thekonzo, neben kylos verletzung hatten die beiden ja auch eine verbindung als letzte j nglinge kylo hat ihr anfangs sozusagen jedi mind tricks beigebracht und am ende versucht zur dunklen seite zu bringen rey ist zwar extrem talentiert und hat hoffentlich einen anderen character arc als luke aber sie brauch nunmal einen arc und der kann auf der gute b se balance ebene stattfinden ,1,de
thekonzo,i think its mediocre at best the color transitions are bad the difference between left and right is bothering rey on the bottom looks like a 2000 video game character its very bland and doesnt really say anything ,0,movies

thekonzo,i had to watch the walking dead god i dont enjoy the show on tv recently and wondered wait people pay to watch this like this 30min commercials after 1 minute of watching shouldnt you get paid to watch this shit ads are already cancer in general but that was like them raping my eyes with a cancer dildo ,1,television
thekonzo,okay since you are so sure about it lets make an experiment as your buddy to drop a watermelon on your head from a roof ,7,PeopleFuckingDying
thekonzo,if you want to be a theorycrafter then it is necessary copying decks from others with no experimentation competetive imo ,19,hearthstone
thekonzo,the final scene didnt help either not only because its disgusting but because it kind of makes clear that all the characters are incapable of learning even when it looked like that earlier quite a few middle fingers after i put some effort into liking the first half sorry if that sounds pretentious ,1,movies
thekonzo,yes amazing games for their time liked them more than diablo actually ,1,gaming
thekonzo,interesting do you think season 3 is skippable for example someone told me i should just skip two seasons of bates motel and start with the most recent season because it doesnt matter much and its just that good now and in older shonin anime its quite possible to skip filler and non essential episodes and get a much better experience ,1,television
thekonzo,is the show watchable still i stopped in the middle of season 2 i think because i did not feel like the plot would go somewhere interesting i felt like alot of things early on in the show where impressive but the mystery fell flat and it generally went a little too crazy edit i also think quite a few of the characters were extraordinary but they could not really carry it for me forever ,3,television
thekonzo,ty ty do you think he does it for his personal enjoyment or to kickstart his guru career or did he expect his old businesses to grow are you generally good at reading body language does tai in general seem like a liar in general to you or was it more the evidence that made you question the whole thing do you think there is value to his guide stuff for me its just that the moment i first listened to tai my reaction was he is full of shit he is good at the confidence thing but cant quite shake off the out of place ness but his lessons seem to be good enough from what i can tell so i am pretty conflicted about how to judge him not too big a fan of this h3 video i dislike normalizing conartists too much or being scared of alienating political extremes in the viewerbase i am just really conflicted ,7,h3h3productions

thekonzo,wtf was that second half the first half was somewhat entertaining not exactly witty or great but somewhat interesting second half beginning and end were garbage middle part had some neat moments i just really dont understand why i dont understand if there was some metaphoras etc going on i am pretty sure i havent missed anything i am pretty sure they decided to make the second half garbage on purpose just to send some message ala uuuuh dystopia trying to understand the story choices is a true wtf and that scene close to the ending is also really fucking wtf ,3,movies

thekonzo,better call saul has not right to be as good as it is its a spin off prequel for a side character and its better and more approachable than breaking bad imo has an amazing character story to tell and feels so authentic and creative and well made this should be impossible ,7,television
thekonzo,westworld is pretty impressive and pretty good but it is slow at times and the story is wonky at times its basically a miracle that they managed to get the show to work in post production a little overrated but an interesting watch and enjoyable most of the time ,-1,television
thekonzo,it usually happens with slow mystery shows but we both agree sense8 still has something unique to offer with the characters and the way they interact so we will always have that ,2,television
thekonzo,i feel the same way but i am anxious about being disappointed and i usually write along the stories in my head while reading watching i cant help but constantly wonder why they are even going with this whole thing when is the plottwist gonna come when will characters be forced to make their choice ,1,television
thekonzo,vague uninspired wannabe intellectual comments like yours really hurt to read in these kinds of subreddits not that i dislike being critical i just really hate this yeah this is obviously a thing didnt you notice type commenting ,1,HailCorporate
thekonzo,spoiler i liked the buildup and the visuals and the acting the reveal of the car accident was good for example but the actual plot progression there was kind of meh in the middle of the first season someone gets abducted and it feels awesome and you dont know what is gonna happen a few episodes they just do the exact same thing but in a different country now and this time because of her own stupidity i like the consequence of it the compromised and drugged dude but it still felt very unspectactular we did not get a hint of where the series is going is it them being just hunted by this one secret org or are they gonna fight against other evil sense8s but that doesnt seem that awesome where is the matrix like plot progression where is them becoming the chosen one where is the v for vendetta like progression her becoming a resistance fighter of her own chosing with her own morals and strength not dependant on v who started the whole thing the show does not have any of that yet granted its the first season but still but i did like the christmas episode and the whole character mindvisiting thing is fun and the orgies are okay ,2,television
thekonzo,typical sequel spinoff setup of hey this character that you really liked he is a dad now and he is a pretty bad dad and none of the characters communicate and there are loads of references and fanservice very shoehorned very little authenticity have fun i mean naruto already was kind of a failure with a great concept good characters two great first arcs and maybe one good villain later on pain but everything else was a huge letdown boruto is way worse than that its like fan fiction ,10,worldnews
thekonzo,the middle of the first season is awesome so its worth pushing a little further the end of the season is pretty meh the show is quite slow mystery in general and even this trailer makes me think that they might not actually know where to go with the plot but it does have other qualities like production and characters and it does have its moments a weird one ,6,television
thekonzo,i hate being this person but can we please not make fun of that picture especially after the gas attacks just happened and while most countries dont even take in syrian refugees thanks i concede that you might not have tried to make a joke but were making an honest observation but that guy that replied made a joke and i want to direct this message at everyone reading and and not just that one offender ,0,h3h3productions
thekonzo,thats the joke but i also didnt find the jokes in this video clever ,1,h3h3productions
thekonzo,both loud political extremes felt offended because they are retarded and for everyone else its not just outrage culture but outrage culture being popular normie status and them wanting to be part of a circlejerk even if they arent actually fully behind it if they were honest feels really awkward to witness ,-1,h3h3productions
thekonzo,not even that but when outrage or just critical reactions become a normie thing and suddenly feel very dishonest and pretend noone actually hates the thing but many people go along with the circlejerk because the outrage thing is popular now its not quite the same as everyone wanting to be angry its everyone wanting to take part in the angry culture thing and also people give alot of credibility to extremists on both side of the spectrum for some reason ,2,h3h3productions
thekonzo,what is up with the amount of comments like yours that feel like such casual follower memers i dont want to insult you or be a gatekeeper but this attitude of haha h3 doing his cough and ranting about some stupid drama haha is getting too prevalent i am not big on the eh normies ruining everything but this subreddit really feels like that right now where did everyone go why do i dislike these last few non critical non clever h3 videos so much ,1,h3h3productions
thekonzo,i know this is me being a downer but i really did not like the video much and the comments in this thread are really low quality h3 did recover from the low in quality that they had like 8 months ago but these recent ones were a little too badly researched and just not that clever i also dont think the commercial was that bad for example its just political extremists being outraged and everyone else circlejerking although they dont really have a big problem with the video one more case of ethan not really taking a stance i can appreciate not when it came to politics not when it comes to recent youtube drama not when it comes to mainstream drama whats going on right now ,-8,h3h3productions

thekonzo,i agree it was a little too long they could have used cuts between the phone calls it would have added comedic effect but they probably wanted to make the creator guy relatable and kinda authentic so it wasnt that bad a decision ,-1,television
thekonzo,the loud political extremes being angry does not equate to the video being awful i did not really like it but it had something cute and positive to it it did not feel worth talking about to me but everyone started going along with this huge circlejerk cant you find something actually worth being angry about like the massive amounts of companies that fuck up in some way with their products or workers etc anyways maybe the small outrage isnt that bad maybe most reasonable people think at the back of their head well i did not hate the commercial that much and maybe later down the line well pepsi did do something daring even if it blew up in their faces but they were commited to their positive message maybe it will turn out to be successful branding ,1,television
thekonzo,you basically said you are stupid and unknowledgeable if you dont hate the commercial it insults a lot of people but you didnt give any example you just attemped some unconvincing appeal to authority its not a good commercial but it does have something cute and positive to it for sure people are just circlejerking and the political extremes overreacting terrible message what about it is terrible ffs how can you get so emotional and rallied up over this maybe disconnect yourself a little from the mainstream once in a while buddy ,12,television
thekonzo,people were ready for something to circlejerk over all the political extremes can find something to hate in the commercial uses minorities for brand supports libcuck idiot protests and you have alot of people that just follow the trend i think most reasonable people that are being honest dont really hate the commercial its naive and a bit trivializing like you say but its also kind of cute and positive just whatever ,1,television
thekonzo,its a bit naive and cringe but its not that bad really i feel like people were just ready for something like this to appear and to circlejerk over and of course the two political extremes of alt lighters and sjws have something to hate about the commercial ,1,television
thekonzo,its a fine short and it was well made still relevant enough if you compare every creative person you meet to the entirety of the human hivemind then you will just constantly get disappointed and come across as a big edgelord ,2,television

thekonzo,most players who are annoyed with hearthstone did pay hundreds of dollars already but cant even come close to owning a full competitive collection also you use the if you dont like it gtfo argument and f2p doesnt have to mean cancer progression or bad value for purchases you can focus more in cosmetics or on making purchases feel very attractive and fun without making progression a full time job f2p is not an excuse for making a shitty game f2p is not an excuse for effectively being a pay2progress or pay2win game league of dota for example have way way better progression and the league community was still justified in criticiszing the progression until riot implemented hextech crafting and lowered prices of rethought runes probably even more help for new players in development and even then league shold have a bundle that gives access to most heroes for a price around 80 dollars hearthstone couldnt be further away from that for example ,2,hearthstone
thekonzo,i think you are a bit too strong on this youtube is just 15min of fame thing i think it might be the exact opposite i think youtubers will be way more relevant and impactful than traditional hollywood paparazzi celebreties ever were they have a way stronger personal brand and are way closer to their fans and you can monetize that and in that context ethans stance at least the one you are describing might lead to the exact opposite result he starts to forget what makes youtubers youtubers and in the process alienates his dedicated fans that could happen there was a down in quality of videos almost a year back and they recovered but right now it feels like their content does not have enough meaning and relevance maybe its just memes and collabs when the memes were originally culturally relevant for good reasons ,2,h3h3productions

thekonzo,i have a hard to wraping my mind around someone like toast he is very likable and a good creator but i just dont like how friendly someone like him is with the company he wouldnt dare burning a bridge that he relies on for his new and unstable career how judgemental can i be of that especially when everyone else before him acted like that just a cancerous industry that presents itself as very positive and buddy buddy i wish i didnt have to view it this critically ,2,hearthstone
thekonzo,yeah i know i have probably written like 40 larger posts about how to fix hearthstone and make it sustainable and great for the next decade over the last few years since release i listed the best arguments and thought about different scenaries i talked to people tried to reach out to streamers asking them to raise their voice but in the end it was wasted effort they really dont care and those few blizzard artists and designers that would agree dont have the position to voice their opinion this just wasnt meant to be sucks when you dont have competition or even piracy keeping a company in check i should really give all these new card games a chance though now that things have actually changed still very disappointed in the company and all those people involved including most of the streamers that just never really cared to represent the players interests i guess kripp redeemed himself a little bit with this video ,1,hearthstone
thekonzo,well thats a shame luckily you will get a second and third chance at topdecking your creditcard this year seriously though with dust from legacy cards and cards that left standard i will hopefully be able to craft maybe two of most fun and strong non aggro meta decks in a few weeks maybe i will play a bit of hearthstone again here and there this expansion but i have already given up on grinding all those other decks and legendaries there is just no way and i would rather invest 400 euros in new pc parts or something similar than in probably knowing my luck 10x the warlock legendary ,30,hearthstone
thekonzo,and i will continue to shame this behaviour and tell everyone i can to not fall victim to shitty progression monetization overwatch is great design hearthstone and hots are cancer they are an illness to the industry they managed to take way too much money from many players without giving enough in return even when the card designers are doing okay with this expansion for once ,5,hearthstone
thekonzo,why did you not spend 400 dollars on access to this video game expansion gameplay ,178,hearthstone
thekonzo,yup they made mistakes with the monetization early on but it went really well early on and then made too much money on the casual mobile market especially in china at that point investors dont want to see a big change even if its the right choice sure its anecdotal but from viewing the gaming subreddits the hearthstone subreddits the way hearthstone is mentioned on the internet over the years most dedicated players stopped playing around 2 years ago this sub at this point mostly consists of fanboys and players who started a few expansions in as far as i can tell i would like to look at blizzards data gaming companies usually react way too late when it comes to this evolve is a prime example ,5,hearthstone
thekonzo,all of us have done that before dont deny it d,14,Destiny
thekonzo,ugh,-1,Destiny
thekonzo,they would have been way less players would have abandoned the game or switched to competitors people would have stayed with the games for years longer look at magic and for how long players can stick with card games it would have kept the blizzard image in shape more players trying out overwatch or hots also the game would have been way better and to a game design company this should have value even in a capitalist world everyone i personally know who played hearthstone more than 20 stopped playing exept one arena player i myself stopped actively playing quest arena almost 1 5 years ago i gave up hope in development turning around a full collection became more and more impossible over time even as a player since beta who put 200 euros into the game and plays quite a bit and arena quite well and btw whenever the topic of hearthstone comes up with friends then basically everyone agrees that they feel cheated and that they should never have spent the money on the game and this includes guys they spend 400 dollars on league of legends skins in total most of which they probably havent even used yet just think about it it could have been a game to be exited abotu and play on the toilet every day for the next decade for all of them instead now all of them hate it just because they fucked up the monetization by greeding out its a fucking shame ,3,hearthstone
thekonzo,what this sub should be saying is cut pack prices by 50 increase quest rewards by 30 increase dust returns for commons lower cost of epics make legendaries give 1200 dust focus more on cosmetic purchases and make a lightweight version for mobile at that point the game would still not be cheap blizzard would still make a fuckton of money more players would just purchase and players would just purchase more packs but this subreddit or at least parts of it has been rightfully saying this ever since the game launched and you will always have fanboys elitist whales or ignorant people saying shit like its a card game those just are expensive or if you dont like it leave or you are just entitled blizzard needs to make money gtfo so its never gonna be a unified message even when its 100 the correct solution to the problem which it was all along ,52,hearthstone
thekonzo,well yeah i dont think he really needs crowdfunding but he might not really think creatively enough about his job i mean its destiny or maybe he just does not need it ,-3,Destiny
thekonzo,wait what reynad is the type of ignorant person i would expect to say yeah well sucks for you bad luck hearthstone is a card game and those are expensive go find another game buddy i still feel like hearthstone prices should be cut in half and probably blizzard would not even lose any money because more players would buy packs and players would buy almost twice the amount and that not even enough quest should make it so you can earn one pack every day with not too much time commitment stress of losing too much yeah and that whole dusting system needs an overhaul but whatever i have been saying this ever since the first expansion adventure launched the monetization model was garbage and cost blizzard alot of goodwill and made hearthstone a way way worse game that it should have been and i dont have much sympathy for the developers and even hearthstone personalities that let it happen i like kripps diplomatic approach but i am personally less lenient these days overwatch luckily did not repeat the mistakes of hearthstone and hots good thing we spammed them about it ever since the reveal at blizzcon ,0,hearthstone
thekonzo,its really just about educated people having the confidence to correct folks who shout about pedophiles as a common manifestation of evil by saying pedophilia is a harmful condition but rapists are the criminals you are thinking of there is a difference and thats literally all i think i think consent and age differences in relationships are worth thinking and talking about still but of course we dont want to normalize pedophilia or rape really nobody needs to know that sounds a little too pragmatic and convenient to me the idea is to not hate a person based on their conditions so it would not really matter that much if uncle joe is a pedophile unless you see him behave weirdly thats hard to imagine but thats the goal right or do you worry that that would already be too much normalization do you think its too risky maybe the repercussions and stigma help right now with keeping pedophiles in check while mental health treatment and education is not good enough maybe i am thinking too much about the long term but maybe you are also too pessimistic and have too low trust in therapy or dont respect the societal pressure of demonization enough that might currently actually lead to way more crazy pedo rapists who cant control themselves ,3,Destiny

thekonzo,okay i had to look that up as a non native speaker what exactly are you trying to say that a drawing tablet would not be worth it what makes you think so dont you think destiny uses paint often enough to warrant a small investment like that dont you think that a tool like this would have potential in a profession like his dont you think its at least worth trying out i dont use my cheap drawing tabelt without a screen quite that much but i used my surfaces sketching capabilities quite alot before i returned it for other reasons ,0,Destiny
thekonzo,what find fine why is fine enough his writing at times is barely recognizable and it takes more time in general using drawing tablets might also help him with his job in genral giving his artists and editors better direction prepare himself for debates stuff like that ,-1,Destiny
thekonzo,because the pedophiles might need therapy and need to not feel demonized as a human being all these pedos have to realize is that nobody blames them for literally not fucking kids thats just factually incorrect pedophile rapist in the minds of most people still therapy programs have started appearing over the last few years afaik so its less of an issue but its worth talking about because that way you prevent suffering on multiple ends ,11,Destiny
thekonzo, if gearbox followed through and pulled out that good on them they can no longer be criticized for partnering with g2a if someone is going to be condemned for an act after they make amends there is no reason to make amends you cant reaosnably blame someone for somr one for something they did not do i think thats a little bit of a hard stance you dont make ammense by just reacting ot backlash but imo their public statement was pretty great so i dont mind ,1,Games

thekonzo,if overwatch had heroes unlockable with their chest system maybe via dust or hero crafting shards then the drop rate could either feel good or feel awful depending on the numbers the latter wouldnt mean that the class shooter genre is not for him its like when you criticize the food in a fast food restaurant and then your buddy says maybe burgers and fries just isnt for you maybe you should go to a chinese place and then you would reply with who said i didnt like burgers anymore this food is just shit here what the fuck what happened to your brain ,1,hearthstone

thekonzo,how is stranger things quality not as high as it can be i dont know what could have been improved ,23,television
thekonzo,its impressive in production and visuals and premise but the plot is not exactly awesome yet slow moving mystery basically nothing big happens in the first season not every character and storyline is super interesting but there are quite a few of awesome moments and they basically all become likable and relevant so its not as insulting as other shows that bait viewers into watching with fake mystery bullshit because here you watch for the characters and relationships too basically if they had kept working on a few characters for a little longer for example the german one if they had started the first season with more information about the threat that the group will face and replaced the last third of the season with that and if it had moved 20mph faster then it would be close to a 10 10 first season right now its a very impressive and interesting but slow 7 10 the middle of the season has some pretty great shit the show can still move just about anywhere because again it was mostly just introduction to characters and their personal changing lifepaths so far at the same time the story could also move right in the dumpster because i will admit i personally cant come up with an amazing arc threat if a zombie apocalypse happened i would shrug my shoulders and give it a try because there isnt anything so far that would contradict that new storyroute ,4,television

thekonzo, and there no way you can try to argue that without it validating the views of white supremacists and other race realists because you are basically making their arguments for them thats my entire point if our society was better then we wouldnt have to be afraid of that because small differences in current racial groups would not matter anyways doesnt mean i am naive and dont argue against race realism right now but i do argue that there are alt lighters that want to explore the topic without them being hateful racist maybe gigantic idiots that need to be explained why we try not to be assholes but not neccessarily white nationalists example like for example sargon of akkad jontron is was an idiot and basically parroted nazi propaganda but he himself is as far as i can tell not a hateful person its not about white identity for him or at least to a small degree and i am not a fan of his channel or person really i think thats just something to keep in mind even though its fair for spouting nazi propaganda on twitter to have consequence sponsors and non close businesspartners he deserved what he got but i dont view him the same as i view many other nazis or alt righters that i talked to ,1,h3h3productions
thekonzo,race realism that shows actual scientific small phenotypes differences between races or biological groups of people but that doesnt intend to cause any political policy shift i agree that its risky at the moment but at the same time its sad that so many decades after ww2 and after so much positive result from globalism and progressive values we still cant trust our countrymen to not fall to facist ideas in time of slight stress ,1,h3h3productions
thekonzo,the difference would be one form of race realism being factual and the other form being dishonest unscientific propaganda for people with identity problems i dont want to push my argument too hard i am kinda okay with standing against race realism in general for now but eventually i rather have people be able to not care in the first place if some genes might sometimes on average cause slight differences because 99 999999999999999 of other qualities are the same and problems can always be worked around anyways no need to tell people where to live and who to fuck except of course in jontrons mind there is a reason the altright nazi movement hes probably partly libertarian in that he think no culture value system really is superior and if a majority of a country wants to become facist then thats democratic and a okay spoiler alert thats bullshit progressive modern values are superior and lead to less conflict and a better life for all individuals facism is always bad even in a facist country with brainwashed people except maybe if we need it to fend off some alien invasion or some shit i think its more valuable to focus the term racism on irrational fear and hatred brushing groups with a big brush judging and punishing them in some way i dont like when its used against soft stereotype humor or even alt light curiosity about race realism the phobia terms to this better homophobia is an irrational fear and hatred talking about how well gay couples can raise children or something similar is not inherently homophobic as long as its factual and not motivated by homophobia spoiler alert gay couples can raise children well ,1,h3h3productions

thekonzo,if someone made it up then i would applaude them because people are too quick to see the worst in people on the internet quite a few cynics and sjws need to learn to tame themselves not saying i support the right wing anti sjw bullshit i wonder in the first place why we dont censor names and faces in videos like these when it does not involve a public figure people get fired over drama like that ,1,cringe
thekonzo,no sorry you will have to look that up well its about a former movie critique youtuber and a community website they formed and about stuckmann visiting them and beeing a gloomey presence in the house and overstaying and not having brought enough money in that story non of the sides look good and its been some time and involves alot of financial uncertainty and awkwardness i wouldnt read too much into it and look ahead instead at this point i think stuckmann is a good guy anyways and tries to do a good job i dont think dug up unreliable dirt from many years ago is all that useful ,5,movies
thekonzo,thats a big one too my brain uses the smallest hints and turns them into pretty big spoilers ala oh okay then if he talks about that character like that that means the he probably wont die which means that the plot has to flow that way and maybe this character dies instead etc i can trust stuckmann when it comes to this thanks for reminding me enough other folks dont respect that enough ,10,movies
thekonzo,but he is objectively not a nobody he is more of a somebody than most movies and show critics in the world he is as much of a somebody as one can be these days ,9,movies
thekonzo,i agree that he should improve the writing in his videos a little bit he used the same phrases too often in different videos and now he even repeats his arguments word for word within a single video but the i am a huge fan of and i grew up with this are not just empty words for gaining sympathy he tells us about his perspective and the angle from which his review is coming from ,3,movies
thekonzo,there is some drama from way back then when youtube was young and stuckmann was more socially awkward but it all relies on a single perspective in some anonymous interview with a former friend collegue he has a falling out with there was some memeing because people did not like a page of a script stuckmann wrote casually and started harassing him and his wife there is some hating in general because stuckmann can be a bit of a fanboy his videos are sometimes not super well written and his own creative video segments arent exactly incredible i still like the guy alot his taste and criticism perfectly alligns with how i watch movies and shows i think what he does is great i like that he tries to be fair not overly edgy and values the entertainment factor higher than the harsher critics around the internet even though i personally dont like to watch just entertaining movies ,59,movies
thekonzo,kong and rogue one were recent ones ,13,movies
thekonzo,he is one of the only critics who consistently alligns with my taste in shows and movies compared to most others on youtube blogs or letterboxd i think he is very fair most of the time and doesnt ignore the pure entertainment factor unlike more harsh critics i dont always love the writing of the reviews themselves or his own more creative videos for example his recent rogue one analysis he did not have quite enough arguments like war movie for example but he still offers the opinion i trust the most when it comes to what i should watch in essence i can understand the accusations of hes a fanboy or i dont like him or he is just not good enough at analysis or writing or videomaking but both parts of a fucking nobody who parrots popular opinion are just objectively false ,10,movies
thekonzo, anime is a way less useful term if you just focus on the origin country instead of animation or animation style afaik japanese anime fans arent even that crazy about it its more weebs circlejerking about how special japanese culture and media is and how it has to be viewed in isolation mental garbage imo i think if avatar isnt anime then fma b isnt and thats arguably the best anime around ,8,movies

thekonzo,just start watching it already the comedy is universal its not just satire ,1,television
thekonzo,i disagree my criteria were scifi adventure mystery young protagonists endearing group dynamics the feeling of entertainment i had my suggestions fit okay enough in descending order afaict there arent too many shows close to stranger things which is why it blew up in the first place aside from the quality the setting the characters and the plot are something we havent seen in decades super8 was close i think modern animated disney movies still come kinda close in how kids are caught up in an adventure and are misunderstood ,1,television

thekonzo,i brought it up because i felt it was relevant i like both destiny and h3h3 and think they are somewhat similar i like your animations the fine bros one was not just awesome but prophetic even if you think that destiny caused the whole thing with the 250k comment i still think you did not exactly act classy neither did he probably it does not need to have any consequences i think you guys can make up or have it calm down and forget about it maybe make up later in 60 years when you by chance end up in the same retirement home ,1,h3h3productions

thekonzo,dominance his community has been pretty volatile it calmed down over the last months he is actually pretty serious about mental health and suicide and he tries to use that language less and less a few years back he was hardcore about words are only words faggot but he changed that stance he is a good guy actually ,1,h3h3productions
thekonzo,okay i appreciate that just for context destiny uses off yourself and your an autist to keep his community under control and he doesnt have it easy when it comes to the communities around the people he debates ,-1,h3h3productions
thekonzo,well destiny is always a bit meme y on twitter compared to actual discussion because its twitter but still he was actually giving valid business advice to pebbles i mean the guy uploaded like 1 video per year and then felt like he could complain about youtube monetization and the animation community rather circlejerked around self victimization and pebbles was aggro anyway because he is a semi altright buddy of jontron it was more like destivy vs some uninformed circlejerk mischaracterization and the altright but i concede that everyone was just a bit emotional and things can totally calm down its not like i couldnt be convinced that pebbles isnt an annoying brat only i guess im looking forward to the podcast ,4,h3h3productions

thekonzo,the important question is was it malicious ,1,Destiny
thekonzo,i guess my little interview has pretty disappointing results i didnt plan on making a huge document and making a thread i just wrote a few angry paragraphs after realizing that it wont fit into tweets under sleep deprivation and was hoping for a few accommodating reactions and clarifications it just happened and aint that useful at all really but its something questionmark and i got to test a few ideas of mine questionmark i also do hope destiny gets into another talk with him and presses him on his personal believes a bit more but destiny seems to like talking to him and j f wants to grow his channel so i dont see why it wouldnt happen ,1,Destiny
thekonzo,ill try the optimstic perspective i think in the cases of felix and jon all sides have valid viewpoints and its good that a widespread discussion could take place without anyone basically losing his future over it felix might take a few comedy courses jontron might be more resistant to friends poltiical views now the journalists going behind pewds got shamed a bit destiny got a good amount of recognition unless you were a huge fan of scare pewdiepie or needed jontron to be your personal anti political friendly gaming zone then you are probably fine ,1,Destiny
thekonzo,look i have been up for like 48 hours just reading a few lines of that paralyzes me right now that shit is horrible just imagine what it feels like to know that you basically got a syringe of stupid as a child that is probably a great example to confront self control and freedom of thought type people intelligence is probably a source of identity for alot of them granted i am talking more about the mental handicap level cases but just imagine having someone take that identity away from you and you just cant function as the person you want to be anymore ,1,Destiny
thekonzo,hmm yeah maybe i like to think that some of the art we have is special and unique to our timeline so to speak but maybe zootopia is not the best example i dont know enough about the industry just a handful of screenplay writers sometimes speak about how they get fucked over but thats pretty different from how the disney machinery works probably for the most part i really just care that every year there are a few movies or shows that blow my mind in some way and things are going okay in that regard at the moment oh and i was talking more about getting downvoted a bunch after i felt like i pointed out something interesting about starwars and what maybe makes it so popular i dont even know why i care about downvotes sometimes thanks for the reply ,2,movies
thekonzo, ,8,Destiny
thekonzo,its a very polished elegant concept pitch though i dont think basic is a fair description you could reduce star wars the same way young guy gets recruited by old relative to join a rebellion when something awful happens but actually its just a very ideal concept that would probably come out on top in a competition of a hundred concepts for a scifi fairy tale even making the connection between that concept and the setting that is sci fi can be the pure genius for example because it might convei a feeling of trust in obi wan at least in a very new and intimidating universe where you dont really know what the empire or the rebellion stand for maybe it needed to be exactly that to be star wars so for zootopia you couldnt take any other basic concept that is comparable to the one you were summarizing maybe it needed to be exactly that concept combined with the animal city because its the perfect fit do you understand my point i am not sure i wrote that well edit well not the reaction i was hoping for,0,movies

thekonzo,i mean i am an optimist and hope that someone like trump wont be elected anymore at some point but you are right one should tread carefully when you give the government the power to manipulate schools for example i think its probably possible to implement policies in such a way that a supervillain president cant turn the country and all children into theocratic theist slaves for example but i think the opposite mindset of wanting the government to be as small as possible with as little authority as possible is also not good in the slightest ty to you too ,1,Destiny

thekonzo,for starters i would recommend the first three but i am not that big an anime pro myself i am very snobby and dont want to watch stuff that is just entertaining so i move pretty slowly the 15 was more or less and arbitrary number based on my own thoughts and recommendations i put on my watchlist from multiple critics i respect full metal alchemist brotherhood is the got lotr level show not much else to say pretty much perfect hunterxhunter 2011 version is a naruto onepiece bleach dragonball type show but actually really good pretty much perfect for what it is you will probably be interested in erased from last year a gorgeous short butterfly effect crime mystery childhood nostalgia show some people find the mystery part towards the end a bit underwhelming and thats not unfair criticism but otherwise its amazing steinsgate is a great crazy scientist unreliable narrator time travel show code geass is a bit more nieche but a pretty good dystopia revolution mechs show the first of the two seasons especially has very concise fast and exciting episodes very impressive very entertaining but not without problems ,2,television
thekonzo,that can be said about alot of shows but most are still on television and not on subscription internet services they make money with ads and short seasons mean way less ad space when will we be able to leave this cancer behind us i mean season 1 was pretty damn short might be one of the reasons darabont got fired ,1,Showerthoughts
thekonzo,this hurts me way more than the firefly cancelation thing for example it got a great movie to tie the whole thing up twd is just ruined it ruined the entire apocalypse genre for me ,2,Showerthoughts
thekonzo,all of them can be written to be interesting though the show versions have less depth and consistency and development purpose than the comic ones to be fair the comic isnt perfect most stuff is taking place at one setting kirkmans talent lies more in the worldbuilding vague arc concepts and character concepts but if you dont at least manage to make ricks and carls character developments feel as authentic as on paper then you can just forget the whole thing ,3,Showerthoughts
thekonzo,staaahp this hurts me emotionally ,4,Showerthoughts
thekonzo,or you know a great tvshow if the showrunners were more talented season 1 was great the following seasons had okay parts but really big fuckups then the whole you know how it was back then this is how it is now you arent who you were you know type dialogue with ambient guitar and bass background music started happening and these days they manage to make the most awesome moment from the comics feel like cringe garbage in the show i stand by that it could be alot better i mean look at how bad the first season of fear the walking dead was compared to the first season of walking dead ,46,Showerthoughts
thekonzo, d i mean dumb nazis are a threat because of their annoying presence and well right to vote smart nazis are the puppeteers in the background that organize websites conventions deals and try to push the alt right as movement in the entire west steve bannon is one step below the most powerful man in the world they arent dumb idiots but not dumb ,3,Destiny
thekonzo,you probably have quotas in mind i agree that they would discriminate based on sex however i would find soft quotas acceptable as a temporary last resort measure as long as it doesnt fuck too many people over but i know that this is an extreme view of mine and i dont have an industry or company in mind that would need one maybe its not worth it anyways because it just speeds up a process that would happen anyways at the expense of a few careers of very qualified males at the same time a soft quota ala 20 women could mean that those women will be just as qualified or even more qualified as the men that dont get the job the companies would just be pushed to not favor the male applicants thats what its about anyways and again temporary and as a last resort but i dont know enough about it anyways a quota is the most extreme version anyways destiny was talking more about insentivization sure then you have memes coming up like minorities get into college scholarships way easier but even though thats easily debunked but thats still a pretty extreme topic in america so a better example would be widespread projects for schools that let every student look into every industry and job i dont see why the government doing it is such a big deal i dont understand the antagonization of the government here they have our tax money to work with and to use for the public good ,3,Destiny
thekonzo,i dont like comedy anime one punch man is an exception its entire tone is satirical but very human and modern its one of the maybe 15 anime that should be watched by mainstream people ,12,television
thekonzo,wait what me being a social democrat cuck is my source of income or do you mean that i dont change my mind dude my mind is wide open i am just arrogant enough to dismiss ideas that i consider dealt with not the reasons for the ideas though ,2,Destiny
thekonzo,i am german maybe i just did not watch enough colbert stuff its not just about culture clash for me its about being a real christian and being a cynical comedian dealing with all sorts of topics those are conflicting things to some degree at least i feel like you would agree with that a bit maybe like scientists being way more atheist on average for example i dont have anything againt religion as a hobby really i dont want to say its inferior to atheism afterall life is about enjoying life but lets say some things require you to be an atheist on average maybe ,3,Destiny
thekonzo,yeah i agree that wasnt the main point i was trying to make i mean its part of it but it was more about keeping the opponents background in mind more and having realistic expectations but i feel the same way destiny is constantly trying to improve already and he knows all this he talks about these things constantly when someone suggests who he could debate next and my points are kind of irrelevant ,3,Destiny
thekonzo,for me personally i really dont care my opinion does not depend on any of that but of course people with different mindsets and worldviews interpret discussions differently and for example know what a debator intends to say even when he doesnt present himself perfectly i think destiny did well but i dont think he beat sargon i think sargon was very annoying multiple times and destiny lost his temper in the end as he he lost hope in the discussion leading to anything hence my post ,3,Destiny
thekonzo,hey sorry can you rephrase that i am a dummy and not sure i understand ,2,Destiny
thekonzo,well yes and no i mean i was raised religious and thought within religious realms for a few years myself before rejecting it for me personally i can still go back to that mindset if i want to i just think if colbert is a real christian and does not only enjoy the theatre and culture as well as the comfort of a god and afterlife then he would be an outlier as a clever cynical comedian and social critic anyways yes of course i was admitting that my view on religious people is being challenged by him and my buddy for example ,3,Destiny
thekonzo,agreed but he probably shifts mindsets sometimes he thinks hes doing the world a favor sometimes he just feels like he is an entertainer for his audience sometimes he has to do something questionable or his thing because its his job he is probably consistently dishonest to himself ,5,Destiny
thekonzo,okay then go ahead and call me a casual racist while i fight for equality and a good life for every human being while i try to respect sensitivities to a reasonable degree and be on good terms with every person on group that deserves it i will continue to watch comedians like louis ck or chapelle that make observation about certain social groups i will continue to find playing around with stereotypes in a well meant way to be harmless and fine i will not be alienated by your accusations or feel threatened by sjws even though others might ,1,funny
thekonzo,sargon does not seem to me like he lacks empathy its more that he comes across like self important and eccentric what amount of rapes or murders of your own citizen worth the lives of what amount of refugees if you are capable of phrasing that question like that then you probably have some amount of respect for refugees the problem is that many have not and i think that all larger political sides have to take a stance and be pro empathy and pro helping refugees it might have to have a limit of course and it has to be excecuted well those things need to be discussed but you have to reach an agreement on basic things like that ,3,Destiny
thekonzo,thats interesting i liked your bit on the two perspectives on hard work and being patronizing you wrote it up pretty well but i was talking more about empathy as a concept an argument and as a meaningful value in society meaning that you establish caring about the positive life experience of other humans as something that everyone can agree on if you dont agree with this then i cant talk with you about alot of things because for example i dont think sociopaths should have much authority going forward even though i think sociopaths can coexist in society ,2,Destiny
thekonzo,by not interfering and letting random factors from history run their course you still interfere and make the choice to let it happen you cant have responsibility and pretend like you dont have responsibility a hands off approach is still an approach because you expect certain outcomes if you dont care about the outcome and dont care about what happens i am sorry then i dont want you to decide politics ,13,Destiny
thekonzo,i dont want to educate you or debate you on this i just wanted to point out what i pointed out ,1,Destiny
thekonzo,but got his sidechannel fucked in the process d ,3,Destiny
thekonzo,you painted all refugees with the same brush you take a very extreme and accusatory even insulting stance ,7,Destiny
thekonzo,that is very good thanks sorry for making this thread if you feel like this has been discussed already judging from the upvotes people dont mind too much and i mean i am sure destiny knows this i just still felt like mentioning it ,5,Destiny
thekonzo,big brush you have there ,8,Destiny
thekonzo,yeah i agree ,2,Destiny

thekonzo,yeah thats a very similar mindset ,3,Destiny
thekonzo, mass islamic immigration is a big problem in europe refugees immigrants also the problem is largely dealt with currently the problem is more that we cant really help but let erdogan cum into our ass ,8,Destiny
thekonzo, if you are a trump fan dont watch me to be fair that was meltdown moment he had a huge fight with his wife felt personally disregarded by his entire country as a cancer patient has always had lets say mental vulnerability to stress and yeah again the whole cancer thing that was before he got the news about remission from his doctor he felt like he was about to die and the world gave him the middle finger as he was put down his grave and yeah i am glad i live in germany i mean we dont even have gay marriage probably next year though but the merkel versus schulz election has me smiling because i really dont care much because at least both are sane people with generally social democratic ideas and parties behind them feelsgoodman too bad that i 99 follow english american media ,8,Destiny
thekonzo,god during the marriage argument i could only see the words causation correlation spinning before my eyes mentally i wanted to write each word on each of my hands and slap sargon left and right until he gets it ,14,Destiny
thekonzo, but they both agree that less regulation is better i would still consider destiny a social democrat the no regulation is a big meme if you dont regulate then thats still a form of regulation and from what destiny says i think he wants america to advance to the point where socialist policies can take care of those without work wether that means retraining or welfare especially going forward when automation hits he doesnt want a welfare state in the sense that he doesnt want to commit to risky policies he doesnt want america to end up as a bad example of a welfare state destiny patience seems to have run out and he no longer listening because sargon was not respecting the points of the debate he constantly went back on things that were agreed on before he made it impossible to talk about programs meant to change culture and open up industries for women or blacks because he just cant get over personal responsibility versus influencing factors no debator or politician could take sargon seriously if he starts denying how statistics and observing tendencies in social groups work sure sargon was calm about it and likes to appear rational but he was actually playing dumb destinys patience ran out because he specifically tried the can we agree on this thing like 3 times and sargon fell back into retarded patterns destiny really needs to keep a leash on his temper i agree i dont think it was that bad but as my last paragraph in the op post says i think he could work on a few things still to defend him i personally think its fine to get frustrated when arguing with the alt right and alt light so often afterall they are the more extreme political stance and should attempt to explain themselves well when the exact opposite is true because many of them are edgelords i wont hold it against him if he is sick of that whole spectrum but it of course would hurt the whole rational friendly discussion thing he tries to get going with his channel ,19,Destiny
thekonzo,eh i am not looking for carnage id rather see actual political discussion and not just destiny explaining why we try to not be stupid this might be my entitled european perspective where we have a very different political spectrum but i am getting tired of the trump altright stuff and would rather see him explore actual politics of the next decades people knew most republicans and conservatives where stupid and backwards for many years how about we talk about topics that even elon musk and bill gates bring up these days ,5,Destiny
thekonzo,true true but destiny came to the conclusion and i just repeated it i like the way destiny goes about the discussion i just think he would be able to process them better if he kept the opponents background in mind more ,3,Destiny
thekonzo,discussing in very good faith is a the reason probably no pun intended ,3,Destiny
thekonzo,i find that many younger right leaning folks want to make observations and mini conclusions that support the way they feel but are mostly unable to come up with policy suggestions or solutions or even real arguments they imply alot of things i think they are just really rallied up by the the world is going to shit and the sjws are ruining the west narratives ,20,Destiny
thekonzo,more of a positive spin on this it still confuses me that colbert is religious doesnt fit with the way he argues about most subjects i also have a muslim buddy that i can talk with about anything like philosophy and nothingness after death basically talking in atheist space for hours and at the same time he still leans more towards islam at least he agrees at this point that one should only follow a good god ,11,Destiny
thekonzo,i feel the same way that was weird also i personally dont even care what groups or terms my believes allign with at the moment i try to be openminded about every single issue anyways and dont believe in all opinions being equally valid i want to find the truth the best option or options with the given information and then move on ,3,Destiny
thekonzo, on average people watch destiny stuff because they like him as a person people watch sargon because it reinforces their views i think you are the exception to the average i have no data but thats my impression i dont doubt that you can like him for making logical arguments in territory of thought that others dont meddle with or when he tries to have an outside non mainstream perspective i just dont like the way he argues combined with him not seeming to accept social determinism but i do respect his calm way of speaking debates goals should not be about changing your debaters opinions rather giving them information about your own side and let them come to a conclusion for themselves i personally dont like debates that equate to dickmeasuring and comparing cheap polemic strategies if you dont want to discover something together with the discussion then its a waste of time for me destiny seems to feel the same way and rather brands it as discussion than debate with my last paragraph in the op post i meant to say that with someone like sargon its good to keep the background in mind similar to when groups or instituations send speakers lobbyist they wont be open minded then you have to go differently about the discussion to get value out of it ,10,Destiny
thekonzo,maybe soloq without voicecomp is the problem though maybe he is bringing something awesome to games as long as teams are just a little bit more skilled and coordinated maybe in 5 years the upper levels of the playerbase have advanced in skill to the point where ryze becomes very attractive and you want to scrap all that because in chaotic low quality soloq games a heroes strengths arent abused by scrups i phrased that a bit edgy on purpose to make the point clear ,2,leagueoflegends
thekonzo,ugh i already kinda hated the second half of daredevil season 2 this feels like a repeat of that maybe i will try maybe i mean i have heard from a few people including you that the second half of iron fist gets better ,1,h3h3productions
thekonzo,thats the case in any game with different characters to play they have different levels of impact in uncoordinated games some heroes abuse bad enemies very much some like mercy are not proactive at all anyways generally always play stuff with high kill potential pharah roadhog and zenyatta are the holy trinity of gaining rank even if you are not the best player ever plus they are fun ,2,Competitiveoverwatch
thekonzo,good suggestion actually worth reaching out to the admins for this would be a reasonable request for a quick value change or future mod function in general big subreddits should in rare cases even be able to change the name entirely if its for a good reason communities and sub purposes sometimes change ,6,Competitiveoverwatch
thekonzo,and that doesnt mean that the rework was bad it means that he is not great in soloq until there is voice chat and thats it he does not need another rework his issues were fixed for the most part and ryze is very playable in soloq for people who want to invest the time especially when they duoq with an engager top laner or jungler i mean its not like i would mind another rework i personally suggested many many times before both last reworks that ryze should actually just become a much more close ranged melee combo fighter mage with a tp ult like he has now i am fairly sure that the suggestions has been read by devs but even still i would be okay with ryze staying the way he is now ,2,leagueoflegends
thekonzo,should i really not give it a try i am very crtitical but also very curious ,3,h3h3productions

thekonzo,its not racist those are stereotypes this is about stupid simplistic character writing in tvshows this is supposed to be comedy i can find this funny without thinking that every person loves chicken or is a meth cook anyways i am done talking to you people if you want to write me off as a racist because i find normal harmless comedy funny then go ahead and be a dishonest outraged thinskinned sjw its the funniest thing you wont find much stronger advocates for equality and respect for all humans and a conjoined human society than me but for some reason you want to alienate me and portray me as a racist enemy because of joking about some stereotypes i guess all comedians are racists now i guess every poignant and fun depiction of conflicts between genders is sexist now i guess any overly fabulous depiction of a gay character in any story is homophobic now we cant have fun we can talk about difficult subjects without being decent and friendly to one another we cant have the benefit of the doubt ,1,funny

thekonzo,how many fucking times to i have to mention that i am okay with nerfs especially to her selfheal grenade to make it a heal over time and lower her effective hp when she is getting flanked of course you drama queens once again band together and downvote everyone and throw around with hyperbole and garbage arguments to make it sound like ana is the worst designed character ever dude she has zero mobility her skills all have counterplay require aim her sleep is quite hard to hit on most flankers and her grenade will basically be used for selfheal those fucking are weaknesses in her design even though she was or even is still overtuned i just said stop fucking crying about ana most op in the game when that doesnt make any fucking sense in a game with heroes that have all different purposes again with heroes like rein soldier widow around she still dies to a fucking widow headshot she still dies to good flanker players especially when two divers go after her together all i want is for you to stop being such babies and start being reasonable again and advocate for the correct changes and not rage y cut her healing in half bullshit edit also even the supports dont compete like that lucio is more important in situations lucio is picked as much as he is because he has the only thing ana does not movespeed boost exactly my fucking point mate and you play ana for her generalist strength as an immobile backliner for her nade against zenyatta and for her snipe against pharah for example yes she is a little too self sufficient because of her hp but stop fucking being unreasonable ,5,Competitiveoverwatch

thekonzo, i have said my share of stereotypes in the past and have learned the hard way that it was not funny and it is offensive while it may have good intention i do not know what though it distasteful no wrong if you are white you might have a hard time finding this offensive how could you white people outnumber blacks tenfold here you disagree with yourself by your own logic the context makes stereotypes offensive a white person finding stereotypes about themselves not offensive while a black person might the context not the stereotype itself and the context changes over time and varies from region to region from person to person you dont have ownership over that you dont have ownership over what stereotypes are funny and which are not you have the most popular comedians in the world making jokes on set like these in the comment section jokes about stereotypes about their girlfriends or how life would be like if they were black or asian or white or gay or whatever those jokes arent racist or sexist or homophobic they are stupid fun with stereotypes or social critique and people in the audience of all colors and backgrounds can enjoy that you dont get to taboo that ou just dont you should be ashamed of yourself for having such a lack of good comedic taste fuck off the comments are racist to me they arent they are about stereotypes there is a difference those words have definitions and look up the definition of the word wrong because thats what you are again i am sorry if you have been the victim of racism or abuse to the point where you are this sensitive i dont want to belittle the way you feel but you are overstepping your boundaries here you are being extremely judgemental and trying to taboo something that is harmless and enjoyable to me and many others ,1,funny

thekonzo,there is a difference between racism and stereotypes there is a difference between hatefulness and insensitivity a difference between propaganda a jokes i personally think if you are offended by jokes about a black version of walter white liking chicken then you really really need to work on that and give people the benefit of the doubt more i mean there might be reasons for your sensibilities and thats fine thats why being insensitive is even a concern but you putting the racist label on this is really worrying like i am hugely disappointed in this part of the comment section and the amount of upvotes behind this moral outrage about very well meant harmless stereotype jokes about character writing in tvshows you might think what the fuck now he blames me but seriously thats how i feel i am hugely disappointed in you for this the way you try to make appearance a taboo subject the way you view all stereotypes as hateful thats not to say that i dont respect that you feel offended and it sucks that a post on r funny made you feel bad and brought some racial issues up that bother you anyways i think i made myself clear black version mirrored version of walter white the plot is now an uplifting story about a former meth cook becoming a chemistry teacher racism racism racism god what the fuck is going on with some of you people ,-1,funny
thekonzo,really hard to tell if you are trolling or actually that aggressive and accusatory i mean its a comedy sub but those part of the comment section seemed pretty serious anyways im gonna remove myself from this situation and not further feed your trolling or feed into your insane perversion of moral outrage ,0,funny
thekonzo,i fucking with my first two comments agreed that creepshots are wrong for fucks sake what the fuck is wrong with you do you have such identity problems that only this sort of outrage can you give a meaningful experience in life right now ,-1,funny
thekonzo,thats not well meant and you werent making an observation about my looks you were looking to harass ,1,funny

thekonzo,if you think that making a joke about a black walter white eating chicken if unaccetable racism then i really dont think we can talk anymore because my mother taught me to not interact with insane people ,2,funny
thekonzo,you mean well meant stupid stereotype jokes is that such a bad thing should that be taboo or do you perceive that as racism ,0,funny
thekonzo,thats not very nice ,0,funny
thekonzo,well maybe but that doesnt make the picture racist like its not even racism by association its just a bunch of comments that op has nothing to do with and those stereotypes are not necessarily racist the chicken thing isnt negative the black prevalance in prisons is not racist if you dont blame the black people or their genes for it but know that the legal system is fucked up and black people on average get pushed more towards criminality for a number of socioeconomic reasons that a non racist observation its a stereotype and i mention it i can even joke about it well meant or with cynicism but that doesnt make me a racist maybe insensitive i think you should really reconsider what you consider racist and insulting and maybe not keep alientating people that are on your side if you want to fight against actual racists and unfair instituations and bad conditions in whatever part of a country or the world count me in but if you want to shame me to such a degree for finding ops picture funny or for enjoying a few jokes about stupid stereotypes then count me out ,0,funny
thekonzo, this hurts noone except i concede his privacy have you even read my comment also making photos in public is legal doxxing me is not legal but i do think this modern presence of cameras is something we will still need to rethink probably faces should generally be censored but still the image from ops post is really great and funny and well meant so it its not that easy a subject ,2,funny
thekonzo,i tried to approach it like that a few times and thought i was getting into that same mindset but then after a while there will always come the games where you have literally zero impact and realize that as mercy you are at the mercy of your teammates and generally how the game plays out proactivity is the keyword its just not there if you are curious my suggestion would be e ability target a small area with her pistol to shoot a defibrillator tazer bullet to create a small electric field aoe for a few seconds that slows and even prevents using movement abilities probably not the this thing can maybe be targeted with guardian angel for mercy to fly towards targeting either like ana sleepdart or like reaper tp but not quite as far and maybe not instant cooldown 15 seconds passive after healing boosting a friendly target for 4 continuos seconds the beam will lock on and remain for 2 seconds even if you let go of rmb lmb or swap to your pistol your next three pistol shots are small defibrilator bullets and deal increased damage and will briefly slow struck enemies maybe cooldown 12 seconds after shooting it might look bland on paper but i think it would do alot for the feel of playing her ,1,Competitiveoverwatch
thekonzo,racist unacceptable come the fuck on cant one at least make well meant observation about peoples looks anymore this hurts noone except i concede his privacy i am replying to you and not the guy above that says do not take creep shots of people which is true even though the picture was great his comment was good yours is insane and 83 upvotes as of now and to think that i fight against the anti sjw circlejerk on a weekly basis ,11,funny
thekonzo, she clearly the best hero in the game she literally cant be because she doesnt fill all the roles overwatch heroes dont compete like that even the supports dont compete like that lucio is more important in situations zen and mercy also have their merits ana has no mobility and while her grenade is strong and has many uses it has a single cooldown her damage already got nerfed substantially only debuff freeze trap silence hack you mean the only anti heal yeah so what i mean sure she is a monster and useful she is a toolkit utility healer backliner a little too tanky probably i support that ana nade should have half the healing proc over time but the game is not finished anyways still a few hero reworks and and teamcomp adjustments need to happen before you can make definitive judgements about a hero ,-6,Competitiveoverwatch
thekonzo,oh come on what does most op even mean when the heroes all have different roles you could say the same about reinhardt or soldier or widowmaker if someone had perfect aim etc and ana is not exactly that toxic to play against unless you are a prebuff winston i am all for testing out nerfs if she is really that impactful at high level and in tourney play as long as its not fueled by crybabies who want ana to end up having basically no selfheal for example ,3,Competitiveoverwatch
thekonzo,whatever national identity means its just vague meaningles tribalism at this point in the well off european countries and a language barrier otherwise its literally the same culture and mindset ,2,geopolitics
thekonzo,and most of them have been fixed in a good manner ana did not exactly ruin the game even with her strength reinhardt is reinhardt he is a core pillar of the game the only real problem is that a rein shield is the only protection against a rein ult they will probably nerf that ult a little bit eventually i am optimistic that junk will get worked on soon i would really love if mercy had more proactive and skillful elements to her i have a pretty good e ability and a small passive in mind but in the end her ultimate is just too crazy to allow those changes she is kind of balanced and very attractive to lets say a certain type of player but it sucks that she is not all that fun to play for me and that she is very hit or miss bastion is in a very good state now he will probably need his passive buffed a tiny bit once again people were such crybabies about him it wasnt even a week of bastion meta ,1,Competitiveoverwatch
thekonzo,i think you are wrong about that ,-1,geopolitics

thekonzo, blizzard can very well fail the hearthstone team failed the hots monetization made the game a failure starcraft basically died because the devs failed wow had gigantic failure expansions and at this point a new expansion makes for a pretty good 1 week rpg game and not much more but overwatch has pretty much made no wrong choices so far and has the biggest talents from blizzard working on the game these guys are the leading scientists of their area ,1,Competitiveoverwatch
thekonzo,suggestion what if amp it up had its own small circle and would be as small as current crossfade while crossfade gets a little larger again accomplishes pretty much the same as current ptr changes but makes it a bit less punishing for ult generation if do your own thing for a little bit on lucio ,2,Competitiveoverwatch
thekonzo,k what percentage of books and movies and tvshows have you watched what do you guess 1 let me spoil the 99 for you because maybe its your responsibility to avoid the internet i mean you did put a weird edit there instead of just a fucking got spoilers s5 or whatever but you dont really seem to care about spoiling the show for anyone i get that got is basically part of modern culture and that its different from some great book that you havent come around to read yet but its such a small effort that makes sure that you dont hit a handful of people that didnt have the time or opportunity or interest yet to watch the show not sure why you jump to blaming when its really just about minor effort ,1,photoshopbattles
thekonzo,but the lucio rework does make him more demanding and skillful play more rewarding does it not i can understand that you are worried about deathball and heroes strategies that are stupid easy and cant just be outplayed but i think you need to remind yourself of that overwatch is not fully fixed yet maybe with the lucio changes deathball dive etc will be in a perfect spot in theory but junkrat still doesnt fulfill his role so the entire balance system collapses ,4,Competitiveoverwatch
thekonzo,this isnt talked about enough lucios ult charge system might be a problem ,2,Competitiveoverwatch
thekonzo,the overwatch team is pretty much as good at design and balance as it gets they threw shit at the ptr and are observing if it works as intended so what lucio with these changes will be more specific and require more specific heroes and strategies even if those will be strong and prevalent it doesnt mean that the mini rework is a failure it would have still done its job ,2,Competitiveoverwatch
thekonzo, i will fill i will play rein or lucio thats such a true observation ,29,Competitiveoverwatch
thekonzo,he meant you might as well put a bit of time in learning positioning with pharah and then you do the same as your junkrat but also induce pure terror in most enemy teams even bastion is better at junkrats job now ,1,Competitiveoverwatch
thekonzo,junkrat by design is supposed to have a very clear and prevalent role an anti flank anti deathball backliner with huge damage he is just too weak at that there will be always a hero that has the lowest pickrate that would be sombra an anti defense sabotage hero or sym and torb as defense heroes junkrat is different from that this is not like mobas with 100 heroes where they cant all be balanced and many characters represent the same role and strategy overwatch heroes are supposed to be unique specific perfectly viable and overpowered in a sense because the enemies can still adapt ,2,Competitiveoverwatch
thekonzo,double steel trap would be a horror to play against actual horror i much prefer the skillshot instant cc trap that is suggested here i much prefer just about anything over double trap riptire bubble meh i think junkrats kit needs to be refocused i want his ult to become a more effective solo kill assassin tool then it wouldnt need the bubble thing which kind of fucks alot with the counterplay aspect its supposed to have ,5,Competitiveoverwatch

thekonzo,after a while you will probably not feel that satisfied with the few results on sites like that imdb is pretty much useless when i comes to tvshows fans just rate the show highly and others dont feel confident in giving it a rating after they stop watching the best thing is probably to ask once in a while in recommendation subreddits and making a list and checking for metacritic and rottentomato scores i wish there was something better similar to letterboxd but for tvshows but when it comes to managing tvshows and the episodes you watched i recommend next episode no review function but its still very useful for me ,5,television

thekonzo,so essentially you have anti globalist and self centred views and no hope in progress or better education if thats working for you fine but just because you are a cynic you shouldnt go to the lengths of stopping people who try to make life more fair and support all sorts of people like for example people with mental illness i mean i could summarize your views on empathy and the life experience of other humans as pretty fucked up i dont need to be a marxist to see it that way you do you but i think you have a very pessimistic view of what society progress and life in general are about i dont understand why people like you choose to adapt nationalist and anti progress political views instead of just well retreating from politics ,1,changemyview
thekonzo,not that i know of i am just going from the way he reacted to destinys arguments in that debate to me it didnt just sound like rambling but he got confused and insecure and yeah as i wrote his income depends on him not accepting the concept anyways he is a lost cause anyways ,2,JonTron

thekonzo,hey thanks buddy so that was a joke thanks i feel really sorry about the situation destiny was put it regarding his suicidal friend it took me years to develop a stance on suicide that i feel confident enough with to talk to depressed people its not like we are being taught that shit in school and destiny gets hit with the club of eternal regret for trying to be respectful of his friends feelings and desperation for a moment seriously i had alot of people in university and friendcircles of the opinion that suicide should be a personal right if it wasnt then what would that mean for self determination any one of the could have ended up in that situation of course its bullshit afterall we humans do by design not want to kill ourselves unless we are driven to it by factors and for the most part those factors are reversable and an affected person can of course not make rational choices on their future and basic problem solving even fuck man why does every public figure have some fucked up shit in his history ,2,Destiny

thekonzo,only intelligence like us could even have a concept of purpose and meaning the universe has no consciousness so of course only we can have control over that and since you would probably want to reject authority telling you what lives purpose should be you would want to have personal control over that luckily our intelligence works by constantly enjoying and looking for enjoyment through fulfilling drives so the whole ordeal is enjoyable for most of us so the purpose is to be what you are to enjoy by doing what makes you enjoy yourself yeah and thats about it usually when we look for the stars in terms of religion and scifi we are actually just looking inside ourselves we project inner conflicts onto gods and aliens and seek confirmation or criticism or authority so people in constant search for answers usually just have problems in their lives social mental stuff like that ,1,changemyview

thekonzo,destiny tries to not say faggot anymore and the autistic thing helps him get his weird community under control it was a trend word for them and he kind of took over the reigns and steered it somewhere else not defending either one just explaining it i think destiny is a bit of an oddity but every few months or so i watch a video of his and he makes alot of progress i think the debate thing he has going on now is a great thing but i agree that jons content is fine which makes it different from the pewdiepie thing but still i think felix has been abused by journalists for clicks i feel like jontron should face some consequence for pushing white nationalist propaganda he was posting that shit on twitter which is his public image constantly even before this isolated political debate which would be more of a neutral ground if it was really just here ,2,JonTron
thekonzo,the persona sargon is pretty much alt right because thats how he makes money the guy behind sargon had his worldview shaking in a debate with destiny because it was obvious that sargon did not understand social determinism and thought that everyone who is poor is at fault for it its not like he would ever change his channels direction either way ,33,JonTron

thekonzo, this is kind of my point if we cannot get it right at nation scale then global scale is hardly going to be easier than that this is a challenge that is beyond our capabilities again you take the current state of things and take it as proof that any future system cant work even though they arent really related there are so many factors at work you cant really reduce it like that it does not matter how educated or well off people are if they have free agency then they have the option to choose wrong and do wrong manipulation in this context is removing that agency in part or full surreptitiously peopl of course dont have agency the better the education and the better the living conditions the more they make the right decision we dont even teach basic psychology american schooling is a mess and you pretend like its representative of how humanity is gonna look like forever with the mindset of look we are already trying meanwhile trump gets elected no things are still gonna change drastically i am not sure about your essay on ai from what i can imagine we will always need to closely control what and how an ai things and what motivations it has upon creation an ai should have no drive to preserve itself or do anything we will slowly add stuff like that to make them be happy specific tools and they will be fine with it anything else is risky to the point of threatening all non ai life the sociopath bit i agreed with what you said but with a little bit of education about social psychology and with society moving forward people will be able to spot sociopathy and it will not be all that benifitial in positions of power anymore things will change in general empathy skills will be more and more important look at tech companies and how they work look at top european politicians thats the path we want to be heading we dont want to stick with hopefully getting a manipulative male leader that singlehandedly steers the country through bullshit people we want those times to be over protecting your own tribe and territory is something that is written into our dna thats half pessimistic and half nazi propaganda almost you are excusing and normalizing shitty behaviour because its natural when in reality a different way of living is very possible and leads to better results i agree that there is tribalism but its not a good thing moving forward unless you are talking sports clubs you gotta take that identity aspect under control it has to be part of basic education we have already seen what happens when islamic nations get democratic choice in the arab spring religion the way its practised in islamic countries is a problem i think we all want to see that solved right i am confused as to why you keep mentioning current problems that we all hope will be solved soon and take that as proof that a world with those problems solved cant exist i already live in that society and it is not my responsibility to save the rest of the world from its own choices it really is if you dont care what happens to other humans then you are just unempathic for whatever reasons with bettering conditions humans will always want to be empathic towards other humans its not their fault that they were born in a different country ,1,changemyview
thekonzo,but a large part of the alt right are nazis you want to normalize that and when xenophobes anti immigrant people and fascist followers also identify with the alt right then you have to see them as the sane representative majority of the movement i am sorry but from a european perspective american politics are largely extreme because the republican party already is a far right party and the democrats just a center party on a european scale thats already an extreme state of things and now the alt right is even way way further right to the republicans although nowadays one cant really tell anymore seemingly russian connections are an a okay thing for them now i dont buy this stop being so judgemental both parties have their strengths and weaknesses both are practically the same just start getting along again and i dont buy this dont call the alt right nazis because that way you turn the people to the extremes and practically make them nazis see its your fault ,1,television

thekonzo,thats a very simplistic view yeah larger countries have more problem areas but you just assume that they will stay problem areas over the next 100 years the more voters in a system the less your vote matters your vote doesnt matter anyways you dont have control anyways its a system designed to keep politicians in check and select parties and guys based on topics and appeal its not your vote that matters its the party program and the events unfolding that matter even in smaller countries the vote numbers are high enough that you are talking about a mass of people deciding and a mass of people behaves in predictable ways the current problems would be magnified yeah but we are supposed to fix those problems and many more important problems that we have are of global scale so you gotta work together anyways i am just saying that eventually there will be no reason a single government wont work even if you rather have 2 incase one of them goes to shit then that would still be the most ideal single governement system each government should have perfect checks and balances anyways each government should have every human in mind anyways ,1,changemyview
thekonzo,i am glad that you want to bring up potential problems with a naive utopian goal but i am talking about eventually and you only mention current problems that we are working towards solving eventually you will want to have a fair society and people to move past discrimination when we teach social psychology in school and stuff like that why do you think that these problems will remain you dont need ai to be diplomatic or empathic no manipulation required the good thing is that an ideal society is in the interest of everyone except for a handful of sociopaths who are still compatible we dont have to make people take drugs to supress their want to kill each other in general you seem to see as manipulation what is merely education and better circumstance most western citizens right now would be compatible with a good world government as long as it has checks and balances maybe still parties and takes care of everyone again if many country leaders werent so dumb if we had no real international conflict anymore then thing could already move towards more conjoined problem solving at that point we would basically already have a single government because they all work in the same interest ,1,changemyview
thekonzo,you are drawing arbitrary lines at certain population sizes for some reason and again you want a government that cant get corrupted and will represent all humans anyways no matter the actual size of the country i havent heard of anything that indicates that a world government couldnt work i am not sure why we need conflicting nations one as a pseudo democratic one party system and the others with two core parties that will essentially be the same ,2,changemyview

thekonzo,a single world government is gonna happen eventually anyways there is no reason to not have it you need the individual governments to have checks and balances in place anyways and need to represent all citizens and basically respect all humans anyways i think its pretty clear that international conflicts are a system that isnt sustainable you want perfect diplomacy and everyone to be taken care of and all countries and humans to profit that equates to a single government the problem is getting there not the afterwards but i agree the solution to climate change wont come from politicians but from researchers and influencers but it doesnt help if people work united its quite likely that the shift in thinking in the chinese government on this topic is caused or at least accellerated by diplomacy and the west pushing for environmental matters ,-2,changemyview

thekonzo,its really not i spend enough time on altright forums and talked with the exact people that are influencing jontron they are nazis even if they seem less insane and seem rational their identity consists of being caucasians and being part of a great superior to most race with an exception of a handful of them that want to create one somewhere else if possible or those that are still on the edge and just want to vent some steam they would be willing to enforce an ethnostate brutally throw out most non whites disallow women from voting because they are too emotional and tell people who to fuck and how to raise their kids all because they derive identity from being white and now feeling threatened by libcucks muslim foreign antiwhite jewish conspiracies i swear to you i really looked deep and tried to see that most of them just dont like pc culture or whatever or that they are just a little worried about whites becoming a minority and just want to give the topic a chance nope its waaay passed that stage for that entire alt right thing they are a pretty large nazi movement please just try to dare and see them like that for a moment you dont need uniforms and swastikas to stand against everything we have built in the west ,32,JonTron

thekonzo,well regarding season 1 and merle for example i just disagree it felt like an actual apocalypse and constant danger with very different characters thrown together all of them forced from one situation into the next with generally interesting plot and themes but afterwards it was just disappointment after disappointment especially for me as a comic reader ,21,television
thekonzo,the comic is quite slow right now i am expecting a big twist at the end of this arc though i expect alot of people to die and something like carl his girlfriend and michonne travelling the sea or maybe the walking dead is just in general lazy and done ,3,television
thekonzo,this video is quite discouraging and disappointing not because of the production quality or effort not at all but for the most part the information is all stuff that one already gets a feel for after a handful of games of playing mercy but thats not the fault of the video maker top mercy players just practically do the same as mediocre mercy players its great that people have a hero to play that is less demanding for perfect aim and excells in other ways but this character is just so so not proactive in general for me and many others i assume its just not rewarding to play and train on her just a bit of hide and seek and praying for good conditions for a rezz she so desperately needs a new ranged ability and something to encourage pistol play but at the same time she is balanced right now and will quickly become very overbearing the moment she feels good indepent of her 11v6 ultimate ,-1,Competitiveoverwatch
thekonzo,i thought the sickness arc was a low point hey lets make a season where everyone gets ill and yeah thats basically it or when the governor did not only stay around for way too long and ruined andrea as a character in the comics she is a badass sniper and ricks bae but also got a fucking extra season after that i dont even remember its too much to list i have a feeling the show creators dont even come close to understanding just how much they fucked it up how they ruined a perfect opportunity and create nothing of value the show is a complete failure at this point ,18,television
thekonzo,spoilers they probably did it to manipulate the audience because they might have been worried about some backlash later on,6,television
thekonzo,the poor writing has not existed in season 1 early parts of season 2 were fine too the governor introduction was fine also but most other things were completely fucked up talentless fucks and now every episode is a super slow soap opera centred around 3 characters with this constant garbage dialogue ala you know how it is like things back then you are who you were we do what has to be done and shitty ambient bass guitar music in the background such melancholy ,31,television

thekonzo,k without being triggered or really wanting to insult you i still feel the need to say that you are a bit of an irrational unempathic dismissive asshole just to make sure that you know it ,1,hearthstone
thekonzo,i think the top gifs on the frontpage are for the most part still great for me when it comes to mobas then yeah interesting plays rarely ever happen and even if then you just have the feeling of well bronze 5 games so what but overwatch is different imo there is so much potential for interesting stuff to happen ,1,Overwatch
thekonzo,it would make the overwatch reddit scene feel more connected and like a hub with a common interest in the game and the community it just feels great i think and its great for new players and users gaming subs are traditionally very good at introducing new users to the reddit website in general ,12,Overwatch
thekonzo,a whale can be a casual at least the way i use the word the opposite would be hardcore and competitive players many of the hearthstone players that spend alot of money dont even play that much or that dedicated at a high rank ,3,hearthstone
thekonzo,you really dont have much empathy do you,1,hearthstone
thekonzo,no i dont think its lunatic at all i also hope that consciousness is something that remains upon death i like to think that its part of some physical energy like the force we dont know how it all works and there might be something like that involved but at the end of the day that would still turn out to be scientific and logical and not magic existence without reason stays a weird concept for me landing on that spark of light surrounded by endless nothingness feels unlikely but if you think about it you would only ever be able to observe anything if the condition is already met if that makes any sense the big bang happened because if it had not happened then we wouldnt exist to know even if it only happened 1 out of infinity times then that 1 time would be the only time we could be there to think about it and give it meaning without our perception present in the first place things happen instantaneously or basically not at all and again i think our existence has reasons but you have to have the confidence to take authority over these reasons we are the ones who observe we are the ones that give things meaning and enjoyment and feeling good are what drive us if we were looking for the purpose for life in the universe what would a potential answer make you feel like comfort happiness closure we can already answer that by leading fulfilling lives i find that often when we look to the stars and write about science fiction then we are actually just projecting things that are going on within ourselves with aliens its about finding someone who would judge us from a different perspective with god its an authority with absolute certainty and correct advice and a safe lap to sit on when we cant find happiness on earth and look for answers elsewhere then thats really just depression or obsession with curiosity but that isnt to say that you cant believe things anymore religion for example can be helpful and enjoyable and thats fine we dont need to be 100 rational again its really just about having a good time and because of that being wrong but happy sometimes is being right and you can be confident in that as long as you arent hurting yourself or someone else in the process no problemo anyways thanks for the talk gotta play some zelda now ,2,technology
thekonzo,its great for public figures and for when they are creatively engaging with their community especially when the important tweets get posted on reddit but twitter itself for the general public is impractical but i do love that companies have accounts and react to things and are forced to do authentic pr ,6,technology
thekonzo,eh whatever a good dc movie could happen anyday its not like suicide squad the concept couldnt have been realized in a great way its just depressing that they seem to fuck up again and again and again they fail so badly at characters right now and its not even that marvel movies are great at that ,-7,movies
thekonzo,maybe he intends to sell the account maybe its a bot gotta profit a bit from fucking up humanities communication or maybe hes just a goodold karmawhore ,3,natureismetal
thekonzo,because that way more nolan than dc,0,movies
thekonzo,you should see logan you will probably love it deadpools first half has pretty dark humor and a dark story and crude action and brutality sure its less depressing because of humor but i would still count it the second half is alot closer to standard marvel movies ,2,movies
thekonzo, i think rejecting free will implicates that human life has no value how does it implicate that just because we arent magical doesnt mean we dont experience life and dont enjoy life and that that isnt meaningful to us which leads to the conclusion that nothing has value and makes anything existing at all a weird thing in general of course objectively everything is meaningless because objectivity has no emotional attachement the universe doesnt care we care because thats how we work and thats okay we dont need to be padded on the back by some god or purpose in universe luckily we can lead fulfilling lives without any of that so you think thinking through your options and selecting the one you liked best is the same as never having had other options you have options because you lack information to make a definitive call or because you have conflicting drives still hasnt anything to do with randomness or magic in my opinion thinking through the different options is part of the process of making a free decision thats doesnt make the decision free its still based on the factors and the logic behind the options you will never be free from logic or from your drives or your experiences you would want to be free of what makes up your existence i also think that people can act morally and decide to do good or bad morality is really just about empathy and the compromises that comes with society and caring about long term effects you do bad things when you are in a stressful situation or somehow forced to look out for yourself or when you have been fucked up mentally you do good things when you are in a calm environment and have been brought up in a positive way and have been taught to think rationally there are no good and bad spirits within your whispering in your ear good and bad are just emotional concepts really that help us process human behaviour its always just a result of circumstances that make for who you are and how you think and act the more society progresses the more its about finding the ideal compromise and conditions that everyone can live with the more people are generally good because they are allowed to be that way by not having a fucked up environment its a solution to a problem its not humans being good its humans being smart and empathic ,1,technology
thekonzo,everything is creepy and cringy,2,gaming
thekonzo, they excel at those gritty dark tales excel yeah right the batman trilogy was good but it doesnt count now marvel has deadpools first half and logan and those were real good dark action movies ,10,movies
thekonzo, you can choose to do a multitude of things but that doesnt mean free will the choice i make is still based on logic and who i am as a person and human intelligence works choice itself isnt free its a task of finding the best or most enjoyable outcome its not a magical ghost doing whatever because whatever the freedom to do anything is just about rejecting authority as an influence on you i think its popular because its true and helps with people becoming more rational and empathic once they accept social determinism its similar to atheism because its about accepting us how we are and questioning things that dont make sense or that we dont depend on not because they support each other but because they are both results of enlightenment ,2,technology
thekonzo,that extra click and hidden information is a big deal its not like r overwatch and r competitiveoverwatch play a zero sum game i constantly check both subreddits and one is better at one thing while the other is better at another thing just think of whats best for the users the new players that come here i promise this sub wont collapse if you add those few resourceful related subreddits to the sidebar ,13,Overwatch
thekonzo,i mean that one seemed fine to me its not like we have had posts like that too often before and it seemed genuine and fun i just skimmed the text and the top comment and moved on to the other stuff on reddit its just a single authentic post not spam like the bad portion of potg and gifs ,22,Overwatch
thekonzo,i really like the top potg and gifs this game allows for really great short gameplayvideos like that but i really dislike most that hover around 1000 upvotes and make up the second half of the frontpage and for the entire second page i also want some more discussion ,16,Overwatch
thekonzo,your username keeps making me want to rewatch full metal alchemist brotherhood dude i have only so much time ,3,Overwatch
thekonzo,damn i forgot about the r competitiveoverwatch in the sidebar thing in my survey answers add 1 to the list ,33,Overwatch
thekonzo,because directly calling someone an idiot who is asking for feedback and seems willing to change in that moment that doesnt really allign with social norms overwatch mods present themselves in a very calm way and rather only comment where its required its like modern pr with big companies when they rarely engage in dialogue they appear very calm and willing to listen it really makes it hard then still be harsh and blunt with the feedback because benefit of the doubt and stuff ,12,Overwatch
thekonzo,lets hope you are right,1,Competitiveoverwatch
thekonzo,the questions became boring and samey very quickly could have included more things about the meta and balance and what kind of heroes they would like to see released or more personal questions like what they do for hobbies what other games they play i mean sure the video format is called would you rather but you can still call the video meet the clg players would you rather permaban lucio or reinhardt also its a bit weird to have them all sit together in a big group like that they are all hiding behind one another its a pretty bad format for getting to know the players 2 players interviewed at once time would probably be the best dynamic for starters its a bit annoying that there arent really any tourneys right now and overwatch in general is still in a big development phase this video was a little too fluff considering we dont have much gameplay to go hand and hand with it i would have prefered something fun but with more meat like the clg team testing out fun modes on the server browser or doing shit like hanzo vs widowmaker like they said in the video that would probably do well on the r overwatch subreddit but probably wouldnt be allowed here ,0,Competitiveoverwatch

thekonzo,thats a pretty bad comparison lamborghini isnt trying to sell to kids with bad spending habits ,10,hearthstone
thekonzo,sounds like the copyright claims are quite profitable for maker studio thinking ,5,videos
thekonzo,many f2p business models are inherently immoral because they know they are financing themselves through a handful of people who have bad spending habits meanwhile they make for an annoying experience for everyone else worst of all in cases like hearthstone where the game is could be actually good or when competition just isnt there to the same degree this has been changing over the last year my point is that its not all that useful for blaming to playerbase to fund a game like that in some cases but its very useful to be critical towards the developer for creating a somewhat drug like game that is happy to take hundreds and hundreds of a players money while still not offering a complete experience in general f2p should always have a bundle for around 80 dollars that gives access to full gameplay either that or cosmetic purchases only or really fair progression everything else is cancer and should be viewed critically ,1,hearthstone
thekonzo,thats kinda unfair the criticism is fair development has always had problems the game progression has always been harsh and prices quite high if we are talking about hearthstone arena then yes the game aint that bad at all although warlock last season was once again too absurd just because problems dont affect you because you have endless time money doesnt mean the problems dont exists this place is for discussion and as far as i can tell the frequency of whining has only really become like this over the last year or so before that i got constantly downvoted by blizzzard fanboys whenever i tried to make a feedback thread or get a discussion going about improving parts of the game in some way ,9,hearthstone
thekonzo,the game is designed for casual chinese mobile players they dont want to alienate them from the game if there are a few too many changes then some people go ugh this is getting too complicated i guess i wont spend 400 dollars now ,2,hearthstone
thekonzo,thats the correct answer but of course there could be a low space version of hearthstone that disables cosmetics and anyways they already have alot of cosmetics in the game but hand them out in a very weird way ,3,hearthstone
thekonzo,i am saying there is a difference between making a good game and an unfair greeding f2p cancer ,1,hearthstone
thekonzo,well yeah cosmetics should be a huge part of any f2p but i think a game like hearthstone can have card aquisition and have it be a really fun experience if the pacing is fair and fun ,1,hearthstone
thekonzo,hearthstone is designed to be fun and addictive you are being overly dismissive ,0,hearthstone
thekonzo,overwatch is basically perfect though i cant stop shilling for that game i am so thankful for them not fucking it up ,1,hearthstone
thekonzo,soooo pay to win aka not free to play ,5,hearthstone
thekonzo,whales spend close to a thousand in hearthstone and this game is very good at turning people into whales but yes i agree any f2p should have a full price version a problem however is that the card collection is a big part of the game itself ,3,hearthstone
thekonzo,you can also ask for better development and more fair progression thats how it sometimes works with other huge games league for example has adjusted the xp and currency requirement a number of times and are now about to revamp the rune system entirely they also have that whole get free skins just by playing hextech thing the problem is that parts of hearthstone are very enjoyable and that the game has the potential to be great its designed to be fun an addictive people are designed to fall victim to that ,1,hearthstone
thekonzo,i dont understand how people like you cant understand that a game like this is about getting a decent collection and playing around with cards seriously your comment makes my blood boil just pure apathy ,20,hearthstone
thekonzo,either the drug is great and enjoyable and you take it or people dont take the drug because its unhealthy there is no middleground and immorality doesnt exist ,1,hearthstone
thekonzo,if drugs were actually bad for you then you wouldnt take them right f2p is designed to be cancer hearthstone is not meant to be a good and fair game unlike overwatch for example no win win ,0,hearthstone
thekonzo,i am worried about the growing trend in recent months many people including youtube personalities have been advocating and recommending onetricking i just think it brings some unhealthiness with it and is against the idea of overwatch a game that allows for hero swapping and countering and lots of strategy again i am not looking to make anything illegal i just want to keep this in check so that not every game becomes about everyone write what your main is lets hope we end up with an okay comp you widow can you maybe play a tank we already have alot of dps what you havent played one in months well thats fine afterall we dont need healthy heropools in overwatch thats not what this game was about right ,1,Competitiveoverwatch
thekonzo,but we have no reason to believe that free will exists what would that even mean why cant we just be deterministic logical intelligence that perfectly describes how my mind works and how anyone that i have ever interacted with works i have no reason to believe that any magic or randomness is at work i know that i have a consciousness but its pretty simple and predictable and thats fine anything else would be scary ,1,technology
thekonzo,this guy has given more insight than brode has given in 10 times the videos and screentime i used to shit on league development and i like brode as a person but riot is doing so so so much better than the hearthstone team ,1,leagueoflegends

thekonzo,we cant share too many details yet but one of our projects is a chess shooter hybrid of course we had plans for a dnd sandbox vr mmo with 400 man servers with a reset and a new plot created by gamemasters every 3 months but at the secret game design conference last year all company heads agreed to withold it from society for another decade at least expect tons of awesome f2p mobile games including riot employee simulator and revenge of the tribunal if you think we have league lore related character rpgs in the works like an echo dishonered type game then you are mistaken once again tbh we are just making so much money on league we really dont even know what to do with all the cash making more games is like whatever anyways you know ,8,leagueoflegends
thekonzo,passive after healing boosting a target for 4 seconds your beam locks on and remains on target for 2 seconds when swapping to your pistol those shots are enhanced e small aoe slow at a targeted location after short delay might even prevent movement ability might even be targetable with guardian angel visually its represented by a tazer defibrillator function in the pistol ,1,Competitiveoverwatch

thekonzo,the three times i picked it up the gold prices and slow gold gain were just really unattractive it felt worse than league and it had to compete with dota and league as a casual version ,1,hearthstone

thekonzo,after many months i am still so so in love with overwatch i was so worried about it before it launched because of how awful hearthstone and hots turned out to be in my opinion ,1,hearthstone
thekonzo,ehh i dont see why we cant look at elons other actions right now instead of later when he has revealed his evil plan or his puppy killing spree it certainly is possible to tell the difference and i am not sure why you insist that we can only use this one example for our judgement and wether you want to ignore the possibility or not just depends on how desperate you are about that agenda i mean you can call that picky or overly cautious but i am just not a fan of blindly following sociopaths if conditions change then things can get fucked anyways i really just wanted to defend altruism and empathy a little bit i promised myself to stand up to cynicism more often on reddit but maybe your comment wasnt the best target ,2,technology
thekonzo,influence social media and create chaos everywhere,1,europe
thekonzo,people just dont tryhard that much in league anymore many hardcore players moved on doesnt mean that its not important anymore that champions like ryze exist and anyways riot has still not gotten the champion class design under real control they need to fix tanks and carries and probably redo mages and assassins before you can make actual true statements about how healthy a champion like ryze can be i personally think his current iteration is good enough ,0,leagueoflegends
thekonzo,gp is slightly underpowered because his easy easy and universally good ultimate is too often too unhealthy for the game ryze is in a better state than him tbh ,0,leagueoflegends
thekonzo,i disagree you can look at other instances of that persons behaviour and judge from that and that has implications on the persons stability in extreme situations not sure why you want to ignore all that so badly and turn this into only actions count get to work in the modern time you most certainly want leaders with high empathy skills and without identity problems we dont want to rely too much on potentially crazy people its risky ,2,technology
thekonzo,i think i summarized it quite well in my comment everything is selfish we cant function without being selfish the problem is using the word selfish with a negative connotation the author just wants to sell his book what we idealize in society is at the core empathy and empathy is very real even if its a positive feeling that feels good and leads to benifitial results for the most part i donate money because i empathize with other peoples problems and i want to help them its not all about feeling good about myself or some societal expectation to donate a bit at least sure you also have sociopaths and quite a few of them are compatible with society and can be altruist in the sense that they profit from those relationships or enjoy certain things or it just logically makes sense to them but for them its not about empathy and its just not quite the same thing this is more in line with what you were describing or what the book probably is about ,1,technology
thekonzo,i was just trying to correct the logic and make clear that the underlaying mechanisms are fine and can matter its still useful to differentiate between altruists who are just good guys and crazy people ,1,technology
thekonzo,thats still quite pessimistic phrasing if you only go one level deeper then everything the human mind ever does is about positive experience everything we do is to satisfy a drive and feel good we are incapable of working in any other way because thats what makes up our psyche we dont act random that doesnt mean that empathy doesnt exist just because we enjoy being empathic doesnt mean its somehow a bad thing and dont mistake that with the want for prestige or deriving identity from being an altruist you can be an altruist without depending on it there is an identity seeking perversion of anything see what we call sjws ,-5,technology

thekonzo,havent heard of that one i really wish i had some good objective critic that would compare all those games and not be that blind to the monetary side and its future most are so fucking bad at judging progression and aquisition systems and by the time you have a full understanding of one of those games then a patch can already screw up the whole game actual first world problems ,1,hearthstone
thekonzo,when you focus on prohibitions you are just in an egocentric mindset and ignore the motivation behind the law you dont view the entire system its better to start at the beginning point which is the protection part so that mindset and view is superior in general discussion ,2,explainlikeimfive
thekonzo,well yes we have capitalism but slowly adopt social systems to make it less inhumane and unfair we will have more or less full blown socialism when robots create a really cheap and really high standard of living ,1,explainlikeimfive
thekonzo,i think you should do some empathy social determinism practise you could very well be on drugs if you had different life circumstances and its not really about being an idiot so so many people play f2p mobile games they are fun and slightly fulfilling activity while on the bus or break or something but the whole industry adopted these psychology abusing systems to try to get people to pay which is quite rewarding at first learning not to trust those games doesnt make you smart but cynical it fucks societies relationship with games and fun activities its not useful enough to just make fun of whales for funding the f2p genre its worth shitting on the devs and supporting better alternatives that or more sustainable win win for everyone involved ,9,hearthstone
thekonzo,im just saying its not worth that much to blame the general average playerbase people behave the way they behave because thats how it is if a game manages to make many players spend way too much money on really worthless shit then you can say its their own fault they shouldnt use money like that but you also have a bad opinion of the game designers that choose to develop a shitty money printing machine instead of an actual good fair sustainable game unfair f2ps are somewhat similar to drugs ,9,hearthstone
thekonzo,because games like that are designed to make you want access to certain fun things ,15,hearthstone
thekonzo,thats what i expected reading the headline i dont really play this game anymore because the grinding greedy prices are just too punishing its borderline impossible to have a full collection for theorycrafting and messing around and the shitty metas and ladders systems lack of tourney mode overall disappointing development make it not worth it anyways reading this i though well thats kinda late probably the price drop wont be all that big or meaningful they probably wont get me back to playing and paying for the game again ooohh well that makes sense price increase nice incentive for the expansion bundle greedy fucktards ,464,hearthstone
thekonzo,overwatch is great has incredible development and has a great great monetization model p2p with a very fair price and the chest loot rates are reaaaally fair and fun only the blizzard f2p models are completely fucktarded i also cant get over the idiocity of hots gold prices they intended to compete with dota and league by releasing a casual version with even harsher grinding and shitty price value ratios ,3,hearthstone

thekonzo,assassins creed is a premise there are no real characters or story in the games at least not comparable to good books films and shows the questions is how to turn that premise into something interesting and thats only really possible if you make it about a huge mystery and a huge threat to the world similar to game 3 but people did not like that game very much i could see it working if it was similar to the last of us with an apocalypse already underway and the main character needing to find clues in the past while being dragged between his love in the real world and the safety in the past something like that but its just not worth the huge investment all the settings and characters and apocalypse shit should would require walking dead is a cakewalk compared to this project and they fail miserably practically constantly ,1,television

thekonzo,na i think threw narrative by the wayside describes it quite well characters and plot went from good to garbage all coupled with fancy pretentious visuals and dialogue that had zero meaning and werent derserved in the slightest from season 1 where i thought my god this is going to be amazing a psycho consultant with the fbi on cases with hannibal also involved everything is fitting the cators the narrative everything holy smokes to the later seasons where i thought this is the laziest cringiest bullshit ever they just could not come up with good plotlines and confrontations for hannibal and now try to cheat their way out of the responsibility by turning everything into an lsd trip not even temporarily represent the main characters struggles and character development but just in general because they writers are talentless hacks like that i know thats unfair and harsh since quite a few people did enjoy it and they clearly still put effort into the show but thats just how i felt ,1,television
thekonzo,yup but them being at that rank with a hero pool of 1 leads to an amount of shitty games for the teammates because the onetrick is unable and unwilling to switch if there are too many onetricks then that causes a big divide of onetricks and flexers and games are much more decided by matchmaking depending on what teammates you got because you cant alter strategy on the fly really essentially onetricks currently end up at a rank where they cant be the teammates they are expected to be ,1,Competitiveoverwatch

thekonzo,i feel the same way and i think the damage nerf on her rifle could be brought back to 70 her nade damage could be brought down by 10 damage maybe but destroying her self heal and burst heal entirely or nerfing her damage heavily on all fronts that would suck probably it will be hard to determine when ana is too weak itd rather they bring her down slowly afterall she rivals with 3 healers that have pretty insane abilities too i rather not have ana be a pick where the viability depends on the ulted target getting a bunch of kills ,2,Overwatch
thekonzo,her weaknesses she has zero mobility she has no speedboost she has no rezz she has way less damage than zenyatta and no invul for the team her abilities do have a cooldown and are multipurpose she requires skill and aiming and her abilities have counterplay i only read the first few lines of your text because your whining really does not interest me and you probably dont mention anything that is new ,2,Overwatch

thekonzo, nano sleep i was talking about what makes playing ana feel like playing ana and boosting and sleepdarting are not as much core to that as the grenade and the rifle you boost the guy and thats it you sleepdart the winston or pharah and either hit or you dont against many flankers you probably dont hit it her mobility does not matter because she shits on every other healer and is able to deal with flankers on her own blablabla i want to ignore her lack of mobility because i want to circlejerk highest dmg or now the 2nd highest dmg as a healer she was designed to be a sniper healer hybrid she deals less damage than zenyatta who heals while shooting and discords technically ana nade can be seen as a 3000 damage anti heal ability but thats not very genuine she does way too many things too good she is overtuned yes but that doesnt make her jesus she will get adjusted and she wont need to have two abilities removed from her kit she was the best to deal with pharah right behind a good mccree or widow oh no hitscan good against pharah more news about this later this night would love to hear all of her downsides from ana mains she is fucking immobile she either heals or she deals damage she is hard to play and her abilities are hard to hit for the most part and have counterplay she doesnt have speedboost she doesnt have a revive she doesnt have discord or quite as insane damage as zenyatta dude calm the fuck down you forgot to mention that her nade pretty much shits on hogs whole concept of being a selfsustaining off tank bullshit hog is supposed to heal behind cover where he is not easy to hit with a nade for ana in most cases he is supposed to be a tanky dps duellist flanker punisher he is not the tank that reinhard or orisa are and ana doesnt shit on him nade against his selfheal isnt even that crazy good its more that he is left defenseless without any healing especially from his teams healers because he has no shield or mobility again she 100 deserves nerfs and i hope they implement something like the healing over time suggestion on her nade but she is still a great hero and she is supposed to be a great hero overwatch design is all about clear and impactful abilities ,2,Overwatch
thekonzo,well but valve is privately owned if gabe says make comics and a movie then they do it if kaplan says make comics and a movie then he gets a fuck you aint nobody got time for that possibly i mean overwatch does seem to have alot of freedom its special that they were even allowed to make it p2p after the success of league and hearthstone but that said yeah there should be more i will pay 30 dollars for an overwatch movie ticket if its good well better than warcraft ,1,Overwatch
thekonzo,so you are saying i should cancel my order of the back to the future clothing line ,1,Overwatch
thekonzo,aaaaaaaaaah nsfl chalkboard screeching,1,Overwatch
thekonzo,i agree with the heal over time thing i wrote in my post that ana is overtuned i also support damage nerfs either on the weapon or the nade all that other crying is white noise to my ears at this point this is not a moba heroes are supposed to have clear strengths and abilities not bonus damage against jungle monsters ,5,Overwatch
thekonzo,thats obviously a decoy cardboard torbj rn you all fell for his bamboozle and now you diiee ,17,Overwatch
thekonzo,roti pz,16,Overwatch
thekonzo,might be a reaction to something on the overwatch forums i dont know maybe but i wont go and check that place is horrible ,2,Overwatch
thekonzo,overwatch design is supposed to be more elegant than that no 4 passives with 4 lines explanation each its fine that ana has extra health but its shouldnt be a 100 probably ,1,Competitiveoverwatch
thekonzo,then ana cant heal herself and it feel bad to use the ability which has like different 4 purposes with a single cooldown eg selfheal when getting attack by tracer wont really do anything might as well keep the ability and hope that you can throw it into a zenyatta ult or something ,-3,Competitiveoverwatch
thekonzo,it is 100 defensible stop being dramaqueens it is an ability with a single cooldown and three purposes its used offensively to counter zenyatta ult for example or its used to burst heal your team in a clutch or its used to selfheal and give tools against flankers hardly every do all those purposes come into play at the same moment with a single usage its weaker than her having the ability split into three abilities and three cooldowns its her core ability the sleep dart is much more situational and hard to utilize nano boost requires strategy and teamplay the nade and the gun are what makes for the feel of playing ana ana has no mobility none at all she is the same boat as zen and symmetra and needs strong utility to be worth the risk that doesnt mean that ana isnt overtuned she can get nerfed and will be a great character still but these rage y whine y drama y attacks on the balance team are beyond stupid ,62,Overwatch
thekonzo,words have definitions so yes sometimes someone is a scotsman and sometimes someone isnt i think you should refrain from diagnosing fallacies until you really understand them ,16,books
thekonzo,that actually sounds kinda good its gonna be hard to get ana versus flanker to an ideal spot and your suggestion could be part of the balance toolkit if its required ,15,Competitiveoverwatch
thekonzo,good thing you did not finish it because the finale was the worst part ,1,television
thekonzo,made a big reply to another comment of yours i am forcing my ideology on others because i worry about negative consequences for the ranked playersbase and the ideology is really just expecting a teammate to be able to switch to a different hero role if things are not working out its not that evil or big a requirement its not a strength to me but a requirement for an enjoyable overwatch ranked experience when the widowmaker is not working out at all then i expect him to be able to switch to an alternative hero thats just it any of the 23 i dont care anything some people say well if its not working in that single game then its bad luck who are you to tell him what to play and others like me say this is a ranked game its a team game its expected the the guy gives a shit and if widowmaker is useless on that map against that teamcomp with that teamcomp then its expected that he has a backup hero so the team can try a different strategy can you see how the latter case comes close to an accusations of griefing or refusing to communicate can you see how your ideology argument might not be all that accurate its a discussion about what rank represents and what the requirements for having a certain rank should be what being a healthy teammate in overwatch means i am talking about onetricks on average not the top players who have no flexer competition for the most part ,1,Overwatch
thekonzo,look at it like this for the majority of players i would prefer if they ended up at a rank where they can still realistically play at least three different heroes depending on the game and the team he is with the alternative is that many players are onetricks and are at a rank where they put themselves into a corner and can only play tracer else they will basically insta lose and by that they put their team in a corner in those games on average they climb but there are those games where they are an absolute dread to play with for the other team for the flexers or the other onetricks you end up at a rank because 1 wins are measured and to a small degree 2 performance ingame is measured i would argue that having a hero pool of at least two or three heroes should be a measured skill so that the ranked ladder will long term have a healthy form and not be filled with inflexible anti teamplay players now you can argue if this is ever going to work or if onetricking at the highest level is not the highest level of skill possible or if this would feel bad for many players who try to improve on a single versatile hero or if onetrick flexers is already a healthy enough strategy and setup for ranked long term but i dont accept your arguments its about changing the meaning behind rank the factors that influence rank the requirements and just to a small degree just to prevent extreme cases like people who play widow every game or mercy every game and who are not willing or able to switch i think those should potentially land at a slightly lower rank than currently so their team gets fucked a little less if the conditions for the onetricks success arent 100 met i am talking about a small penalty on rank gain if you play a single hero for more than 75 of your games that should not affect the absolute majority of players for the hardcore onetricks that still will play the same hero 100 it will mean that they gain rank slightly slower its not even comparable to the op situation of practically getting banned from reports for playing symmetra only i think its fair to expect that a skilled overwatch player should be able to play one of the healers or tanks once in a while instead of their dps or flanker without causing an instaloss for the team that really not that nazi a thing to say is it i am talking not only about a very soft requirement but also about a very soft penalty wether that even makes sense or not is worth looking into but i just want there to be something in place that reminds players to not play a single hero only its a 6 person teamgame about somewhat flexible strategies having an unflexible onetrick on your team can be an awful things even if on average his winrate is good or if in theory the other 5 teammates should have just played around the onetrick ,1,Overwatch
thekonzo,you get 5 new teammates every game and changing conditions there should be a number that takes all that into account well enough ,1,Overwatch
thekonzo,why the two extremes why not the compromise ,1,Overwatch
thekonzo,in the first season twd was a good show ,15,television
thekonzo,i often try to get myself to stop watching the show and just be happy with reading the comic only sometimes i just cant resists and binge and catch back up i was applauding the second half of last season it was suddenly very good and i told many people about it because i previously shat on the show constantly then the infamous finale cliffhanger that represents alot of things that are wrong with the show direction then the next season with a quite lame and non psychopath negan a quite unconvincing character development for slave rick and his squad a really cringy instead of badass carl once again back to generally awful awful meaningless shitty dialogue ala everything is the way it is remember how it was back when you think it will ever be like that again this is how things are it just is you know you do we are what we are things are not how they were supported by shitty bass and guitar ambient sounds it makes me want to kick the characters in the face the writing and dialogue are soooo fucking baaaaad fuck thiiiiisssss showwwww last episode had good ideas making the relationship between rick and michonne feel a little more authentic some more exploration the struggle to find resources characters that have a different opinion and motivation from the group leader and band together other survivor groups and our protagonists interacting with them but its unbearable for me the dialogue is so fucking bad the characters are ruined at this point all the major plot writing feels so contrived nothing feels meaningful like it usually does in good stories nothing has gravity the zombies right now are practically falling apart when you touch them its hard to express just how big of a wasted opportunity the walking dead is we have quality of somewhere between mexican sitcom and arrow when it should be easily around game of thrones the writers have zero understanding of how to make characters interesting or authentic an embarrassment of modern television and i cant stand how smug the creative people come across every time i see them ,5,television
thekonzo,or mei wall or iceblock or lucio speedboost ,3,Overwatch
thekonzo,and mei didnt use one of her two abilities lucio speedboost and he was on the top platform in the beginning and still died somehow mercy dashed into the ulting mech reinhard did not put up his shield this is horrible to look at and it tilts me because whenever i use d va ult the enemies are hide and seek grandmasters ,12,Overwatch
thekonzo,that was the most extreme example a different one owuld be playing torbj rn while only letting your turret attack or reinhard without using the shield certain things are expected of you in ranked its a compromise if you dont play your part in a sport then you get kicked of the team or people on the basketball court will not want to play with you anymore ,1,Competitiveoverwatch
thekonzo,yes onetricks contribute to winning on average but there are enough games where they cause problems for the team by not being flexible but basically bullying others into playing roles and heroes they are not comfortable with they cause a divide in the playerbase of onetricks and fillers when the optimal playstyle should lie in the middle if onetricks got a slight penalty then things would balance themselves out more and the playerbase would stay healthy ,1,Competitiveoverwatch
thekonzo,i really dont understand how you can equate onetricking to players that just misplay independent of the hero again misplays already lead to a lower chance of winning on average onetricking does not lead to a lower chance of winning of average thats why people grind as onetricks in the first place and disregard the individual game but it does cause problems with the individual match and the playerbase ,1,Competitiveoverwatch
thekonzo,because onetricking is effective while its also hurting the feel of competitive which is why the playerbase is changing thats why i suggested a small shift and making play not just one hero a skill factor that affects rank trickle overult do not strafe well contest poorly are universal skills that already affect the outcome of the match granted onetricking sometimes also but not on average when it comes to grinding and onetricking its all about the average and thats the problem it should be about the individual match and the teamplay not about the winrate on average ,1,Competitiveoverwatch
thekonzo,eh its hard to constantly communicate to your team where you hack healthpacks its good that the game now automates this afterall its supposed to be part of the heroes design and that comps advantages id put that closer to qol rather than buff because it just helps out with accessing a strength that already exists in that exact form but was hard and impractical to use for the player and the team imagine every teammate would have to jump at the same time before genji could use his ultimate it wouldnt really change the powerlevel of the ability itself except for a short delay but just ass a communication barrier would you see it more as a nerf or as a bullshit cockblock ,3,Overwatch
thekonzo,and you are turning everything into extremese come on if someone is encouraged to not play 1 out of 24 characters every game but sometimes take a different one when the team needs something else then thats really not a fascist dystopian system yet cranky people playing heroes they do not want to play and are not good at the cranky part is weird the other part is exactly the point if you are at a rank where you can play only that onetrick hero then you are causing problems for your team in a number of games you should be more flexible than that and some of the time play something else a different role or a more fitting hero of the same role at least some of the time you can still play your main most of the time and you can still play your main all the time but you would gain slightly less ranked points that way the ranked ladder wouldnt be filled with unflexible anti teamplay mercy only widowmaker only players that dont give a rats ass about teamplay having something akin to a hero pool should be a skill requirement factor in competitive overwatch i think the encouragement punishment semantics are quite important afterall the op post was about a guy practically getting banned over playing symmetra which i am most certainly not advocating for i was talking about a slight rank point penalty one that onetricks can live with but that would encourage them to swap to zenyatta or roadhog or something once every full moon ,1,Overwatch
thekonzo,haha thanks thats refreshing to hear i personally think its only an okay idea because it would of course feel awkward now and then to have those things popup and tell you to play a different hero even if you are doing well on your main its not optimal but the opposite isnt that great either i wonder if blizzard is going to do something about this or if i am misreading the situation and things are fine the way they are ,1,Overwatch
thekonzo,i agree 100 i am thinking more along the lines of a slight penalty in rank gain if you play more than 80 on the same single hero which means you can still keep onetricking but its encouraged to swap to a different hero and role once in a while that way less onetricks will the ranks that realistically cant switch without instalosing because they just suck too much with any other hero and are unflexible for the team the waiting times for op are of course horrible i should be more clear and professional about this topic people react really emotionally to this i made a thread on competitiveoverwatch and got bombarded with downvotes and insults and dismissive attitudes ,2,Overwatch
thekonzo,its allowed but its slightly discouraged with a slight rank penalty if you approach 80 on the same hero and role because it leads to many players being at ranks where they realistically cant switch and adapt so if the conditions are bad for your onetrick hero then your team might get fucked because you are an unflexible guy that doesnt care about teamplay you dont have to play all heroes just at least one hero of a different role some of the times thats really not that much to ask for and it really help with keeping the playerbase in check and discouraging grindy anti teamplay sentiments a little bit ,1,Competitiveoverwatch
thekonzo,1 you already have two heroes at least so thats fine 2 you hero pool is ass d at least learn pharah or a healer or zarya or something zarya rightclick is basically junkrat right p 3 i was suggesting a small rank gain penalty for those that play more than 80 on the same hero and role so players are reminded to be flexible and teamplay oriented teammates at least to a small degree so that the ladder is not filled with players who realistically cant swap to any other hero role without instalosing the game 4 even though your situation comes somewhat close just because of the extreme hero choices of yours but the system i have in mind wouldnt affect you it would affect the guy that plays mercy every single game the guy that plays widowmaker every single game those that dont give a shit about teamplay those that dont even try ,1,Overwatch
thekonzo,i have a problem with onetricking when you play 80 100 the same hero and role every time and dont give a shit about being a flexible teammate you would end up at a rank where you cant swap when the conditions for your main are bad without instalosing and that sucks for the match and for the team there should be a slight discouragement along the lines of a slight rank gain penalty if you dont play an other hero and role once in a while you still have you main and play him most of time i just dont want the playerbase to become more and more about grinding and ranks being filled with unflexible anti teamplay onetricks goes against the spirit of the game ,1,Overwatch
thekonzo, now obviously playing one character and only one character leaves you with some pretty big weaknesses mainly the fact that if you run into more of the same sort of people on the same team you are at a severe disadvantage that was exactly my point i want to see exactly that slightly discouraged by giving a rank gain penalty when you approach 80 on the same hero and role you should be at a rank where you can still be a little bit flexible and strategic for your team i have a problem with the playerbase becoming more and more grindy and onetricky i think it will become a problem ,1,Overwatch
thekonzo,thanks i wouldnt go so far and call it a shadow pool of other garbage players i really just want it to be clear that 80 of the same hero and roll should not fly in overwatch the game and teamplay and strategy expect different behaviour and skill than that and again just a small rank gain penalty not nazi gas chambers ,2,Competitiveoverwatch
thekonzo,i was arguing that not everything is playstyle and that certain things are expected in a competitive teamgame being somewhat flexible should be expected in overwatch i dont think the game is healthy when on average the ranks are filled with onetricks that cant swap heroes without instalosing it will suck to play those games sure since onetricking on average leads to a good winrate for the guy it would be weird to call it trolling but there are many games where you are causing problems for your teammates at least when you play the single hero role more than 70 or 80 of the time ,1,Competitiveoverwatch
thekonzo,exactly that reason the current system and playerbase that supports heavy onetricking that leads to onetricks being at ranks where they can only realistically play a single hero and would otherwise instalose the game that situation sucks for the team because when that onetrick hero is not great or the teamcomp is not working out then the onetrick is an unflexible teammate that the others suffer from i am not talking about the top players where this is a different situation i am talking about onetricking on average and its effects on the placebase and the matches this is not a personal vendetta i play way too much pharah myself right now this is about a this growing notion in the playerbase that i think is damaging the feel of the game ,1,Competitiveoverwatch
thekonzo,i was talking about a small rank gain penalty not about actual punishment if you want to play competitive overwatch you shouldnt play a single hero role more than 70 or 80 of the time because you are supposed to be a more flexible teamplayer than that and that should be a measured skill more along the levels of encouragment and discouragement not punishment ,1,Overwatch
thekonzo,thanks for those insult ,2,Competitiveoverwatch
thekonzo,70 is alot and yes in a team of six and in a game of changing conditions i would expect players to not play a single hero role more than 70 of the time at that point it becomes unflexible onetrick grinding that imo should be discouraged for the playerbase on average ,1,Overwatch
thekonzo,as long as you dont 90 onetrick thats fine everyone has heroes they dont like or cant perform on ,1,Overwatch
thekonzo,nice apology edgelord ,1,Competitiveoverwatch
thekonzo,well thats dismissive ive had comment sections with the complete opposite consensus just depends on the context and phrasing on since this is the competitive subreddit of course people are in the hamsterwheel mindset and dont want changes to their rythm whatever you are not worth tlaking to because you quickly dismiss people as not worth talking to and that whole insulting thing that you have going on not very pleasant ignored,1,Competitiveoverwatch
thekonzo,i dont want to see it as punishment i want to see it as encouraging to play other heroes and roles once in a while and shifting the skill requirement from just pure performance with a single hero a little bit towards performance with at least a small number of heroes thats it i dont want the whole playerbase like its currently heading towards to be all about focussing on a single main hero and just grinding every single game without much strategy talk sure you can say just find a 6 man team but i just really disagree overwatch competitive shouldnt be a ladder grind only it should be about individual high quality games with people really caring about the match and their teammates doesnt mean you cant play your main it just means that you shouldnt play it when something else would be a much better choice or when your teammates already want to play that role and again i would like people who are at a certain rank to not be stuck with a single hero with no choice really without the realistic ability to switch because they went full onetrick you think too much in terms of top notch players not in terms of average players ,1,Competitiveoverwatch
thekonzo,ugh well let me rephrase i mean that with a changed system the winrate reflects different skills its about looking at what winrate represents and what it should represent i personally think that when the playerbase becomes too much about focusing on a single hero and just grinding then thats against the spirit of the game ,3,Overwatch
thekonzo,the cook example wasnt retarded you are just unwilling to think yourself into the system i suggested the customer ranked system currently wants the best tomato soup it could however favor the cooks that that also cook a few other dishes well if the situation requires it ,1,Competitiveoverwatch
thekonzo, your strategy sounds amazing but if im solo queued i have no obligation to fulfill your ideal if playing multiple heroes was already enforced and getting high ranks required performing well not just on a onetrick then i could dismiss your post the exact same way you are dismissing mine ,1,Overwatch
thekonzo,you are focussing too hard on the handful of top players i am talking about onetricks on average and how these sentiments transform the playerbase and the game experience on average onetricks are not that great to deal with in ranked they end up in a ranked where they put themselves into a corner where they can only play that one hero even when its a bad choice and the team suffers from it in those games cant you understand my argument ,2,Competitiveoverwatch
thekonzo,doesnt work that way if you are a onetrick and instalock genji then you are already ignoring teamplay and stand in conflict with and so can his teammates,3,Overwatch
thekonzo,wtf i never spoke of banning i spoke of relatively minor rank gain penalties ,1,Overwatch
thekonzo, you are trying to force your own perception of a good overwatch player on other people so if things were the other way around i could say the same thing about you if you think someone who flexes in plat is better than a one trick hanzo in gm thats an extreme example i want to hire a cook that can prepare all the dishes and doesnt only make the best tomato soup in the country sure for the magazine best soups ever youd really only care about the soup guy hanzo main but for the restaurant you might not care that much it depends on wether the customers come for the soup alone or for the other dishes too ,1,Competitiveoverwatch
thekonzo,so afk in spawn should not be forbidden in competitive what if thats the preferred playstyle for 1 of players ,0,Competitiveoverwatch
thekonzo,ignoring what internet strangers aka teammates tell you isnt everything either,6,Overwatch
thekonzo,no well it depends its super hard to enforce and draw clear lines if you are that attack torbj rn guy and reach grandmasters well good for your ego but you cause problems in the process its supposed to be a strategic teamgame and you ignored the strategy part and the team part longterm blizzard will punish such a player afaik in competitive i dont have a clearcut stance on this it differs from game to game too leagueoflegends has this exact debate at the moment ,0,Overwatch
thekonzo,i didnt downvote you actually http imgur com a dobiy,1,Competitiveoverwatch
thekonzo,i suggested changing the meaning of high ranks favoring onetricks less and promoting more diverse play and universal skill you see no reason why they should be punished discouraged i do because it puts grinding above teamplay and strategy it causes onetricks to strongarm their teammates it makes the game less about the individual game and its circumstances ,0,Competitiveoverwatch
thekonzo,thats exactly my point though i dislike how the playerbase gives grinding the priority and not strategy ,3,Overwatch
thekonzo,you are not supposed to play the same role or hero every game there are 5 other players in your team ,-4,Overwatch
thekonzo,and since being a flexible teammate is part of what makes a good overwatch player then the onetrick rank isnt as meaningful as the non onetrick rank i am not denying his skill on that hero i just think that doesnt give him the right to strongarm his teammates ,1,Competitiveoverwatch
