canadianbacon22,i think maybe you should re consider the current situation you are in before you take a shot at the oscp i am not saying this because i do not think you wo not be able to do but if you do you might have a hard time given your current situation for one without any work experience you are going to find yourself learning many more things than just the course material in the oscp there a saying that what makes you good at security is everything you know besides security and there are a couple of stories around here of even some experienced guys took a shot at the oscp and been bogged down because of everything else they have to learn about linux and what not second if you are already working at a degree maybe coupled with a part time job you might have trouble finding time for the oscp it a job in itself like u 5150 5150 said you will need a lot of free time you could try it however i think maybe you should wait until you are in a better situation to devote more effort towards it continue doing ctfs and maybe even read a few books or find some resources for pen testing but i think you should wait until you have more time on your hands ,1,AskNetsec

canadianbacon22,well seeing as so many people are commenting here i hope this gets noticed i was bullied pretty badly during my elementary school years until grade 6 names called getting beat up getting stuff stolen etc almost committed suicide i genuinely do not understand how people see me as an appealing or attractive person a lot of my friends tell me that i am a bit of a comedian that i can put a spin on anything that i think outside the box and sometimes work faster than raymond from rain man but i do not always see those qualities in me so how others see me is a higher priority for me than how i see myself on the topic of friends i never really felt i trusted all my friends i was never really a priority i was never the person to be texted first i am always second guessing what i should say or how i should act this fear was greatly amplified when i got into an argument with my friend but it was more how she acted about than what i actually said so yeah i have trust issues with people high school was a fresh start for me so when i started making friends again and met i girl that i really liked when she rejected me i felt like i was back at step one fuck i am 18 and i still think i am not over her despite fucking up with her so many times and falling in love again ,1,AskReddit
canadianbacon22,right sorry this is not short for an eli5 but it still simple the dark web refers more to the malicious use of the tor project the onion router and other similar services it works the same way as the regular internet works your information bounces from point to point different machines and reaches it destination except the the tor network is all volunteer machines and along with some encryption protocols the goal to make it so that you can send something across the internet anonymously so tor goal is to make you anonymous and make it impossible for someone to see who sent something heck even mit runs a tor node or relay i think now tor offers something called hidden services essentially you can run a web site inside the tor network this means your information enters the tor but never leaves it these websites do not work the concept of ip addresses rather address keys so you cannot just say oh this server ip address is xx xx xx xx and then find the owner so you can connect to a tor hidden service like one of the black markets however you wo not get general information like an ip address remember that bouncing i mentioned it works both ways so the website does not know who you are and you do not know what the website is spez i forgot to mention so you could pretty much rent a server from anywhere configure it to work with tor and then you could access it through tor so when agencies try to locate one of these hidden services they commonly start to ddos the servers of certain known hosting companies and eventually they will knock it down and then they have found it these companies usually accept anonymous payment methods like bitcoin but most of them are probably hosted somewhere in the america ,1,The_Donald

canadianbacon22, so you do not agree that this is voter suppression i do not see any of the changes preventing someone to vote a lot of it seems unnecessarily strict some of it makes sense but you cannot just say discrimination when one demographic is affected more by a change when everyone is affected by it in terms of voter id yes all citizens have the right to vote the problem is that 7 of the us population are non citizens https www census gov prod 2014pubs acsbr12 06 pdf a study http www sciencedirect com science article pii s0261379414000973 from old dominion university estimates that around 6 6 of non citizens voted in the 2008 election also that 80 of non citizens voted in favour of one party and that it was enough to affect the outcome of the election ,1,AskThe_Donald
canadianbacon22,if hb 589 reduces the availability of locations to vote then no you cannot say that it targets democrats it affects everyone not just people who vote democrat requiring an id does not suppress anyones vote you literally need some sort of government issued id to do anything nowadays anywhere in the world and with the amount of voter fraud that was discovered it a logical response to have such a law requiring an id or notarized absentee ballot ,2,AskThe_Donald

canadianbacon22,actually the us equal employment opportunity commission determined that title vii of the civil rights act protects people from discrimination based on sexual orientation so no you wo not get fired the wall in all honesty probably has to do more with illegal activities along the border than it does with just human trafficking regardless i think the wall will solve many problems as for fada trump never said he would pass fada he said he would only sign it on if congress passed it regardless if it would be passed i think the american people would be very quick to stand against it last i heard around 70 of americans were against it i hope i do not come off as a mean person when i say this but something like fada is what equal rights look like you have the right to live and do what you want how you want and i should not have the right to stop you but likewise i have the right to live and do what i want how i want and you should not have the right to stop me if people want to be discriminatory in a free market it sure as hell wo not end up well for them ,0,AskReddit
canadianbacon22,like i said before i think many of his policies are brute they are like covering a hole in the wall with duct tape instead of fixing it properly they will work but it wo not be the greatest i do not think building a wall will be a waste i think the whole fiasco about who will be paying for it is a lot of unnecessary drama but i think it wo not cost as much as we think it might knowing the us govt spending habits some sanctuary cities are pretty bad and do harbor some terrible people and no many americans would do the jobs they do but they cannot compete against illegal immigrants doing the same job for half the price i am not so sure on starting some sort of pathway to citizenship for someone when literally everything they have done in a country was illegal like i said the bar on muslim immigration is brute it not banning everyone but it not perfect either but it will work the gag order is dumb but after looking around a bit bush obama and whomever else was president did the same thing so i guess it common practice still dumb but normal i do not think lgbt people should be worried the civil rights act wo not be going anywhere if anything reinstating the religious freedom act wo not do anything but point out who some assholes are and in the long run affect their businesses did you even read why the justices dissented from obergefell v hodges it has to do with more on the principles of what the supreme court is compared to what the lgbt community was asking them to do ,0,AskReddit
canadianbacon22,well let see building a wall well when you have an illegal immigration problem with the border of mexico and want to fix it you build a fucking wall slash funding of sanctuary cities why the fuck is your government funding cities who pride on granting illegal immigrants safe haven muslim ban first of all it not a muslim ban it a bar from having muslims immigrate from countries that have islamic extremism terrorism most of said countries values do not even coincide with those of western society mainly because of many of their laws that are derived directly from islam so if you think you should let in a bunch of people from a country that stands for the complete opposite of yours be my fucking guest silencing any government scientists you mean the gag order that trump placed that lasts one week while power is transferred yeah i think that stupid i do not agree with that rolling back civil rights for lgbt people what the fuck are you talking about you think the civil rights act is going to be turned over or something you think reinstating the religious freedom act is going to do anything besides making people shop elsewhere ,-2,AskReddit

canadianbacon22,yeah i think that the way i am going to go doing the oscp during or after my military service could you recommend any other certs that are considered entry level but focus on security would ceh be a good one i know it not much in terms of credibility but in terms of it being like a hr filter ,1,AskNetsec

canadianbacon22,i was under the impression that everything you needed to know to pass the exam was taught in the course obviously working in it would make it that much easier would you consider doing something a little lesser like eleansecurity jpt first then the oscp it very similar in terms of material given it a little dated there even a practical exam all for a fraction of the cost as well ,1,AskNetsec

canadianbacon22,the only thing i am concerned about is how long it would take because my parents are really on my ass to get in because it been about a year i am out of high school i think i could do it but for all the time required to study and actually pass it would present another delay for me ,1,AskNetsec
canadianbacon22,yeah i am already studying sec and will also have net done by end of february for the oscp i would probably have more lab time than usual but i am debating when i should do it ,1,AskNetsec
canadianbacon22,well i do have the time and money for the oscp i am just wondering when i should do it in order to not waste time and money i was hoping to do it with around 3 or 5 months of lab time before i joined the army granted i just finished high school and have no it work experience ,1,AskNetsec
canadianbacon22,in the end penetration tester becoming one in the military not the end goal so to say if i could become on great right now my goal is to get quality experience if i were to join with the oscp my chances of getting a security role would be greatly improved because every year there is a ctf style competition for such positions ,1,AskNetsec
canadianbacon22,generic it certificates can get you a generic it job like helpdesk from there you could probably move up rather quickly to something else a bit higher like sys admin work a bit as a sys admin do a practical cert like oscp and then you could probably land yourself as a junior pen tester heck some people think oscp is even over kill for a junior but for the price and time it worth i would do it regardless you will have to have some sort of experience even if you had a cs degree in terms of canada it not the best there maybe only a few job listings for my province and majority of them are multi role security functions not just pen testing as soon as i serve my 4 years in the army i am probably going to see what job opportunities are in the us ,2,AskNetsec
canadianbacon22,i think people all feel depressed in different ways like look at me i still cannot get over a girl that rejected me in 7th grade it messed me up in different ways i developed some bad habits and anxiety but i was not letting that control all of my life sure it messed with me when i would try and socialize with other people but it would not stop me from driving or going to the gym the biggest problem with humans is our intelligence the fact that we can build destroy or fulfill ourselves with our thoughts alone is very powerful but also very dangerous the amount of times that i thought all the shit was going to fall down and everything was over has yet to happen ,1,sad
canadianbacon22,i think if you are going to go for the oscp it would be kind of pointless to do some other certs because the oscp would prove your abilities lot more for example you could ditch the lpt and maybe another cert while the oscp is considered a entry level cert it would suffice for many jobs i think you might have a problem with not having any experience though not pen testing related just anything it related certs are not really much unless you can back them up and most people who chose the longer route instead of getting a degree in comp science usually worked as a sys admin or something similar before security so i think you might have an issue finding even a junior position without any sort of it experience that where something like the oscp might help you out given it real practical training ,3,AskNetsec

canadianbacon22,when you say used it alone do you mean that being the only outstanding thing on a junior resume the way i am sort of planning my learning path is to get the related experience in the military certifications such as oscp and the college diploma linked picture if what i listed wo not cut it ,1,netsecstudents
canadianbacon22,by comp science degree do you mean a bachelor degree because we have colleges here in canada that have 2 3 year long computer science programs that offer something like this http www johnabbott qc ca wp content uploads 2014 05 computer science courses jpg ,1,netsecstudents
canadianbacon22,i live in montreal and i have done some looking around on job posting sites like indeed ca just to see what sort of requirements are needed i am fresh out of high school joining the army in a few months just asked to see what the life of a pen tester is like by the looks of things there is not many openings for solely for penetration testing they are more of like analyst and engineer type roles where they want someone who can pen test basically if you are going for a job you also need to be a well rounded person ,3,AskNetsec
canadianbacon22,sorry to confuse you but when you say degree do you mean a degree from a university or college degree a lot of the posts i read throw the word degree around it just confusing for me because where i live we usually refer to university studies as a degree and college studies as a diploma basically when you say degree do you mean university of college ,1,netsecstudents

canadianbacon22,wait like the same way you are holding a mouse ,3,Showerthoughts
canadianbacon22,i think most of the it industries will favour experience over degrees to some extent that being said i think a degree in computer science is the most highly regarded correct me if i am wrong while having a degree will get you pass hr experience will get you the job in terms of your certs they are good but are a lot more powerful if you have relevant experience getting one and then doing an internship or a job where you will be using them is great also i think you might want to plan which certs you will get when you figure out what you will want to do i think things like the a and linux are a bit unnecessary for sec and net you might want to pick up a book or two they are like 40 each and watch prof messer http www professormesser com videos ceh is regarded as a pos and scam and you cannot become a cissp without 5 years of full time working experience i noticed you mentioned kali and ceh so i am guessing you have penetration testing in mind the oscp is definitely a cert you will want to get if you want to try something a little lesser before that there eleansecurity junior penetration tester it has no reputation whatsoever but it still wholesome material and cheap too ,1,netsecstudents

canadianbacon22,this is my 2 cents granted i was really young at the time and was not actually in a relationship it was rejection that set me into a spiral basically i could not get over a girl who was like my best friend that rejected me in 7th grade and i lived my high school life revolving around that moment i had issues not sure if i worked through them all because i feel like i am back at step one first thing i am going to say is do not fantasize about anything seriously this can lead you down a big fucking rabbit hole that hard to get out of the only time i got out of it is when i met someone else and when that ended i started fantasizing over the same girl again and now i am in the same spot as before do not sugar coat anything also if you start thinking you will be able to fix it when you really cannot it going to hit you harder when you learn she he moved on try not to get into any contact with them whether it social media or anything you really do not want to turn into a social media stalker like i did i swear i was doing some cia level information gathering get busy get fit invest your time well it even better if it with other people i find that doing stuff with people is a great way to get support and keep yourself busy at the same time if you are like me who constantly thinking about it sometime the self helping things wo not work too well i really liked doing things that were safe but still scared the shit out of me like roller coasters and other adventurous things time will pass and you will heal and remember you guys were either going to get married or break each others hearts sorry the latter had to happen just remember that at the end of the day it better to be single and lost than to be with someone who does not love you ,2,AskReddit

canadianbacon22,you do not need to know the basics of penetration testing i think that sort of how the last line of comment came off i meant the basics of security and networking and as well as some scripting like it says on the pwk web page also general computer knowledge for example if you have no idea how a firewall works what a packet is or even lesser things like the difference between an admin user or regular user is then maybe you should research and study some more before starting but no you do not need to know anything pen testing related to start but you will probably end up reading those books and what not anyways so i would probably do that before and save some time ,2,AskNetsec
canadianbacon22,this is what i kept on telling everyone the affordable care act was going to fuck everything and everyone over if it was going to regulate the private insurance companies the whole point of affordable care was so that people who could not afford health insurance got it not that all the private companies had to start selling policies to unhealthy people they would lose money on or that everyone had to get health insurance sure 20 something million more people have health insurance but now health insurance would cost more than some people mortgages ,0,uncensorednews

canadianbacon22, when people say that they will push their sexuality onto children and then straight people go on to push sexuality onto children then i see no benefit to pushing a child towards any type of sexuality then what is the problem with straight parents raising children with a straight state of mind are you calling them hypocrites for raising children normally edit formatting,0,AskReddit

canadianbacon22,coming from another person who also learning how to ride one thing i would suggest is try to practice technique in a controlled environment whether you choose it to be the track or the local parking lot is up to you just a nice stress free place to learn and practice the parking lot i usually practice in is rather large and i try to make the best of it by riding up and down imagining turns here and there etc also do not be afraid if you think you will need to take baby steps along the way some of us are just slow learners ,1,motorcycles
