perrierwoof,but then why did not he want to get married if theoretically they had a relationship exactly like a marriage just minus the paper what is the big deal of just making it legal it seems shady to me in that case if two people are committed to each other and the legality gives you more benefits why not in the case of fear of divorce rape for the man if he did not want to get married it seems like he did not trust her ,1,RedPillWomen
perrierwoof,what kind of asian are you do you live in asia and born and raised it sort of interesting because east asian parents meaning parents of the millennial generation typically had a stem working husband and then a sahm but i have noticed for millennial asian american couples both are asian it common to have both man and woman working in stem or medicine there so many asian doctor couples or asian engineering couples i wonder if it because that the only way they can meet people also asian americans do not typically go out of their way to meet new and interesting people outside of their box i just wonder if it more to do with money or to do with social circles ,1,RedPillWomen
perrierwoof,i do not think it the point of being holy but it the point of why buy the cow when you are giving the milk away for free i mean obviously it varies for each couple and it does work out sometimes but i have also seen way too many couples who have lived together for years woman was in smitten and hoping for marriage and the relationship was going that direction in every single way their lives totally intertwined then the man realizes she not going to be his wife but he ok with her living with him and wo not complain having free female company so she has to make the move to leave ,1,RedPillWomen
perrierwoof,just out of curiosity did you talk about marriage in the future before moving in together and if not what would happen if you continued to live with him hoping for eventual marriage but one day he realizes he does not want you as a wife would you move out ,1,RedPillWomen
perrierwoof, once a woman moves in the guy gets everything he wants and would have in a marriage minus the legality of the relationship marriage confers if anything it can easily lead to him delaying marriage even longer because he basically has marriage in all but name only yes agreed although i have seen it work out for a few couples but i feel it risky it also draws out the process longer living together for a few years before marrying typically and you have to be willing to risk those few years without any sort of talk of proposal usually these couples decide to live together to try it out then talk about marriage it works for some but for me i cannot understand it the whole trying it out scheme seriously what is there to try out you just live in the same place and keep your same life you have to deal with another person mess sometimes but if you have lived with flatmates before it not a shocker ,6,RedPillWomen
perrierwoof,the post was never about courthouse weddings although i can see how that misunderstood when i say legality i mean that in a sense of legal status and commitment of love i am predominantly talking about bridezilla weddings or those over the top proposals and women feeling sorry for you if you did not spend thousands and had everything perfect as i mentioned in my post i would also like to have a modest wedding as a celebration ,1,RedPillWomen
perrierwoof, but it means that our community sees us as married which we would not necessarily get with a courthouse wedding nothing more i consider the community aspect an important one in terms of making sure that marriage is venerated by all that a good point because the legal aspect is secondary to the commitment between two people in my opinion definitely it should be the commitment between two people first but that what i am also saying you do not need a fancy wedding to celebrate that commitment the commitment should be there already marriage just makes it legal and upgrades your statuses publicly it gives you legal benefits that you would not have with just the normal commitment i would also like a small wedding in front of family and friends but i just do not see the point of making it a huge deal and spending thousands of dollars ,1,RedPillWomen
perrierwoof, are you marrying a person or a piggy bank well i am personally not i am just playing devil advocate if you expect your man to provide the high value of a higher standard of living that comes along with a higher income you ought to be offering a higher standard of value to him as well that when it reasonable if you just expect to be pampered then it unreasonable who said i am expecting or anyone that expecting to be pampered that what the post is about raising your own value so you can attract higher value that why i asked if anyone has ever tried to attract better by raising their own value first sure maybe if a woman who wants to marry a wealthier man might be marrying a piggy bank but is it really so bad to ask for a man who is employed that the same as a man asking for a woman who is in a healthy bmi i do not think asking for a man who has employment is gold digging at all i think it wanting to be with an adult who can be responsible for himself asking for an extremely wealthy man is of course another issue ,3,RedPillWomen
perrierwoof, the ridiculously large traits women have for mr perfect when you have clear life goals and you know what type of man you want to share those goals with so how is it ridiculously large trait if a woman wants a man with money so she can be a sahm how is it a ridiculously large trait if a woman wants a man who works for a corporation so he has stable income how is it a ridiculously large trait if a woman wants a man who has a very active social life because she likes that life too what if these traits are her life goals as well then it does not make it a ridiculously large trait for mr perfect do not you think ridiculously large traits for me would be trivial things like he has to be a lawyer that volunteers at the animal shelter and does crossfit of course that unreasonable but basic traits listed above money social life stable income i think those are reasonable goals in life i am not disagreeing with your point that women should be happy themselves but the point is let say a woman is stable and happy herself she a social person and works a job that does not pay much why should not she look for a man who earns more than her and has a social life because she happy with that life the post has nothing to do with women being happy without a man although it important but the basic premise is that you are already happy but are you ok with what you attract even with your best self ,6,RedPillWomen
perrierwoof,this post was not about rich guys anyway or finding that perfect man to give you that life it was about types of men that you attract none of those types up there are necessary bad they are just different a greater beta man would be easier to handle and would protect you more while if you married a socialite alpha he expecting a lot out of you to keep up with his fast lifestyle ,4,RedPillWomen
perrierwoof,i have to agree here i have attracted two lone wolf guys and i have noticed what happens is they are simply seeking companionship at the beginning then when i prove what i can contribute to their lives they are fiercely protective of me wo not let me go these types of men do not look for a wife they tend to look for interesting women then realize that you are a catch ,4,RedPillWomen
perrierwoof,well my point is it better to have a beta boyfriend because everything is in the woman favor but i could never respect a man who just let me make the decisions and walk all over him ,0,RedPillWomen
perrierwoof,i do not understand why people leave the love of their lives why not try to work through it it sounds like in your case she was the love of your life but you were the one who left her why and of she was so crazy at the end why did you love her that much my boyfriend has a friend who loved this girl so much and was engaged only to break it off and marry another girl in year later my boyfriend claims his friend does not truly love the new girl but he loved his ex girlfriend then why break up what could possibly not work out ,3,RedPillWomen
perrierwoof,if you date a man in his 30 he going to have baggage of some sort as with women in their 30 ,2,RedPillWomen
perrierwoof,yes i do have this of being direct i am not very good at being confrontational and i tend to let it go and bottle it up inside i feel like it rude to say please stop talking about my relationship or stop giving me advice i am trying to learn how to deal better because i think what happens is i am so passive about it so that why these friends are pushy because they think that what i want but it not while i might have fueled her and i need to be more direct however i did only legitimately talk about my relationship twice only twice but only to get her feedback dozens of times in return unsolicited also i did tell her my boundaries in example 3 i told her never mind i do not want to talk about it and she still offered unsolicited advice and felt the need to take care of me when i was blunt in saying i did not want help i think that was the time that pissed me off the most ,0,RedPillWomen
perrierwoof,thank you i think part of it has to do with her personality and her career she a very successful businesswoman she knows how to talk she gets off on being social and getting attention and being in people business whether it personal or work and she very calculative she can see through people and put two and two together to get the maximum benefit for her so that why she thinks she being helpful when to me she butting into my business i know she not a bad person maybe we just do not get along in certain aspects i know i get annoyed sometimes because i feel like she not listening to me and just wants to talk and when we are out with other people it always her that doing the talking and she feels like she has to baby me by pulling me into the conversation i do not need someone to pull me into the conversation i will say something when i want to say something side rant anyways i have had these a few of types of friends before their benefit is that they like to lead and i am pretty easygoing and will go along with them but the disadvantage is they are aggressive and overbearing funny enough i have noticed this exact type of woman tends to have relationship problems and you know why because these women are so independent and aggressive and cannot relax but wonder why men do not chase them and then they expect men to serve them just for being awesome i see a connection between all of these types of women they think everybody else is lower than them i am pretty sure her husband cheated on her because she a handful ,1,RedPillWomen
perrierwoof, the best way to share a life is to build a life worth sharing i loved this sentence and the more i think of it the more it true i am just thinking of a woman who is great domestically but nothing else what more could she share besides household duties that why it so important to be your own person woman have your own interests and hobbies then you can contribute something to the relationship besides just exchanging provider domestic sexual favors what is more to you besides being a maid or a prostitute or an escort ,2,RedPillWomen
perrierwoof,yeah i am sure she had good intentions too it just really irritated me when she would try to solve my problem when i just did not want to talk about it you know that what it was when i told her never mind i do not want to talk about it but she still had the nerve to push her opinions on me that what really pissed me off she was being too helpful and i just did not want it ,0,RedPillWomen
perrierwoof,yes i know i fueled her and i am for sure going to stop talking about my relationship to her i did not realize she would act this way obviously after the third episode i decided i had enough and something needed to change i just do not know if i should confront her or just cut my friendship with her again she brings it up when i did not in the first place actually just writing this makes me feel like i should just cut contact her advice is not even that helpful it just makes me more paranoid and anxious and feel worse plus i feel like i know why her husband cheated on her she has shrew characteristics like being a know it all and being condescending and aggressive and wo not stfu ,1,RedPillWomen
perrierwoof,that exactly why i do not understand women who must need rich husbands a woman i know married a rich oral surgeon and he spent 100k on a wedding and bought a crazy expensive apartment in nyc but she always unhappy because he a beta dork and not physically attractive or confident at least not with women you need enough money to survive but now and again i believe personality and character compatibility is the most important not having a six figure income ,1,RedPillWomen
perrierwoof,a lot of high value men will flirt with any woman because it part of their value to be socially adept i would say he legitimately interested only if he actually asks her out i say this because i know too many men like this because they get off on making women bask in attention i mean sure give it a shot and the worst that happens is he turns her down but i do strongly feel if he truly interested he will make an actual move not just flirt on the surface ,4,RedPillWomen
perrierwoof,thank you again ,1,RedPillWomen
perrierwoof,thank you so much your comments have been very helpful in understanding this i just felt like men wanted an emotionally strong woman because i know of a few couples where the woman is or at least seems pretty happy and stable but also the man is a huge beta i was just nervous that if i am not always perfect then no one will be with me obviously that an irrational fear because i have had several ltrs before but it just what i have observed i have also heard of men leaving their wives because she just refused to be happy i do not refuse to be happy but i just seem to struggle more or so it seems ,1,RedPillWomen
perrierwoof, you fear your boyfriend will not want to protect you because of your emotional problems but thats the exact opposite reason emotional instability is a red flag men all too often men are more than will to stay in an abusive relationship thinking they can help their partner sorry could you elaborate on this so he wo not look down on me for being anxious and fearful i thought men wanted a woman who was strong emotionally so they can put her on a pedestal i am not cruel towards other people but i am anxious what people think about me and i am always scared of doing a bad job like failure i feel like a man would want a successful woman who does not have any problems and is very confident i have seen psychiatrists and therapist for years so i have coping techniques but it just does not always happen but i make sure to be aware of it and take control when i can i am proud to say at least even when i relapse i am willing to admit i have the problem and i know how to get out of it i am just not perfect and that why i am afraid he will find someone that more normal ,1,RedPillWomen
perrierwoof,but does not self harm scars means emotional instability i mean i am generally fine now but i do have minor relapses meaning small bouts of depression here and there and i have normal pms times but definitely nothing as serious as before i feel like it still a red flag and it makes me scared because then i feel like he wo not see me as someone to protect because i am so messed up i am still working on my moods and it will be something i have to continuously work on because it not something natural to me i am not abusive but my problem is high anxiety and quick to be angry the anger only happens when someone offends me and it feels like an attack then it sets me off my boyfriend does see my emotional instability but he also knows i am rational and intelligent enough to work through it and not let it overcome me but then it makes me fear that he would eventually leave and pick a girl who is not as much of a handful why would not he if i contribute craziness in his life why should he stay ,1,RedPillWomen
perrierwoof,i think this is what it is i am overcompensating and it making me unhappy i just need to try to still improve but let go of other people choices or opinions ,3,RedPillWomen
perrierwoof,yes i have had a more volatile life than most i would say i struggled a lot with depression due to existentialism crises and some self worth still do for me i like my boyfriend because he on a mission and exactly the qualities you said he has a strong hand and gives me enough attention but he also helps me stay independent because i cannot be as clingy it makes me feel worthless so my independence is important yes i would say if my friends know what my relationship was like they would think it abusive we also have a little bit of a bdsm dynamic in both the bedroom and in real life i am really submissive to him and i get off on it i could never be with someone who was not so dominant he gets off on being so dominant our sex life is insane i enjoy being with him and it makes life worth living instead of being a hamster on a wheel and following the crowd ,2,RedPillWomen
perrierwoof,actually it sort of the opposite my friends are american and they value working for a big corporation because of money so they think it stupid to be a freelancer my boyfriend just prefers the independent lifestyle and he building a name for himself to be a construction and business magnate in a developing country it takes a long time to develop and he struggles sometimes but he made connections with all the big businesses and he might be meeting the president soon because they want to develop the country infrastructure ,1,RedPillWomen
perrierwoof,yeah that exactly it he dreams of this independence and freedom i believe in him he not american and we do not live in america so it a little more difficult too seriously it really not as easy to build yourself up outside the us but he has these dreams and i support him so much i mean if you look at his resume it like managerial or consultant positions with many companies he just really prefers to be independent and i understand this i have dated corporate guys and they are so jaded with themselves and my boyfriend is so independent he explores by himself and he talks to people he does not need an office to have a community he developed his network all by himself ,2,RedPillWomen
perrierwoof,yes exactly this ,1,RedPillWomen
perrierwoof,thus is exactly that are you infj our personality type says that we can be people person but then shut down and friends are confused because they have seen our charming friendly side sometimes i actually do not know how to talk to people just a normal conversation because i am so used to being on ,1,RedPillWomen
perrierwoof,because my friends are rich and posh and have husbands who make over six figures so they feel superior having a breadwinner husband again my boyfriend works for a family business and he seen as a drifter because he the one out getting jobs and projects he does not just show up to the office and is a good boy and i have seen many relationships where the woman is so obsessed with money and status but there no love between the two ,1,RedPillWomen
perrierwoof,my boyfriend comes from a country where there are not big corporations rather family businesses he works for his family and for himself so he not really a typical drifter bum ,2,RedPillWomen
perrierwoof,i understand i do not try to lure anyone on purpose it just how i am unfortunately i guess i cannot really help then just be yourself if you want to be genuine ,2,RedPillWomen
perrierwoof,thanks that really made me feel better i do feel like i have higher intelligence in some way mostly interpersonal intelligence and my parents have said i am too smart for my own good and that why i struggle with mental illness my boyfriend accepts me and we enjoy life together i have debated if i want one of those cookie cutter marriages dating normally with a corporate guy and marrying before 30 because societal expectations and then buying a house and letting him work up the ladder and just buying more materialism throughout our lives i just do not understand when my friends say i am not in the relationship for good reasons when they are fat and boring housewives ,4,RedPillWomen
perrierwoof,this comment is really funny to me because i am a performer as my job i can easily put on an act and be extremely charming it lures a lot of guys in but then i have a difficult time figuring out what i want and also at the same time they figure out that i am not so charming 24 7 and i need a lot of down time not sure if other people are like this dating putting their best self forward then having to transition into their normal personalities maybe i am mentally ill ,4,RedPillWomen
perrierwoof,it so tricky because i also feel like i have to pretend i am perfect and also i do not want people talking about my relationship we all know women gossip i do it too i do not really trust anyone but my parents to keep things to themselves so then i feel pretty closed off in general and maybe the best way is to ask reddit strangers ,2,RedPillWomen
perrierwoof,yes and another big issue is i have a lot of red flags nothing to do with drugs or sex but i used to cut myself and i have some scars on my arms i realized there were some normal guys that were freaked out about it but i want someone to accept me and my past and how far i have come he does just that he does not beat me or anything and he works full time just not with some big corporate honcho ,3,RedPillWomen
perrierwoof,yeah i mean i feel like why does it matter if my friends like my boyfriend or not he treats me well he might be a bit of a lone wolf but as am i i have some pretty big red flags anyway i honestly do not feel like normal guys would want to date me ,2,RedPillWomen
perrierwoof,you are misunderstanding i am not the main breadwinner he does not make little money he simply make a middle class income instead of an upper middle class income the remarks were coming from upper middle class friends i actually have a very low paying job in most situations except right now where i was able to get a good but rare position his job is much more lucrative than mine ,1,RedPillWomen
perrierwoof,another comment to the drifter comment maybe we get along because i am a drifter too i have thought about this i have had dates with these so called corporate guys and i just do not get along with them i find them to be like a mouse on a wheel and a bit fake i like my boyfriend because he very independent and he does not follow the crowd our life is not an american sitcom where everything is perfect and he gets fat at his 9 5 job or whatever i feel like i am living life with him and i feel fulfilled and happy with him a lot of those corporate guys do not even know what to do with their money anyway and are totally oblivious to outside the us and live in some perfect ignorant bubble my boyfriend is not american ,3,RedPillWomen
perrierwoof, maybe your friends are just concerned for you because your boyfriend comes across as a bit of a drifter type i think that what it is and i do realize this too but at the same time i see so many of my friends with husbands who are not drifters but they are not even that happy so what is the point i know women with husbands who make 300k and they have everything they want including work or no work for themselves and again still not happy a friend who married an oral surgeon who makes huge money working three days a week but then on his off days he playing video games and is a beta dork at heart so she disgusted and turned off by him or a friend who married a rich doctor and he lets her stay home they hire house help and he does not pressure her to cook ever but she gained so much weight and is depressed she over spoiled so that why i just feel like drifter or no drifter does it matter i do not understand this friend judges me because of my drifter boyfriend but i am happy fit attractive and not pitying myself like she does my boyfriend might look like a drifter compared to those working for corporate companies but he not a bum he the most hardworking that i know actually ,3,RedPillWomen
perrierwoof,i am willing to move and find a job to be with him i guess sometimes feminism still gets to my head he should work hard to chase you if he really wants you bullshit i acknowledge that both people have to pull their weight to be together he would provide the house for us if i move and i am compassionate of how hard he is working to make it feasible from us i guess i keep hearing my friend voice saying things like do not be stupid to move you have a good job tell him to find a job near you instead but she has a bad marriage so maybe i should not listen to her ,1,RedPillWomen
perrierwoof,he took the job because the company closed his home country does not have any jobs the economy is in the shit he had to move to make a better life for himself we talked about him seeing how the new job is and i will visit him to see what my options are i would not make as much money there as i currently do now but i would be a wife and still work part time ,1,RedPillWomen
perrierwoof, i see a couple of red flags in your situation one is your boyfriend career similarly limited by geography did he have to move in order to find work or was it optional if he already had an acceptable job and prioritized a career upgrade over being with you hmm i am not sure how much i would sacrifice in that case yes he had to move we are not americans it was required and he could not stay in the previous job because the company closed his home country does not have any jobs or at least they are very low paying his new job pays a lot better than what he could find in his home country and in my country i am not moving there without being married and he knows this we have discussed it before ,1,RedPillWomen
perrierwoof,i actually met my current boyfriend online but i was also asked out by colleagues people who work in the same building but not office friends of friends even at a concert i just learned how to be more sociable and approachable and they literally came flocking ,3,RedPillWomen
