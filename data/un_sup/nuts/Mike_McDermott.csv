Mike_McDermott,fair i did not intend to equate them at all other than to highlight how people will watch news that confirms their bias and ignore news that disagrees with their bias i was using the recent conspiracy stories coming out about the various players to high light that concept i bring it up because the point of the article is that fox news is losing viewers while cnn and msnbc are gaining and that is reversing a 17 year trend that is pretty significant in my book i think the trend has changed because the left wing news now has a lot to report on about the current president and right wing news doesnt because the choose not to this medium kind of sucks for me to communicate my ideas i recognize that is my problem and not the mediums problem thank you for allowing the opportunity to clarify my post im afraid it was misunderstood again my fault ,1,news

Mike_McDermott,no i chose my words carefully my entire point was that fox news is struggling against cnn and msnbc because fox conspiracy news stories seth rich clinton stealing the dnc nomination are not gaining traction like the ones on cnn and msnbc viewers of cnn and msnbc probably dislike trump and are a lot more inclined to tune into a news show that talks bad about him a similar thing happened to fox and contributed to some of fox s popularity while obama was president fox viewers typically didnt like obama and if fox reported negative stories about him they would tune in and watch we watch what confirms what we already believe we ignore what conflicts with what we already believe trump supporters are having a hard time accepting or even reading about the russia conspiracy but his detractors love it for obvious reasons i never voted for trump and do not support anything he does he is a clown and an embarrassment ,1,news
