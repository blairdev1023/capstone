ijpqenbfp,you are right that m t mechanics are obtuse and hard to grasp you are also right that playing m t optimally is sometimes a bit of a math puzzle still m t is deeper more fun and interesting to me than vanilla eu4 for example in eu4 the optimal strategy is simply blobbing as hard as you can in m t conquering a far away province will mean that that province is at 100 autonomy all game because it so far from your capital that it gains autonomy over time so then do you move your capital to a more central location build roads docks or regional capitals to reduce effective distance and thus lower autonomy if so which do you build and where these are all expensive so it not immediately obvious that building these is better than building say a workshop in your capital or do you accept 100 autonomy and do you ask the estate that runs this province for help occasionally or do you not conquer far away provinces at all after all the more provinces you have the more privileges your estates will demand and privileges increase corruption this means that strategy is not just how do i blob quickly but also should i blob at all if so where should i blob and how do i ensure efficient communication with my capital ,5,eu4

ijpqenbfp,you are right that unlike in vanilla money lost to autonomy gets reinvested rather than vanishing into a black hole that makes lowering autonomy less of a priority than it would otherwise be however if you have a province that stays at 100 autonomy all game then that province may develop itself very nicely but it will never give you even one ducat aside from trade power and begging the estates for money what good is theoretically having an asset that you cannot cash in if you need it eg to fight a war in contrast you can choose to reinvest all earnings in a 0 autonomy province but you also have the option to spend the money on something else a better investment in another province advisors paying for troops etc plus 0 autonomy means that you do not have to beg your estates for troops every time you want to fight a war plus religious conversion is harder at high autonomy so 0 autonomy is still the ideal ,9,MEIOUandTaxes

ijpqenbfp,you are right that i was being inaccurate maybe this is a better way to put it the price of oil that companies need to continue extraction search for future fossil fuels is say 100 barrel and rising every year it rising because of declining eroei if it lower than 100 barrel you get supply destruction which is delayed by 0 interest rates semi invisible cuts to fossil fuel exploration and money stockpiles from better days but still the price of oil that median consumers need to keep up their consumption is say 50 barrel and falling every year if it higher than 50 you get demand destruction 50 and 100 are not exact numbers but the point is oil companies need an ever increasing oil price or you get supply destruction and consumers need an ever decreasing oil price or you get demand destruction and this leads to the cycles of demand destruction and supply destruction that we have been seeing it only took one spike in fuel prices in 2008 to create some fairly durable demand destruction this is part of the problem i described above and yes demand destruction means that the cost of oil and natural gas has been going down but this does not negate the trends that i have described above the problem is not that oil prices at this moment are wrong the problem is that two trends oil needs to be ever cheaper and ever more expensive are combining to cause a situation where there there will be no viable oil price which causes the market mechanism to break down this leads to cycles of demand destruction and supply destruction i do agree that the khazzoom brookes postulate is also worrisome it seems similar to the jevons paradox https en wikipedia org wiki jevons paradox ,2,collapse

ijpqenbfp,not paywalled for me but ever since 2012 scientists have been debating a complex and frankly explosive idea about how a warming planet will alter our weather one that if it s correct would have profound implications across the northern hemisphere and especially in its middle latitudes where hundreds of millions of people live the idea is that climate change doesn t merely increase the overall likelihood of heat waves say or the volume of rainfall it also changes the flow of weather itself by altering massive planet scale air patterns like the jet stream pictured above which flows in waves from west to east in the northern hemisphere a warming planet causes our weather to become more stuck in place this means that a given weather pattern whatever it may be may persist for longer thus driving extreme droughts heat waves downpours and more this basic idea has sparked half a decade of criticism and debate and at the cutting edge of research scientists continue to grapple with it and now a new study once again reinforces one of its core aspects publishing in nature scientific reports michael mann of pennsylvania state university and a group of colleagues at research institutes in the united states germany and the netherlands find that at least in the spring and summer the large scale flow of the atmosphere is indeed changing in such a way as to cause weather to get stuck more often the study its authors write adds to the weight of evidence for a human influence on the occurrence of devastating events such as the 2003 european heat wave the 2010 pakistan flood and russian heat wave the 2011 texas heat wave and recent floods in europe but what does it mean for global warming to alter the jet stream the basic ideas at play here get complicated fast the study itself for instance refers to quasi resonant amplification qra of synoptic scale waves as the key mechanism for how researchers believe this is happening terminology sure to impart terror in nonscientists worldwide on the other hand some of this isn t all that complicated the northern hemisphere jet stream flows in a wavy pattern from west to east driven by the rotation of the earth and the difference in temperature between the equator and the north pole the flow is stronger when that temperature difference is large but when the arctic warms up faster than the equator does which is part of the fundamental definition of global warming and which is already happening the jet stream s flow can become weakened and elongated that s when you can get the resultant weather extremes it s sort of like if you confine an electromagnetic wave to a coaxial cable then you re not losing energy it s being tightly contained in that cable and sent to your television said mann these waves aren t losing energy so they grow and get larger and get stuck in place as well what the new study is saying is that in summer in particular this can occur moreover it finds that a particular temperature pattern is linked to that behavior and this temperature pattern featuring an extra warm arctic is becoming more frequent over time based on both observations and also a review of the outputs of high powered climate change models that the researchers conducted we think that the signal has emerged from the noise over the last decade said mann one researcher who co wrote an influential 2012 study suggesting that changes in the arctic could be driving mid latitude weather extremes stephen vavrus of the university of wisconsin praised the new research in an emailed comment monday this study goes beyond statistical correlations and explores a specific process that can plausibly explain how enhanced high latitude warming trends may trigger remote weather impacts he said but other scientific authors have expressed considerable skepticism of these kinds of ideas in the past a recent study in nature geoscience for instance called into question whether the arctic s melting and in particular its sea ice loss has been causing winter cooling over eurasia another idea that has been swept up in the debate over the jet stream and weather extremes one author of that study john fyfe of the canadian center for climate modeling and analysis at environment and climate change canada remarked of the mann paper by email it is well established that there has been a human influence on the large scale atmospheric circulation and temperature of the northern hemisphere mann et al advance a theory that attempts to link those changes to changes in the spectrum of shorter scale waves in the atmosphere which are our weathermakers i do not believe that this theory is fully developed or that the implications have been fully explored but i do think that mann et al study is a very good start the current study really only covers weather extremes in the spring and summer for extremes occurring in winter mann said we need to look to other mechanisms for odd atmospheric behavior nonetheless the work represents yet another suggestion that a changing climate is leading to a changing pattern of atmospheric flow with major implications for the weather felt by a massive swath of the global population mann who testifies before congress this week in a session that is expected to feature a rip roaring debate about the severity of climate change commented that s going to be a fake debate

ijpqenbfp,it not a dumb question here are two possible answers conventional reply oil companies are already incentivized to reduce costs so they are already using as much human labor as is cost efficient if they would employ more humans than that then oil would be more expensive to extract making oil more expensive for customers and thus making everything we buy more expensive r collapse reply you are thinking of oil companies as greedy and rich companies that could easily spend a bit more on their employees they were that in high eroei times but in the current low eroei times they are actually struggling and in no position to pay more labor costs oil companies need an oil price of about 100 per barrel or higher to be profitable however if oil really were 100 a barrel demand and thus oil price would immediately crash because even the middle class cannot afford that anymore without taking on even more debt most consumers can only afford oil based products ie everything if the oil price is about 25 or less so the oil price needs to be 25 and 100 which it cannot which means that the usual price finding mechanism breaks down how are we dealing with that situation well the oil price currently is at 50ish putting both the middle class and oil companies in an unsustainable situation we are solving that by making both oil companies and consumers borrow more money and we are solving that by having 0ish percent debt but this situation cannot last so no those oil companies that are already making struggling not to go bankrupt are not going to voluntarily increase their costs in the same way that poor people do not buy organic food or other niceties if you want to know more gail tverberg frequently writes about this ,8,collapse
