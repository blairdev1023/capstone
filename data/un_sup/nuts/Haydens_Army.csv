Haydens_Army,you have lost with me with the reference to these two laws can you please site both specifically the state programs already exist these religious foundations are auxiliary programs that supplement the whole that is quite a reach to assume they do not care about the child just because they choose to honor their own belief system and you digress with the pedophile comment that is so far off base it not worth a response at this point we agree to disagree your circumstantial scenarios are the basis of your arguments therefore the factual information is irrelevant best wishes to you ,1,news
Haydens_Army,first and foremost i really appreciate the well thought out answers 1 this bill does not block the lgbt couples this bill gives religious foundations built upon and based on set principles the option to opt out of an adoption that may go against their belief system it does not make it law to deny all lgbt couples from adopting i mentioned earlier that with the evolution of religion many many churches have lgbt members assuming they are members of said church they possibly could still adopt if not they have a surplus of state federally funded organizations that can help them adopt let me ask you this if this bill had not passed and religious organizations then shut down their adoption programs all together do not you think that would be worse ,1,news

Haydens_Army,your distaste for the religious centers is palpable you are perfect for government work btw if it an issue just throw money at it good call let me ask you this why do you care how a religious organization handles an adoption how does it directly affect you who rights are you fighting for the lgbtq community rights they are still fully intact and chances are that a same sex couple that attends a church and are members would most likely be able to still adopt through their religious organization i guess i am just lost as to what the hell you are arguing about ,1,news
Haydens_Army,do you have children did you adopt were you adopted have you spent time in the foster system you go ahead and do you i will still support adoption is all forms in any way that we can make it happen ,0,news
Haydens_Army,i am adopted i grew up in the church i support equal rights i would just ask that before you some of you spew your disgust for all to read that you read the original article and do your own research a religious foundation staying true to their principles may have to alter their methods or close up shop altogether if forced to go against their ideologies every child every child deserves love if this bill provides some protections for these private entities so they can continue doing good and helping to facilitate adoption then so be it ,0,news

Haydens_Army,does not abs measure rotational speed or anything applying pressure to the brake pedal initiates braking but more force is needed to slow down the larger wheel compared to the smaller from your response i am getting that the abs system is a blanket concept that just applies pressure to the brake pads which initiates slowing so you could downsize from 20 wheels on all 4 corners down to 15 wheels on all 4 and the abs system would still perform braking as normal ,2,cars

Haydens_Army,i think that is what i am struggling with so bad i am bringing the world down upon someone i used to love so much someone that gave me the most precious incredible gift in this life i do not want to do it i have to do it for me and for my daughter thank you for the powerful words ,1,Divorce

Haydens_Army,being a single father of a 3yr old daughter who had the incredible opportunity to take her out trick or treating last night this literally has me in tears at work the only silver lining i see is that this kid gets to grow up knowing his father was a real life hero rip,27,pics
Haydens_Army,i think the comments so far have been incredibly on point i want to speak to the quote i love you but not in love with you i have been down this rabbit hole several times over the last months and have come to the personal conclusion that this is simply a fallacy what does it mean to be in love that the real question and i believe that in love is another form of infatuation to love to love truly and deeply is not about being in love it about tackling life knowing you have a partner that is with you through thick and thin no matter what it about making the effort for your partner to know you appreciate and enjoy their very existence would love to know others thoughts on this ,4,Divorce
Haydens_Army,she had cheated on me with my friend gym buddy who was our neighbor i tried to let it go but i could not stand behind her when she was feuding with that guy girlfriend she wanted my support i could not give it she escalated and put my child in danger it was at that point i left i vowed i would protect my child with every ounce of who i am i currently have full custody with court tomorrow to hopefully finalize ,4,Divorce

Haydens_Army,as a child who grew up reading the goosebumps series first and foremost thank you for the several bad dreams and wet bed sheets i can solely attribute to your stories bob purely out of curiosity have you ever drawn from real life events to help craft your tales if so what major events have influenced you the most ,1,IAmA
Haydens_Army,i would not even be mad dude needed a break ,0,funny
Haydens_Army,i am not implying either of those very liberal interpretations imo i am looking at the circumstances 2 months out of divorce older kids holiday rapidly approaching he has no one in town the ex has all her family there what im trying to voice is that if the op feels it would be more beneficial to his children to be with the ex and extended family this thanksgiving then there is nothing wrong with that he is their father he can make the calls as he sees fit i knew my stance would be unpopular in this thread but i am glad i took it ,0,Divorce
Haydens_Army,you are extending the circumstances and implying things that are not true the divorce is two months old his family is 2000 miles away all her family is in the town why not let the kids spend time with extended family this year and that gives him a year to save up and take the kids to visit all his family 2000 miles away ,1,Divorce
Haydens_Army,again i completely respect the sentiment but you are focusing on the op i choose to keep the focus on the kids ask yourself what is best for them ,0,Divorce
Haydens_Army,greetings please excuse my naivety but i do feel compelled to ask i was adopted from birth with no family medical background i now have a 3 year old daughter as well what outside of predetermined markers for cancers does genetic testing show if i were to submit to testing much needed what else could i potentially find out i apologize if this is a redundant question in advance best wishes to you and thank you for setting up this ama ,1,science
Haydens_Army,right but circumstances change do they not you make a plan now but months years down the road somehow a decision you made previously was perfectly in the best interest of your children currently i am on board with following the parenting agreement but i am also selfless enough to know that if i do not have plans for thanksgiving and my child could spend it surrounded by family at my ex i will send them over only after i cook them a killer breakfast that morning and make it clear they know i will miss them today but i want them to go enjoy family ,-1,Divorce

Haydens_Army,the only answer is what is best for the kids if you think it would be good for them to be around family then let them go talk to your ex and express your thoughts and if you both agree then have your ex sign over next thanksgiving get it in writing sorry to be the one who goes against the flow but i believe as parents we must always do what is right by our children best wishes to you ,-1,Divorce

Haydens_Army,just breathe man just breathe my stbx was screwing around with my friend before during and after we got married i bounced out too luckily you do not have much to fight over it a fairly safe bet she will want you to cover some of her attorney fees basically up to the judge but outside of that now that you have made this decision brace yourself for the kick back there is a good chance she will be upset you will be just fine man hang tuff ,5,Divorce

Haydens_Army,just glad i could help a little best wishes and run hard for all of us ,1,Divorce
Haydens_Army,i can at least attest that it happens after 3 joint sessions 2 solo sessions each and then a session that was my ex wife and her mother the therapist called me and said she could no longer see us she told me she had serious concerns that my now ex wife had bpd with narcissistic traits and that i should prepare myself for things to escalate and potentially end needless to say after consulting a few other professionals 13 months of divorce proceedings legitimate threats of being murdered and a long overdue psych eval the therapist was right and i was pretty much lucky to get through this all fairly unscathed ,149,AskReddit
