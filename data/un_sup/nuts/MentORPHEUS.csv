MentORPHEUS, i got there and she was with 4 of her girlfriends and barely acknowledged my presence she just wanted to use you for some type of validation or social proof if this was a formal date planned for you two it would be downright rude to to bring friends she shut me down when i tried to dance with her or engage physically so i left without saying goodbye and have not talked to her since this is the correct response she probably finished with you but if she tries to maintain contact set the bar for her behavior and investment very high and the maximum you will give back low plate only if that ,2,TheRedPill
MentORPHEUS, i was wondering if it would bad to keep her around as an actual friend i am somewhat of an outlier in that many of my exes are on good terms with me few rise to the level of friend but many remain as acquaintances or become customers of my business they say it because they know they can trust me in these cases usually it takes a reset period of little or no contact after the intimacy period ends then a new norm of interaction can emerge trying to transition directly to friendship can become long and drawn out like peeling a bandage off slowly i am a believer in the camping rule of relationships http archive is z06r5 wherein i prefer to leave people better than they were before me ,1,TheRedPill
MentORPHEUS,a similar thing happened at usc last year http archive is gnwwi big video game industry conference was cancelled because they could not stack enough females into the speaker panel to satisfy sjws i mean never mind the mission technology code games women feel excluded so shut the whole thing down ,5,TheRedPill
MentORPHEUS, it is religion itself that is bluepill in my opinion time to replace prescientific superstitions with a rationality based social system i hate seeing people present the future as a binary choice between join the sjws and return to religion religion is based on a false premise all that follows is fruit of a poisoned tree trying to move forward with religion is like trying to sprinkle some alpha on a deeply embedded blue pill mindset too much work constantly patching the facade to fit reality because the underlying premises amount to fairy tales ,2,theredpillright
MentORPHEUS,i have got pof down to a system when i need prospects i unhide my profile for a few days then it time to hide it again because my calendar is full next month i am traveling to another state so i set up a new profile in that city and had my first meetup in the bag within 12 hours study your male competition on your site of choice the bar is pretty damn low to get your profile into the top 20 make a more detailed and polarizing profile than average you will get a smaller number of better qualified contacts ,4,TheRedPill

MentORPHEUS,over a dozen years ago i went through a hellish relationship with a true cluster b woman perhaps you have to go through it to understand how an intelligent experienced person can wind up entangled i am glad to see them revealing and explaining their past bad experiences so that a new generation of young men can avoid the same fate it of greater utility to laud his candor in telling about the lowest point of his past life for the sake of others than it is to shit on him for the series of bad choices that led him through it i see trp not only a museum of perfect alphas but a hospital for reforming betas sometimes the best lessons are from those who have worked their way back from deep beta territory ,3,TheRedPill
MentORPHEUS,brother we pretty much all did cringy stuff in hs forget about it and move forward when encountering estranged exes in public treat it the same as making eye contact with a benevolent stranger and continue to look forward with a 1000 yard stare if walking or continue sweeping your gaze as normal if stationary the lifting sounds like it going well try learning a martial art it helps your body but especially your frame when tough guys try to amog this unflappable frame often makes them back down without a word from you compared to this seeing your hs ex and her mom will be like nothing emotionally ,8,TheRedPill
MentORPHEUS,excellent analysis not sure why you are getting downvotes one of the structural issues facing dating sites is the perennially greater demand from males making it necessary to lower the bar or outright incentivize women to join in order to get and keep a dating site running i have seen ads for dating sites trying to launch different models but they never seem to take hold in the marketplace ,26,TheRedPill

MentORPHEUS, what is your alternative advice a fair question first off seek advice from men the average woman is not able to empathize with the perspective of the other gender and provide unbiased advice this is especially true of dating advice but this overlaps into fashion browsing celebrity pictures on pinterest is a female centric time filling activity of course a woman would recommend this it a woefully inefficient way to shop for clothes you can actually buy for yourself designers comp their wares to these celebrities in hopes they are photographed wearing them in which case the retail prices for potential rubes such as ourselves become multiplied this path will lead you to boutiques with per square foot rent that would make you pale and single garments that cost more than a used car i live in los angeles thus am not star struck by celebrities i am privy to the process of average persons ascended to undeserving godhood including truly stupid and or shitty individuals quick story a top a list couple was comped a household good that cost 40x as much as the one their average fans own they needed white glove delivery a service where rich people pay several hundred dollars extra to have their item carried inside and set up in a 10 minute process this was also comped later they needed it adjusted a 1 2 minute process not much more complicated than changing a futon from sofa to bed and back they needed a factory rep to come out and do it almost a 3 hour round trip in traffic this too was comped fucking twice this led to a sales increase of thousands of units of the company low end shitty chinese made product lines not because the celebrities were savvy consumers who chose a quality product from a company that offers a good value for the consumer dollar but because expensive shit was given to them for being celebrities which they still managed to behave as needy dumbfucks about at every step of the process the company has a team of people whose only job is to push the company product on social media one person gets paid to post on pinterest and one other 35 hours a week i am pretty wary of online fashion advice because of all the manipulation it a pit of blue pill tentacles everywhere you turn so what should a man do for clothes go out to clothing stores and see what is out there try things on see what actually looks good on you if you need fashion advice seek someone who is a professional haberdasher with your interests in mind not just a commissioned salesperson discerning the difference between a pro and a sales drone in any profession is an important life skill btw you will find clothes that look great on you and probably almost never encounter any of the celebrity worn clothes shown on pinterest in the process ,0,TheRedPill

MentORPHEUS,i agree her behavior was crappy all night but we have only what op wrote to work with regarding this particular situation it easy to sit and stroke your justice boner to a purple sheen while thinking of ways you would turn her out into the night with force and finality the trouble is these are male centric solutions that wo not have the desired effect on women and actually play to her advantage in the female social matrix i have actually lived through several variations of woman becomes insufferably cunty during car ride unless she becomes physically violent the best move is to stoically drop her off at home or wherever you would normally drop her off she wo not be able to dismiss you as the bad guy in the scenario so her hamster will spin like a femtosecond pulsar even if you do not want her back for yourself there a strong chance this event will help extinguish the bad behavior she was exhibiting that night the downsides of forcing her out of the car in public she will probably dig in and refuse to leave the vehicle if she did not initiate the use of force this places you in the position of doing so white knights will rush to the scene and presume she is innocent and you are the bad guy she might claim to the police that you used force upon her and left her in danger she will most definitely propagate the above story throughout her fsm it easy to rationalize herself as the innocent victim and you the bad guy she wo not make the connection that her bad behavior caused the situation she will conclude that you are a monster and it will actually justify and thereby reinforce her bad behavior which led up to the situation,15,TheRedPill

MentORPHEUS,i am going to leave this right here one hundred percent american there can be no question about the average american s americanism or his desire to preserve this precious heritage at all costs nevertheless some insidious foreign ideas have already wormed their way into his civilization without his realizing what was going on thus dawn finds the unsuspecting patriot garbed in pajamas a garment of east indian origin and lying in a bed built on a pattern which originated in either persia or asia minor he is muffled to the ears in un american materials cotton first domesticated in india linen domesticated in the near east wool from an animal native to asia minor or silk whose uses were first discovered by the chinese all these substances have been transformed into cloth by methods invented in southwestern asia if the weather is cold enough he may even be sleeping under an eiderdown quilt invented in scandinavia on awakening he glances at the clock a medieval european invention uses one potent latin word in abbreviated form rises in haste and goes to the bathroom here if he stops to think about it he must feel himself in the presence of a great american institution he will have heard stories of both the quality and frequency of foreign plumbing and will know that in no other country does the average man perform his ablutions in the midst of such splendor but the insidious foreign influence pursues him even here glass was invented by the ancient egyptians the use of glazed tiles for floors and walls in the near east porcelain in china and the art of enameling on metal by mediterranean artisans of the bronze age even his bathtub and toilet are but slightly modified copies of roman originals the only purely american contribution to tile ensemble is tile steam radiator against which our patriot very briefly and unintentionally places his posterior in this bathroom the american washes with soap invented by the ancient gauls next he cleans his teeth a subversive european practice which did not invade america until the latter part of the eighteenth century he then shaves a masochistic rite first developed by the heathen priests of ancient egypt and sumer the process is made less of a penance by the fact that his razor is of steel an iron carbon alloy discovered in either india or turkestan lastly he dries himself on a turkish towel returning to the bedroom the unconscious victim of un american practices removes his clothes from a chair invented in the near east and proceeds to dress he puts on close fitting tailored garments whose form derives from the skin clothing of the ancient nomads of the asiatic steppes and fastens them with buttons whose prototypes appeared in europe at the close of the scone age this costume is appropriate enough for outdoor exercise in a cold climate but is quite unsuited to american summers steam heated houses and pullmans nevertheless foreign ideas and habits hold the unfortunate man in thrall even when common sense tells him that the authentically american costume of gee string and moccasins would be far more comfortable he puts on his feet stiff coverings made from hide prepared by a process invented in ancient egypt and cut to a pattern which can be traced back to ancient greece and makes sure that they ire properly polished also a greek idea lastly he tics about his neck a strip of bright colored cloth which is a vestigial survival of the shoulder shawls worn by seventeenth century croats he gives himself a final appraisal in the mirror an old mediterranean invention and goes downstairs to breakfast here a whole new series of foreign things confronts him his food and drink are placed before him in pottery vessels the proper name of which china is sufficient evidence of their origin his fork is a medieval italian invention and his spoon a copy of a roman original he will usually begin the meal with coffee an abyssinian plant first discovered by the arabs the american is quite likely to need it to dispel the morning after effects of overindulgence in fermented drinks invented in the near east or distilled ones invented by the alchemists of medieval europe whereas the arabs took their coffee straight he will probably sweeten it with sugar discovered in india and dilute it with cream both the domestication of cattle and the technique of milking having originated in asia minor if our patriot is old fashioned enough to adhere to the so called american breakfast his coffee will be accompanied by an orange domesticated in the mediterranean region a cantaloupe domesticated in persia or grapes domesticated in asia minor he will follow this with a bowl of cereal made from grain domesticated in the near east and prepared by methods also invented there from this he will go on to waffles a scandinavian invention with plenty of butter originally a near eastern cosmetic as a side dish he may have the egg of a bird domesticated in southeastern asia or strips of the flesh of an animal domesticated in the same region which has been salted and smoked by a process invented in northern europe breakfast over he places upon his head a molded piece of felt invented by the nomads of eastern asia and if it looks like rain puts on outer shoes of rubber discovered by the ancient mexicans and takes an umbrella invented in india he then sprints for his train the train not sprinting being in english invention at the station he pauses for a moment to buy a newspaper paying for it with coins invented in ancient lydia once on board he settles back to inhale the fumes of a cigarette invented in mexico or a cigar invented in brazil meanwhile he reads the news of the day imprinted in characters invented by the ancient semites by a process invented in germany upon a material invented in china as he scans the latest editorial pointing out the dire results to our institutions of accepting foreign ideas he will not fail to thank a hebrew god in an indo european language that he is a one hundred percent decimal system invented by the greeks american from americus vespucci italian geographer ralph linton one hundred per cent american from the american mercury 1937 ,1,theredpillright

MentORPHEUS,this post strikes me as a curious mix of decent child rearing advice and the olden days were better bias fallacy many in the rp community seem to view the 1950s with a disingenuous halcyon aura this is foolish because we will never return to the conditions that existed at the time and there were many problems that made men and women chronically very unhappy the usa enjoyed manufacturing and economic hegemony due to much of the rest of the world being laid to waste during war earnings and expenses balanced so that a single income could support a comfortable middle class existence and stay at home mom during the 70s us productivity continued to rise but worker compensation which rose steadily with productivity before flatlined thanks to inflation even a majority of two income families cannot afford a house today the trend is toward this condition worsening social roles were rigid and ruthlessly enforced great if you naturally conformed to the mainstream or willing to put on the appearance of doing so but unremitting hell for everyone who did not or could not social class was much more stratified and mobility much less education and self improvement were little help if you found yourself in a lower stratum than you desired this was one reason for the popularity of west side story career mobility was much less possible even for the ambitious most men were worker bees in the eyes of the company being blacklisted in an entire industry was common and easy average men were unhappy tied to a job they hated nose to the grindstone tied to a woman that hated them no divorce or career options did not automatically make women good obedient happy wives average women were unhappy not everyone aspired to be a stay at home housewife but there was little choice addiction was a common coping mechanism this is the premise of the song mother little helper consumerism rose putting men on an earn spend treadmill to keep up with the joneses religion was de facto mandatory not only that one had to attend the right church or be shunned and ostracized affairs cheating hypergamy unwitting cuckoldry existed they were better hidden but do not fool yourself believing that even strong social controls kept the women in line in summary some problems exist today which were not salient in our retroactive understanding of the 1950s this does not mean that returning wholesale to 1950s norms values institutions and behaviors is desirable much less even possible indulging in a cargo cult understanding of the 1950s or whatever better times period your fantasy idealizes is an unproductive indulgence not an actionable plan for modern men it makes sense to draw lessons and carefully choose traditional practices and beliefs that work well but each must be rigorously chosen and properly implemented to work in today world and into the future past performance is no guarantee of future results ,2,theredpillright

MentORPHEUS,short answer no hypergamy becomes worse with economic inequality but that does not mean it gets better under socialism or communism there exists lots of actuarial data about sexual practices and mores in socialist communist countries and intentional communities and communes even in a commune situation where commitment is a given partner preferences still emerge and women tend to remain the gatekeepers of sex betas still bate ,1,theredpillright

MentORPHEUS, you are ignoring the fact that the women in the marriage model of the right are completely different than the women that the left has created we would not need a redpill if the left was not working around the clock to destroy the nuclear family you made two claims here the onus sits upon you to support them i am interested to hear your reasoning too onus probandi brother ,-1,theredpillright
MentORPHEUS,i am not amused by it i am concerned with seeing the world as it really is without bp biases because doing so is vitally important for the individual all the way up to society as a whole i do what i can to challenge assumptions and present facts as i see them some are more willing to challenge their own beliefs than others even within trp ,3,theredpillright
MentORPHEUS,i have always made the case that left right politics divides people who are really allies and symbiotes and amounts to a matrix game that serves masters other than ourselves it exploits the tribal nature of humans and gets them readily working against their own interests and for the interests of globalists and a club of elites we will never become a part of i cannot blame people for hating the most extreme leftists and sjws that exist however this results in people defaulting to support the gop then which becomes hugely problematic for any red pill man you are against marriage children religion and in favor of sex outside wedlock birth control and your third tier plate needs an abortion go tell it to your right wing church congregation and your local gop committee then come back and write us a field report about how woke your party is i am pretty amazed at all of the contradictory belief systems people maintain under a red pill banner ,5,theredpillright
MentORPHEUS, some of them even secretly crave the idea of big daddy government abusing them and helping their wives cuck them more efficiently they are masochists they get off being slaves to the state and women and they raise their children this way truly the scum of the earth i am not sure what audience you are writing for but this makes no objective sense and places you in the barking mad category show us a nation or even an intentional community that thrives with no government tell us how this is an improvement when governing a nation of 320 million people or a world of 7 billion tell us why you are not setting up shop somewhere like somalia where there is no pesky government standing in the way of your personal success this entire thread is an indulgence in poorly thought out fantasy writing like this makes the red pill an embarrassment something i have to think twice about sharing with thinking friends ,1,theredpillright

MentORPHEUS, in my view the establishment used to be right and over 50 years it has become hard left this is where the bias of your primary sources becomes apparent the overton window has shifted right over the last 25 years so much so that obama was to the right of nixon by many metrics patently ridiculous to consider him socialist or communist ,1,theredpillright

MentORPHEUS, well change left to sjw and right to responsible reasonable human being if you want the current ideological battle is between toxic feral marxist useful idiots suffering from excess femininity and vaguely normal real human beings hello confirmation bias i think the representations of gender metaphor has collapsed into ruin at this point left right in a more specifically defined dictionary definition is between conservativism and openness it has specific tie ins to the personality traits of openness on the left and consciencousness on the right sensible and i do not disagree but it really only works to tie people to political positions in vague metaphoric terms once you better understand the underlying motivations of the other side here you will discover that you are attacking not only your enemies but your allies and symbiotes with the same broad brush ,1,theredpillright
MentORPHEUS,that a good observation but left right politics is a non sequitur unless you are speaking metaphorically or at a high level of abstraction left right politics is a blue pill game that benefits masters who manipulate the tribal evolution of humans into making straw enemies of groups they have more in common with than differences this whole essay reads like our tribe good and masculine other tribe bad weak feminine i prefer discussing issues on their objective merits and drilling down to the underlying reasons things happen making certain they fit every other fact and observation i am aware of this essay makes no testable claims and cites no facts that why i consider it fit for an echo chamber audience ,1,theredpillright
MentORPHEUS, the point was men are more future oriented and women more immediate oriented out of biological necessity in how they approach child rearing if that was true then men would be the gatekeepers of sex immediate gratification and women would be the gatekeepers of commitment future orientation your premise flies in the face of one of the most basic red pill truths ,1,theredpillright
MentORPHEUS, at a base level left right political views can be seen as mother father or masculine feminine differences mothers care about the wellbeing of their children in the moment the baby is crying so they wish to soothe it ok you lost me already this explanation is satisfactory to a far right audience of people who do not really know anybody who is not also far right to everyone else it looks like a bad job of trying to make a half baked theory correlate to reality ,0,theredpillright

MentORPHEUS, the reason the estate tax exists the primary reason for the estate tax is to prevent a dynastic accumulation of wealth across generations accumulation and concentration of vast sums of wealth many multiples of what a person needs to live even a rich life from cradle to grave would subvert democracy and lead to oligarchy the estate tax is the reason we do not see rockefeller or kennedy on our money today keeping it in place will prevent our grandchildren from becoming serfs to emperor soros chancellor walton or premier koch one of the most legitimate complaints about the estate tax is when a property rich family must sell off assets like the family farm or store to pay the tax this might make a case for adjustments to the bottom end of the estate tax structure not to mention good estate planning but it is not a good reason to eliminate the estate tax entirely eliminating the estate tax entirely benefits nobody reading this subreddit advocating for removing it benefits only the most wealthy and burdens everyone here with higher tax obligations while setting the stage for oligarchy to replace democracy if you see an article advocating eliminating the tax completely follow the rabbit hole and see how far up it goes ,2,theredpillright
MentORPHEUS, testosterone is not a powerful drug do not split hairs with me pedantically this discussion covers all athletic enhancers some of which are powerful drugs you have never used gear yourself damn right i have not it a risk i chose not to take for myself as a younger man it may become an option eventually now that i am north of 50 your daft statist position you are not reading very carefully my position is closer to libertarian than you make it out to be but even if it was dangerous you still have no grounds to violate someone self ownership with your silly statist prohibition here is the crux of the issue i am not motivated by a desire to control others but by a desire to not have the freedoms of others intrude upon me if there was no chance of name risky thing becoming burdensome to others there no reason for the state to interfere and not only am i against this i have actively worked against such government policies all of my adult life i have observed this over and over and over through the decades the most strident anti government individualists will latch onto the public teat the instant they have a need they will defend this as their entitlement and still be against all forms of entitlement for everyone else this not an arbitrary and capricious nanny state is why we cannot have many nice things freely that why i said upthread if you are self indemnifying against the risks rather than externalizing them onto a risk pool of people who do not use supplements then yes go ahead and use them it does not work when people are able to privatize the gainz but socialize the risks and costs i do not wish serious consequences upon you to test whether you simply suffer whatever bad outcomes arise once your personal wealth becomes exhausted or you end up burdening the rest of society if someone starts supplementing a horomone as a productive young man and causes his body to stop producing it naturally what happens if he becomes unable to pay for his own ongoing trt for life if someone develops fast aggressive prostate cancer at 45 instead of slow progression with onset of symptoms at 70 how does treatment get paid for think of the potential downside of literally millions of people using every type of supplement out there without adequate medical knowledge and maintenance the potential for a multi decadal expensive as hell public health burden is tremendous are you accounting for this when proposing no restrictions on athletic enhancers of any kind i do not even know what you are doing on this sub since you clearly have a total disregard for individual liberty there are people here literally advocating for fascism for one thing i think you are behaving dramatic calling my position of make athletic enhancers more available than they currently are under a medically prioritized harm reduction policy as a total disregard ,1,theredpillright

MentORPHEUS, this forces them to have to sell assets in order to pay the estate taxes find out how in r shittyestateplanning this is an unfortunate circumstance and not the intent of the estate tax fixing this problem would involve adjustments to the bottom end of the estate tax but does not make a case for eliminating it entirely ,1,theredpillright

MentORPHEUS,my thoughts with decades of plate spinning experience this is a game of subtlety the most minimal found object works best making an obvious show of it is like walking around with obvious hickeys beyond middle school age this works great with low self esteem women but against you with high self esteem women excellent for prospects plates and newer relationships counterproductive in many cases with main ltr established plates when the novelty of you is used up excellent frame and dgaf attitude internalized abundance mentality are needed to pull this off well if you flash a beta tell when confronted however momentarily it will work against you when you are actually seeing multiple women these things will be left organically you will more likely find yourself strategically removing obvious easter eggs rather than placing subtle ones yourself by this stage of your plating game you wo not need tricks like this but it never ceases to amaze when it plays out before your eyes,5,TheRedPill
MentORPHEUS, the true basis for religion is not supernatural beliefs are you serious i do not think even religious people accept this definition the great mythological taboo which stands at the heart of western civilization itself the holocaust i can think of only two groups obsessed with the holocaust the left is not one of them the progressive solves this by inverting morality there is no unquestionable good but there is unquestionable evil an evil which cannot be challenged or deconstructed good and evil are abstract concepts that religion obsesses over you are projecting this religious bias onto nonreligious people this projection is systemic in your essay we must demythologize fascism as a unique event of absolute evil in the historical sense just questioning the causes or reasons for the rise of fascism is enough to delegitimize the mythological narrative of it being a completely irrational inexplicable purely genocidal event fascism defined as the state acting as the face of industry we can discuss it rationally all day it not a system i admire nor would want to live under if you think it is the onus is upon you to support that position openly not backhandedly by criticizing the other tribe for standing against it do not fear the left when you fear the progressive religion and bow before it you cuck yourself before it who the hell does that show some specific examples ,4,theredpillright
MentORPHEUS, you gloss over growing teenage girls being on birth control that we know causes adverse long term effects but focus on steroid usage well yeah this is a thread about athletic enhancers so of course i am focused on those i agree that horomonal birth control is also full of its own suite of risks and hazards bringing this up does nothing to further the cause of athletic enhancers testosterone usage done properly is actually a net health benefit i agree with this statement and for the last time i believe testosterone should become more available than it is today you are arguing against a position i am not taking what i am saying is that powerful drugs like this done properly involve specialized knowledge and often regular lab testing and interpretation so making them as legal as tic tacs is not a practical or realistic legislative goal ,1,theredpillright

MentORPHEUS, tax everybody including the poor the rich and the middle class exactly the same a flat x of their income flat tax is a better idea than the current encyclopedia sized tax code i would be on board with it but the proposal never gets anywhere legislatively might be worth its own thread but this is about the estate tax which is under current consideration ,2,theredpillright
MentORPHEUS, the idea of estate tax is simply so that the government gets a piece when money changes hands no try again the government gave the wealthy and savvy people a bunch of work arounds so they do not have to pay anyway something that needs to be reformed because nobody actually wants their rich citizens moving their piles of money and property to other countries right they should just fuck off to other countries if that what they think of the usa getting rich within our infrastructure economy and society then spiriting the proceeds away untaxed is tantamount to economic treason or to coin a rp based phrase economic hypergamy i am surprised that strong nationalists are on board with this ,3,theredpillright
MentORPHEUS, get rid of it and tax it as income to the recipient this overlooks the underlying reason for having an estate tax avoid a shit ton of paperwork the estate tax is one of the simplest aspects of tax code match the net estate value to a table i want a consolidated tax structure anyway though i am totally on board with this the estate tax still has a place in a simplified tax code however ,1,theredpillright
MentORPHEUS, birth control pills manipulate hormones far more than plenty of steroids like anavar primobolan winstrol non sequitur it another opportunity for you to grandstand your statist ideas read carefully i am advocating that performance enhancing drugs become more available than they are now let each become available according to the individual characteristics some may be safe enough to be sold otc certainly you agree that some are too dangerous for lay people to take without regular lab tests now about grandstanding your libertopian ideas are you saying our society would be better off descheduling all pharmaceuticals and making them available on request ,1,theredpillright
MentORPHEUS, i personally feel trepidation based on some anecdotes quote the part where my feelings were introduced into the discussion that an appeal to emotion the realm of women and not up to your usual sterling quality of logic and argumentation blanket condemnation of all pharmaceutical use do not go there we cannot prove it safe quote the part where i said this too pls if you think i am a prohibitionist boy have you ever got it wrong read again carefully i am saying performance enhancing drugs should not remain illegal to people who are not competitive athletes i am also saying that some of them are potentially dangerous and belong in the same category as other drugs too potent to be available over the counter ,1,theredpillright

MentORPHEUS, manipulating one horomone has effects on the others people who are just taking supplements without adequate knowledge and or guidance from a professional and regular lab tests to watch for problems and titrate the dosage protocol are asking for serious trouble which just stopping can make worse in the short term do not believe me ask an endocrinologist steroid use was really big in the 90s around los angeles you could witness big men having temper tantrums in public firsthand it was so common that this became a staple of comedy routines for a time ,2,theredpillright

MentORPHEUS, it dangerous to casually manipulate the endocrine systems it usually results in long term harm and can precipitate a health crisis roid rage is a real thing and people in the midst of it fail to keep their problem from affecting innocent others costs of this risky behavior pretty much always become externalized onto others when they run into negative results but do not pay 100 pennies of every dollar mitigating them costs hospital visits chronic illness later in life employment reduction or loss if society could divorce itself 100 from these it would be much easier to adopt a policy of sure knock yourself out people want their freedom to do whatever they want while it is benefiting them personally but when they reach the downside do they voluntarily crawl into a hole and die without burdening others or do they pull from risk pools paid into by others who choose not to take potentially expensive risks perhaps it would be better to wish for requirements to be relaxed about supplements being more available through doctors under a protocol of monitoring endocrine function through regular checkups and tests and within a separate and resultingly much more expensive risk pool just turning steroids loose on the general population sounds like a recipe for disaster ,9,theredpillright

MentORPHEUS,excellent post about ignoring the stigma of aggression and harnessing its power where appropriate this is one area where positive standards and role models of masculinity are lacking i disagree strongly with this part however modern day sociology makes the distinction between assertiveness and aggression which i think is equally fallacious assertiveness seems to be this sanitized pc version of aggression where you pretend you are willing to face opposition but in reality wo not really do anything substantial in case there is in fact opposition assertiveness is pc garbage assertiveness is not a toothless substitute or watered down version of aggression in fact it can be seen as a special case of aggression most useful in long game applications i wrote a detailed article about assertiveness http archive is uc6ap that clarifies the differences and applications of assertiveness versus aggression there are many life scenarios where assertiveness is a better tool than aggression before a legitimate authority figure like a cop who has just pulled you over a judge your boss some circumstances of negotiation particularly longer negotiating processes or where you are involved with the other parties ongoing some circumstances of seduction assertiveness is much less likely to induce buyer remorse and false rape hamstering than aggression resolving problems as a customer where a rule or policy may need bending people in customer facing positions face abuse all day every day aggressive demanding jerks find stone walls at every turn those who behave with civility are gladly helped through obstacles and sometimes given perks or upgrades without even asking the key distinction assertiveness takes the interests of all parties into account and seeks win win outcomes aggression tends to consider the aggressive party interest only and pushes for win lose outcomes there are legitimate applications of passivity assertiveness and aggression for even top males passive aggression is usually a bitch move and is a behavior worth avoiding ,5,TheRedPill

MentORPHEUS,in the united states the current birthrate is artificially high because of welfare not only making possible but incentivizing single motherhood and having more children one cannot afford millennials who are smart enough to plan families are choosing to postpone or forego having children the trend is toward this phenomenon increasing and the driver of it is economic uncertainty for the future of an overpopulated world lacking economic opportunities increasing our birthrate will exacerbate the underlying conditions driving this trend this is why i see the alternative of reducing overall world reproduction as a better alternative by better i mean economically and ecologically sustainable and requiring less public assistance and government involvement in private lives while addressing the being outbred concerns of nationalists ,1,theredpillright
MentORPHEUS, also native populations in most white countries are not stable they are shrinking nationalists are the only ones who care which brings us right back to my question why not work to reduce the birthrate elsewhere instead of increasing our own birthrate to third world standards lower birthrates are a natural result of economic prosperity and help further it dynamically why would you want to force a reversal of this ,1,theredpillright

you are already off to a bad start it seems in reality most gay men will have little to do with the family losing themselves in an endless sea of cock and stds these men are not passing their genes on and are sacrificing skilled employment to live a degenerate lifestyle do you really know any actual gay people i live in los angeles one of the places gay people flee to from communities of people like you gay people have been out of the closet and in higher concentrations than much of america here for decades now my opinions are informed by actually living among and interacting regularly with gay people here are my rebuttals to the case against homosexuality the ratio of gay to straight people is not changing even within the local artificially high concentration of gay people in la there is not a sense of they are taking over i would say we actually reached peak faggot at least 5 years ago it become completely pass and unspecial to have come out as gay gayness appears to be expanding in much of the rest of the country when what is really happening is the steady percentage of gay people in the population no longer feel socially obligated to hide their identity in less than a generation your area will have passed peak faggot and it wo not seem like a palpably expanding force taking over just another aspect of humanity however unlike yourself the people you see acting crazy in pride parades do not represent day to day gay life you are seeing mostly people coming out in public for the first time after a lifetime of publicly denying a central aspect of themselves most of them mellow out eventually the few that do not are the social equivalent of the 40 something stuck in an early 20s crude pua rut gay people do not universally support each other as team gay they judge others along the same lines as straight people do nellie boys are disliked the same as female drama queens drag queens are sometimes considered mere attention whores prancy lispy extroverts are looked down on for annoyance and perpetuating an unpleasant stereotype bears are disrespected not for being gay but for being out of shape the same way straight fat lazy betas are disrespected by alphas on trp those who are overly sexualized or would hit on someone in an established couple are not invited back to couples parties and shunned socially by many the same human foibles that dog heterosexual relationships affect same sex couples women tend to couple up quickly fight dirty break up bitterly men are promiscuous as hell when young both genders tend to pair off into more stable long term monogamous relationships later in life gay couples engage in the same amount or less of pda as straight couples in an environment where they are free to do so the ratio of those who engage in too much pda versus those who tell them get a room works out the same as in straight populations gay couples throw excellent parties which notably often see a majority of straight couples in attendance lots of people in these friend groups are professionals in the entertainment industry halloween parties are the greatest gay couples make excellent doting adoptive parents their kids tend to grow up adjusted better than average with the same distribution of gay straight as the general population the notion of gay parents indoctrinating their kids to become gay becomes ridiculous when you see the reality

your own life masculinity or the marriages of straight couples in reality ask yourself how can one mock sjws for triggering and justify the same behavior about this topic way too many jimmies rustled by the existence of gay people around here besides the argument of muh freedoms i have never seen a coherent argument that shows homosexual acceptance benefiting the greater american culture how about this removing the stigma of gayness proves through actual experience that gayness is not a controlling variable as to whether an individual is a productive member of society and that gay peoples human strengths and foibles fall along the same distribution curves as straight peoples in fact despite having more freedom and acceptance than ever they seem to be increasingly uppity at everyone who even just finds it uncomfortable seeing two dudes kissing these are the death throes of institutionalized homophobia and a perfect example of to those who have lived with privilege equality feels like oppression when left to their own devices their outfits will be sexualized their language will be sexualized and their music will be sexualized do you fail to see how heterosexual culture is universally and openly as you describe already as a fish cannot see the water it lives within gay couples being allowed to do the exact same things as straight couples does nothing to harm straight couples there are no actual instances of anyone oppressing straight people while allowing gay people more leniency regarding public sexuality you are making that up in your own head

MentORPHEUS,before wwii certain implementations of socialism and communism were not only considered legitimate forms of social order but were downright fashionable in some circles in the united states the 1929 stock market crash and great depression of the 1930s did nothing to enamor the average american of capitalism and entire communities and regions operated with elements of socialism such as soup kitchens alms for the poor shantytowns and poorhouses and hybrid market socialist economies involving scrip barter and often generous asymmetry the united states with its two party winner takes all system on paper stood against socialism and communism but in practice contain elements of each our economic and cultural hegemony after the war made the american way the most noticeable cultural bellweather european political systems are usually more parliamentary giving proportionate power to different factions of society this system allows them to openly consider issues case by case instead of a binary choice every 4 years it also makes it obvious that certain socialist ideas are actually the best answer to particular social needs i think this is why europeans are more warm to socialist ideas because the word is not used simply as a pejorative like in the us i also find this image of graffiti in a french university most likely of college students showing sympathy to marx himself the picture looks almost old enough to have been exposed by daguerre himself it actually from 1968 during student occupations at the school you can clearly see that the word marx was laboriously cleaned off once then hastily rewritten by a different person this tells me that despite the student revolt zeitgeist of the late 60s support for marx was considered radical and not mainstream nor the official position of the school most of the world recognizes pure marxist ideas flawed and inferior to capitalist ones consider the gross inefficiency of soviet era industries and the low productivity of chinese farmers paid equally regardless of output while there exist a certain number of modern communist or socialist purists they represent a minority in america socialism sounds appealing to college students between full parental care and workaday reality but seldom survives the transition to full time working for a living communism is a shitty system for groups larger than dunbar number and even then is vulnerable to the same human forces that dog pure capitalism primarily selfishness greed and avarice the short lived hippie communes of the early 70s were ample proof of this pure marxism is functionally dead in today political climate a lot of people you hear spouting marxist platitudes and wearing che guevara shirts and possibly stupid berets are mostly not politically savvy well read and aware the fact that young people today call pretentious rich things boojie on social media is proof to me they have never once read the word bourgeouisie much less studied marxism seriously i cannot blame them marx is so dry and boring i have never been able to read more than a page or so such deliberate free association and even revering nature of the far left is tolerated but the far right is not speaking of europe again the left is more a power to the people position as opposed to the right meaning centralized authoritarian government can you think of a reason why europeans retain a certain healthy distaste is there something else that the general public is not being told in schools just as an optimal sexual strategy for a healthy long term relationship is not pure alpha or beta but rather a healthy mixture of traits neither is the best long term strategy for running a country pure capitalism or socialism but elements of each ,3,theredpillright

MentORPHEUS, i do not agree that capitalism depends on exploiting the poor or endless population growth i love capitalism but am realistic about how pure laissez faire capitalism runs amok privatizing the gains and externalizing the costs everywhere possible i wish this was so also but as you pointed out similarly those people producing iphones and nike shoes probably have 10 other people desperate for their jobs to support their families only the desperate work in such appalling conditions for such dirt pay tell us how apple would be profitable and iphones nikes popular if they were made using first world workers factories and wages it just happens that modern western governments use mass immigration to pad their economic growth forecasts oh no it does not just happen mass immigration is baked into modern economic systems deeply that is one elephant i am trying to point out in our face the real room here industry and government collude to tacitly allow immigration for cheap labor while feeding us a big shuck and jive about our country and borders and lay the blame at the feet of the immigrants themselves from mexicans and h1b workers in america to moroccans in france to middle easterners in sweden some try to blame the women and cucked men of the countries in question for the problems of immigration but ignore the fact that they are the product of economic motivations of big businesses if only they would be good little slaves and disappear invisibly into the woodwork when they are not at their jobs at the expense of living standards and creating an enormous welfare bubble the welfare bubble is a very recent innovation humans have always migrated for the hope of better conditions even when it was sink or swim i am looking for long term sustainable ways to keep our economy healthy and workers fairly compensated as foreign labor becomes more difficult to exploit we see pressures to remove benefits and push down wages for american workers economic growth requires economic freedom that all freedom to work and produce freedom to spend what you earn without taxation these are not the words of startups and small businesses such as you and i own or work in these are the sentiments of big business interests who would like to use the infrastructure of the united states for their own economic benefit but give back absolutely nothing toward said infrastructure wal mart is one of the more egregious examples of this phenomenon do not be a useful idiot for the likes of them this is one of the engines of third worldization of the united states and definitely not sustainable ,1,theredpillright

MentORPHEUS, our problem here is not that we do not know how to build a fence it that we do not know how to convince enough people that one needs to be built the crux of the problem right here so many people default to religion for social and spiritual guidance and wo not consider other avenues we as a society lack a sense of identity and thus a sense of self preservation what do you propose we do in that respect because that comes before not after building a fence the question becomes what can we as red pill right offer as a replacement or streamlining of the interface between religion and government any ideas james rational realism seems to be an impossible sell to the hoi polloi i know what works for me as a lifelong atheist but have come to difficulty getting religious people to think outside of that particular box and meet me even 1 10th of the way so to speak ,1,theredpillright
MentORPHEUS, originally posted by g petroneus as i predicted the discussion has become hugely chaotic already with several different topics mashed into a single discussion thread let simplify and focus a little you will forgive me if i say that i do not find your answer very enlightening because your approach to the question of religion is to bring the debate to a terrain you know well and would efeat religion on it you insist on setting up a religion vs science confrontation and showing that science is superior in providing answers to scientific questions that true but at the same time not very insightful not only do we know that already but it also not relevant to the modern world people do not turn to religion for scientific answers anymore the fringe nutjobs who insist on doing so are societally irrelevant so i suggest ignoring them what i did find interesting in your answer was your example of going on the internet for solutions i would say that touches upon the crux of the question you seem to be of the fundamental underlying belief that people problems are mostly circumscribed to the rational sphere the problem for you is finding the rational solution and once you have it you need only implement it but i would counter that that model is not realistic most people fail at implementing rational solutions to their problems even when they know what they are so evidently there is something extra that lacking a sense of purpose a potentially irrational source of motivation here the crux of the problem i want to put forward can people be motivated into taking correct desirable action via purely rational argument i do not think they can and if that true what kind of irrational mechanism works instead if any ,1,theredpillright

MentORPHEUS, originally posted by g petronius i think at this stage asking what a potential trp movement stands for is putting the cart before the horses analysis of issues from a rp standpoint should come before a deduction of rp policy ideological positions for now the only constant of rp thought is truth is truth regardless of your feelings if something offends you or is morally objectionable or whatever other upsetting connotation if it true then it true however policy discussion can still be useful as even if we do not already have our analysis down the discussion itself can help hash out that analysis but there are too many different items on the menu here each one of which would require multi thread discussions to make some little progress so i will just pick one that i suspect most of reddit is uncomfortable discussing religion in my view an rp understanding of religion must be wary of falling in line with cheap edgy atheism aka lol religion is dumb that is the current dominant view among the demographic of trp users which means we risk being blinded by natural human tendency to align with one peer group here in brief my position religion is a ubiquitous human phenomenon religious behaviour has been present in humans before anatomically modern homo sapiens emerged consequently it must hearken back to some fundamental constant of human nature whatever that might be additionally religion has an undeniable cultural and social role providing in an extremely large number of cases the fundamental social glue and even the defining element of soci cultural identity this role can not be discounted no matter how dumb one finds religion to be in an epistemological sense as of right now the west is bereft of a sense of identity which is largely being replaced by cheap and easily replaced cultural and political slogans prepared and propagandized by professional political and corporate machineries that loss of identity weakens the west and leaves it open to exploitation by cultures with a stronger sense of identity in this sense it works nearly identical to frame in social interactions religion might be a fundamental component in potentially restoring a sense of identity to the west and consequently its ability to define its own goals and defend its own boundaries,3,theredpillright

MentORPHEUS,exactly and wal mart is one of the greatest examples of privatizing the gains while subsidizing the costs onto taxpayers this is not capitalism it a rigged system to favor the economic elite useful idiots do their work for them by advocating against the minimum wage and blaming it on the liberals it propaganda follow the rabbit hole and see if you find actors and actresses at the end in real life ,3,theredpillright
MentORPHEUS, then do not argue from emotion quote the part where i argued from emotion you introduced the topic of emotion to this discussion i asked if anyone can name a liberal or cite one saying these things fine they are all equally wrong want to pick a different sample you dodged the point and changed the subject right after saying glad to see you dodged the point i gave you 80 000 000 liberals and you cannot quote one saying the things you claimed they say genuinely i do not mean to devolve to ad hominem but you have given nothing but support for the liberal point of view this is not the comments section of a fox or breitbart article if you are going to advocate against minimum wage laws bring your facts and figures to the discussion you are showing your partisan us vs them mentality if you run out of words beyond the standard talking points you certainly implied that 40 hours of work should produce a livable wage are you standing by that i am people who identify with the right simultaneously decry things like subsidized housing food and medicine yet advocate people who work full time not earn a living in the united states the gop represents big even globalist interests and turns its back on the american worker the red pill right is an emerging system are we going to double down on the gop ongoing efforts to drive down wages for the american worker while blaming the liberals for their plight or are we going to move forward with a sustainable system where people who work full time in our country can afford the basic necessities of life ,2,theredpillright
MentORPHEUS, i apologise for my crude generalisation no need to become apologetic to me about this civil discussions are a great way to understand the complex world better than we can on our own liberal elite celebrities who either patronise the public like lena dunham or look upon and lecture the public like meryl streep george clooney ashley judd etc celebrities get a disproportionate voice in the media because people unreasonably idolize them and they draw eyeballs worth big bucks to media companies however rich outspoken celebrities make up perhaps 0 00001 of the liberal population and they are not usually well educated in politics or history despite this certain people treat their word as gospel and keep electing them to high positions as if qualified i am looking at you scwarzenegger i am drawing on my experience having grown up in these communities and having been politically active within them i have too grew up in los angeles and harbor no illusions or magical feelings toward entertainment industry workers nor surprise at the difference between their public pronouncements and image versus the way many behave toward common folk they encounter in shops and restaurants etc the liberal media elite make a conspicuous target for pundits but they do not represent the vast majority of those who identify as other than right ,1,theredpillright
MentORPHEUS, so it seems this is an emotionally charged issue that the way feminists and sjws shut down arguments without addressing them good show brother listen to them talk about the poor they are helpless and uneducated they cannot survive without handouts these are vague platitudes i asked if anyone can name a liberal or cite one saying these things not just make up unattributed sentences for a straw man fantasy you have at least 80 000 000 americans who identify as liberal to choose from here the minimum wage is the single barrier preventing low skilled workers from entering the workforce no it is a floor for working people in america funny the way right wingers claim to hate elites and globalists when it comes to working with other countries but when it involves the private gain of owner class americans it becomes laudable you are proposing that american workers compete at global wage levels or their jobs be sent overseas for third world labor to benefit only the very right wing elite company owners should i be able to lick dirt and make a living wage if i do it for 40 hours what about 60 hours why not raise the minimum wage to 50 and hour and everyone can have nice cars and big houses you are indulging in hyperbole now not engaging the topic with the gravitas it deserves do you employ people i do ,2,theredpillright
MentORPHEUS,is this essay against liberals or elites it seems to be using the terms interchangeably a mark not of objectivity but propaganda what are the non liberal elites doing in the meantime liberals despise the poor this is going to be a really really hard position to defend the vast majority of liberals built their worldview by being poor themselves at some point in life and or direct experience with the lower economic quintiles the wealthier and more successful people become the more likely they are to switch to a conservative point of view look at the stereotype of young hippie turned middle aged yuppie liberal contempt for the poor sees them believe the poor to be too stupid for their own good can you cite examples and name any names of liberals expressing contempt for the poor coax these filthy stupids into voting dem disenfranchised enough to keep voting democrat again do you have any direct experience with welfare and minimum wage earning populations i have worked over 25 years in blue collar neighborhoods and voted in the polling places there as well if you think these populations are even political much less a reliable voting bloc you are imagining things you do not see the destitute the welfare collectors and except in time synchronized bursts the minimum wage earners in their fast food or warehouse uniforms in the polling places on election day it mostly retirees management level employed and above and churchy looking housewives every election i have been through over the decades there are no busloads of suspicious voters no lines of welfare collectors clutching sample ballots and absolutely nobody in the greater hood being paid or incentivized to vote why the animosity toward the minimum wage anyway who does the argument against serve anyway you as it stands inflation has made the current minimum wage amount to below the poverty line in most regions does it make sense to you that a person working full time 40 hours a week earns less than the basic cost of living my business serves a higher end niche my customers are not minimum wage earners however many of my customers customers are so when food and housing costs a large and growing segment of the workforce more than their paycheck every month it affects my bottom line and the other small businesses in the community according to members of our local merchants group follow the money who directly benefits financially in the long term from a frozen or eliminated minimum wage mostly large scale employers a demographic not known for its liberal voting patterns ,5,theredpillright

MentORPHEUS, you are seriously asking if a one line remark is a major pillar of the article come on the author cited a trend in dance music of 25 years ago as part of the post cold war globalist zeitgeist my point is that a red herring given the way european dance music has evolved and it does not tie the rest of his article together those who are skeptical find this damages the overall credibility of the essay those who are inclined to agree with his sentiment will hand wave the point away without critical examination if this point is relevant to his case there must be a simple explanation available the article is arguing as a secondary point that the western cosmopolitan elites have developed a level of contempt for the lower classes and he failed to make a clear case which elites and what exactly is best explained as a new contempt for the lower classes i have read through the damn thing 4 times now and still do not agree with his conclusions or even see how several parts of the article fit together as a coherent whole ,1,theredpillright
MentORPHEUS, you are reading way too much into an off hand observation that my exact point about what the author writes about eurodance music is it one of the major pillars of his essay or an offhand remark to be dismissed when it does not function as a dog whistle which was coincidentally introduced after trump election even if this tagline change is a direct response to trump election it a pitch to bring in and retain readers in standard newspaper language what is this guy talking about the attitude of the upper classes towards the uppity non globalist lower classes there contempt all around a trend that is only growing because of specialized media outlets that pander to niche markets reassuring each that they are correct and all others are not only factually but morally wrong understanding the motivations and mechanisms behind a very politically and socially prominent behaviour that is peculiar of our age i disagree with the author analysis for reasons given ,1,theredpillright
MentORPHEUS,did anyone else have a tough time following his stilted writing it seems like a mashup of 3 or 4 different rants in the 1990s the transnational european union was born alongside a russo american honeymoon and a south american opening of markets even club music insisted that borders were pass eurodance a genre that topped global charts featured a caribbean male rapper paired with a european female vocalist in practically every group reggae was popular in the 90s and found its way into everything including eurodance which was characterized by assertive rappers and wailing divas not necessarily caribbean ones europe dance music taste has since evolved toward electro swing which samples the sounds of american music from what could be considered the last glory days of patriarchal life how does this fit with the author insinuation that music is a tool for the progression of some liberal master plan if the washington post s new slogan democracy dies in darkness is anything to go by confident transnationalism is no longer the trajectory in 2017 this heavy breathing pronouncement more appropriate in a punk rock song than on the masthead of a national paper is a clear rebuke to the trumps and brexits of the world it seems odd that a 140 year old newspaper would choose a slogan based on an election cycle or it could just be the journalistic ethos of shining light into darkness and holding elected officials and others accountable the exact kind of role an objective news organization pursues and the very calling which draws most people to the reporting field why else do you think so many newspapers chose names like sun star beacon and mirror perhaps such a master student relationship is the best that the humble can hope for everything else so far has been naked contempt everything is naked contempt what is this guy talking about does anyone even read this far in the article much less try to fit it together with the rest of the writing status signalling is something all human beings do so also do animals and even plants this article is itself status signalling some signals the author does not like but does not come to a useful point what is the useful or actionable takeaway here ,1,theredpillright
MentORPHEUS,lots of great advice in this thread already i echo those who point out that you are apparently expecting women to approach and offer iois the way men are supposed to when i was young i was socially awkward and also had a hard time reading iois and following up on them with action initiated by me this is the lot of men we must look for ambiguous cues of interest and take the initiative to approach risking rejection this is how the game works do work on your in person flirting skills but here another direction make better use of online dating if you are good looking that is half the battle online you can get to chatting by text and build interest so by the time you meet face to face it no longer a cold approach once you have gotten some relationship experience this way you will find your in person game improves greatly partially through sheer dint of experience and partially because your mindset will have evolved more toward abundance mentality which will totally change the way you project yourself in person your looks probably are not the problem get out of your head and on some actual dates experience and the improved mindset this brings are where your gains will be made good luck friend ,1,asktrp

MentORPHEUS, the media are in the business of getting as many viewers and listeners as possible this is their prime directive only a fool expects objectivity from any given station or outlet i got sick of this crap and killed my tv way back in the 90s over it i do not see the point of this post honestly the va has been shamefully underfunded and undermaintained for decades stories are run about it periodicallly but like most other things going on in the world it not going to dominate every news cycle 24 7 365 forever even if it did this would be counterproductive as it would quickly oversaturate everyone attention span if you are annoyed that humans just love a story about someone standing on a white house couch like a boor what is the point of being angry with the media for selling what their stupid customers want if treatment of veterans is a bona fide concern let look at the entire big picture going back at least 25 years we can make it 40 or more if anyone wants to really drill down look at the annual funding the voting records the testimony at the hearings the filibusters blockades irrelevant riders and pork attached to va legislation look at our military industrial complex the redundancy and blatant waste in costly systems and poorly managed equipment there always seems to be money for look at the no bid contractors who keep getting lucrative contracts yet deliver shitty work that actually kills soldiers look at the wars that america has engaged since wwii how many of these protected our homeland versus specifically the economic interests of the elite look at our foreign policy cucking entire countries for decades to exploit their resources building deep anti american resentments that we readily accept alternate explanations for like they hate us because of our freedom talk about fake news what about those weapons of mass destruction yellowcake uranium ben tillman look at the way soldiers are treated their whole life through much like anti abortionists who love the fetus and toil to make sure every unwanted zygote comes to term but turn their back on the human once born our country is great at paying lip service to our troops during the jingoistic phases before and during wars but like briffault law ignores and discards them after their period of utility has run its course never mind the couch i call your attention to the way the media helped create hundreds of thousands of needy veterans with propaganda and the citizens readily lapped it up look at the millions of americans whose only contribution was to slap a yellow ribbon or support our troops sticker on their car but have done fuck all to actually support a single soldier ever whether directly or through careful choosing of representatives who make the decisions about how and where to allocate our country budget look at the treatment of cindy sheehan whose question to the president was why did my son have to die how do we justify this cost and was vilified as a traitor look at the treatment of the dixie chicks who were right it turns out look at the treatment of the french who were also right in this case but were vilified in the media and popular culture so extremely that french mustard ran full page ads around the country pointing out that they are an american company the citizens of our country are very eager to send stranger youth to war and gladly consume stories about soldiers then but readily disregard them afterward when it not at the top of the news cycle because now they are not glorious proxy heroes for ourselves but broken humans with costly problems and limited future potential that we would prefer to just forget about the media and the public are symbiotically responsible for allowing this state of affairs to exist the media are whores for any story that glues eyeballs to them while their advertisers are counting this is a given ultimately we the citizens are responsible for behaving as savvy media consumers and choosing important stories and issues to attend to over puff pieces ragebait over a couch dominating a particular day news cycle does not help the troops the media or the reality of the idiocratic general public this type of red herring is typical of the worst years of fox news but i see no utility in indulging it here ,3,theredpillright

MentORPHEUS, imo a lot of this comes right down to women getting the vote throughout history every time that happened it was only a matter of time until that culture was destroyed in some manner you have given absolutely no argument for ending suffrage but the classic post hoc fallacy extraordinary proposals require extraordinarily convincing arguments ending suffrage is absolutely a political non starter this line of reasoning is doa as written people who propose this seem to ignore how much technology and agriculture have forever changed conditions away from the way they were pre suffrage and are as silent on how this would actually work as they are bold in asserting this one change is needed to fix modern problems they have brought in millions of people from cultures that are incompatible with western values and it creating cultural creep throughout the host nations many of the underlying causes are a lack of economic opportunity and barriers to integration into the new host society even by individuals who desperately want to integrate and live productive lives look at the areas of britain where tensions are highest with immigrant populations citizen unemployment runs 25 30 even without the migrants this fuels resentment and perceived competition for resources that keeps established and new citizens from mingling even casually causing social barriers to integration in these areas with migrant unemployment above 50 is it any sociological surprise that integration does not happen smoothly in france the situation is further engrained due to the colonial history in africa there are 4th generation immigrants who are socially and economically discriminated against look at the muslim populations in america for contrast they have economic and social opportunities to integrate into mainstream society good community social and economic safety nets and a real chance to live peacefully and successfully among people of differing religions and cultures they are given a legitimate stake in their own place in our society and it results in good citizens willing to self police their own subculture and report bad apples to law enforcement when there exist bona fide opportunities to integrate into society muslims do not dilute western culture western culture dilutes extreme islam like the broken windows theory of crime blaming immigration problems on women suffrage addresses symptoms but is fundamentally wrong about the underlying causes of the problems resulting in dangerously wrong solutions being proposed even if women lost the right to vote today how does this proposal address the fact that men also tend to be woefully politically woefully misinformed uneducated and subject to outside manipulation and poorly equipped to understand and combat their own internal biases and fallacious thought processes ,2,theredpillright

subject of climate change everyone in the scientific community knew his ideas were wrong and why at the time in the case of anthropogenic global warming agw there is a near total consensus among scientists that agw is happening and the long term effects will be serious the next time this happened was in the mid 70s when the mcgovern committee was formed to decide what the us government should recommend people eat snip research into trans fats and got no government grants to do so because her research contradicted what government bureaucrats were saying another red herring with regards to climate change how many of your paragraphs are going to amount to verbose disinformation tactics https www reddit com r theredpillright comments 5sjazs common disinformation tactics i will be making a mr scientist spoiler all and because the recommendations basically meant the destruction of modern society they made it really scary this is how the fossil fuel industry spins it the earlier we address climate change and shift to carbon neutral technologies the less disruption to daily life mitigations to agw will require it not about abandoning technology and going back to the caveman days it about advancing technology thus getting beyond 19th century energy sources and methods the trouble is those predictions have proved very wrong and get more wrong with every year which predictions have proved very wrong and get more wrong every year the average temperature is rising steadily over the decades and more importantly the rate of increase is increasing they would even try stories like tipping point which relied on people ignorance educated and aware people recognize this as a reference to positive feedback loops most people are not aware that we are in fact in an ice age defined by the presence of permanent ice caps and these ice caps and glaciers of our planet are in the process of rapidly shrinking away eons of accumulation within one human lifetime 10 000 year old animals and humans keep thawing out of them worldwide during the last 30 years the northwest passage has become ice free in summer funny you should use this to support your anti agw position at a time when an iceberg bigger than delaware is breaking off the larsen ice shelf co2 is not high either it has been many times higher in the past eg in the devonian another red herring i am beginning to discern a pattern in your post here co2 has risen probably faster and farther in so short a time than ever since the industrial revolution got a full head of steam co2 rise normally lags the temperature spikes in earth history the result of positive feedback processes that sustain warm periods if you listen to the popular press and activists like hansen you would think that both are higher than they have ever been but it is far from that if you get your science from the enquirer or other lay source maybe reputable publications are quite clear about what is happening with co2 and the climate implications of this the amount of fudging of the data is simply unacceptable in a true science even if you accept that air temperature records are hopelessly corrupted every available temperature marker and proxy corroborates the corrupted air temperature data so this does not disprove agw at all true scientists who understand the reasons and methodology of what you are calling fudging the data do not consider the data corrupt the climate has always changed and always will well there a solid scientific argument this is the first time it changed because of human activity and we are not guessing we are measuring the gas concentrations and temperature effects the big worry is when exactly the next glaciation period begins because we do not know what causes the change eg the younger dryas and by past periods it is due around now argument from ignorance we do not know from having lived then and witnessed it firsthand but there are robust theories explaining glaciation and events like the younger dryas mainly milankovich cycles and the collapse of the north american ice sheet the scientists have no idea what they are talking about trope is popular among religious and uneducated people but how do you start out claiming to be a scientist and say this there is no sign of the positive feedback loop that the models are based on yes there is two of the big engines of positive feedback are well understood even do you even know what these are whether or not you believe they are significant to the case the other thing to keep in mind is that co2 levels had become dangerously low another red herring sawagurumi nobody but nobody is arguing that co2 is or was dangerously low during modern human history or that it would become so if humans were not extracting and burning in 100 years what took millions to sequester the last time this happened was during the glacial maximum of 18 000 years ago and obviously the humans of the time had food enough to survive and reproduce the issue at hand today is co2 levels are higher than they have been in over 800 000 years http www climatecentral org news the last time co2 was this high humans didnt exist 15938 and rising at an unprecedented rate we were fortunate to develop industrialization when we did to bring some of it back into the atmosphere and the result has been increasing crop yields and general greening which increases biomass if we are lucky our output may stave off the next stadial for a few hundred years nobody disagrees that higher co2 levels increase plant yields these gains would be somewhat offset by 80 of the arable and populated land on the planet being beneath salt water in 100 years good day sir ,1,theredpillright

MentORPHEUS,as i detailed upthread traveling to another country with money earned in the usa market is classic economic arbitrage the idea of sexual marketplace arbitrage applies to your own reasonable geographic region but recognizing that several parallel sexual marketplaces exist within this and what you bring to the table has a different value in each one does not have to travel to apply this theory these markets exist right there in your own county ,1,TheRedPill
MentORPHEUS,i am not an economics major but felt certain one would be along to fine tune this metaphor that as far as i have seen has never been applied to the sexual marketplace thanks for your input now here why i think arbitrage is a good metaphor in the example you pointed out the younger man finds sex within his own sexual market women his age at his college is costly and difficult to obtain it a buyer market for young women in this demographic so the average frustrated college chump can take several women his age out to dinner a week and get no sex instead he turns to the milf market a pool of older post wall women lacking a stream of eager men market conditions are such that she will take him out to dinner and for sure have sex boom arbitrage ftw i deliberately left out the example of sex tourism as arbitrage not so much because i am personally not into prostitution and consider it a deux ex machina cheat in game the idea of this article is to help people think of their own personal sexual marketplace in economic terms so when they are not finding success in the market they have been shopping in they have a rubric in place to formulate an actionable plan start shopping your smv around different sexual markets what you bring to the table can have a dramatically different value in each unlike economic markets sexual markets can overlay the same geographic area humans artificially divide themselves by age class race etc and self enforce these arbitrary boundaries strongly enough to make for widely differing sexual markets right in the same neighborhood ,1,TheRedPill

MentORPHEUS,great topic rps i have been around long enough to remember news while the fairness doctrine https en wikipedia org wiki fairness doctrine was in effect and through sea changes like citizens united https en wikipedia org wiki citizens united v fec that have altered the veracity of the media landscape dramatically over recent time plus i am a skeptic and truth seeker at heart so fake news is not a concept new to me i remember mondo2000 predicting in the 90s that personalized news channels would emerge and we would become simultaneous consumers and producers of news this time has come and the repercussions are staggering the epidemic of fake news is magnified by social media we easily become part of the problem when we pass along biased or bogus information and ideas it seriously was not like this just 25 years ago humans are advancing their interconnectivity and information spreading capability almost faster than we can evolve an understanding of its effects a process toffler called future shock https en wikipedia org wiki future shock what is a fool proof way to spot and debunk fake news nothing foolproof but here are some of the cognitive tools and ideas i have evolved to arrive at something close as possible to the truth in a known biased media landscape place news sources in a hierarchy of primary tertiary primary sources are direct verbatim quotes or complete videos of speeches or events scientific primary sources are published peer reviewed studies spelling out the exact methodology used to arrive at the conclusions given secondary sources are reports about primary sources that are usually biased and cherry pick what parts they show and slant their headline and conclusions but refer the reader to the original primary source mainstream media and scientific or industry journals and publications are usually examples of secondary sources tertiary sources basically start with secondary level understanding of the topic but may heavily slant and editorialize their own conclusions tertiary sources never refer to primary sources in any comprehensive manner editorials opinion pieces websites blogs social media posts and chain emails are usually tertiary class sources understand that bias exists everywhere in the world it bottom up human nature not always a top down conspiracy just as sexual strategy is amoral and just exists so too does bias exist in every news outlet the game is not to attack the biases of the other tribe it to recognize your own biases and those of other people and news sources and use this information to your advantage look for and root out your own biases the best you can by always confirming beliefs against primary sources and expectations and predictions against actual outcomes guard against the human tendency to indulge in confirmation bias https en wikipedia org wiki confirmation bias in yourself and your sources of information a life of skepticism and truth seeking sometimes demands difficult self reflection and scientific willingness to reject disproven ideas and theories even those once considered important use known biases to triangulate upon the truth where primary sources are available start with those and check how the story or finding is reported by left right specialty and mainstream sources to calibrate your understanding of the biases of each this can be helpful in cases where primary sources are unavailable such as breaking stories or highly politicized topics for understanding these better on the fly when only secondary and tertiary sources may be available cast a wide net according to the scale of the topic or event most things are worth only getting from one or two sources but when it comes to world events i will check media outlets in major cities around the world and even outliers like ruptly and aljazeera ruthlessly vet your news sources both what you absorb and what you pass along if your careful vetting finds that a given source keeps serving up excessively biased information reject them already i cannot believe how many people keep passing along the same info from their beloved source that is proven biased or blatantly wrong time and time again trust but verify and ffs stop blindly trusting if they keep fooling you watch for heavily biased language and dog whistle words especially those carefully crafted to appeal to your particular demographic this is the automatic downgrade to plate or tertiary status of news source vetting enjoy the entertaining writers and characters who support your worldview we cannot begrudge people that but remember to always always start from primary sources when it comes to forming and maintaining important opinions and vetting facts and ideas and treat tertiary sources with the weight they deserve very little watch for headlines that are not supported by the body text i am looking at you fox and breitbart this is a technique of outright propaganda sometimes the body text is even the opposite of the headline they get away with it because so few people read anything longer than a tweet these days consider it next level bias and be accordingly wary of sources that indulge in this use inductive logic not deductive deductive logic is often used to lead people step by step to a predetermined conclusion and is a handy tool for propaganda beware of analyses and conclusions that are presented as a simplified deductive chain of reasoning with many open assumptions inductive logic brings all of your knowledge to bear on a problem which can help you transcend your inherent biases and detect and avoid propaganda on the fly and arrive at your own solid conclusions develop a sound information vetting system if this sounds like a lot of thinking it is but after a certain learning curve throwing out bad information helps build a comprehensive rubric of information and cognitive tools that make it easier and more efficient over time to take in and accurately process new information those who indulge in amusing half truths and biased clickbait stories and memes are the ones who find politics and media never become easier to understand for they build over time a

MentORPHEUS,many on trp practically fetishize dark triad traits personally i find dale carnegie more effective for day to day interaction and interpersonal leadership than machiavelli often the preferred leadership style is closely interlinked with one self image and personal philosophies different situations call for different techniques so the man who pigeonholes himself as one type or another may find himself applying the wrong tool with less than ideal results the authoritarian leader makes people feel obligated to obey by fiat on the surface and in the short term emergencies for example it is effective however it usually gains grudging compliance at best and while it is simpler up front it fosters resistance and passive aggression in subjects who may change their behavior as soon as the leader is not watching the charismatic leader makes people want to follow his lead it tends to be front loaded with more effort to fully explain plans and expectations and sell them to the subjects but once on board with the leader plans they will continue to work on the mission even in the absence of hands on leadership and scrutiny ,5,asktrp

MentORPHEUS,i do the same thing for the right opportunities the main pitfall is to become complacent and not reach higher always keep one or two plates in the kitty and use this as a platform of realized abundance to reach for higher highs another thing to watch for is a much lower smv woman will behave like one much higher if you allow her be vigilant about catching and passing shit tests and remember that you are the prize sometimes you just totally click with a particular woman outside your target dating range they say to reach for the better apples at the top of the tree but for a lower smv woman you are at the top of her tree this can make for nice times together if you leverage it right there something sweet about opening your eyes and finding her staring at you admiringly like a greek god ,9,asktrp

MentORPHEUS,hi welcome to rpw please take the following thoughts and advice in the spirit of pitfalls to watch out for rather than reasons you should not do this to directly answer your question it should come up no later than the end of the second date let it flow naturally from a discussion of values and common ground unless you are dating a limited pool of men such as from a church where marriage before sex is assumed do not put off mentioning it too long most men can respect a principled chaste woman but positively despise a perceived prick tease there a reason just married is such a popular trope in humor the discovery of flaws and showstoppers after committing for life is perilous for both men nsfw cartoon http visionity com wp content uploads 2016 05 just married cartoon jpg and women mouseover nsfw caption s oooh stanley it so hard but when does it get big commit for life as virgins evolved socially in an environment where many women died in childbirth before their mid 30s and people stayed within 50 miles of where they were born and interacted mostly with the same small town worth of people their entire lives adapting this to modern times is a really tough sell sometimes men who suppress their sexual urges in the name of religion end up with a madonna whore complex as a result often the first symptom is he virtually never has sex with her again once she pregnant make sure your vetting process screens for this a red pill man is liable to agree to these terms for a high enough smv and rmv woman and follow through on the engagement and marriage but maintain a plate or two in the meantime one useful method of keeping a good man interest through a mutually agreed waiting period is to pace your escalation to the time scale at hand from experienced daters who can usually discern good ltr material by the third date to those entering the dating pool hoping to get married before intercourse a sense of incremental progress is much more satisfying than an impenetrable wall he can walk right up to decide on your hard goalposts and boundaries first then approach these slowly and incrementally to maintain excitement and interest you have come to a good place to work toward your particular relationship goals despite modern challenges good luck to you edit format,2,RedPillWomen

MentORPHEUS, plausible deniability that an aspect of this but the core concept is allowing the other party an opportunity to save face this is a very important element of japanese culture for example but american culture emphasizes a clear winner loser dynamic just the act of breaking out of this expected aggressive script can be enough to throw people off of their hostile track ,1,TheRedPill
MentORPHEUS,the only difference would be jackass instead of bitch by addressing the line cutter with dignity and offering a chance to save face there is a strong chance they will comply and even mutter an apology people expect you to open with aggression and they are usually ready with aggression of their own to match it they are already acting with passive aggression by line cutting active aggression is right beneath the surface these are not abstract notions i am typing out i have done a b testing of both ways over decades and actually experienced the short term outcome and long term effects of each ,3,TheRedPill
MentORPHEUS, the problem is none of this works unless others see you as above them i disagree so many people are accustomed to superior inferior relationships that they automatically try to enter every encounter as the dominant party matching this with an aggressive stance eliminates the chance of a peaceful encounter and escalates and polarizes the situation from the word go assertiveness addresses others as nominal equals with their own interests to be concerned with my business is in a ghetto ass industrial neighborhood so i have decades of first encounter experience with swaggering gangbanger and hoodrat types you would be amazed how many hostile greetings turn friendly or at least neutral in the first two conversational moves if you maintain a dignified frame for yourself and the other party to the conversation example subordinate still not doing task you ordered reply the task is not done angry and disappointed stare it a simple fucking thing and you could not do it disappointed what am i going to do with this idiot exhale now you either do the task for them or assign it to someone else this is a parent child transaction not an assertive one of nominal equals and all of the sighing and angry staring amounts to passive aggression your suggestion may or may not work in the immediate term but for a long term productive work relationship will quickly replace respect with compliance well honed assertiveness can maintain a leader subordinate hierarchy and the dignity of both parties this can be more work at times than a hard nosed authoritarian leadership style but the payoff in worker loyalty respect motivation and production can be exponentially greater than the mostly different not greater effort needed p s this comes from experience being raised by narcissists that explains a lot the finer points of human empathy were damaged or missing during your formative years it must seem distant and impossible to interact like this with strangers much less intimates given that background ,2,TheRedPill
MentORPHEUS,your first example is definitely aggressive and the second could be aggressive or assertive contingent on contextual cues like tone inflection body language etc the examples are somewhat exaggerated to clearly contrast different styles in the shortest way possible they probably wo not do if you try to lift them as actual dialogue empathy is definitely an component of successful assertive communication in an actual encounter a man would want to titrate empathy down to the minimum necessary amount necessary for that situation the examples exaggerate this up to an obvious level for illustrative purposes ,1,TheRedPill
MentORPHEUS,it an acronym for defend excuse explain rationalize ,2,TheRedPill
MentORPHEUS, the examples you have provided are terrible you are right in the sense that the examples are pretty exaggerated in order to provide clear examples of the four types that fit in small boxes you either sound far too timid or like a disapproving woman the actual dialogue will emerge from each unique situation but well honed assertiveness looks different from aggression and timid passivity and gets very different results compared to both by carefully maintaining your own frame and giving someone who has broken some social rule a chance to emerge from the situation with dignity it elevates rather than diminishes the status of the leader who can be gracious instead of ruthless when others are cooperating the less words you need to say something the better true carrying on too long with explanations or deering is not a hallmark of strong effective leadership ,3,TheRedPill
MentORPHEUS, additionally providing an excuse for rude behavior allows the other person to correct their behavior without accepting public rebuke it hard to judge the tone through text only here but allowing the person that opportunity is one of the underlying goals here it worded to allow her an opportunity to save face which is part of taking the other person position into account and an important factor in whether others consider your actions charismatic leadership or rude aggression after the fact ,28,TheRedPill

MentORPHEUS, i have also found myself to be very selective to the point where i am unattracted to anyone who is not self aware in some way i am the same way this is in stark contrast to critics who think poly means fucking everything that moves this often invokes strong beliefs that were instilled since childhood by religion etc once this happens a rational discussion with the person becomes impossible that why its also important to never allow even the perception that you consider poly to be a better or more enlightened form of relationship when discussing it among critics it triggers an emotional response that is impenetrable to logic many belief systems structure their canons to take advantage of this aspect of human nature a post from someone talking about a crazy woman and do not stick your dick in crazy this does not refer to someone who is benevolent but alternative it refers to legit crazy axis ii disorders like borderline personality disorder or commits crimes when they feel jilted such as assault vandalism and stalking the relationships in my polycule are the healthiest i have ever seen zero drama in a group of 9 that awesome if only our critics could see and fully grok poly relationships that work smoothly like this gosh that sounds like a lot of drama in your life i agree it does but keep it in perspective my love life spans over 1 3 century at this point 20 years of it with times of being poly most of this time was smooth and happy for all parties it my nature to cultivate win win relationships the bad breakups and extinction level events that ended numerous relationships at once were like earthquakes or tornadoes not there almost all of the time but devastating and with wide lengthy and memorable repercussions ,1,RedPillNonMonogamy

MentORPHEUS,hey glad you made it over to this sub good questions does anybody here have a red pill partner or partners not in name some partners have been quite self aware and had a good conscious grasp of the smp others have almost stereotypical blind spots about their own self and nature and bumble along cluelessly they could not absorb the red pill if they ground it up and snorted it at my age late 40s people are pretty set in their ways a strong male can lead many women along his own path to an extent but it becomes much harder to change radically speaking as a man to adapt to new partners differences so you become more selective people really have to be ready to swallow the pill later in life do you think the nature of non monogamy when done well leads to being open and honest with oneself and each other by darwinian necessity yes this is playing with reptilian brain fire those not open minded and self aware quickly crash and burn and shy away from poly once they experience the strong situational emotions and conflict cognitive dissonance that usually arise i think it works for people who are already more self aware than average rather than itself being a driver toward awareness and that non monogamous people are more awake it true that poly relationships are a level above monogamy in the sense that there are a lot more moving parts and ethical emotional cans of worms opened this means they are more demanding not superior in any universal objective way i think it cognitively risky to imagine poly as superior to mono i have learned the hard way you do not want to even accidentally imply that it or you are superior when discussing the topic it amplifies the hell out of any triggering that occurs when this comes up in mixed discussions so beware do you think female sexual strategy changes slightly when she is non monogamous heh af bb theory would respond what do you mean when i found the aware poly ones were far more easygoing and matter of fact about the on again off again nature of the relationship taking cancellations and schedule adjustments in stride in contrast monogamous partners were sometimes chill sometimes really paranoid and jealous of random others even in the absence of dread or actual competition what do you think of the attitude at the red pill of men who claim they can spin plates but she cannot have another relationship i do a lol cringe thing about it but i can empathize with those who feel this way for their own reasons and i do not blame them for having strong opinions on the subject from my perspective of 30 years of love life experience it something i tacitly accept about my plates with zero fucks given my history includes losing a step family i had bonded with extinction level breakup events see my fr down the page a bpd stalker ex and other horrifics leaving my disney oneitis blue pill love life model a burned out hulk i honestly cannot blame young men still on their first third girlfriend for having a problem with m 2 geometries experience with breakups and relationship management are prerequisites for successful poly life imo ,1,RedPillNonMonogamy

MentORPHEUS, there are numerous pro plate threads i do not see any pro plate threads on there all written by male users cut to the chase you mean two threads by whisper with whom there is some raw acrimony by the old rpw crew at present the divide is fresh and strong now if you read his piece in 6 12 months from a more neutral stance you might not take away that he simply promoting platehood for the benefit of men wherein female users state that the advice messages are harmful a consensus of people arguing incorrect assumptions does not make their conclusion valid vetting ideas does not work that way male users are allowed to insult while the smallest word from a female user is corrected and an issue is warned looking through the whole thread as it stands now what you perceive as male favoritism can just as readily be attributed to the mods being new and not as numerous decisive as the experienced old crew there was objective merit to whisper questioning someone reading comprehension and he backed up why he said that trp male users and outsider trolls both liked to pretend that the old sub was somehow dedicated to worshiping all men but especially any guy that was a trp user that annoyed me too and it shows a fundamental misunderstanding of rpw what people do on subs outside of rpwi is not something i concern myself with we are tens of thousands of words deep in not concerned at this point people have invested a lot in these subs it okay to be concerned go ahead and own it you can claim not concerned in lieu of addressing key points of the discussion here but i for one am not buying it the community i care about is happy and safe good my compliment of the state of that sub was sincere straight talk keep up the good work over there as a parting thought you know the saying to those accustomed to privilege equality feels like oppression in this context consider the analogue to those accustomed to strictly limiting discussion widening the scope a little feels like removing limits altogether keep rocking the rpwives world from my pov announcing the death of rpw due to freely promoting male centric advice is premature cheers ,4,PurplePillDebate

MentORPHEUS, as for the other parts of your comment i will always take issue with marriage and ltr minded women being told they should would iscuss the merits of having sex early often and without commitment it is in complete contradiction with everything rp says about the cc n counts sluts single moms etc we seem to be looking at the same sub and reaching different conclusions someone is working from false premises here from new subreddit rules to a note on plates to axioms of rpw the official policy on the sub is the opposite of what you are claiming it is stated over and over that male centric advice is ot provide links to where the cc high n count slutty behavior etc are officially advised honestly you are conflating opening discussion with permissiveness the old sub is now being forced to allow damaging advice that directly affects a woman chance to secure commitment i have seen bad non rpw advice downvoted debated appropriately even deleted i think you are considering anything more lenient than the old editorial policy as permitting the worst extremes this was one of the biggest and most legit complaints about the old mod team the scope of discussion was so limited that people were afraid to speak at all if they did not agree with the prevailing narrow consensus trp flat out does not allow women to push ltrs marriage or hamster on the main sub as well they should not i have seen some bad examples of rp unaware women bringing really bad discussion advice to the sub and get bounced as surely as the far more numerous rp noob men that stumble in and start typing nonsense there are women posters who bring value to the discussions and are not bounced one element of these posts is they correctly leave out their gender unless absolutely relevant and address the audience they have not the one they wish they had ,5,PurplePillDebate
MentORPHEUS, rpwo seems to be struggling to figure out how to push the plate agenda in a way that wo not alienate the few women that still participate there they have changed their position several times and the hypocrisy no insulting user unless it to defend a male is becoming increasingly apparent i do not think that an objective view of what is going on at all it been directly stated on the new rpw that becoming a plate is not an optimal strategy for a woman opening the discussion changing it to a pro male strategy i consider the young women of rpw like e nieces and i stepdaughters if i sensed that there was even a subtle covert campaign to treat it like a plate factory i would ignore the place and not look back being a big picture systems oriented kind of guy i see trp rpw and mrp as complementary parts of the greater manosphere rpsphere when the leadership and boundaries are amicable the three have great synergistic potential infighting distracts all from our somewhat different but ultimately parallel missions consider how much of your critique may be influenced by sour grapes over the leadership disagreement from my dispassionate viewpoint you are missing some of the fine detail of the current rpw direction and discussion policy whatever the reason the rpwives forum level of discussion has improved dramatically in the new sub so congrats for that these sorties to deliver somewhat disingenuous critiques of the original rpw forum direction seem antithetical to anyone mission at this point ,8,PurplePillDebate

MentORPHEUS, is it possible to be alpha as well as a nice dude who cares about the girl and keep her attracted to you or does one need to go full dark triad dt traits are somewhat fetishized by a certain percentage of guys here they are not wrong in the sense that certain traits are attractive to large numbers of women however this is heavily skewed to the low self esteem side of the female bell curve they become an impediment when trying to attract good ltr material such as an intelligent woman with healthy self esteem from a good education and upbringing does one need to be an asshole who does not care about those around him to succeed with women this is a very salient question for those who come to trp from the reformed nice guy categories of men there are many different competing ideas of what constitutes the most evolved of men though many are mutually exclusive most are not wrong per se because different men of different temperaments ascend to different peaks to give two extreme examples the dark triad villain or dark hero who stands atop a pile of bodies and rules by force and fear the benevolent king who is hoisted atop a pyramid of eager supporters who lifts those around him to buoy himself ever higher and rules by charisma and respect for another way of considering the differences ponder the contrast between aggressive and assertive so what does one talk about with a woman on a date i heard that women consider talking about mart things to be boring is that true this is very true of party girls and cc riders who are only interested in a quick no connection bang my dating funnel selects for intelligent educated women so being able to carry on intelligent conversation on a variety of topics will help you stand out from the crowd if this is the type of woman you are seeking however do not forget awalt even the most nerdy woman will lose attraction if your balance goes too far toward beta being able to satisfy her craving for chad thundercock and going full caveman in the bedroom needs to always be part of your package ,3,TheRedPill

MentORPHEUS,i am late 40s have run through the age brackets 20s women are much more carefree willing to hook up or get in a ltr with a less matched man 30s established women are much more comfortable and experienced getting into relationships with a giant but their biological clock is ticking like big ben and even though they might not start a relationship on a marriage track they are most likely to have the talk earlier and way less negotiably than younger older ones and bail if you wo not commit mid 30s through 40s they tend to be more realistic about having an ongoing relationship not leading to marriage a big bonus is many women libido kicks in fully in their mid 30s and they are down for more sex with fewer inhibitions and hangups ,3,asktrp

MentORPHEUS,in my own experience long term part time plates thrive best with some floor level threshold of minimum contact the amount and type varies from woman to woman once you understand each one needs using an intermittent reinforcement schedule you can keep them on hold with minimal happy contact going totally cold makes it harder to spin things back up when you return to town and more risky that she will be completely unavailable to you if you do it right you can keep the relationship idling through occasional texts for cumulatively less effort than respinning a broken plate or starting a new one the real danger is spending time that you do not want to spend texting or whatever other relationship maintenance you put in i text a long term plate now and then even during periods of months or years that we are not available to sleep with each other because i enjoy it if it became burdensome for the returns or i did not enjoy it there would be no reason to ,3,asktrp

MentORPHEUS, covert contracts are subconsciously expected rewards for good behavior snip i do not think that applies to op idea i do think it applies and here is why it is still a covert contract if she enters the friendship with ulterior motives she fully conscious of but conceals from her new friend frankly i think a conscious covert contract has worse implications than a subconscious one there are perfectly dignified and ladylike ways to communicate i like you let be friends and see where it goes mirin eyes give the man you like a chance to consider you as an option polarize the situation and make his move if he decides the overarching concern about this method is it can lead to too much investment of time and effort into dead end leads making new friends can expand your exposure into new social circles but developing female oneitis for a man who never turns into a boyfriend constricts your exposure committing 100 to a boyfriend once you find him is great however there no virtue in committing 100 to a single prospect and it an inefficient scouting strategy ,5,RedPillWomen

MentORPHEUS,until i read that wiki page just now i had not heard of steinberg and his triangle of love theory it does look like a useful paradigm especially in the attraction and initial stages of shorter term relationships i was referring to the natural and readily observable evolution of many long term relationships from passionate to companionate love which is what keeps sexless 80yos lovingly together till the end ,4,TheRedPill
MentORPHEUS, so after realizing the boost in attraction i started to want these awkward scenarios and orchestrate them on purpose because if you play it smooth when they expect it to be awkward for you it god damned 100 000 sexy points to you i agree not reacting as if you have done something wrong is the key element of how to respond to plates colliding when you get caught organically and play it cool it is surprisingly likely to make both women more attracted to you however if you get caught deliberately orchestrating a meeting it is much more likely to backfire because it gives her a heavier element of deceit to have to hamster away if you are a very high status man in the perception of both women you will come out ahead almost every time with little to no effort it the average guy batting at or above his smv league who has to be extra careful about his game during these events in order to come out ahead i do not go out of my way to torture my ltr i do not orchestrate events like this any more ltr dread game is potentially much more volatile than casual plating even though she has much more investment to protect she more likely to decide to walk upon confronting this reality in most of my ltrs with concurrent plates the higher they rise in my dating hierarchy the more likely they are to prefer a dont ask do not tell program they are more likely to respond positively to subtle implied low levels of dread but once confronted with the reality of it might nuke the relationship one time my main ltr of many years drove up and found me with a throwaway plate in the car about to go for a drive in the country she tearfully broke up with me on the spot never to speak with me again i proceeded to nonchalantly spend the day with the plate as if nothing had happened whether this means i have reached a state of alpha as fuck or the last part of that thing i might once have called my soul has died is a matter of ongoing conjecture ,17,TheRedPill

MentORPHEUS, the day before i asked her to be my girlfriend it best to let the woman initiate relationship talk i prefer ltrs and long term plates and i used to go on about how important relationships are to me ad nauseum what i discovered when i started leaving it to them was the talk comes much later than expected and they end up demanding far less than i freely offered upfront when i was a poor smp negotiator while well intentioned your initiating of the talk probably resulted in her filling in and assuming details that you did not intend if you waited for her to initiate the talk she would have brought them up one by one and you would be negotiating from a position of better power i reassured her she is the only girl i am interested in being with this was my mistake i believe oops if that not what you 100 wanted it was a slip but not an irrecoverable one consider it suspended and during the relationship negotiating discussion that is soon to come resist the urge to throw out offers like that what is your advice to keeping frame and still remaining in control of the relationship while actually trying to treat her with a little respect when she throws out shit tests that are silly treat them as such remain unfazed especially if she starts getting angry or emotional you snap chatted her back yeah yawn you liked her instagram photo i did she commented on your photo mmm hmm verbal judo recommends do not respond to the presuppositions in her statements which include you did something wrong this is tantamount to cheating you should be ashamed you should take action to make this up to me set a precedent that she cannot use these shit tests to whip you into her emotional frame and they should dry up if they do not that a clear sign that she problematic ltr material some women work through their early doubts and settle in as a good gf others never stop questioning and shit testing if her demeanor is generally insecure and paranoid she probably in the latter category if the same arguments keep coming up and she never learns gets over the same worries and concerns then she will probably be the same if you manage to stay together for decades ,15,TheRedPill
MentORPHEUS, the best solution is for her to agree to let me fuck other girls with the condition that she is still my no 1 and that i am committed to her long term i am inclined to agree but good luck obtaining her buy in to this idea it probably better to have the most amicable breakup possible with the possibility of getting together again in the late 20s however there is a lot of personal growth between now and 25 or so you two might not even be compatible at that point there an old proverb a man never steps in the same river twice for the river changes and so does the man sex whenever i want but i honestly am somewhat bored of her after fucking her all this time some women have their libido really warm up in their 30s but you cannot bet the farm on that happening i had a gf that was a great companion but she would not know sensuality if it bit her on the ass she was totally passive and vanilla in the bedroom and had no motivation to change she had one bf of a few months since we split over 10 years ago sex usually does not get better with time and overfamiliarity alone ,2,asktrp

MentORPHEUS, plates have zero reason to respect themselves if they are enduring the status of plate in the hopes of one day earning commitment i agree this is one of the most foolish reasons to enter a nonexclusive relationship promotion from plate to a higher order commitment happens all the time but odds are strongly against this outcome when commitment is the goal heading down the path of non commitment makes no sense now if a woman has no desire for commitment then she should not only be a plate but have several male plates of her own turnabout is fair play is the way i have always approached this the word plate is now being stretched beyond recognition multiple relationships defy simple categorization and are sometimes better understood as points or shapes on a venn diagram http tacit livejournal com 333842 html rather than words obviously that is not a strategy this sub endorses or encourages i found out in the middle of a virtual flash mob that many trp members feel the same way a guy can spin lots of plates but the thought of his lowest order plate having another boyfriend can be positively triggering edit typo,4,RedPillWives

MentORPHEUS,interesting way of looking at it the concept could be fleshed out a bit more for consideration my own take on it would be this hookup partners are a fungible commodity like grain or petroleum while ltrs are a durable good like major appliances or cars wherein branding can help narrow down the available options however i do not think hookups and ltrs are so fundamentally different as to be completely mutually exclusive when it comes to analyzing each using market analogies they are categorically different but share enough elements of initial attraction and selection that common elements can be compared ltrs are obviously vastly more complicated but casual relationships like hookups use some of the same modules if you will i think the word commodity has a strongly negative connotation which may be blocking understanding it as a metaphor here strip away the emotional freight and it still a basic minimax https en wikipedia org wiki minimax problem wherein both parties seek the maximum they can obtain from the marketplace with a minimum of effort speaking as somebody who prefers ltrs yes the commodity model has elements that are useful whether you are optimizing for short or long term relationships ,6,RedPillWomen

MentORPHEUS, my friends are all getting married and tend to only hang out with other couples or married people if people drop you let those fuckers go getting married to keep friends is one of the wrongest reasons if you are on the type of career path where you will never make partner if you are not married that might be different i am in my late 40s never married have seen plenty of people go through it with regrets and others that are happy that way it just the way i like things i have never needed people to get through the day i am satisfied with having had many different partners in life and at times i have several at the same time which is like living many lifespans in one https www trp red p vermillionmanmarch 189 you are at the age where your female cohorts are hitting the wall and desperate to pair off the pressure is on from every direction to get married now however as a man your smv has yet to peak my love life was just getting started at 30 and the 30s and 40s have been great i would have missed out on a lot if i latched on to one woman do what you want to do not what others are pressuring you to ,143,TheRedPill

MentORPHEUS,short answer the effect is more strong in women less strong in men according to popular wisdom in my personal experience it is down to the individual as to whether they can go from promiscuity to a durable pair bond the promiscuity is usually a symptom rather than a root cause many young women ride the cc in college because it easy and they are away from parental authority for the first time these are the types that may grow out of it well women who are promiscuous for reasons like personality disorders abusive childhood etc were probably oversexualized and broken long before college age and will remain so after absent years of difficult therapy and self improvement which seldom sticks in these cases here is a discussion i had about pair bonding and partner count http archive is grt8j which you might find interesting ,4,asktrp
MentORPHEUS,as one of the grandpas let me start by beating you with my walker i am disappointed that this is your takeaway i have not seen anyone say sex is overrated so do not try to get laid it more like getting laid is easy once you learn these things once you get to the point that sex feels overrated here are some other aspects of masculine life you will need to reach your full potential trp is like a smorgasbord there is lots of good information for men to improve many aspects of their lives take what you need for you and ignore the rest we have a saying here rather than complain about the content post the content you want to see you are a redditor of 17 days who has only posted questions for the community and this complaint ,2,TheRedPill

MentORPHEUS,the key to any of these shit tests is not to flinch or show even a moment of perturbation presuppose that how you are living is okay because it is and that she is the silly one for bringing up the topic pressure flip you are upset because i am not your fuckboy agree and amplify might be do not you have seventeen gentleman callers no liar smirk ,-1,asktrp

MentORPHEUS,good post op this is an important principle that is often botched by men in established relationships who are newly unplugging dread game is a power tool one can do much more harm than good if they wield it like a chainsaw at full throttle the correct way is to improve yourself to the point where women spontaneously admire and flirt with you it works best with least chance of backfiring when it is organic trying to force it bluntly and crudely will definitely backfire especially if your partner does not see your smv as high and or rising effective dread game is not blatantly initiating flirting with cashiers and waitresses that only makes you look like a cad or asshole and not in the good way for more detail look for the article about 12 levels of dread you want to apply the minimum amount needed to achieve the desired result in the context at hand without going over that ,8,TheRedPill

MentORPHEUS,it could go either way i do not want to get into an argument over an ambiguous soundless video where the police report and witness statements my meta position on the matter is i set a high bar for what i would hold up as an example of gender privilege another recent example is the girl holding the knife to the guy it was posted as an example of females getting a pass but it was a breaking story where law enforcement had not yet even identified the people in the video and every news source i saw reporting the story mentioned she committed a crime ,2,TheRedPill

MentORPHEUS,agreed bad example particularly because the guy probably assaulted the husband off camera this after him telling them owners of the parking space to fuck off when they informed him he could not park in the only spot in front of their business with the nose inside the building no less then walk over to the neighboring business i own a business with a private off street lot you would be amazed the strangers that pull in litter block the way and threaten to murder you not exaggerating when you ask them politely to leave ,-3,TheRedPill

MentORPHEUS, im maxim 108 give a woman less attention than she wants it is easy for a man to be too generous but near impossible for him to be too frugal this is true so long as his smv is sufficiently high in her perception the attention bottom for a high smv woman is higher in a sexual marketplace with many equal or better options and rises if his smv slips for any reason the minimum a man can get away with averaged over several relationships is a market indicator of his smv ,22,TheRedPill

MentORPHEUS, s ociopaths do not have great life plans they are characterized by poor impulse control the inability to form long lasting relationships unnecessary risk taking and the inability to learn from mistakes i agree your posts are great but titling them as learning from sociopaths then describing healthy mind behaviors and habits takes away more than it gives to your works to paraphrase a science fiction editor show me a man who performs as well as a psychopath but not like a psychopath ,13,TheRedPill

MentORPHEUS,when i was closer to 20 i viewed this as a moral absolute with 30 years of real world experience since then i consider never cheat a strong recommendation albeit with nuances and extenuating circumstances do what you will or wo not in your own life but do not be too quick to finalize judgements on others because you do not know all of their situation walk a mile in their shoes so to speak for those who want to spin multiple plates it much easier to set up a nonmonogamous relationship upfront than to change or amend it later and much much easier than just cheating and getting caught instead tell the bitch that she a loser and walk away a correction a lesson that you wo not take the easy pickings and that her actions put her beneath what you are willing to deal with do not assume this will have the long term effect on her behavior that you wish it would in fact the cognitive dissonance will probably be resolved by riding the next cock that much harder if it makes you feel better about yourself go ahead but unless your woman set this up as a test or the prospective cheater circles intersect yours now or in the future the effect will end there ,6,TheRedPill
