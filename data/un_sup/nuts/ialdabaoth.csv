ialdabaoth,slate star codex is an excellent blog for true seeing a word of warning though there a lot of things that the redpill gets wrong the ssc crowd does not get them any more right but exposing yourself to those people will make it more painfully clear where trp does not see the whole picture this is dangerous because swallowing trp as a coherent frame is part of what makes it work it probably only 70 accurate but it only works if you believe it at least 99 accurate and as a pragmatic thing that belief is important for success ,0,TheRedPill
ialdabaoth,let me try this the biggest recent problem i have with consent is with multiple girls rejecting me because i tried to explicitly negotiate with them a few managed to articulate that what they want is to have a guy do what he wants with her and make her enjoy it and if he fails to make her enjoy it then she wants to be able to call it assault and that seems pretty terrifying to me because it seems like lately most of the people i am actually attracted to have this mindset and i do not know how to navigate it ,1,bdsm

ialdabaoth,yeah but i am telling you right now that in my cohort the guys who dropped out of college to join a tech startup are outperforming the guys who stuck it through to get a cs degree the key is to actually do something build a useful app write a fun game be someone that people can hang a story on i got in the door at my last gig before this one because i wrote mods for kerbal space program and my boss son played that game so i was instantly more than just some guy with a degree from a random college i was the guy that kept his son entertained and educated for hundreds of hours and it did not matter that i only wrote a tiny bit of code for the game he anchored me to his son being happy and bam i have got the job ,7,TheRedPill
ialdabaoth,yeah fuck that i do not have a degree and i am glad i do not most of the kids around me with cs degrees do not know how to problem solve they know algorithms they know something they call ux design but they do not know how to figure out the right solution to the problem you want to learn to program fucking learn to program it just like lifting but for your brain go download some open video game like kerbal space program set up a github account and start coding once you have proven that you can do something useful download an android dev kit and build yourself your own mobile app you do not need some shitty 4 year degree to prove that you can code i spent 10 years as a tech lead and i will tell you that if you come to me with an app that works and does something useful and you walk me through the trickiest part of the function library and i will fucking hire you on the spot no interview and anywhere that needs to ask you bullshit algorithm questions after vetting your cse credentials is not a place you want to work for anyways ,15,TheRedPill

ialdabaoth,oh and some caveats you need to prove that the change you made saved the company money but do not think that they are letting you get away with it because you saved them money no they are letting you get away with it because you back up your actions you buck the status quo they challenge you you throw down figures like a boss the proof is just a prop you need to be able to stare down the first guy that challenged you and say your challenge is stupid and you should feel bad i saved this company 3 million dollars so unless you can pony up that much cash you have to back down and eat shit for challenging my initiative that gets people attention obviously do not say back down and eat shit unless you are in some boiler room money market firm most companies reward people who play the game and playing the game involves corpspeak and feigning civility while emasculating your competition ,11,TheRedPill
ialdabaoth,yeah it takes a weird combination of empathy and cynicism so first a parable there was this research project involving monkeys research projects involving monkeys are usually awesome and hilarious just by themselves but this one also produced a super important result but first the awesome and hilarious setup shove a bunch of monkeys in a room put a bunch of bananas hanging from the ceiling stick a ladder under the bananas point a fire hose at the ladder whenever monkeys start to climb the ladder to get at the bananas hose every motherfucking monkey down with the firehose whether they were on the ladder or not predictably the monkeys will start beating the shit out of any monkey that goes near the ladder no matter how hungry they all are now feed them some kibble and repeat do this a few times until the monkeys have all got it fully ingrained into monkey culture that ladder beating then disconnect the hose the monkeys do not know the hose is disconnected of course so they keep beating the shit out of any monkey that goes near the ladder swap out a monkey for a fresh monkey one that never got hosed what is he do he makes a bee line for the ladder because hey bananas the scientists did remember to throw out the old nasty ass bananas and put up fresh ones what do the other monkeys do beat the shit out of him of course next day swap out another old hose monkey for a fresh non hosed monkey what is he do beeline for the ladder what do they do beat the shit out of him repeat this process until there is not a single monkey in the pack who ever got the hose and then put in a new monkey they still beat the shit out of him why because that how we do it here what is the point of that lesson when you look around you in an office you will see a lot of stuff that just stupid stuff that makes no goddamn sense wastes money and makes everyone miserable some of that stuff is there because someone got a hose pointed at the office and will punish everyone if they try to make an improvement but other stuff is there because a long time ago someone used to have a hose pointed at the office but they are long gone and still the monkeys beat up anyone that could get them the bananas because that how we do things around here learn to say fuck that and pay attention sometimes someone has a hose pointed at everybody for a good reason maybe some improvements actually come at a steep cost somewhere else in the organization but more often than not it just because someone wants to make a dick print on the office environment and has the power to do so trust me you do not wanna cross those guys but again sometimes there just no reason to do the dumb thing anymore so learn to keep your eyes open and notice all the little things that could be improved and then look a step deeper and notice all the things that actually can be improved without your ass getting fired for trying and then come in and do one of them there this dog and pony show where you have to do some kind of analysis and show your work and make it look like you are doing it for your boss but if you just do it you can often just fucking wing that part the real analysis you need is in cost savings be able to prove that the change you made saved the company money and someone with a high six figure salary will notice you do it with a minimum of personal effort and you have just bought a ticket out of loserdom i would strongly recommend reading venkatesh rao gervais principle stuff before trying any of this though and cross correlating with the relevant bits from the 48 laws of power ,13,TheRedPill

ialdabaoth, 40 heatcap for a lolcust with a shutdown at 20 with 75 kph top speed after three lpls a locust should never ever have three lpls to begin with the game meta has been severely warped by the terribly incomplete heat system coded in since 2013 now you would penalize builds that dont actually need heatsinks like ac builds for building up heat this incentivizes them to build in more heatsinks at which point they would just convert to lasers you slashed meta diversity no you are just making things up ac2 5 10 are all very low heat compared to even a medium laser but that arguing at the wrong level of detail shooting at an enemy now has enormous repercussions as at any moment you could get attacked by somebody who held off of shooting and can now severly outpace and outmaneuver you this is intentional it a much more strategic system than the current ghost heat solution which is terrible and needs to die and finally penalizing clan xl for losing a side more than currently on top of the movement penalty incurred by losing the engineslots and the lower heatcap further lowering the effective movement in your system engine slot movement penalty is dumb and should not happen it should be a heat cap penalty instead like in the tt game ,1,OutreachHPG
ialdabaoth,eh proper solution is drop base heat cap to 30 set dissipation to 0 1 for singles 0 2 for doubles set capacity to 1 per heat sink regardless of single or double code in graduated heat penalties from 0 to cap with an automatic shutdown at cap 2 unless override is engaged from 10 of cap to 60 top speed accel decel turn rate twist rate and arm twist rate each decreases by 1 so at 11 you are at 1 to each at 60 you are at 40 to each from 50 of cap to 100 you take 0 1 point of internal structure damage to your head per second if your life support system has been damaged otherwise you are fine from 50 of cap to 100 you have a heat 4 chance of taking a critical hit to an ammunition slot each second so 12 at 50 of cap and 25 at 100 of cap each engine critical hit taken lowers the heat cap by 5 and lowers dissipation by 0 5 ,0,OutreachHPG

ialdabaoth,1 you can only perform one response to a given action so if you played break away and your opponent played a response say change tactics to your break away then sure you could close in in response to his change tactics but you cannot play two responses in response to one action 2 a basic rule of the game is you decide which direction to round all of your own cards and in what order to apply your own card effects so you would choose to round down to prevent more damage on the other hand if you play a card that halves your own damage you could choose to round up 3 it only counts for an incoming attack damage is only dealt after everyone response chains have been worked out ,2,tabletopgamedesign

ialdabaoth, nod yeah that one thing i am definitely trying to avoid there are currently six response cards that can deal with a strike break away lets you retreat one step and reduces your opponent accuracy by 1 if you use it during a strike close in lets you advance one step and reduces your opponent accuracy by 1 if you use it during a strike counterattack lets you attack simultaneously which does not defend you at all but at least lets you hurt them back defensive roll halves all the damage you take dodge reduces the accuracy of all their weapons by between 1 and 4 based on your reaction skill seize the initiative completely undoes the attack and gives you the next action but also untaps all their weapons and puts their strike card on the bottom of their deck so that they effectively have not used up the action slot which means they cannot perform that specific attack again but you use up an action and they effectively do not there also one move card called take cover that sets up near invulnerability for the turn but it does not have any effect at contact range and it can be thwarted by two different response cards seize the initiative and intercept ,1,tabletopgamedesign

ialdabaoth, i think you could simplify a lot if aim was a weapon itself and not some kind of pit fight well that breaks one of the core mechanics of the game instead of an attack phase like in magic each strike red card creates an attack and then provides a bonus to that attack there currently ten strike cards aim lets you pick which section to deal damage to area saturation your missiles do less damage but deal damage even if they miss barrage gain a spread of damage bonuses if you attack with several usually small weapons charge lets you move closer when you declare the attack critical hit destroys one of your enemy weapons if it hits they pick which disrupt lets you cancel one of your enemy stay in play maneuver effects you pick which knockdown your opponent can play one fewer maneuvers this turn point blank shot you can all your weapons at contact range even if they normally cannot hit at contact range smash trade accuracy for damage with one physical weapon suppressing fire trade damage for reducing reaction with your ballistic weapons if you do not have any of those cards in your hand you can play any of your maneuvers face down as a basic strike and get to shoot but you wo not get any of those listed bonuses likewise movement cards each let you move but also give you a bonus that occurs when you do so or like an mtg enchantment give you a bonus that stays in play after you have done so if you do not have a good movement card in your hand you can always play any maneuver face down as a basic move and get to move but you do not get any spiffy bonus so the basic conceit of the game maneuver system is there two basic actions you can take moving and shooting you can always perform a basic version of these actions with any card or you can play a specific card for its listed purpose and get its bonus effect applied to that action merging the weapons with the strike cards and presumably merging some of the non weapon utility equipment with the movement cards would break the game in a lot of ways because maneuvers are how the game randomizes outcome once you have a weapon it on your mech and visible until it gets blown off weapons are in mtg terms permanents while maneuvers are pells and they interact to produce an action ,1,tabletopgamedesign
ialdabaoth,that roughly what the game is already doing but a little simpler also the build from the ground up get more add ons later was something we tried in earlier builds it did not scan nearly as well as start with a fully loaded mech and slam into each other ,1,tabletopgamedesign

ialdabaoth, nod yeah that matches my intuition the problem is how to simplify which things specifically do i want to cut out of each bit ,1,tabletopgamedesign
ialdabaoth,so to sum up the past 3 posts you can fit your entire combat mechanics on about 2 pages if you use cards just use equipment card which has specific rules for the equipment printed on it and action reaction cards which have specific rules for how that action reaction plays out and let the interactions between the cards determine the flow choose suitably evocative names for your actions and it actually reads pretty well ,1,tabletopgamedesign

ialdabaoth, the canonical harry potter universe certainly does have an afterlife which is portrayed quite accurately to canon here to be fair i do not consider limbo to be an afterlife king cross station and hermione woods here are an abstraction a representation of a liminal space between life and death they are a metaphor your brain wraps around the process of moving on harry rowlings got king cross station because that was the place where the greatest journey of his life had begun where the most profound changes had happened to him in his head it was the canonical representation of leaving your life behind for something new if there an actual afterlife in harry potter it has yet to be shown or described wherever that last train goes or wherever hermione path beyond the river leads it is for them the ultimate unknown maybe wizards get some awesome heaven maybe they get some kind of hell maybe they wake up in atlantis and take off their simulation interface maybe they reincarnate we can only speculate but here in the space between a simple choice can be made go on or go back no time is passing here maybe an abstract representation of time passage is perceived but it is no more real than the gleaming white edifice of king cross or the pale misty woods by the brook or rather your mind makes it real limbo is not an afterlife it an abstract representation of the place where that choice is made harry rowlings and hermione ialdabaoth have made a choice somewhere in the timelessness where the abstract representation of their choice making algorithms formally exist beyond any material implementation of those algorithms but the harry that existed at the moment between avadra and kedavera was not a harry that could just move on and neither is my implementation of hpmor hermione of course merely not moving on is not enough something has to reimplement that algorithm or it just so much platonic wankery harry rowlings had an ace in the hole in that he had a back up soul grafted to him when he got his scar hermione the abstract mathematical description of hermione knowledge and choices and desires and perspectives has harry eliezer working on something with less ex and more deus and machina riddle rowlings had six powerful artifacts each holding a back up soul plus the one he stuck in harry once he blew those his mere refusal to move on was not enough he timelessly stuck with the desire to be reimplemented and no way to achieve it ,11,HPMOR

ialdabaoth,when i was 23 i moved from bakersfield ca to tempe az i packed everything that would fit in my little honda del sol and headed east on highway 58 somewhere in nevada i got lost and wound up driving up a narrow canyon road at 1 in the morning in the rain when i say narrow you have to understand that this was the sort of road you would expect to see mules traversing not cars forty foot sheer cliff going up on my right seventy foot sheer cliff going down on my left it was paved sure but there was no guardrail and the dotted yellow line through the middle seemed like someone idea of a joke suddenly i see a car headlights illuminating the road ahead of me motherfucker is doing 75 and on my side of the road he notices me just in time and swerves to the outside so i swerve to the inside and he whoooshes on past and then my headlight clips the rock face next thing i know my car is doing a 720 spin and that blind turn with no guardrail and a 70 foot dropoff is looming up ahead and then to my left and then behind and then to my right and then ahead again getting closer and closer i wind up pointing forward again just as i reach the edge brakes squealing and then ch thunk my front wheels are off the edge of the cliff i come to a rest wile e coyote style with my car see sawing on the edge of this canyon the headlights flooding into the little wash below i shit you not there are coyotes on the bottom of that canyon and they are staring up at me in my memory one of them even licks his lips at this point i say fuck this and try to back off but front wheel drive where are my front wheels off the edge of the cliff fm soon to be over l i roll down the back window del sols have a rear window that you can roll down unbuckle my seat belt and start to shift up out of my seat to climb out the back of my car coyotes can have my fucking laptop and clothes nope car starts leaning forward when i shift position and slides a little further off the edge so i settle niiiiice and slow back into my seat grab my cellphone and dial 911 barely have enough service this was back in 1998 but eventually i get a connection i have to explain which road i think i am on and they say they will send a police car and a tow truck i then wait one and a half hours on the edge of that damn cliff until they show up while the coyotes wait for dinner ever since that day i drive like a grandma i no longer care when i get anywhere so long as i get there in one piece ,53,AskReddit

ialdabaoth,our society values have gone out of sync with our government and economy practices this happens whenever culture progresses government jobs especially enforcement jobs will always attract the more conservative members of society and bureaucracies will always crystalize the views of the people who created them thus people who care most about law and order will be exposed to a subculture where law and order trumps fairness and common human decency and where the proper reaction to the larger culture abandonment of their values is a siege mentality even the concept of decency is co opted decency becomes about preventing women from accessing medical care because we disapprove of the procedure or preventing the wrong kind of people from marrying or jailing 15 year olds for admiring their own bodies or gang raping women with drug detection tools because we are afraid someone somewhere might enjoy themselves too much if we let them ingest the wrong substances a big part of the problem is fear of course as long as you are afraid of your kids doing drugs you are part of a chain of approval that lends force to the people who gang raped this women as long as you are afraid of your car being broken into you are part of a chain of approval that lends force to the people who break into houses and shoot dogs as long as you are afraid of your children being abducted you are part of a chain of approval that lends force to destroying a teenager life because they peed in the bushes outside a party it reasonable to take precautions but it not reasonable to let people tell you what to be afraid of teach yourself statistics and learn to read the actual numbers when a news reporter says two hundred and fifteen murders occurred in the last year in the greater metro area stop and ask yourself how many humans live in that area pull up a map and look at where those murders occurred then ask yourself what the likelihood is that a murder will happen in your neighborhood and what you can do to prevent it without involving thugs with badges of course the deepest fear is fear of your neighbors the more afraid of the outside world you are the more insular you become and the more queer and strange the neighbors seem how often do you just hang out and talk with them do you ever just invite them over for dinner when the weather gets warmer try having barbeques in the back yard and inviting everyone over robust communities are the solution to this sort of siege mentality when a swat team breaks down a door in a robust community it makes the news and the popularity of local swat teams goes down a notch as support for the siege mentality is eroded at the local level the state and federal level eventually lose the foundation of normalcy that they have built these atrocities on and bald face abuses like this become harder and harder to get away with but it starts with meeting your neighbor ,5,politics

ialdabaoth,well the problem with that is accepting that the situation was normal given the context is neo job and amy does not trust neo judgment anymore neo is called the neocortex because it the stuff that humans have that animals do not or at least do not have as much of the amygdala is part of the animal brain so good luck teaching it anything too complex for your dog to understand basically what you need to do is teach neo to make better decisions and teach amy when to shut up and give neo a few minutes to think these are separate training tasks and both are pretty damn intensive on the other hand there are some promising drugs coming out which basically use chemicals to accomplish what you just described but we have no idea how well they work or what the side effects are so we are still doing trials on animals to make sure they do not rot people brains or turn them into reavers or something else horrible here an article about it http www dailymail co uk health article 2195982 drug stop post traumatic stress disorder way successful test mice html btw thanks for the gold somebody ,12,IAmA

ialdabaoth,how much do you know about the human brain to use a metaphor your brain has a bunch of different parts to it three of those parts are called the neocortex the amygdala and the cerebellum neo a smooth operator and always has a plan if you just give him a few damn minutes to think about it amy prone to freak out and tends to solve everything by either hitting it really hard or running away from it really fast aka fight or flight the cerebellum is like the driver seat for the body the way amy and neo work is amy sits in the driver seat with her hands on the wheel and neo sits shotgun with all our maps and mission specs in his lap with me so far so when you are having a freak out what is basically happening is amy has gone bugshit and is slamming on the gas spinning the wheel and bugging the fuck out now while neo sitting in the passenger seat shouting something about minefields and going off mission and how bad the co gonna yell at us when we get back to base in an ideal brain neo got one more stripe than amy and amy respects the chain of command what you have got in ptsd is a broken chain of command because one time amy followed neo orders and things got really crazy so now when things look like they are about to get crazy amy does not trust neo orders anymore and you cannot just put neo in the driver seat check out this picture http mybrainnotes com amygdala prefrontal cortex jpg the prefrontal cortex is neo and the amygdala is amy that weird looking tree thing in the bottom back is the cerebellum neo just flat out cannot reach the cerebellum without going through amy so you are going to have to fix your brain chain of command you are going to have to work out some system to remind amy to listen to neo before amy decides that neo full of shit and she bugging them out of there this will take a lot of time and effort but remembering that it a chain of command issue should help ,255,IAmA

ialdabaoth,gladly each of these is an answer to a particular question the question in eli5 terms is why does one thing happen and not another have you ever imagined that an event might have gone differently each interpretation of quantum mechanics explains a different way that the universe decides which events happen and which events do not but keep in mind that quantum mechanics deals with very very tiny events big events like the things that you notice in your own life are made out of billions of these tiny events before they become noticable the copenhagen statistical interpretation basically says the universe rolls dice ie events are ultimately totally random and unpredictable other than to say this event is more likely than this one you cannot know which event will happen the penrose interpretation is that measurement or interaction causes collapse many people take this a step further and say conscious observation causes collapse ie nothing ever happens unless someone is there to notice it some people even go further than that and claim that conscious beings decide which event happens through some mysterious mystical process the everett wheeler interpretation says they all happen somewhen there a universe where you never got that job because someone spilled a coke on your best tie just before you walked into the interview somewhen else you met a beautiful girl at 19 and married her and had three kids somewhen else you died from a bee sting at age seven and so on and so on everything that could ever have happened happened but the more likely something is to have happened the more universes or timelines there are in which that thing happened does all that make sense ,16,IAmA

ialdabaoth,increases in automation mean that a lot of the work that is currently being done by humans can be instead done by machinery supervised by a smaller pool of humans for most of human history a small number of people have been supported in relative luxury by a much larger population of effective slaves by replacing this slave labor with technological solutions we make much of our population redundant one naive idea that technological utopianists will throw around is that we should then turn and elevate that redundant population to the same level of luxury as the ruling class the problem with this idea is that you need more than technological force multipliers you also need raw material resources and while we definitely have the technology to give everyone a life of luxury we do not have the raw material resources to do so if everybody is several billion people luckily as fertility rates drop we slowly approach a population that can be stably provided for with our technology without overburdening the environment at around 1 5 billion people we should reach a level of luxury where no one fundamentally has to perform labor unless they want to and where people can turn entirely to creative innovative or hedonistic pursuits ,3,changemyview

ialdabaoth, i hope this helps in terms of making the distinction ontologically relevant i do not see how anyone can ever act against their will since by definition one is applying their will whenever they make a choice the universe is in state s s contains a series of potential actions x1 x2 x3 x n each of which has an anticipated consequence y1 y2 y3 y n my will is just whatever neurobiological process causes me to choose a specific n there no way for me to act against my will because however i act that was my will it might be that a particular y n contains the consequence i wish i had had other options or i wish i had not had to choose to do x n but the weather can cause that just as much as other people right it seems to me that a more coherent definition of force is any action which restricts the range of choices of another agent which is sticky because if there no distinction between action and inaction then i can be guilty of a passive initiation of force and we are right back to obligatory reparations and wealth redistribution and all that ,1,Objectivism
ialdabaoth,since this discussion is being uncharacteristically fruitful would you mind if i try to challenge the part of objectivism as i understand it that i have the most trouble with ethically i am a hardcore consequentialist part of which means i have more than deontological problems with distinguishing action from inaction in fact i would say i have ontological problems with distinguishing action from inaction my comprehension of the universe manifests as a list of if i perform x y will happen with z probability hypotheses and my comprehension of myself manifests as a list of if y happening measures w utility so do nothing is just another x with no particular ontological significance to privilege it compared to blow up congress with a ray gun or buy the entire contents of a see candies and give it away one piece at a time to every child i see to put it in what i hope is closer to your language i cannot manage to understand how inaction is anything but just another action so the initiation distinction in initiation of force makes no ontological sense to me can you see how that framework makes comprehending the objectivist american libertarian definition of coercion difficult ,1,Objectivism
ialdabaoth,they were primarily in libertarian groups which is where all the randians tend to hang out it nice to know that my initial assumption was correct that they misread objectivist literature and did not actually understand it to be fair i do not think those people understood nietzsche or darwin correctly either ,2,Objectivism
ialdabaoth,nothing online just various we are all white asian here so lemme tell you how it really works face to face discussions at university ,2,Objectivism
ialdabaoth, i hate to speculate but it sounds to me like you have had encounters with some nominal objectivists who were quite bluntly very mean and uncivil people would that be correct in general yes around here objectivism tends to intersect with some particularly weird brands of neo fascism which always struck me as really really hypocritical until i spent some time trying to understand where they were coming from it mostly seems to be about a sort of survival of the fittest enforcement of the just world fallacy where force is justified if you can get away with it because weak beings are not actually people or at the very least are not worth enough economically to treat as people if that makes any sense ,1,Objectivism
ialdabaoth, so it does not sound to me like you are a comtean it sounds to me like you are simply a generous and benevolent person which is hardly the same thing as altruism as the term is used in objectivist literature fair enough but in that case i have a completely different critique by narrowing your critique to comptean altruism you are using altruism in a very different way than most people and in fact most people who call themselves randian objectivists do this is a problem with language where the semantics and the pragmatics do not always line up there are pragmatic consequences to using altruism exclusively to mean comptean altruism not the least of which is the fact that it allows certain near sociopathic douchebags to convince themselves that rand said they can be as greedy as they want and not worry about consequences ,3,Objectivism

ialdabaoth,hi altruist here i do not believe i am a fraud here my rational argument in favor of altruism the prisoner dilemma sucks more generically there a lot of situations in game theory where if you cannot trust your opponent and he cannot trust you things work out worse for both of you it turns out that in a good number of game theoretical situations mutually enforced altruism with a certain tolerance for cheating is actually far better than every man for himself because you can create a larger net wealth and create less of a power disparity between potential victims and potential predators which makes looting behaviors less appealing in less theoretical situations altruism is socially useful to people who are ideologically opposed to coercion because the more equal in fact people are the harder it is to get away with coercing them also altruism helps create environments where people are more likely to become rational and self directed and generally help the worst off behave less like animals and more like men since empirical evidence has shown that more behavioral differences between poor people and rich people are due to environment than are due to genetics it stands to reason that improving their environment will lower the risk they pose to the rest of us plenty of studies have shown that it actually cheaper and more effective to just feed clothe and house people than it is to fund military or police force and attempt to fight and contain them in their own ghettos additionally an environment where some people can get away with coercion because they have more power is an environment where people are less likely to fight coercion which turns into a nasty feedback loop massive power disparities are inherent threats to free markets and free people because they make coalition building positive feedback loops more likely now so far all of this can be considered mere benevolence rather than actual altruism because i am explaining ways in which altruism benefits me this is because i am using altruism in the game theoretical evolutionary biological sense which is where much of my expertise lies but even in the face of self sacrifice i still believe it is important to be altruistic and here why i am not going to live forever there are things which are more important to me than the mere continuation of my own hopefully pleasant sense experiences primary among these things is the continued legacy of sapient beings i want to make things better for myself but i also want to make things better for the future i consider this an aesthetic choice ultimately in the nietzschean sense i choose to call beautiful that which maximizes the power and intelligence and creativity of future sapient beings and so i inflict an artistic vision on the world that i believe will maximize the power and intelligence and creativity of future sapient beings if that means sometimes i myself have to suffer or sacrifice that okay creating the future is an artistic act ,3,Objectivism

ialdabaoth,you see a lot of the same problems in cultures without polygyny though for example american low income urban culture where you have a class of unweddable males and a class of unwed females the unweddable males are not caused by polygyny for the most part they merely correlate what is actually causative is a particular kind of cultural machismo that sets males in constant competition with each other and only considers the top n performers to be worthwhile human beings while the rest are expendable that happens independent of polygamy in a causative sense although in practice cultures that support polygyny also tend to support those competitive hierarchies the real solution is to find a way to break the stranglehold that various forms of power elite continue to enforce on the rest of us by dissolving artificial resource scarcities ,2,atheism
ialdabaoth, one it tends to favor the rich as they take many wives whom they are able to support this leaves the area in question skewed as far as available partners are concerned you are describing polygyny not polygamy in general in the situation you are describing it not polygamy that the problem it gender disparity educate and empower women and you solve that problem right fast polygamous as in just rampantly promiscuous would not be so much of an issue were it not for the resulting uptick in std that what i am discussing and the uptick in std is solvable if people stop being prudish about prophylactic protection ,1,atheism

ialdabaoth, your socioeconomic status does not preclude you from care it does if i am insufficiently motivated to keep trying well no technically my unwillingness to keep trying precludes me from care which neatly makes this all my own fault ,1,atheism

ialdabaoth,what if you have developed an underlying assumption that you cannot live your life to the fullest right now i am caught between anything i do to give meaning to my life will fail and make me more miserable and anything i do to end my suffering will fail and make me more miserable i am not sure where to go from there and it does not really matter anyways seems the most logically coherent explanation although it deeply unsatisfying and unsettling ,1,atheism
ialdabaoth,several but i have a cached overgeneralization that says if you have a goal you will fail at it period and if you think you have no goal you are wrong but trying to find out what your goals are is a goal and you will fail at that ,1,atheism
ialdabaoth, perhaps you should merely find something you truly enjoy and pursue it i have tried that but i have discovered that i typically do not have the power to pursue things that i enjoy my wetware has possibly incorrectly generalized this to if you enjoy something you will not have the power to pursue it so do not pursue anything that you enjoy and attempts to fix that have led to a second layer of generalization of any attempt to fix anything that wrong with you will fail so do not bother i am not sure what is left ,1,atheism
ialdabaoth,in my case because i feel utterly powerless in my personal life and my efforts to increase my personal power have failed often and painfully enough that i have developed a learned helplessness aversion to attempting to rectify the situation since i am powerless nothing i care about matters because it not like i can do anything about it so what is left ,1,atheism
ialdabaoth,suppose my goal is have better goals but without any capacity to evaluate what better means other than make the feeling that the goals i have now suck go away ,1,atheism
ialdabaoth,okay let me rephrase i wish to recursively optimize my optimization criteria also i am noticing a bug wherein my current utility function heuristically translates to do whatever minimizes your utility function which is introducing all sorts of g delian derp into my goal seeking behavior i have no idea where to go for help with this ,1,atheism
ialdabaoth,that is not particularly useful if you do not like the culture why not try to participate in things that would change it ,2,atheism
ialdabaoth,the thing is natural ethics is a system of ethics not meta ethics just because it possible to derive a system that if followed would maximize happiness productivity insert your favorite utility function here so what why are utility functions useful also trying to outthink the language is really all i have to work with right now it either this or charging down into the what is the meaning of meaning rabbit hole ,1,atheism
ialdabaoth,so what should one do if one head is incapable of processing should in a human normative way ,1,atheism
ialdabaoth,as a skeptical materialist who is also a low status member of a highly complex and interconnected tribe i often find myself bereft of the social defense mechanisms that many of my more superstition inclined friends use to feel better about their powerlessness and helplessness obviously delusional beliefs and behaviors are less useful for people who actually need to know how the world works and how to interact with it but sometimes low status humans wind up in situations where they are fundamentally not allowed control over their own lives and must simply find a way to mak sense of what is happening to them what processes can a rational empiricist employ to replace the comforting and self affirming utilities that most people get from their common social delusions ,-1,IAmA

ialdabaoth,that one was mine but if you ever have need to use it please use it people tend to gloss over words like aducee and amaritan incidentally i am an atheist but i spend a lot of time mulling over metaethics my usual process of deflecting questions of faith by christians is to say this look jesus himself said that there only two ultimate commandments love your god with all your heart and all your might and all your soul and love your neighbor as yourself there only three important questions to ask there 1 who is god god is love itself everyone who loves has been born of god and knows god whoever does not love does not know god because god is love if i speak in every language known to man and the angels but do not love it just empty noise if i know everything there is to know every secret of the past present and future and if i have the will and the power to reforge the earth itself to my desires but do not love everything i do and everything i know will amount to nothing if i give everything i have to the poor and suffer through terrible ordeals but i do it for attention instead of for love i get nothing out of it because the universe is winding down and someday there will be no more knowledge and there will be no more language and there will be no more power everything ends but love because love is the very process of joining and understanding and becoming one with love is simulation love is emulation and for now we only understand the barest part of that because we are operating with finite and limited hardware that can only generate finite and limited souls but as we grow in understanding if we also grow equally in love we will gradually come to embrace everything until we can understand each other fully 2 who is my neighbor anyone who needs help and anyone who can give it everyone who is capable of love is your neighbor 3 what is love baby do not hurt me do not hurt me no more love is patience and kindness love is the utter lack of envy competitiveness and pride it does not inflict harm for its own gain and it forgives freely when others inflict harm on it love never seeks or approves of harm but rejoices when an understanding is reached love always protects always trusts always hopes and always perseveres and when they press further and ask about my personal relationship with the lord jesus christ and my feelings about homosexuality and abortion and fornication i throw up my hands and say jeez guys i am still trying to wrap my head around love i am nowhere near ready to tackle all that stuff i will get back to you once i think i understand love enough but i am afraid it might take awhile ,1,atheism

ialdabaoth,a more accurate explanation a mirror actually reverses front back not left right think about it if you were looking at yourself as you are ie in the direction you are looking you would be seeing the back of your own head instead you are seeing the front of your head because the mirror is reversing aka reflecting everything in the plane of the mirror give that a minute to sink in really think about it and visualize what is going on so why do you think it a horizontal flip when really it a lateral front to back flip here where psychology comes in realistically there two ways to get from facing forwards where you would see the back of your own head to turning around so you could see your own face the first is to turn on the horizontal plane so that you are facing the other way note that this also reverses which side your shoulders on ie it flips your lateral axis and your horizontal axis the second would be to flip upside down you will be facing behind you but it will also flip your vertical axis your feet will be over your head now let say you have a mole on your left cheek you look in the mirror which is to your north since you are facing north your mole is on the westmost side of you the mirror reverses front to back producing an image of someone in front of you with their lateral north south axis reversed ie someone facing south since people do not normally turn inside out you interpret this as someone having turned around since this person has not been reversed up down or left right their head is still above their feet and the mole is still on the westmost side of their body so if you were to yaw around on the horizontal plane you would be facing south and your mole would have to flip to the other side to still be on your left cheek ie the mole would need to be on the eastmost side of your body so it viable to say the mirror image is me turned around but with left and right reversed alternatively if you were to pitch around on the vertical plane you would be facing south and your mole would still be on the westmost side of your body but your feet would be over your head so it equally viable to say the mirror image is me flipped upside down but with up and down reversed both of those are equally natural interpretations of the mirror image mathematically but here where psychology comes in how often do you see people turn around to face the other way now how often do you see people flip upside down to walk on the ceiling your brain says this person turned around and then reversed left to right because this person flipped upside down and then reversed top to bottom makes way less sense from a day to day perspective even though technically neither is true the image is just reversed front to back ,1,AskReddit

ialdabaoth,on the other hand i feel like i should soften my previous statement it sounds like you have experienced many of the same things that i have depersonalization derealization anxiety depression so you have had plenty of reason to believe that people are shit i would certainly never presume to invalidate your experiences or your right to feel angry or hurt by other people because they could not understand you or care about you when you probably desperately needed them to i have been there i guess all i am really saying is they are not doing any better than you are being normal is just a different kind of crazy and for most people it just as hard and just as stressful and just as terrifying as what we experience they just do not know any different and they have been taught to think it normal plus they are all going through it together while we tend to experience our reality isolated and alone with no one to reinforce or validate that our experiences are allowed or acceptable or even real but they are just confused terrified apes the same as we are if you have the energy to spare try to remember that they are lost too ,1,AskReddit
ialdabaoth,i strongly disagree with that interpretation most people are wonderful they just have a limited capacity for empathizing with things they do not understand and cannot experience firsthand that understandable most people are never taught how to love properly and that not their fault even those who could love properly most of them are too overwhelmed by the intensity of sharing another person pain and fear and so they very quickly learn to tune it out it bad enough carrying one own pains and one own fears in this culture trying to empathize with others is an invitation to exploitation our culture considers the kind of empathy that would have been healthy and necessary in hunter gatherer societies to be a sign of weakness and even moral failing so of course we develop all sorts of neuroses and destructive coping mechanisms to deal with the loss of connection to each other and as a result of those neuroses and destructive coping mechanisms we grow up damaged and emotionally stunted and thus unable to care for our own children and loved ones and friends and thus the cycle perpetuates tl dr people are beautiful but our culture is fucked it not their fault that they are shit they do not know how to be better ,1,AskReddit
