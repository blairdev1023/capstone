come we will face challenges we will confront hardships but we will get the job done every four years we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power and we are grateful to president obama and first lady michelle obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition they have been magnificent today s ceremony however has very special meaning because today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another but we are transferring power from washington d c and giving it back to you the american people for too long a small group in our nation s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost washington flourished but the people did not share in its wealth politicians prospered but the jobs left and the factories closed the establishment protected itself but not the citizens of our country their victories have not been your victories their triumphs have not been your triumphs and while they celebrated in our nation s capital there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land that all changes starting right here and right now because this moment is your moment it belongs to you it belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across america this is your day this is your celebration and this the united states of america is your country what truly matters is not which party controls our government but whether our government is controlled by the people january 20th 2017 will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again the forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer everyone is listening to you now you came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before at the center of this movement is a crucial conviction that a nation exists to serve its citizens americans want great schools for their children safe neighborhoods for their families and good jobs for themselves these are the just and reasonable demands of a righteous public but for too many of our citizens a different reality exists mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities rusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation an education system flush with cash but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of knowledge and the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential this american carnage stops right here and stops right now we are one nation and their pain is our pain their dreams are our dreams and their success will be our success we share one heart one home and one glorious destiny the oath of office i take today is an oath of allegiance to all americans for many decades we ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of american industry subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military we ve defended other nation s borders while refusing to defend our own and spent trillions of dollars overseas while america s infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay we ve made other countries rich while the wealth strength and confidence of our country has disappeared over the horizon one by one the factories shuttered and left our shores with not even a thought about the millions upon millions of american workers left behind the wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across the entire world but that is the past and now we are looking only to the future we assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city in every foreign capital and in every hall of power from this day forward a new vision will govern our land from this moment on it s going to be america first every decision on trade on taxes on immigration on foreign affairs
