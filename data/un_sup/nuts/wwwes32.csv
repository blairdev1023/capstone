wwwes32,i mean i am reading these right now first off half of them are pasted articles or flyers or what not but all of this sounds like a guy who likes to make pasta frankly his dad was italian it would be weirder if he did not eat pasta frequently and the cheese references are almost all within the context of forwarded articles i am guessing you did not actually look at them it really easy here https wikileaks org podesta emails q cheese mfrom mto title notitle date from date to nofrom noto count 50 sort 6 page 2 searchresult,1,conspiracy
wwwes32,you are wrong ,1,conspiracy
wwwes32,maybe it was higher grade like the 100 version but this is the sort of thing businessmen give each other what you think they just throw around 1k every year for everyone christmas gifts podesta probably buys 60 70 of those damn things and no the type of stuff they put in those boxes is gourmet definitely not cheap if you got one you would be psyched ,2,conspiracy
wwwes32,i have been watching and it been better than the last few weeks but yeah they are still struggling to put together episodic television even though they have some fun plotlines going they cannot quite make it land or to put another way i would recommend waiting for the handful of really good youtube clips before i would recommend watching the whole show ,6,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,worth noting they were sixth in viewers behind news shows among original programming they were way ahead even beat most of the abc network repeats this time ,4,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,well here what i will say since you do not want to discuss it i firmly believe that you and your lot believe there are kids being hurt in this specific location i believe you believe that you have uncovered geographical data and evidence to back this up and because of that you lot disgust me because if i thought i knew there was a place where children were being trafficked i would get off my ass and look into it or i would do whatever it took to recruit and help some people who would as much of a fool as that guy from nc looked at least he had enough intestinal fortitude and moral conviction to put himself on the line you all like to talk as if you care but you really do not do you it just uncovering a game and proving a point ,3,conspiracy
wwwes32,the context is only a little misleading it just that he saying they do not try enough with their promos rather than in the ring that most guys do not keep up the sort of raw emotional promos that he tells them to do but of course most people are not allowed to do that in the world most of the wwe lives in sami zayn is told to act like a complete spaz and walk through talking points ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,you completely misunderstood him it s just a matter of believing in myself and going out there and speaking from the heart i believe that sometimes that s something missing in some of the wwe storylines being honest and brave enough to put everything out there on the table this is why i have the reputation of quote unquote burying younger talent because i will let them do whatever they want with me and then after they get done they re not as motivated he saying that people go all out with honesty and realness and energy with promos in programs with him and he does not understand why they do not keep doing it in their next feud but surely he knows why this is the case he cannot be protected to the point he does not realize that most other wrestlers get in trouble for veering from the script if they get the chance to say anything at all ,5,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,that what i mean even if they exist the people doing that shit on the dark web are probably from 4chan do you think john podesta is on the dark web or 4chan this is a guy whose entire email archive got ganked because he fell for a phishing scheme but nah he totally up to speed on the dark web ,6,conspiracy
wwwes32,i think you have nailed why nobody has disproved this,4,conspiracy
wwwes32,god dammit you people actually got me again i do not know how i can fall for it after all this time but so we can demolish them sounded suspicious so i actually looked it up here it is in context i think you should give notice when changing strategies which have been long in place i immediately realized something was different by the shape of the box and i contemplated who would be sending me something in the square shaped box lo and behold instead of pasta and wonderful sauces it was a lovely tempting assortment of cheeses yummy i am awaiting the return of my children and grandchildren from their holiday travels so that we can demolish them do you know how to read how have you survived this long not understanding the concept of context god and that the email with the play dominos line too which just makes things even stupider since the entire conspiracy started with that fucking line the whole goddamn email was about getting a box of gourmet cheese instead of pasta which apparently is the sort of thing podesta gives as a christmas gift so what kind of warped sick mind reads this and thinks of sex of any sort maybe he just got beat at dominos and it an inside joke replace dominos with baseball or basketball and then tell me it sounds like sex talk here is a pasta gift box https www harryanddavid com h gift baskets tower boxes specialty gift boxes 28717 here is a cheese gift box the same price as the pasta one but comes in a square shaped box instead of a collander https www harryanddavid com h gift baskets tower boxes specialty gift boxes 28297 i am pretty sure i just figured out the exact things that podesta sent this guy so i guess if you want to bring down this whole pedophile ring make a trip to a fairly nice mall and this took me all of 20 minutes maybe how have people spent their lives for months on something this easy to knock down ,20,conspiracy
wwwes32,so your evidence that it was not just some guy at 4chan making things up is that a guy at 4chan posted something he said was real this despite the fact that it has never been a known euphemism and does not even make sense because one thing we can all agree on is that nobody uses pizza or pasta to describe pornography ,8,conspiracy
wwwes32,it not actually a long established code word it was a meme from 4chan because 4chan was a place that actually did host and trade child pornography on multiple occasions ,15,conspiracy

wwwes32,not as much as local governments can be local governments and police departments literally get away with murder quite frequently not even just in a we have to shut this person up way frequently just in a this guy needs to learn some respect way and going past that the idea of ethics in local government is just laughable you should consider yourself lucky to have a government that will actually even consider paying attention to citizen requests many of them are run by the chamber of commerce ,2,conspiracy

wwwes32,ambrose gets the chance to go off script too i am sure miz and dolph are allowed to embellish when they want to also but i mean there only so much you can do when the only motivation they can give you for your character is you are supposed to fight that guy ,4,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,the big picture they do right but they cannot script a good episode of television to save their life a lot of people seem to have enjoyed last night show but if you showed it to anyone who does not regularly watch they would say it was still shitty ,-2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,i do not even care about the logistics of it one of the core parts of wrestling is the irish whip and that makes no sense at all but oh man am i sick of these dives they do not mean anything at all at this point because everyone does them frequently they will do a spot where three people dive out in a row and then occasionally they will do one where some big dude like roman does a dive and we are supposed to act like it was some huge deal fuck that it a boring and really predictable moment ,2,SquaredCircle

wwwes32,ironically and depressingly that was her actual gimmick in nxt the one that made her a top babyface that how pathetic wwe is they take a gimmick that works and just throw it out the window in order to make this white bread bullshit vince thinking a burrito is a steak and ketchup wrap is a perfect analogy for how he runs the company almost the entire world hears that and think it sounds ridiculous and disgusting but he does not give a shit he does not even know that this is the case he takes something as delicious as a burrito and deliberately makes it dull and gross because that what he thinks people want ,2,SquaredCircle

wwwes32,that the whole gimmick she is not good at doing promos she is just someone that wants to entertain fans and prove herself while everyone around her just acts like she a dork she is a stand in for the shy kids especially girls when she was in nxt she was so over unbelievably so because they booked her as someone that just did not say a whole lot but came out on top in the end but then everyone in nxt looks better because nxt is not primarily written by izzy mandelbaum,3,SquaredCircle

wwwes32,well it totally is the problem is that as soon as a story starts in wwe you can instantly say what the ending is going to be with a little variation but not much and that because not only are the stories recycled but because the usual answer for the ending is just and then they will have their match and put on a pretty good show if they put someone else in charge of creative someone that actually had to produce results to keep that job then they would be able to make the show something that you actually wanted to watch week to week founders syndrome vince has a vision of the show and only approves things that match his vision but he an old man ,7,SquaredCircle

wwwes32,hey it took almost a year of people microscopically examining this stuff to figure it out i would say that was not really fouling it up if i am right these guys were not master hackers they just were in the right position to open backdoors that why shit seems so weird it not that the dnc talk about russian hackers was a coverup it that a few individuals tricked the entire planet it a dr strangelove type plot played out in real life or not the only thing i think can be said with certainty now is that guccifer 2 0 likely never existed at least not in the form we have thought he existed ,2,conspiracy
wwwes32,i think roman would be a better heel than finn would and finn is a better underdog face than roman so i am 100 on board if their plan is to build finn up as the top generic babyface while roman turns to the dark side for a bit otherwise yeah i like finn but i would rather have the fun guy who loves the fans than the one that makes long speeches ,1,SquaredCircle

wwwes32,but the languages were changed in an attempt to cover tracks and this was done in what was supposed to be an attempt to prove that they were the ones who had these files even though they were not the same files the only way this is not suspicious is if they just opened a completely different file copied pasted text in then renamed it or something but again why when that totally seems to disprove the very thing you are trying to prove i do not think this is the dnc acting on an organizational level though because that does not make sense either because why would they go to the trouble of creating new files when they had access to the old ones granted i have been a believer that seth rich was involved in all this for awhile anyway but now it seems way less likely that russia was involved because we can now see guccifer 2 was on the inside all along ,3,conspiracy

wwwes32,he literally just said that the entire roster of just about any indie promotion or roh is better than the entire roster of wwe overgeneralizing in terms of how many promotions but still it a little demented to say this when wwe constantly poaches most of the top people from those promotions anyway i do not particularly care about his star ratings but i admit that i have had a curiosity in the sense of geez what will it take and i am a little less interested now because the answer is now clearly that it just a deliberate choice ,6,SquaredCircle

wwwes32,i am definitely not a trump supporter and a lifelong democrat but this seems solid an alternate explanation is that there was a leaker or collection of leakers that wanted to cover their tracks by appearing russian and another interesting thing to note is that warren flood specialty is in big data just like seth rich and i believe the person who was found responsible for leaking info about dnc fucking with bernie in dec 2015 was as well was there some small group of people that were conducting a secret war against the dnc from the inside and if so did one of them kill their own member seth rich this might be a little too conspiratorial even by r conspiracy standards but it late so whatevs ,18,conspiracy

wwwes32,what is needed to solve this is pretty simple surveillance videos and statements from anyone involved in his death anything else only proves that he was involved in the hack but i am guessing he was not alone in that the only person that can really blow this open if there anything to be blown open is assange he would have to violate wikileaks policy of revealing sources in order to do so but if he actually had communication revealing what actually happened he could change everything in a flash ,12,conspiracy
wwwes32,he was the guy behind megaupload if you remember that file sharing site that was full of ads and ran premium service for faster download speed pretty widely known at the time as the web based service with the loosest policies about illegal content i had not actually read his wiki bio but he has a pretty sleazy history that goes back quite a long time selling access to corporate phone systems selling stolen phone card numbers insider trading blowing all of it on mansions cars women etc he basically a gangster of the internet ,2,conspiracy

wwwes32,the problem is that he knows that will never ever happen and everyone else knows it will never ever happen so conveniently he says he not allowed to produce anything whatsoever until this thing happens that we all know will never ever happen so if he actually had the evidence the morally correct thing to do would be to release it to the public where at minimum it could be used to force an actual investigation but he does not have the evidence and the easiest way for him to pretend otherwise is to just say that he cannot also he is completely wrong that he would have to come here to have admissible evidence in the first place it not common but it is definitely possible to give testimony without being in the us especially for circumstances like a political assassination ,4,conspiracy

wwwes32,there are people for whom this is likely true but to believe every politician is like this is just playing into the hands of the people that do not want people to actually participate joe biden does not get rich off this shit bernie sanders has money but not laughing his way to the bank money dennis kucinich never got rich and never will hundreds of congressmen were elected as members of the middle class and will stay that way believing stuff like the op just leads you to think that you need to elect people who are not politicians and that not going to help fix anything ,6,conspiracy
wwwes32,assange all but outright stated rich was the source a long long time ago when the seth rich controversy originally started whether rich was the leaker really should not be in question the question is who made it possible unless we get proof rich was a master hacker or something i will continue to be pretty sure that he was a mule for russian hackers ,-1,conspiracy
wwwes32,anyone paying attention knew assange knew believed rich was the leaker ages ago ,2,conspiracy
wwwes32,i guess it the eternal question of whether wwe strategy of let piss off weekly television viewers because they will keep watching because they are pissed off actually works for them and i mean i do not really care much either way because i am not that emotionally invested in orton anyway i am just reading the room ,4,SquaredCircle

wwwes32,the question is to what degree did his team work with russia to coordinate efforts you are not even supposed to do that with pacs though both sides do but doing that with a foreign government would be treason what is the answer to that question well we do not know because we have no official details of the investigation yet we just know that it happening and that there at minimum a small fire under all this smoke ,2,politics
wwwes32,it not like this is some new thing they are doing in response to the story either they have had one seth rich meme or another on their front page basically every day since before the election ,3,politics

wwwes32,he probably was tho if you think hillary and podesta do not murder people it the only logical explanation and even if you think they do you still have to explain how he got access to every user inbox which would require significant access to their mail servers basically of the sort that only a small handful of people in an organization ever have and those people would not have titles like data director ,0,conspiracy

wwwes32,nobody should be celebrating these ratings for either show ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,i ask this because that where i am at i do not think that either the republicans or democrats orchestrate murder so my logical conclusion given that we know the russians have a well funded hacker team devoted to shenanigans and that we had multiple intelligence reports saying that russia was involved in the election is that they probably killed him if i thought that the clintons killed people i might be inclined to think differently but i just do not think they are smart enough to get away with it not when they have been thoroughly investigated for decades and have so many political enemies in every direction so the only logical explanation is russians which to me makes more sense anyway because we know definitively that they do in fact kill people for political reasons ,2,conspiracy
wwwes32,god it just so bad now i have not even been all that interested in watching in a few weeks i thought it would get better after they finished the cross brand stuff but nope still just a whole lotta nothing and i mean imagine a scenario where everything else was the same but it could be proven beyond all doubt that the dnc and the clintons did not order the murder of seth rich what would be your conclusion as to seth rich death given the circumstances as we understand them now would you conclude it had nothing to do with wikileaks ,2,conspiracy
wwwes32,oh both shows are bad right now something happened after mania and i have no idea what but all of a sudden neither show is very good or seems to have any direction ,2,SquaredCircle

wwwes32,yeah but it follows the same pattern they always follow when they decide they do not give a damn about what is going on at the moment the most glaring example i recall back in december for the ko roman match just announce something out of nowhere weeks before it going to happen then half ass book a bunch of matches for weeks and weeks that wo not mean anything because the match has already been made who gives a fuck that it terrible tv they do not care if anyone watches anyway and they are already going to be booking these matches at all the live shows so this just cuts out a step if vince was a producer for any real television show he would get fired by the network nobody should be paid for this shit ,2,SquaredCircle

wwwes32,dozens and dozens of threads happening because a paid private investigator says that there more that he should be paid to investigate which leads to not only the conclusion that it must be true but also that it can only mean one thing regardless of whether that thing actually seems true i do not care how insecure your email server is a random staffer having access to everyone mailbox files is laughable and if your email server is that insecure i do not think you would actually be technically capable of telling who accessed it i happily invite everyone on reddit that believes this is doable to try and download their company mail files see what happens ,1,conspiracy

wwwes32,at least russo wrote unique stuff i would take cheap and trashy over their half assed recycled nonsense any day i used to think the 2k games rivalry simulators were far too simplistic but now they are pretty much dead on how many times have they repeated the heel pretends to fight but backs away from the ring slowly trope seems like it been almost every week ,9,SquaredCircle

wwwes32,the problem they have is that it is frequently a fun show but rarely ever a good show which means that the moments it stops being fun are just excruciating the company needs a new person that runs creative day to day someone that is not old enough to be the great grandfather of half the people in the crowd founders syndrome what are you gonna do of course a larger problem they have when it comes to crowd reaction is that just about every match is interrupted by one commercial break frequently two i have not been in the audience for raw or smackdown but i cannot imagine any of it feels like it moves at a good pace ,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,i really do not know why people mention one night stand as if it a meaningful example of cena being hated rather than just an instance of tribalism it was not about cena it was about the idea of the wwe poster child encroaching on ecw poster child rvd throw just about anybody into cena place and they get the same reaction they could have gotten the rock booed if they gave him the same build i can say that i have no recency bias because i never watched anything in cena heyday until after i would been watching current wwe for several months the hate is not even close to the same cena got mostly cheers for a very very long time i do not think the boos start to be truly noticeable on a consistent level until late 2010 or so ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,roddy piper had they live and starred in numerous other low rated movies jericho had limited outside success too but you generally do not see many wwe guys in general because vince wo not let them do anything he does not approve and he only approves certain things for certain people that and the grueling schedule keeps them from auditioning for anything ,1,SquaredCircle

wwwes32,this is how i feel as well i have hated his commentary since i first started watching raw again back in 2015 everywhere he goes becomes the worst commentary team in the company excluding nxt before the brand split it was raw after it was smackdown granted mauro kept things as good as they could be now it really is unequivocally the worst and then learning what we did basically just explained why that was a phenomenon because he a douchebag that cares more about teasing people or being the loudest one at the table than he does about calling the match ,15,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,well they did lose most of their code to mtv pretty sure but even then porting stuff over is not as easy as just copying and pasting if you are a small company that does not have access to the sort of code libraries to make that task faster i mean if it was actually cost effective to port most of it over do not you think they would have done that ,4,Rockband

wwwes32,it why test is the most underrated wrestler of all time ,5,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,i disagree because adr would be in all of them,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32, your mom sucks cesaro has gotten as far or further than he should in the wwe the raw women division is 1000 times better without charlotte in it she was a beautiful vine that choked out everything else in the garden ,9,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,i did not say that it was the case ten years ago but now so many options apart from impact then disappearing would be a blip ,0,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,wwe could make it known that anyone who signs a contract with impact will be blacklisted and destroy them without paying a cent it is only through benevolence and a desire to skirt monopoly laws that impact is allowed to continue to exist in its current form ,-4,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,your post was so shitty it went round the other side and deserved gold,3,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,which would also mean kralkatorrik jormag primordus ,3,Guildwars2
wwwes32,not a lost watcher huh ,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,if i thought it looked like a pen that would write well i might have,2,adultswim
wwwes32,dude i just now almost spent 3 on their damn pen because ooh adult swim and then was like why am i spending money on a visibly shitty pen ,3,adultswim
wwwes32,i think nearly all people at least on this board agree that matt has the moral right to his creation but that is basically meaningless ,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,i do not think she anywhere near biggest several other people get bigger reactions ,12,SquaredCircle
wwwes32, that and fucking dae facials expressions everywhere but it okay to talk about luke harper facial expressions or about nakamura body language ,5,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,do not knock roman he pretty great in the ring a lot of people who have been in the ring with him have said so and i do not think they are just being polite when roman in the ring i know that no matter what i am going to see a story being told but yeah until vince relinquishes control of creative roman wo not turn or become a true tweener he will just keep on riding the edge of being awesome without ever going over it ,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,you were detecting sarcasm but there was none intended ,4,SquaredCircle
wwwes32, insurers still cannot deny people coverage outright http time com money 4763609 pre existing conditions ahca as was a common practice before the aca passage but they can hike up premiums to an unaffordable amount effectively pricing people out of the market that why ,11,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,i would not read about it here but i am guessing the op is referring to the bits about no longer covering pre existing conditions which in the us can mean any serious medical condition if you get depressed and are treated for it that can mean they can refuse you insurance coverage if you lapse in coverage you can imagine why denying treatment for preexisting conditions could really cause problems for independent wrestlers but yeah if you have universal healthcare feel lucky that you never have to think about whether you can afford blood work or an x ray ,7,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,they forgot the last line that would read this week in wwe ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,they should go the pokemon route and call them the ruby and sapphire championships or why stop there why cannot roman reigns become the first ever wwe heartgold champion ,8,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,i did not even know how much i wanted to say this until i saw it here i am not even someone that typically makes comments like that but holy cow people need to shut the hell up about this they act like making comments about women in skimpy clothes is an act of sexual deviancy on reddit of all places that said the person that made drawings of alexa bliss feet went too far they just did ,29,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,also much like george lucas vince has an obsession with trying to make his stuff appeal to little kids without understanding why his stuff used to appeal to kids in the first place ,10,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,with respect you are totally wrong about the total divas thing i wish it were not true but all the total divas people have a very strong social media following and always get cheers why do you think naomi was so quick to get a big reaction when she got her push ,6,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,i think you may have scarred me by proxy,3,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,not to mention that if they let cena loose he would just fucking wreck roman on the mic ,6,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,and let be real it not like wwe has a long history of being untouchable in cable they have been dropped and moved around many times ,0,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,he said that sami zayn neurotic bits were him getting buried and mocked too and that has not played itself out either if they were going to do a dig which why would they it would not be this subtle ,4,SquaredCircle
wwwes32, they were asked about the raw ratings being down and what they need to do to fix that going into usa network negotiations they worry more about the level of fan engagement not the tv quarters barrios mentioned having great talents split between two brands and noted that one may be doing better than the other at times but they are excited about what goes on with raw and smackdown wilson mentioned how the nielsen ratings is not their only tool to measure with these days they are not worried about social media being cannibalistic to tv and the wwe network they see social media as a rising tide and do not believe it takes away from traditional viewing their goal is to engage the younger generations and bring them over to long term viewing i did not hear the full answer but if this is representative of it holy cow do they not want to talk about ratings that is some grade a misdirection ,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,no japanese wrestler in the history of the company has gotten the push nakamura is getting,11,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,i will take stories more popular than what wwe currently rips off for 800,96,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,is it just me or is he talking about wrestling more than he used to could be that nostalgia starting to kick in bear in mind more than he used to only meaning twice in a blue moon instead of once ,345,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,that narrative is less fun though and actually would cause people to start taking the 2018 elections seriously so of course they are not going to go with that ,1,politics
wwwes32,i never watched any wwe during punk entire run so i have been going back i am currently at 2012 leading up to mania and to see the difference between punk then and in this clip is incredibly sad ,29,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,i remember once in school i had a teacher that i realized was not actually reading our answers only making sure there was something in the blank i started with just random words then eventually built up to writing insults about the teacher this went on for a couple of months until he found out and sent me to the principal office which was really not the right move because the principal was super pissed that my teacher was not grading correctly and he got fired at the end of the year ,1,Kanye
wwwes32,agree i love both those songs they just lift my spirit ,6,Kanye
wwwes32,i would cheer for martin shkreli if he ran in to attack roman reigns,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,which is true for the most part but you definitely cannot say a lot of people are thinking of wwe as something they should definitely watch live every week ,29,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,i mean aj styles gets a good match out of anyone so there that but i think the feud that would most resonate would be seth rollins i am not sure how exactly you set it up but i think those two would really have heat ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,access to his tailor,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,your wedding,3,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,what were you doing during the months when you were buried alive and when you showed back up to stop the fake undertaker ,3,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,well except that the numbers climbed through the second hour but interpret how you like ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,i thought it was pretty over the top but after reading comments apparently not,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,is not it clear that this means he going back to his old farmer character big bartholomew so one assumes he gunning for john johnson on a more serious note the image of rusev line dancing to this song in some country bar amuses the hell out of me ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,this might actually happen,3,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,welp time for ko to beat the everloving hell out of y2j,3,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,oh man my heart just jumped they cannot turn becky,5,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,do not even like answering this question anymore because it feels like i am just teasing myself but of course it roman every time he goes heel he gets a huge reaction way bigger than now even he worked heel for a single night after wrestlemania and he got the biggest reaction i have heard for anyone in a very long time he a natural every single thing that he does as a face would feel more natural as a heel ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32, ambrose is the most natural heel strongly disagree ambrose can work as a face pretty damn well and when reigns works heel he looks like a fucking supervillain ,4,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,they can at least take solace in the fact that their hard work seems to be almost universally exciting for the player base ,4,Guildwars2
wwwes32,so almost definitely legit leaks they should be proud of it though this seems so awesome if there are people disappointed by what we saw there there are not very many that was not the case for hot ,3,Guildwars2
wwwes32,yeah i cannot believe we are getting shout as a vocalist i am fucking psyched ,6,Rockband
wwwes32,i do not know how anyone could accuse you of being anything but a friend to this franchise you are not happy with how things have gone and that just how it is nobody can really be thrilled at how things are going we all wish it were like it used to be even especially harmonix ,1,Rockband
wwwes32,shush we used to not even get that can you imagine how much less fun it would be to find out we were getting two relicenses two days before it happened ,1,Rockband
wwwes32,they want you to think about prince another guy whose unusual affectations masked a serious badass underneath albeit this time meaning on guitar ,3,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,totally a personal opinion but to me it just sounds off ,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,here what i figure their logic is the language of pro wrestling moves is pretty universal especially when that move is a running knee to the face the only part that could seem strange to a crowd in oklahoma city or el paso is that he behaves differently than anyone else on the roster and it a very obvious affectation calling him a performance artist is their attempt to explain that away do i think it necessary or done in the best way they could do it not really but i get why someone like vince mcmahon would immediately throw king of strong style out the window ,0,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,martial artist it right in the name ,-1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,eh he an artist in the sense that he uses flair and odd moves to throw his opponents off their game it masks the true nature of his offense which is actually pretty brutal i do not necessarily agree with their strategy it seems like the sort of thing that they should have rethought but i get why they were trying to come up with something else ,0,SquaredCircle
wwwes32, there is a style that is strong and the motherfucker is the king of it it not very complicated the moment he knees someone in the head or if they take 20 seconds to talk about it like graves did on his nxt debut you will be like oh i get it which would be fine if it was a phrase that rolled off the tongue and felt natural to the english language but it is not it awkward ,-16,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,tjp is the type of guy that asks if he can use your netflix,5,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,speaking as someone who is mostly unfamiliar with japan wrestling and was introduced to nakamura through nxt i feel relatively comfortable saying that most people do not know what the fuck that means and that ignoring the fact that it is an awkward phrase to begin with ,32,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,notunga really has been my favorite time of the year so far i really wish they would consider keeping him he a great fit ,89,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,he has a chinese knockoff that he got from a guy at a bar in santa fe,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,ambrose has no sleep schedule that shit is 24 7,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,of course foley is the guy that gives other people your number,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,you know miz vs lesnar would be funny,3,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,dean you got your ass handed to you,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,enzo is so great on the mic he has stayed over without a single good feud the entire time they have been on the main roster ,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,you have not been here the last eight months eh ,3,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,wow they are hell bent on making sure alexa looks strong it working frankly ,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,it a nasty one,5,SquaredCircle
wwwes32, oh if only there were some mechanism that professional wrestling could use to coalesce opinion behind one of the stars perhaps one day someone will finally crack that code ,3,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,they still could have made it work if it was used as a means to make a new bray that was more dangerous and replied less on pageantry and other people fighting for him instead they ruined him to the point that he has go away heat even from the people that liked him ,3,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,well they were trying to do something spooky without any actual scary elements to it it like a really bad haunted house by a church group or something kids do not like that shit edit if you were anywhere near being a kid in early 90s wcw and you are downvoting this comment you need to think back on how you felt about a lot of that ,-3,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,itt people who do not understand what kids are like,-2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,how far can you go for a cause and keep your identity i am greatly disappointed that he chose not to make waves but he is doing a lot to help by jumping back into normalcy and unapologetically making the best of his situation i mean that such a big thing by itself he did not start asking for forgiveness because he knows he should not have to ,4,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,hey check out my new knee,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,blood is too violent a term you see ,69,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,the most ironic part is that new day are probably the only people that could make this title not sound cringe but now they are no longer on raw ,98,SquaredCircle

wwwes32,five times in one sentence with one instance hir that does not even have the right letter close to the wrong one no can honestly say i have not ,13,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,and yet according to meltzer they wonder why he does not have more drive smdh,23,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,oh wow yeah he had some real awfulness ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,everybody talks about the loss of miz nobody talks about the loss of dean ambrose who was also integral to the success of smackdown i know that he gets shit on here but think about his interactions with miz aj ellsworth bryan shane he was a linchpin and i think he created a pretty big void even if it is not as noticeable as miz having lost those two plus cena and daniel bryan basically makes the show feel like it lost its soul ,113,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,it really does i do not think vince thought this timing through all the way ,77,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,to the extent that it provides some indication of what is and is not working on the show in the us and because it is basically the only metric usa gives a shit about which could definitely impact the company once their negotiations start up again and make no mistake these numbers are bad those 18 49 numbers are basically 25 down from what they were in february with the same number of viewers ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,accurate,3,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,david arquette ,0,SquaredCircle

wwwes32,i was hoping that they would take her further into the crazy cat lady persona but i have to admit that she looks pretty good as the leader of this combo ,39,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,that how you can tell when a conspiracy might not be conspiracy it full of human imperfections and sticks out like a sore thumb to anyone who is actually looking and it sort of terrifying ,2,conspiracy
wwwes32,kevin owens baron corbin enzo cass finn balor probably would be had he not been injured ,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,he their go to starter boss ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,to be fair let them try for awhile can frequently mean wait and see if the fire goes out on its own before we try the extinguisher in wwe it still too early but i get why some people would be concerned ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,nakamura is not a rookie or green in any sense he a veteran and also relatively old a better equivalent would be booker t or obviously aj styles that being said you are not wrong at all he is in a perfectly acceptable spot for someone as new and different as he is and with the number of people whose primary question is is he gay you understand why they want to make his introduction seem gradual ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,a lot of people have wondered this and i cannot say they are really wrong to do so go on youtube or other social media and you will see people asking the same question ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,there are so many topics that get posted here and attempts at a series that it could be difficult to really get another one started you could try stuff like let talk about wrestlemania 21 with a reference list of matches and perhaps a few links images and you would probably get some people that would be glad to discuss that something that i think i would be interested in at least ,4,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,50 off,167,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,got me two of my favorite albums of all time and several big hits at a relatively low price i do not even think i played much of the actual game i just was crazy about getting all that green day ,15,Rockband
wwwes32,i got around this by naming my lights after the seven dwarves,5,googlehome
wwwes32,that what made his debut special tho lots of people myself included watching to see what the hype was about this is actually slowly deflating his momentum ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,eh he not like mojo where his background shows he truly sacrificed and worked his ass off he got an opportunity early on could not hack it and then got fired not exactly a story of hardship when you were on tv almost every single week ,-1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,even when it does not make a ton of sense upon close examination ,3,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,ok yeah that what i thought i remembered that he really pissed off some people before he would even really started i guess they did not think he was good enough to be called up and given the chance to piss people off further ,3,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,good storytelling is a simple story with complex characters and themes this was needlessly complex and had next to no characterization or purpose it is almost the exact opposite of good storytelling ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,yeah and he got that note why would he go to the lengths of actually having some random stagehand walk by to give him a fake note then tell the camera that he had a partner if it was not supposed to be bray that legitimately is bad storytelling and confusing ,3,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,fuck the haters i thought this was funny ,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,i do not think it will be anywhere near the worst i have no hype for it and nothing about the matches seems particularly interesting but nothing seems like it will be a shit show either ,0,SquaredCircle

wwwes32,sportskeeda is not a real source ,8,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,and you are arguing that a public statement consisting of one sentence in response to a newsweek article immediately after signing an nda invalidates weeks of evidence contradicting said statement good god never vote or make investments man ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,jbl has nothing to do with hiring firing even if he was the cause of an incident that precipitated the agreement to terminate the contract lots of people pretending to be dense because they want to kill off the jbl bullying narrative it weird,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,he did not clear him he said the termination of his contract was unrelated to jbl and it definitely was legally speaking ,2,SquaredCircle

wwwes32, looks much more like,-1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,i am saying that you pay someone money to say something they say it and both parties agree to not change that story maybe it not a boilerplate nda but that probably the sort of thing he signed ,0,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,according to dax metzler of the wrestle observatory,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,i think that a shit ton of people fuck up names on air and do not get fired within outside of wwe ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,for now would not be shocked if he coincidentally retired in a month or two ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,elaborate i am pretty sure it about whatever they want it to be if they wanted mauro to say that kevin dunn was the most beautiful man he ever laid eyes on as part of it then he would be obligated to say it and never say he was lying ,0,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,it means whatever the hell they want it to mean how do you think hush money works you do not sign an nda and then go but seriously they definitely did something wrong that defeats the purpose ,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,because maybe the potential audience looks much more like the 18 25 hardcore audience in here than the middle aged women wearing roman reigns t shirts just throwin it out there ,-1,SquaredCircle

wwwes32, although advertising a six pack 1 contender match where half the participants were complete jobbbers probably did not help dunno why you got downvoted i was totally underwhelmed by that going in my excitement level for that match was pretty much nil and then half the rest of the show was about charlotte the most overexposed and overrated person on the roster i absolutely get why people would choose to do something else with their time ,1,SquaredCircle

wwwes32,there not really any other main roster heels on raw though bray is with finn joe is with rollins they took all the heels away there not really any other main event heels unless nah not gonna get tricked into hoping again ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,cow tipping match strowman has probably trained all his life for that one ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,who is roman next feud gonna be then i wonder maybe he will just beat up anderson gallows some more surely they would not keep the braun thing going through june ,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,nostalgia shmostalgia find me someone who was better corey graves is nearly there last week miz hid behind maryse to stop sami zayn from doing a dive and he yelled out what a brave wife that was heenan tier for sure ,9,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,that makes one hell of a lot more sense than any of those six becoming 1 contender even sami at least when the current champ is randy orton god yeah this makes so much sense corbin character would be insanely pissed at being left out ,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,just because we are mentioning heenan it needs to be said once again that there has never been anyone better nobody has ever been able to touch what that guy did off the top of his head not even heyman ,16,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,did not even have to be a hook for next week you felt like if you were not watching the end you were really missing out as cool as the spot at the end of last night was that entire match and storyline was mostly skippable because even if you did not guess the finish you knew that it did not mean anything ,4,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,for sure the audience has to feel that you mean what you are saying in order to really and truly connect this is especially true for the babyfaces someone like seth rollins has a really fun side as a heel that has just been abandoned because they want to write him to be something that does not feel like him ,0,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,the characters now are as good as ever they just do not have very good dialogue and the performers do not get very much creative freedom the people who do get that freedom like bray new day enzo ko ambrose they really do feel larger than life ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,at this point the only thing really and truly missing is weekly plot development during the ae every episode had meaningful progression of some sort for any feud that was happening now they frequently just consider continuing a feud to be simply having a match ,15,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,wow longtime really longtime ,50,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,i feel like he would want us to carry on with life as usual ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,kane has to be the most iconic ,33,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,or do not look back in anger,2,Rockband
wwwes32,sort of twisting the knife to be thanking him ,-7,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,i am interested in hearing more about yall relationship ,3,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,cm punk ryback cody rhodes suck a dick dumbshits ,9,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,ew why did you draw attention to that,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,somehow the competition for us title is higher than for wwe title,43,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,i do not always love when it clearly a bit but they are making it quite good ,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,i thought i was the only one watching it maybe,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32, this has been a treat booker forever,6,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,big show new physique has done wonders for his credibility he was jobbing for awhile ,3,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,i remember the introduction of the name big show and how dumb it seemed now i cannot imagine anything else ,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,is that gallagher ride along entirely in kayfabe ,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,well they are the real actors playing the guys it a weird meta drama playing itself out as they slowly are driven insane by their own commercials ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,anyone who did not watch smackdown has to be baffled by heath talking about above ground pools and rhyno eating cheez wiz ,10,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,please cesaro and jeff show them why they would be dumb to let this match be short ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,this end of it passes the bechdel test too,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,how did they get penn gillette in that dreck ,-1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,you will be receiving a job offer from the wwe on wednesday ,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,worse he looks like an art school weirdo,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,did not wwe send out a survey about what the hell a house of horrors match should be ,3,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,was also in roger rabbit tho,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,are we all just ignoring that axe found a white abed ,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,why are they telling finn to stay stone faced is he going heel ,3,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,alexa and bayley have worked pretty good matches before too ,0,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,wwe network basically becoming their death star in the wrestling universe ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,ok this is really making me realize what a value wwe network is,7,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,livin their that 70s show characters,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,and always just pure luck,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,screw the haters this match is damn good,6,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,anyone else hear i will always love you when nia picked up mickie ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,ember got those thick legs i bet she could,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,with the alfredo i think not ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,seems like it was building up steam hopefully commercial does not kill that,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,mickie looks at nia like woman i dealt with beth phoenix ,9,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,alexa bliss almost cheating the system by being so likable outside kayfabe ,5,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,she has kids now,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,axe jumping on that jbl look bandwagon at a bad time,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,titus look like he selling a timeshare,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,i am interested to see what these two guys can do in just a slightly planned match on raw ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,am loving the first night of notunga,7,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,is neville in point of fact king of the wwe cruiserweight division out of kayfabe gotta be right he amazing ,4,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,he can go on the mic in a non funny way they just keep having him go silly british ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,yup definitely sounds about right more build to lesnar feud ,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,gallagher skull gotta be made of rock or something,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,past the first 20 minutes,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,i could not get into it,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,is that a slang term for asshole i do not know ,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,who do not like this it fun,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,austin aries another example of a guy that really found his persona as a face by a corrective heel turn it works wwe ,3,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,when ambrose is on his game he gives me goosebumps,3,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,i swear miz is indistinguishable from some posters here,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,ok miz is just browsing the front page for ideas,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,be more proud,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,i want to see joe riding on braun back just wrecking all sorts of shit together,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,good guy jericho continuing to put over more guys before leaving,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,joe not exactly convincing with the upward punches,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,what the fuck are they doing with the commentary why do not they just put the match in a little box to the corner and we will watch rollins injury recovery promo again,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,i sort of picture joe just ordering four fried chickens and a coke,0,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,we should come up with a name for this period of celebration notunga maybe ,101,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,patience who knows they might build this through to mania ,5,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,at least its a little better in that there a faster recovery and an injury that seems less likely to be debilitating in future i am sure it wo not be fun but it not something that can destroy a career,35,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,let not go crazy,4,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,would have been great if it was not inexplicably mickie james or if she had a better reason,9,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,i blame god ,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,pasta salad sounds about right the kind that has no flavor and just tastes like eating noodles and mayo and it super frustrating because you really do like pasta salad when it actually made right ,3,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,i do not think they meant done with life more like done with watching raw for awhile ,3,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,this bulgarian is my destiny,3,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,especially since they do not actually start building these things until much later in the year ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,holy bejeezus old man sheamus looks like the toughest bastard i have ever seen ,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,never,5,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,i fucking love booker his weirdness just makes it so you never know what to expect from him i remember him pumping up ko by saying canadians are just natural athletes which is such an odd thing to say ,5,SquaredCircle
wwwes32, jax proclaimed this championship is mine bayley i cannot read this without hearing that weird muppet voice she was using,5,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,please obviously jinder is just acting at jbl behest because finn would not let jbl touch his butthole ,20,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,yeah too bad they dont have stronger faces if only there were a character so good at putting babyfaces over that he could get braun strowman a big pop ,3,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,it a joke about vince and not the subject of the joke also,9,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,ugh whatever i am so sick of how hard they are trying to push op presumably adorable daughter,8,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,open but it not something that comes up often,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,like the tenth video of paige bouncing i have seen this month,3,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,also apparently the best way to have fun is soaping up butts and stealing people stuff or getting them arrested thank christ i was born in the age of the internet when you can have fun without going insane ,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32, at the heart of this entire issue is the passive submissive over entitlement of today s society there it is,12,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,they are so close to already back what with all the people keeping long hair with shaved sides ,17,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,and a shitty commentator that part too often gets lost ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,we found out he gayest than we thought he was and he is no longer safe to be within twenty yards of bas rutten ,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,or they think jbl is shit at his job much more so than several of the people he was hazing bullying or they relate with mauro because they have mental illness or know someone else who does or they just like stirring up shit so many possibilities ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,aids ironic i know ,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,i sort of thought they were trying to kill the idea that she was actually supernatural instead of just playing it to psych out her opponent or something ,-2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,well if you are with wwe and you acknowledge that you are familiar with won jbl finds you and just beats the shit out of you ,19,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,not many the only one they said was a lock that turned out wrong was aj ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,especially since mickie seems to have mostly turned face ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,something interesting i read that he said recently was to the effect of i am slowly getting more ability to control what my character is that makes me wonder whether the problems with his booking are not just about what he wants to do vs what he told to do but whoever was responsible for his booking the last couple months is who should be in charge ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,losing two best friends in two months that rough ,66,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,alexa is implausible as champ sometimes but sasha is champ because her finisher is fucking awesome ,5,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,well that why you do not say things like that is not it seems like there an easy solution ,-2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,no proof that what he said to mauro but he said it to two other people so not exactly a stretch which btw is something that would probably get you banned on this board by itself if you said it to someone ,-1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32, in a roundabout way it sounded like he was saying mauro was taking jbls ribbing too much too heart well no shit if the guy ribbing includes phrases like why have not you killed yourself yet or similar ,3,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,ok then how football reporters would not have a job were it not for the nfl ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,well yeah but that like saying a movie critic would not exist without movies ,4,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,well it came back up during the whole berenstain thing and then i think it wound up hitting some sort of right wing conspiracy angle at some point,3,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,good way to condition fans to be happy when roman shows up,36,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,people replying on that tweet said they lost hundreds of dollars to this ,14,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,well they are not going to just pull the name of main eventers out of a hat somebody has to be chosen ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,hhh knows firsthand roman cannot get somebody heel heat with television crowds ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,i was mad at jbl for giving grief to a fellow bipolar person that i think is also a better broadcaster and setting into motion something that could have been dangerous i dont like the way wwe at large does things and vince especially but that nothing that is news ,0,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,he helped depush alberto del rio legend in my mind just for that ,14,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,this could potentially kill off the bray wyatt spookiness once and for all it a hair away from dungeon of doom ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,well whoop ass is more wearable than candy ass ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,it entirely plausible brock loses the title it finds its way to roman by january and lesnar wins the rumble ,4,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,blame wwe for this shit budro why is someone supposed to bust their ass when the company decides who to push based on factors completely independent of how hard you work or how over you get yourself hell trying to push yourself has gotten people buried ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32, another former company television performer noted that after roberts was gone he would constantly tell tony chimel to kill himself in front of people i am equally confused now,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32, after roberts was gone,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,did it with flair yo,3,SquaredCircle
wwwes32, roberts said that he was constantly bullied and harassed that layfield would throw his bags around and call him names and that every day he asked me why i was still alive and told me to go kill myself another former company television performer noted that after roberts was gone he would constantly tell tony chimel to kill himself in front of people roberts was gone in 2014 so this is more recent ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,latest won said he often asked roberts and chimel why they had not killed themselves yet one hopes he did not make the mistake of asking mauro the same thing ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,loved them pretty underrated a lot of good stuff seemingly overshadowed by their former status as jason schwartzman old band ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,i mean there ambrose a feud between heel roman and face ambrose would be incredible ,8,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,you are into something here ,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,hurry up then,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,ruby riot looks like if amy sedaris did roller derby,3,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,maybe they were trying to deescalate any idea that she was supernatural ,4,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,wtf is this it not bad just strange ,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,aw now ember is not a wolf lady,3,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,that makes sense ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,we are all here for miley,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,what was that chant junkie rollins ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,that was an uncomfortably long time to have your hand in somebody crotch without even coffee first,19,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,well that and to let him acclimate to the culture ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,even still way way worse things get said here ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,well yeah that but what else i would never call him particularly entertaining ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,he said alexa bliss was his thinspiration not sure if i should censor this lest i be banned myself ,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,how in the hell is he your favorite entertainer ,4,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,new day also hmm ,10,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,there are not more we know about but meltzer said he knows of stuff from the last few years and they will be part of a long form story on this that he will have in the next week or two ,11,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,you know if wwe is dead set on the asian thing why do not they do something that would actually serve some sort of niche interest like anime themed merch i have to think that might at least appeal to somebody ,23,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,just looked at the google trends obviously nakamura is nowhere near the big guys but last night there was a huge surge in activity for him shortly after he was out biggest surge of interest of anyone in the wwe all week ,3,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,yeah this was a better reaction and presentation than she would gotten in the two years i would been watching i cannot believe they ignored the obvious pitting her against nia at least the one samoan monster vs another concept would have given her a purpose ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,forget byron he did not even talk shit about ellsworth last night ,6,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,if that how you are seeing it that on you man all he done so far is just indicate he does not like jbl much and deliberately thank everyone who offered him support while he was gone anybody defending mauro is doing it because they want to defend mauro ,7,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,https merydenrr tumblr com if you did not see it above,3,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,the samoan heritage giveth and the samoan heritage taketh away,8,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,she did light it up tho,29,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,a jbl soundboard,9,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,if you mean in the sense that his readers have asked him to elaborate on what he knows for weeks and he finally did then yeah he quite the rabble rouser ,-2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,make no mistake i still want him gone but my hopes for that happening have dwindled if we are talking only about the incidents we know for sure wwe would just say well we fired him for that stuff already the only people who could get him fired are current former employees and if none of those people say anything then all of this really is just a witch hunt until we know otherwise ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,you are getting weird amounts of hate over this but i have thought about it too i think with balor it a bit different than bryan because there no way jinder meant to connect that way it was a mistake in a bad place and enzo just well he did something enzo best i can think that this could apply is just relative heights of the performers and where exactly that elbow did hit finn is smaller so his head was right at the worst possible angle for that botch someone taller and jinder still might have clocked them but he would not have gotten the same leverage i bet ,0,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,he saying he not the important part of the show it was in response to someone saying they did not know if they could keep watching ,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,mauro had a great run though the first sd to be on usa the first live one the brand split aj vs cena twice great run sad it did not include mania ,9,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,ko had the same look as my dog when i wo not throw the toy,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,married,3,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,ehhhhhhh even apollo crews came across better,-16,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,how can shane sound so much like he the boss ,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,vegan dad cool,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,tjp only ever wants to go to applebees,6,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,to flight attendant can you please do something about this guy ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,tjp asks to use your netflix account,3,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,yeah if all we get is a less obnoxious jbl that at least better ,-11,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,what did he call ellsworth tonight oh yeah pretty much nothing just as usual ,8,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,well if mauro cant wont talk and nobody else is willing to step up then there nothing to do hopefully this does lead to them being more careful ,87,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,who would not have gotten concussed from an elbow driven into the base of the skull ,233,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,and it can happen almost every week now ,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,at minimum a match between them would be so graceful,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,yeah really need guys for the tour ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,i have no idea i have tried to think of how this made sense to someone and i just cannot ,5,CrappyDesign
wwwes32,yeah he talking more about the matches and less with the jokes ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,aw mojo and his bros ,3,SquaredCircle
wwwes32, we need someone that can work with rob gronkowski and keep him safe stop right there we are both thinking it jinder mahal ,4,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,just seemed a little off for a bit there ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32, stiffing as opposed to botching and accidentally slamming an elbow into his skull and following through,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,starting to wonder if raw and smackdown also switched writers ,6,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,god poor rowan maybe he and aiden english can form some sort of stable of abandoned tag team members,7,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,i just realized ko could win mitb this year i seriously hope that happens ,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,this is weird wondering where this is leading ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,what a coup,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,there no reason to boo the mention of montreal that loudly,0,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,maybe they have drafted lesnar i mean might as well they could say that he has been sent to the moon for all it matters over the next few months ,12,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,well it probably both and the two combined are making him dangerous ,3,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,that would be insane though you might as well say just not to have a midcard at all ,7,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,he offered to share with everyone else but they do not want none,76,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,thanks for this i guess it falls under that then dunno what this means really but i am guessing it means we are going to get meltzer story with all the things he heard in a couple of weeks when he finishes it but nothing else happens ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,here ya go buddy https www reddit com r squaredcircle comments 45uf4x more reports about titus incident on raw d008o17 ,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,oh you want the comment ,3,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,mojo rawley,4,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,oh let not act like jbl seriously needs this job he has quite a bit of money and a side gig on fox news he does it because it fun for him ,10,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,jbl makes very subtle jabs at mauro and the people angry at him at least once then proceeds to talk shit about byron all night that my guess because that who it seems like he is ,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,here ya go https clyp it yz0ygk5u,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,depends on what it says in his contract i guess i am pretty sure he totally done with wwe so i do not think he cares unless it would get him sued also i mean if it constitutes harassment pretty sure he is covered under whistleblower laws no ,0,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,alvarez was fucking pissed about this on wor today ,3,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,clever i hope this is the case those two would tear shit up if they got the opportunity ,23,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,whatever torment is probably tolerable at this point he gotten his support network built back up and he gotten his own defenses up that just what you have to do when you have what he does learn how to keep your emotions within a manageable range ,4,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,the same thing happened last year with triple h busting roman nose i remember one facebook comment especially mad from some lady in texas who worked at big lots privacy settings kids about how hhh was completely unprofessional and she would not continue watching the program unless he was suspended or fired ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,one half of the headbangers did presumably there are more people that would defend him because you cannot really be a bully and survive without getting a decent number of people on your side ,8,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,how many times have i heard this nobody will know who enzo cass are nobody will know anything about broken matt hardy nobody will pop for shinsuke nakamura the list goes on i am not saying that the crowd will wo not do anything but i am saying you cannot be that certain ,22,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,he has a podcast coming if he is going to make a statement that where he would do it because of course he wants to get a gigantic surge of subscribers ,3,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,if mauro does not say anything in the podcast he has coming with bas rutten this week then as much as i still dislike jbl i gotta think the matter has to be considered closed until someone steps up but i mean if he was going to say something it would be in the podcast because why would you give up on the chance to get so much attention to your podcast ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,ideally ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,miz was going before that happened though he started out acting mad because he was not getting respect even though he was champ if he telling the truth he just swerved into the rage and was not thinking ,11,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,corey is there every week for 205 live though cannot he just do both shows ,0,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,it was actually pretty hilarious with my wife because i had just finished describing it having seen it on the last break and i was like oh there it is and then she turned around and screamed louder than i have ever heard her scream in her life she was not ready ,3,adultswim
wwwes32,raw barely even mentioned the us championship for months having another belt is not going to fix shit like that ,5,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,we cannot do anything about this no matter what gets trending unless there a real story for an organization to cover if mauro tells his story and it revelations of some awful shit they did to him that a story if some other person comes out and confirms some awful shit like jbl mocking them when their dad had cancer that a story as of right now you have meltzer carrying the flag and i trust him to the degree that i do not think he would just actively lie about something like this but his anonymous sources plus people angry about what those anonymous sources claimed is not enough for media to cover ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,it goes with their whole dumbass r im14andthisisdeep if you think he a heel he a heel thing it works slightly better than roman braun because at least you are not accidentally building a babyface ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,charlotte could go face at this point i think it hard to even remember but at one point she was pretty damn over as a face i can only imagine she would be moreso now ,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,your point being ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,i just meant last night but check hulu they will always edit the youtube clips but usually they leave hulu as it happened ,11,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,i heard die roman die you deserve it thank you strowman multiple times ,258,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,byron is ripped though pretty sure he could tear jbl up ,12,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,definitely one of the ten best owens ambrose televised matches ,4,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,oh that a shame for a sec i thought jr had finally joined the meme game and knocked it out of the park,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,yeah shame that he did not show up with a mic tonight the truth has come to raw ,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,nia sounded like lumpy space princess for a sec there,3,SquaredCircle
wwwes32, and i am reading books now too ,7,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,they will have friends there they can play with,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,i stand corrected ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,he plays shitty songs on his guitar,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,jeff might well be the only american to wear those pants this decade ,14,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,i was hoping they would do a new headbangers thing,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,and his only reason was he ai not dead enough marvelous ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,i wanted a heel turn but that was nice too ,3,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,what if he went with scherr terror,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,oh fuck wwe,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,if i hear roman call that match an honor i am going to be sad please just a little more of asshole roman ,5,SquaredCircle
wwwes32, what a brave wife that some heenan level quip work ,6,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,oh man i forgot we get to have corey fawn over miz yay ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32, this is not a shakeup it a shakedown jbl probably,3,SquaredCircle
wwwes32, what the fuck am i supposed to do with this fancy new mask ,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,even by wwe standards this shake up makes no sense ,3,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,the big hog,3,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,this is the long con revenge on shane ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,in fairness guys vince was so busy with the draft picks that he just took the first draft this time guessing he rejects first drafts often enough that the first one is a throwaway,0,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,well that was fucking pointless,3,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,did other people get a podcast commercial ,1,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,that nickelodeon slime green,2,SquaredCircle
wwwes32,oh phew i thought kofi would not be there ,5,SquaredCircle
