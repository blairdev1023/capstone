mr_dong,hey do not forget about the famous phobos 2 incident in 1989 in july 1988 the russians launched two unmanned satellite probes phobos 1 and phobos 2 in the direction of mars and with the primary intention of investigating the planet mysterious moon phobos phobos 1 was unfortunately lost en route two months later reportedly because of a radio command error phobos 2 was also ultimately lost in the most intriguing circumstances but not before it had beamed back certain images and information from the planet mars itself phobos 2 arrived safely at mars in january 1989 and entered into an orbit around mars as the first step at its destination towards its ultimate goal to transfer to an orbit that the would make it fly almost in tandem with the martian moonlet called phobos hence the spacecrafts name and explore the moonlet with highly sophisticated equipment that included two packages of instruments to be placed on the moonlet surface all went well until phobos 2 aligned itself with phobos the martian moonlet then on 28th march the soviet mission control center acknowledged sudden communication problems with the spacecraft and tass the official soviet news agency reported that phobos 2 had failed to communicate with earth as scheduled after completing an operation yesterday around the martian moon phobos scientists at mission control have been unable to establish stable radio contact what had caused the phobos 2 spacecraft to be lost according to boris bolitsky science correspondent for radio moscow just before radio contact was lost with phobos 2 several unusual images were radioed back to earth described by the russian as quite remarkable features a report taken from new scientist of 8 april 1989 described the following the features are either on the martian surface or in the lower atmosphere the features are between 20 and 25 kilometers wide and do not resemble any known geological formation they are spindle shaped and proving to be intriguing and puzzling an unusual photo of a thin shadow across mars below left was shown on the russian television segment seen on the surface of mars was a clearly defined dark shape that could indeed be described as it was in he initial dispatch from moscow as a thin ellipse this photo is a still from the soviet television clip it was certainly different from the shadow of phobos recorded eighteen years earlier by mariner 9 the latter cast a shadow that was a rounded ellipse and fuzzy at the edges as would be cast by the uneven surface of the moonlet the anomaly seen in the phobos 2 transmission was a thin ellipse with very sharp rather than rounded points the shape is known in the diamond trade as a marquise and the edges rather than being fuzzy stood out sharply against a kind of halo on the martian surface dr becklake described it as something that is between the spacecraft and mars because we can see the martian surface below it and stressed that the object was seen by both the optical and the infrared heat seeking camera all these reasons explain why the soviets have not suggested that the dark thin ellipse might have been a shadow of the moonlet while the image was held on the screen dr becklake explained that it was taken as the spacecraft was aligning itself with phobos the moonlet as the last picture was halfway through he said they soviets saw something that should not be there the soviets he went on to state have not yet released this last picture and we wont speculate on what it shows so what was it that collided or crashed into phobos 2 was the space probe shot out of space for seeing too much what does the last secret frame show well cosmic conspiracies have managed to track down this elusive last picture below right in his careful words to aviation week and space technology the chairman of the soviet equivalent of nasa referred to the last frame saying one image appears to include an odd shaped object between the spacecraft and mars this highly secret photo was later given to the western press by colonel dr marina popovich a russian astronaut and pilot who has long been interested in ufo at a ufo conference in 1991 popovich gave to certain investigators some interesting information that she smuggled out of the now ex soviet union part of the information was what has been called the first ever leaked accounts of an alien mother ship in the solar system the very last picture taken by phobos 2 the last transmission from phobos 2 was a photograph of a gigantic cylindrical spaceship a huge approx 20km long 1 5km diameter cigar shaped mother ship that was photographed on 25 march 1989 hanging or parked next to the martian moon phobos by the soviet unmanned probe phobos 2 after that last frame was radio transmitted back to earth the probe mysteriously disappeared according to the russians it was destroyed possibly knocked out with an energy pulse beam the cigar shaped craft in the penultimate frame taken by phobos 2 is apparently the object casting the oblong shadow on the surface of mars in the earlier photo australian science writer brian crowley says that because of the convex cats eye shadow which because the overhead solar inclination prevented shadow casting by martian surface features implies a shadow thrown on the surface from something in orbit beyond the orbit of phobos 2 itself the shadow spindle or cigar shaped is inconsistent with any possible shadow cast by the moon phobos which is an irregular potato shape http www bibliotecapleyades net marte marte phobos05 htm https www youtube com watch v

mr_dong,that does not make any sense who are you or i to give meaning to anything essentially what you are suggesting is that nothing has meaning unless you give it meaning almost as if you suggest we should give up on things that are not relevant to ourselves you are not in a position to state what does and what does not have meaning as soon as someone states that sort of thing i stop listening you are a curios mind you really arent any more than that your thoughts and beliefs maybe have no relevance to my own it neither makes you wrong or right it just means you have an opinion ,3,conspiracy

mr_dong, you give him mod authority i gladly leave which probably means nothing to you it means a lot to me but debunking should be welcomed and encouraged as long as civility remains i am not of the school that says that all moderators should be of the same ilk reports and accounts can stand for themselves and so can witnesses until mod abuse is present i cannot do anything i wo not play that game the ufo community is 60 000 they can make up their own mind if abuse happens then i will know about it and will act the burden is on the believer unfortunately for the sake of honesty we have to listen and tolerate those who debunk ,1,conspiracy

mr_dong,transcript from the video by youtube user nondualitytalk emily is a clear speaker however the sound system did not record her properly here is a transcription hopefully listeners or emily herself will suggest corrections and fill in the inaudible parts i was a witness from the ruwa zimbabwe event i was just over 8 years old when this happened i was born in canada i am from a family of five i have a brother and a sister my brother was also at the school during the time of the event my parents are missionaries for the salvation army that why we were down in ruwa zimbabwe we were in zaire before that then went to zim and we all attended ariel which was a lovely school i am really thankful for that experience putting aside the ufo phenomenon it was a beautiful place to live and to be so on that day i can only speak about my perspective and where i was every child was in a different area of the playground but it was recess and broad daylight and we were just doing our normal thing playing games there were boundary lines along the property and one of the games my friend and i used to play was hopping on the boundary lines then we heard a high pitch frequency sound and out side perspective we saw a flash and a craft and it really hard to describe time at this point so i do not know how long this all happened all i can tell you is that two beings were hopping along beside lisa and i and they were curious they were not touching the ground inaudible they were almost like mimicking us all of a sudden they were in front of us i describe them as being about arm reach and we were frozen telepathic images started going across my face communication through the eyes that all i can really describe it as it was just image after image after image one of the other girls standing beside me she got more communication about the environment and for me mine was more technology uses and inaudible uses of technology moderator speaks clearly no need for transcription i will just i will never forget that day question from the audience have you had any other experiences with the same being emily i do not know if it the exact same being but what i can say yes emily describing one of her paintings so when we were talking about the time of the event which i depicted here i do not know when i am going to realize what i am drawing it just comes out for me it like an energy that all around us that causing time to stop at that point inaudible including description of the feeling of being frozen question from the audience could you explain what the other beings that have been coming to her as far as you know look like emily you mean when i am having experiences yes i will just say that they can alter perception so they can change to make you almost feel a bit more comfortable with what you have seen the last encounter there were grays a face went back and forth between a being and lion moderator speaks ,26,UFOs

mr_dong,from the telegraph 26 oct 2003 the former president george bush narrowly escaped being beheaded and eaten by japanese soldiers when he was shot down over the pacific in the second world war a shocking new history published in america has revealed the book flyboys is the result of historical detective work by james bradley whose father was among the marines later photographed raising the flag over the island of iwo jima lt george bush then a 20 year old pilot was among nine airmen who escaped from their planes after being shot down during bombing raids on chichi jima a tiny island 700 miles south of tokyo in september 1944 and was the only one to evade capture by the japanese the horrific fate of the other eight flyboys was established in subsequent war crimes trials on the island of guam but details were sealed in top secret files in washington to spare their families distress mr bradley has established that they were tortured beaten and then executed either by beheading with swords or by multiple stab wounds from bayonets and sharpened bamboo stakes four were then butchered by the island garrison surgeons and their livers and meat from their thighs eaten by senior japanese officers related articles the future president escaped a similar fate because he ditched his plane further from the island than the other crews and managed to scramble on to a liferaft american planes launched a hail of fire at japanese boats which set out to capture him driving them back and he was eventually rescued by a us submarine when the black hull of the uss finback surfaced in front of him he thought he was hallucinating he told mr bradley in a television film made to coincide with the publication of flyboys he had been vomiting bleeding from a head wound and weeping with fear he said only four words to his rescuers happy to be aboard mr bush part in the raid for which he won the distinguished flying cross has long been known to americans not known until now was the grim fate of his downed comrades none from his own plane who swam ashore mr bradley pieced together the horrific truth from secret transcripts of the war crimes trials given to him by a former officer and lawyer who was an official witness at the time and the testimony of surviving japanese veterans a radio operator marve mershon was marched to a freshly dug grave blindfolded and made to kneel for beheading by sword testified a japanese soldier named as iwakawa at the war crimes trial when the flyer was struck he did not cry out but made a slight groan the next day a japanese officer major sueo matoba decided to include american flesh in a sake fuelled feast he laid on for officers including the commander in chief on the island gen yoshio tachibana both men were later tried and executed for war crimes a japanese medical orderly who helped the surgeon prepare the ingredients said dr teraki cut open the chest and took out the liver i removed a piece of flesh from the flyer thigh weighing about six pounds and measuring four inches wide about a foot long another crewman floyd hall met a similar fate adml kinizo mori the senior naval officer on chichi jima told the court that major matoba brought a delicacy to a party at his quarters a specially prepared dish of floyd hall liver according to adml mori matoba told him i had it pierced with bamboo sticks and cooked with soy sauce and vegetables they ate it in very small pieces believing it good medicine for the stomach the admiral recalled a third victim of cannibalism jimmy dye had been put to work as a translator when several weeks later capt shizuo yoshii who was later tried and executed called for his liver to be served at a party for fellow officers parts of a fourth airman warren earl vaughn were also eaten and the remaining four were executed one by being clubbed to death the parents of all the airmen are now dead but mr bradley contacted all their families the first reaction was a stunned silence a hush but i think that at last knowing how these men died however horrible their deaths has allowed closure and in a word i heard from them healing he said mr bush first reaction was also to say nothing there was a lot of head shaking a lot of silence the author told the telegraph there was no disgust shock or horror he a veteran of a different generation the former president returned to chichi jima with mr bradley for the first time since his rescue for the cnn documentary broadcast last week mr bush looked sombre but never visibly upset and ventured into the water in a modern liferaft to re create his experience he recalled that while on the submarine he asked himself why he had survived why had i been spared and what did god have in store for me in my own view there got to be some kind of destiny and i was being spared for something on earth earlier he had told mr bradley i think about those guys all the time http www telegraph co uk news worldnews asia japan 1445167

mr_dong,one thing that all conspiracy theorists should know by now is that governments or the people behind governments seek to exploit and use whatever they can to forward their own agendas and they mostly use fear as their weapon of choice it is not to say that all ufo sightings are other worldly or multidimensional it would not surprise me at all if the power families had looked to use the ufo story for purposes of manipulation but the idea that all of it is a government hoax does not hold water if you read and study ufology seriously i do not even buy into the idea that they are extraterrestrial i think it a lot more complex and certainly not as simple as visiting et or government charade there is something much more bizarre and cryptic going on with ufos ,2,conspiracy
mr_dong,jacques vall e argued that the entire ufo phenomena is some form of control mechanism and that its nature is deceptive but not fully understood he also believed after many years of research that the phenomena was real as do i there is little evidence to suggest that it is a government hoax the world over ufo have been witnessed and documented by military personnel police radar operators and astronauts sightings go back much further that the original flap wave during the 1940 as well a point of research for anyone who is interested should be foo fighters it is possible that the rockerfeller among others have sought to exploit the ufo enigma for nefarious gains but the idea that the entire subject of ufology and the history of well established reports sightings and witness testimony is nothing more than an elaborate hoax on the governments part does not hold water for anyone who has taken the time to study the phenomena there is something bigger going on with ufo my own belief is that it is connected to our consciousness ,26,conspiracy

mr_dong,a couple of quotes worth remembering when considering project bluebook ufo reports i was there at project bluebook and i know the job they had they were told not to excite the public not to rock the boat whenever a case happened that they coud explain which was quite a few they made a point of that and let that out to the media cases that were very difficult to explain they would jump handsprings to keep the media away from them they had a job to do rightfully or wrongfully to keep the public from getting excited dr allen hynek blue book was now under direct orders to debunk i remember the conversations around the conference table in which it was suggested that walt disney or some other educational cartoon producer be enlisted in the debunking process dr allen hynek project blue book was ballyhooed by the air force as a full fledged top priority operation it was no such thing the staff in a sense was a joke in terms of scientific training and numbers it was highly inadequate to the task and the methods used were positively archaic and that is the crack operation that the general public believes looked adequately into the ufo phenomenon dr allen hynek dr condon was working very closely with the cia to ensure that the outcome of bluebook findings were mundane and easy to debunk ,14,conspiracy

mr_dong, it what i would do if i lived in england and could not afford 75 pounds a game it an interesting point and one that could do the game a lot of good in the long run lower division sides need support and maybe pricing of tickets at higher tier clubs will drive more local fans back to local sides ,1,soccer

mr_dong, i am saying most 20 something year olds probably support a lower division team not being difficult but i have no idea how you reach that conclusion ,6,soccer
mr_dong,i do not think it a question of blame or trolling more observation from your own fans in this instance ticket prices should be something that is talked about and discussed it is not just chelsea a lot of fans are priced out of match day now and it healthy to listen to opinions on how fans feel about prices ,3,soccer
mr_dong,no it does not ,14,soccer
mr_dong,why would that be i used to go and watch a lot of football matches in my youthful twenties so what is changed football used to be a working class sport and was affordable i think the argument about ticket prices at certain clubs in one that should be debated just because a club attracts big players should that mean that the fans get high ticket costs ,6,soccer
