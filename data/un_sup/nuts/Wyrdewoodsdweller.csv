Wyrdewoodsdweller,thanks for the reply it indicates you have keen awareness of politics but we differ in perspective to put it another way we both have an ideal society and could be quite similar mine leaning more on less government absolute impartiality of judiciary and a social cohesion to me that would mean regulate media not to push one view but more to prevent poisonous views from entering also the education system is aimed primarily on economics from the young ages on up not to push one view of capitalism but again to block entry by anti capitalistic views there a debate topic in itself you get the picture state action generally laissez faire and bringing the population up in an ethical capitalist system ,1,unpopularopinion

Wyrdewoodsdweller,depends on your perspective but from every angle i see it from it is destructive and divisive economic social education media legal etc any time cultural marxism takes hold the org shifts its focus from necessary priorities to vague unachievable wastes of time money and attention if your position is that it not a problem i think we first have to define cultural marxism and social justice then lay out how an organization should be structured then we can repair improve these orgs so that social policies are most effectively pursued right now there the threat of lawsuits vague human rights tribunals social media witchhunts false flags etc that present the cultural marxist side as such the onus is heavily on the marxist left to pull back from these tactics first before engaging in debate ,2,unpopularopinion

Wyrdewoodsdweller,i am looking at things from a different perspective from you which is common and expected what we likely agree on is the need for institutions concepts and structures if you will that are ground in reality are resistant to infiltration and subversion and have a deference to a higher power morality the onus is on each of us to look inward to our own assumptions and try and find the common ground for example i readily admit capitalism contributes to societal ills and you may agree we both would then examine how capitalism can be managed in a state on the flipside i would expect you to say something like ocialism lacks restraint and its march through the institutions needs to be audited and we would try and find ways to bring more fairness to the system ,1,unpopularopinion
