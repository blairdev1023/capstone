Thorumar,and in my opinion if she had brought those things up she would not have been decimated moving on so you oppose putin freedom of speech how about isis leaders should we start restricting the internet since bad people might lie on it how would you prefer me to feel that he should not have a right to talk whatsoever why do you not seem to have a problem with nbc editing his response that was my major qualm anyways not putin actions as a leader or his ability to speak freely but hey if you wanna use my support of all free speech as a way out of the conversation please feel free i just happen to think that even evil dictators and sjws should have the right to speak freely lol ,1,conspiracy
Thorumar,idk about this one but you should check out the other one i have gotten into it with on this thread i swear they are like fucking bedbugs i do not think we will ever get rid of them ,1,conspiracy
Thorumar,for those reading this here what he currently doing he ignored my actually point and said that my point was something different whether he does not understand or is willfully ignoring my point is of no consequence now that he set the frame that my point was actually his point he wants me to defend myself endlessly i have answered every one of his questions seriously go check and he has ignored virtually all of mine so now he claims that i have not explained his point well enough and that i am changing the topic back to my original point he wants the debate to work on his terms because he does not have a leg to stand on let try my hypothesis simply state what my main point was if you will i have made it entirely clear continuously so if you are not a shill you should be able to state it outright and agree with it i will give you a hint you are gonna have to talk shit about nbc to make your argument viable whatsoever we should be in for some logically fallacious fun with the next response,1,conspiracy
Thorumar,it was not simply a denial of killing dissenters it was a much longer answer than that if you watched it you would know that it was the whole answer about russia democratic path forward that i thought decimated kelly planned line of attack she got thrown off by a very good response to her setup question that what an interviewer doing gotcha journalism does when their line of attack fails her attack was decimated i fully support putin free speech to lie about assassinations buy that is a perfectly valid reason to dislike the man i fully support nbcs right to be fucking assholes who twist people words to fit their agenda and i also think that is a perfectly good reason to dislike nbc i hope that evidence like this of them being totally sneaky and grimy will eventually lead them to no longer being a viable news agency is this a bit more clear for you bro ,1,conspiracy
Thorumar,it took about seven comments for me to realize you are a troll with no point other than to say that i phrased things incorrectly i am sorry you cannot grasp my point as well as the voting community has but that not my fault which question specifically did i not answer i just briefly checked and it seems you have dodged all of my questions and i specifically responded to reach of yours no surprise there though you are either a troll extraordinarily unintelligent or willfully ignoring my responses to your idiocies ,1,conspiracy
Thorumar,let me help you grasp this the first quote is representative of the edited version the second quote is very similar to what he actually said if you watched the interview you would know that this clearly shows a split from nbc broadcast and putin words that was my main point but you are dead set on me being wrong for some oddly obsessive reason unfortunately you did not understand my original post but the upvotes say the rest of the sub understood just fine maybe you should take a look at yourself and find out why you so desperately want me to be wrong here nbc twisted his words and that fucked up and you wo not even are to that because you simply need me to be wrong for some reason seems like a personal problem to me ,3,conspiracy
Thorumar, i am literally defending the man statements because they got twisted let try it this way i would defend hitler from this same style of attack even if they are my enemy we should not be making things worse by putting words in their mouth right like it or not everyone does secret highly illegal and immoral things us and russia included i am not excusing that you however are excusing nbc blatant twisting of putin words simply because you do not like him that says a lot about you honestly you would prefer a lie that fits what you already think than the truth when it does not sure putin may have been lying but he not the fucking news it seems like they are conditioning people to hate russia and oh look i found one who on board for that ride,5,conspiracy
Thorumar,i meant decimated she was not prepared for his response plain and simple it was a great answer from a not so great guy in other words while disputing her claim he decimated her approach to the interview she had to completely switch gears i am beginning to think you did not watch it and do not care about anything more than being a pretentious prick it clear as fucking day putin did a great job in the interview and they skewed his words to make him look bad which is grimy af past this point if you disagree that all there is to it you have done a fine job getting us off topic though fuck nbc and their word twisting ,5,conspiracy
Thorumar,thank you kind stranger ,9,conspiracy
Thorumar,sorry i should have said disputed not refuted i misused the word and have since learned its definition thank you for that now that we have fixed my syntax are you satisfied with my point ,8,conspiracy
Thorumar,to show that it does not matter which leader it is or how much i dislike them you may have a point with preempting an accusation i have seen quite a bit of those kinds of accusations whenever russia gets brought up so i suppose i was trying to nip that in the bud unnecessarily before it happened my main point is that he did have a great answer even if he a fucked up dude twisting his words is wrong we can all agree on that right ,13,conspiracy
Thorumar,catholic church british parliament saville the finders mk ultra i am scared of the shitstorm of examples this guy just invoked,17,conspiracy
Thorumar,i am not saying the shit does not happen i happen to think the us is guilty of the same things although possibly to a lesser extent i am saying it fucked up to twist his words to make themselves look better if russian television made it sound like trump was saying that oh yeah the cia kills people deemed a threat to the establishment all the time instead of america is a great place and we are moving in a democratic direction perhaps slower than we would like but we are moving that direction i would call that a bullshit twisting of words as well same goes for obama bush clinton and i would have said the same about hillary if she would won and it happened to her you are the fucking news do not edit to fit your narrative that grimy i can talk about that being fucked up without it meaning i think russia is the golden land of the most superior god folk and kelly did get decimated she did not know what to say at all to his answer moving on ,19,conspiracy
Thorumar,i watched the original yesterday so i am sure i did not notice everything whatsoever but this one was glaring to me when i watched it yesterday the edit made it seem like putin was saying yeah journalists disappear and there corruption but that our way of doing things so do not come at me like that seeing that full answer was honestly pretty astounding this time around his answer not only refuted those statements but gave examples of russia domestic progressions they had to try to save some face after he decimated kelly like that,28,conspiracy

Thorumar,i can totally understand and respect that i think that unfortunately both sides latch onto msm programming it gets those who are already liberal to adopt the language and talking points and it gets those who are already conservative to feel targeted even when it only a media talking point and it never catches on in actual society you are absolutely right it divide and conquer at its finest i will try to do a better job at framing my argument in the future thank you for the feedback ,1,conspiracy
Thorumar,yes left leaning cnn gave me my views of hating both sides of the political coin s i am not a victim i have talked to plenty of liberals and seen plenty of people share the sentiment in person and online if you voted for support trump in any way you are a and i do not want to be friends with you it literally this exact social climate that caused people to vote for trump the virtue signalling left is allowed to project its ills onto the rest of society and ordinary people get demonized en masse for going even slightly against the grain we can also talk about how the conservatives are evil douchebags if you would rather have a pleasant conversation from this point forward just so you know i just happen to think the liberals are also douchebags ,1,conspiracy
Thorumar,you are a racist sexist mysoginistic homophobic patriarchal xenophobic arachnophobic monster also let make sure we get the black vote and the hispanic vote and all conservatives think only one way and they are all evil white people and all cops want to kill black people and all people of color are victims and all people who are not white males are victims and if you generalize anyone or anything or disagree with me then you are literally hitler yes everyone generalizes only one group gets to do so with impunity while simultaneously calling everyone else evil for even subconscious versions of what they do explicitly openly and consciously i hate both sides but god damn do i hate double standards ,0,conspiracy
Thorumar,so you think that the conservatives who constantly preach about american exceptionalism who try their best to keep old american values and policies who literally to this day preach about the reds ie russia doing exactly what you are talking about are secretly in support of russia why because they are cool with not being direct enemies with them like hillary would have been i think you have heard a bit too much anti russian propaganda and are as scared as the conservatives that the reds are coming if any proof comes out of real russian subversion instead of fairy tale fear mongering i will change my tune ,2,conspiracy
Thorumar,liberals preach anti americanism all day supposedly conservatives are pushing a pro russia agenda i guess the whole government has already been subverted right otherwise liberals would be pro america like conservatives are wait this point is falling apart either way both camps suck but i highly doubt russia has as much influence on our society as you seem to think if we are being brainwashed by russia i can guarantee you we are being brainwashed by the good old us of a in the same manner so i guess we are all neutrally brainwashed and therefore able to form our own opinions based on the evidence that is presented neat ,0,conspiracy
Thorumar,ironically it liberals who generalize stereotype marginalize and focus on race it almost as if both sides are completely fucked up hypocrites ,0,conspiracy

Thorumar,why did you respond to a random comment i left instead of the one i left you four hours ago you are going out of your way pretty far to defend hillary and i notice you have not brought a single thing to the conversation you are just mad that i disagree with you and you are going out of your way to find shit to bitch about you do not even explain yourself you are stupid i think this is bad logic you okay thanks guy you are really making your points clear and winning hearts and minds out here without any refutation of the things i have said you have not even made it clear why you disagree with me all you have said is that you do disagree great i have laid out why i believe my side in this thread if you are not adding anything new why comment quite frankly no one gives a flying fuck what you think they only care what you know and the only thing you have shown you know is how to cry when people are saying things you do not like good for you ,7,conspiracy

Thorumar,nice ad hominems bro you have stated one important thing here you think they are russian talking points i do not that really all there is to it but you have to resort to attacking people personally because you cannot stand someone simply disagreeing with you that a disgusting trait imo but hey you do you i will keep being me you certainly did not say anything that would change my mind and i am a pretty open dude you can repeat russia all day but it does not prove anything ,11,conspiracy
Thorumar,i have said before and i will say it again assange hints lead me to believe this like many others in this sub a long time ago just because the topic cane back up and someone flip flops their words on it does not change my opinion you are on r conspiracy crying about someone having a conspiracy theory that is doing rather well at the moment based on upvotes and i am pathetic some people disagree with you guy the world keeps turning whether you throw a tantrum or not you wo not change any minds bring a pretentious prick that for sure have a nice day ,12,conspiracy
Thorumar,that the problem i do not visit td i dislike trump and i happen to still see this as a reasonable conspiracy you are so deep in the other side all you see is trump supporters or people who agree with you you are wrong and you are overreacting to me thinking things went down differently than you think they went down keep being an unreasonable dick i am sure you will change so many minds s,11,conspiracy
Thorumar,your desperation to defend hillary and blame everything on trump is pretty obvious i have stated numerous times i hope trump gets his he a psychopathic liar i cannot wait for real leaks on him etc you got strawmen for sale or something you seem to be overstocked feel free to quote me defending breitbart i do not recall ever specifically doing that either which makes your comment a useless desperate attempt to discredit what i am saying without providing any details thank you for wasting everyone time ,12,conspiracy
Thorumar,and by the way i would probably shut my mouth when i got some phone calls from the guys who got seth they probably wear badges and donate to the clinton foundation lol couple of guys pull you in a dark room and show you a video of it going down and busy say take it back any questions this is r conspiracy i do not know why you are adamantly being an asshole about other people theories lol i am simply saying i do not believe the media narrative you do and you felt personally hurt enough to lash out like this on a forum when someone disagreed with you lol believe it was russia all you want i simply disagree ,20,conspiracy
Thorumar,jesus christ projecting much i do not even understand your point other than you saying you feel like a failure and you are mad about it lol my point is i had reached this conclusion without fox news or any other lying media i am not taking back anything feel better now that you got that tantrum out ,12,conspiracy
Thorumar,that a fair assessment i think you raise a good point in saying that i think assange is trustworthy i do i think that is probably where our opinions divide most i do not trust the media whatsoever and there a lot who feel the exact same about assange either way it r conspiracy and they are both conspiracy theories lol only time will tell what the truth may be but i will remain skeptical of the major narrative just in case ,10,conspiracy
Thorumar,i think you misunderstood that the part quotes was me rephrasing my original statement either that or you are telling me which candidate came close to my values without knowing me lol again i do not agree with bernie policies but i did not agree with hillary or trump either i do however think bernie would have been easy to predict and defend against i do not think the same of the other two i am glad you found someone you liked but you are putting a lot of words in my mouth that i am not saying i am not sure if you are stupid or just a dick but either way it does not change anything and your statements have added nothing to the conversation ,8,conspiracy
Thorumar,lol let me translate for the stupid no candidate represented my values during this election only one seemed to be honest and not completely paid for i would have supported him because i would rather fight against something i know than have a dishonest psychopath in office you have made it clear you prefer the psychopathic liars good for you ,7,conspiracy
Thorumar,oh right i forgot about fairy tale land scandal free hillary clinton if you guys want to see her cover your eyes plug your ears and scream lalalalala for the next part yes i know you cannot hear my typed words but you have to be that childish to ignore this laughing about destroying libya and getting a rapist off real crazy receiving questions ahead of time through dnc and media connections real dishonest colluding with dnc members to influence base away from bernie real dishonest overriding of primary system caused us to have president trump classified emails and getting off charges real proven shows how she above the law blatantly and i mean really do i need to go on there plenty more substantiated and rumored she was literally the queen of scandal and diversion every day something new happened but i guess you must have wiped a cloth across your forehead to erase all that information lol ,10,conspiracy
Thorumar,do not worry trump is literally satan as well everything gonna be okay shhhh sleep now little one i pretty much wholeheartedly disagree with bernie policies but i would have voted for him over these two worthless candidates he seemed to be the only honest candidate and what do you know he literally got cheated i think that a fair thing to point out sorry your candidate did not win due to being a flaming pile of shit the other pile of shit was not on fire ,12,conspiracy
Thorumar,very true these are just the two main theories if you will spez changed a word,3,conspiracy
Thorumar,totally disagreed she was a shit candidate who was plagued with scandals and every time people tried to deflect to other misconduct then when people stayed on topic they get called trump supporters if she was not a lying pay for playing cheating cunt we would not have had those issues if they had not cheated bernie we would not be having this discussion yes trump sucks but that does not defend hillary actions she i am sick of people acting like it does i would love for them to go after trump hard on that but unfortunately your girl already got a break and set the bar at it cool use any server you want we sent classified shit and it did not matter and your defense for this is well now trump is doing it great look what your girl allowed to occur now that psychopath has even more power but thank god hillary is not in jail right i want them both there you want the one that wears red there you know she evil but you care more about your team than actual justice ,11,conspiracy
Thorumar,i will give you that that pretty shitty what do you expect when the people in charge of the last case say they do not see a reason to pursue charges though now we have all decided it no big deal it what happens when you do not follow through on politicians doing illegal shit it keeps going and becomes practically accepted i do however agree that this is absolute bullshit and they should all be equally charged both in the court of public opinion and the court of law no question about that one ,7,conspiracy
Thorumar,i did not see anyone else do any of that shut down bernie prepared debates project veritas showed voter fraud was planned i am sure msm talked about that nonstop right so fox may have some clips but they are not on the list of dnc buddies in the msm i do not trust them either but for different reasons so please provide some proof of any other candidates who did anything similar so i may hate them as well ,14,conspiracy

Thorumar,i believed this theory well before wheeler i hate trump as much as hillary but there no direct proof of his shit yet like there is for hillary i do not think hillary personally gave the order to kill seth or least there no evidence to suggest it have fun applying your made up opinions to me they do not fit so you are defending people who lie cheat and try to steal elections because you think someone else stole the election from them i think they are both shite and i do not believe either one i do however think julian assange has left enough of a statement on the matter for me to take the hint you do not have to agree but you certainly assumed a lot of untrue shit for your well thought out breakdown gotta keep those scarecrows away somehow right ,17,conspiracy
Thorumar,blame the media if they had not lied and gotten caught colluding with the dnc people would be inclined to believe them now they are clearly willing to lie for political means so their narrative means nothing anymore especially when it clearly defends their buddies at the dnc i want dnc and rnc to come crashing down i am fine starting with either but your side fucked up first get the fuck over it your evil assholes let their private take leak all election i cannot wait for the rnc to do the same but i am not going to ignore the fucking plain in sight evil that has been laid out in front of us keep defending it by attaching trump it means nothing to me because your side got caught doing evil shit i no longer trust them plain and simple you trust liars you defend them i do not defend trump a liar and i do not defend almost anyone in msm dnc rnc or hillary i do not defend evil i also clearly stated i could be wrong and if i am i will only be upset because the dnc will get away with rigging elections and trump will get away with selling out to the russians all of the evil will get swept under the rug again because people like you have to take every attack at the system as an attachment against themselves personally i know you wear blue you made that clear now get the fuck out of the way so we can burn everything blue and red it time ,24,conspiracy
Thorumar,yeah like when cnn said it illegal to read it and just let them tell you what it says they did a great job covering their own collusion with the dnc you are right s,16,conspiracy
Thorumar,great contribution you should like open your own thread about it i would love to read it like i said i also dislike trump this had nothing to do with the post though dnc still evil as fuck and it seems like you are defending deflecting for them i guess that makes you as evil as trump lol on its own i would genuinely love to read about it but as a response to the topic it literally b but the other guy no one cares your guys are evil too ,17,conspiracy

Thorumar,i know that the msm backed the dnc on the election i know the same msm has been running pro dnc russia hacking narrative i do not trust them because they are in cahoots it part of the problem of being a slimy group of shitheads who try to cheat the system a lot of people wo not trust you anymore meanwhile the seth rich narrative adds up when you are considering a bunch of slimy fucks getting together and trying to figure out how to save their asses kill seth say it the russians on msm since they already do what we want hands in the center dnc on three 1 2 3 dnc i know the dnc and msm should be in trouble and are in collusion so of course they will stick with the russia narrative that means the investigation dies and the dnc is free and clear even if i am wrong it means nothing though here the other narrative a russian agent sent a phishing email to john podesta he fell for it the results of his idiocy lead to hillary clinton losing the 2016 election because when wikileaks released the valid information it affected voters why do not you guys hate trump more come on look russia i hate trump just fine thanks i will hate him more when i see more but i have seen enough to hate the dnc and msm entirely that what the two sides boil down to what do you hate more grab the pussy or lying and cheating in the primaries answer that and i will know which narrative you believe it just pisses me off that the dnc can get out of everything they did this election and yet an unproven trump russia connection is enough for people to flip their shit proven true dnc scandal means nothing but do not worry the media is on your side and thinks trump should be impeached for a theory they refuse to show proof for that enough for you because you are ultra biased against one side it nowhere near enough for me and most here because we are ultra against both sides for being fucking evil go support your evil overlords elsewhere r politics ,1,conspiracy

Thorumar, today i rescind the statements i made in my daily pennsylvanian article from 1991 entitled historical fact of falsehood when i wrote that piece i was a 21 year old kid who had a lot of opinions that i have since changed totally fine respectable so far back then i had many political positions that were not well researched for example back in those days i held a pro war rally for the persian gulf war anyone who knows me now knows that i am a very different person today great i think i like this dude he seems level headed i also rescind the statements i made in a letter to the editor i wrote in 1999 on the same issue back then i had a very different perspective and there were many things that i did not give due weight on this issue i should have been far far more respectful of so many people who had lost family members their pain is heart wrenching and should be acknowledged by all okay clearly he now believes the genocide happened and is acknowledging these people suffering as he says everyone should my mistake at the time was confusing myself for a scholar of history which i most certainly am not groovy this is all spot on exactly what he should be saying i don t want to make the same mistake again so i am going to refrain from commenting on the topic of the armenian genocide which i do not know nearly enough about woah what do you mean last sentence you were implying that it was so clear that anyone should acknowledge these people suffering why did you say all of that just to say you do not know enough to have an opinion at all either you do not believe it happened and you wrote this for damage control or you believe it happened and you managed to leave it incredibly ambiguous at the end due to poor word choice thank you for being patient with me on this issue though i might not have always merited it my patience runs out when i smell a weasel trying to do damage control i do not care about this dude whatsoever and he could be right about a million other things but even if my biggest idol released this exact statement i would be like damn way to skirt around directly admitting that you were downright wrong mr rogan you managed to imply it but you lost all of that credibility when you said you cannot outright say it happened as you just implied anyone should be able to except you right joe come on bro there no strawmen here that a quote by quote breakdown of my take on this if you disagree then it is what it is all of my arguments have boiled down to these points if not slightly more entertaining versions of them i did not invent some nonexistent sentiment to attack it all right there in the statement ,2,conspiracy
Thorumar,i really do not though this dude could be right about a million other things i do not know him or care i literally am defending my opinion of this statement which i read without having any knowledge of this guy whatsoever to people who are claiming i am way off base just because i disagree with you does not mean i have an axe to grind i certainly to have an opinion here since i read the statement and am happy to debate it that much should be clear most of the time when people believe silly things and then realize their mistakes they do not take the position that they have no opinion this guy looks like he weasled his way out of saying the genocide happened if you do not see that that fine but to me it looks like this guy only realized that it was a mistake to talk about it not that his beliefs were a mistake if that was just poor word choice on his part that fine but that how it comes off to me ,-1,conspiracy
Thorumar,it that he started like he was going to say the genocide happened that was rude to the families then he did not say that at all he still managed to leave in the implication that the people who suffered might be full of shit and he just does not know enough to continue commenting on the situation if you feel that way leave the families out of it you appeal to pathos does not mean shit to me if you do not back it up with anything real faimilies suffered man but idk whether it happened or not so i wont talk about it anymore i might be generalizing but i have a tendency to try to read between the lines in a classic pr style apology or rescinding if he still not saying it happened he just saying sorry for talking about it yet he leads with the families as an emotional appeal to make it seem like he doing them some great service by walking this back truth is he looks like a total douche bag for spouting that the genocide did not happen and he more concerned with looking like a douche than the families he supposedly writing this whole thing for it comes of like he using them to make himself look better in my opinion otherwise here the summary i said that the genocide did not happen that was rude to a lot of families who lost loved ones i do not know enough to say whether it happened or not so i will refrain from doing so in the future okay great you apologized to the families and said you will shut your mouth but do not act like you have done them some grandiose favor you did not take the time to even find out if you believe their plight was real or not he just saying fuck it this opinion is not worth the backlash so i will take it back but i am sure as fuck not switching sides openly do you see how weasely that is he could at least take the time to learn enough to switch sides or just leave well the fuck enough alone and keep believing what he wants to openly do not walk it back just because of backlash that politician level bullshit and it should be clear as day on fucking r conspiracy i do not know why i have spent so much time explaining that a guy who makes money based on his looking good to his viewers took back a statement that could potentially lose him money when clearly that the most important result of the statement to him not the truth not showing the families who lost loved ones that their plight has been heard understood and that he will start facilitating their side of the situation he just said sorry i made people mad i wo not talk about it anymore i think that a bullshit copout personally ,0,conspiracy
Thorumar,he changed his mind to not knowing enough to have an opinion before he knew enough to claim it did not happen and now he seen a mountain of information that made him not believe anything seems off he attempting to make himself look better without having to admit he still believes what he did before this pr statement sorry families who are calling me on my shit i do not know enough to have an opinion anymore now that it could come back and hurt my career that all i see there but that does not mean you have to view it the same way just my two cents ,2,conspiracy
Thorumar,his new well researched opinion that he does not know and therefore will refrain from commenting on the situation further this is what i am talking about the first half of his statement sets it up as if he apologizing to those who were hurt in the genocide and then he ends his official statement by saying the equivalent of but idk bros it might have happened it might not have so i wont talk about it anymore it a bunch of pr bullshit to make him look better about the situation without him ever actually going back on anything entirely that the way i see it personally you are entitled to have a different opinion but i think this came off in a shitty way whether he meant for it to or not ,-2,conspiracy
Thorumar, i think 9 11 did not happen years pass i take that back that was rude to the families who lost people i will refrain from commenting on the situation in the future why not just say i made a mistake the 9 11 did happen whether it what he believes or not without knowing about how nice of a guy he is his own word choice sounds like he saying sorry people who lost someone in the genocide people who are calling me on my shit that was totally rude of me to say i wo not comment on the situation anymore because i do not know enough about it fucking cop out he weaseling his way out of saying it happened whether he believes it did or not he making it sound like he saying oh sorry you are right that happened but he really saying i dunno bro sorry i hurt ya feelings i will shut up now i think that a shitty pr status official apology and i do not buy into that shit whether i know someone or not welcome to r conspiracy where no one trusts fucking anyone get used to it ,0,conspiracy
Thorumar,feel free to read my post history for a more detailed explanation of my view of this subject i have acknowledged this argument and it does not change my mind you are welcome to disagree ,1,conspiracy
Thorumar,thank you for understanding my point and being respectful i do not think the dude is evil or that this discredits any of his other points he may make i just thought it was if nothing else a poorly chosen string of words to take back such a strong opinion respect to you good sir edit or madam i do not mean to be presumptuous lol,3,conspiracy
Thorumar,it totally fine for someone to educate themselves and change their opinion all while supporting it work facts it different for someone to openly say they rescind their statements while simultaneously saying they do not have an understanding of the situation leave the part out where you say you do not know enough you are good add it and you are simply saying your opinion is worth as much now as it was then you might as well say i should not have said that it might have happened and it might not have i do not know because i do not know enough about the subject which i would call a cop out and not actually admitting anything you are just saying hey guys i get it leave me alone please i wo not say it ever again that my opinion at least ,4,conspiracy
Thorumar, my mistake at the time was confusing myself for a scholar of history which i most certainly am not i don t want to make the same mistake again so i am going to refrain from commenting on the topic of the armenian genocide which i do not know nearly enough about now i am saying it happened but i still do not know nearly enough about it that not an opinion i am running to trust given this stranger to me guy track record on this very subject what is stopping him from changing his mind again he went out of his way to make it clear data and information were not the deciding factor i happen to think that looks sketchy and said as much god forbid someone lack trust in a media personality on conspiracy though right idc if he msm or youtube his statement standing on it own sounds like he changed his mind for image and money reasons that not someone i think is worth listening to no matter how much they get right he sounds like a liberal alex jones to me and you sound like you have a horse in this race are you a fan of cenks ,-4,conspiracy
Thorumar,i am not saying op is right i am simply saying that throwing in how little he knows about the situation certainly says a lot about his reasoning for rescinding said statement it also says a lot about the man he clearly does not need to be well informed to make an opinion or to change one i do not know him and do not give a flying fuck about his views i am simply pointing out how silly it is to say that you still do not know about the topic that you are rescinding your statements for why did not he just learn about it before his rescinding because the data was not important to him changing his opinion feel free to spin that any way you want it makes him look foolish and i am not out of line for pointing it out as a separate point ,-10,conspiracy
Thorumar,i do not know the guy at all but that sounds like such a cop out i changed my mind not because i learned a lot about the subject no i do not know nearly enough about it in fact i changed my mind because people started calling me out for it i do not know that what happened but that how the quote reads to me,17,conspiracy
Thorumar,my thoughts exactly i am not saying the guy is wrong about whether it viable or not but i certainly do not think a company would hesitate if there was a way to profit off of it and honestly if you think about data plans for cell phones it could be done in a very similar way i would not be surprised if 25 years from now you have to pay a data wifi and wiel bill,1,conspiracy

Thorumar,do you understand that i am not trying to convince you of anything nor am i trying to convince any detectives to start an investigation there are plenty of people better suited for that than i am i am a lurker for the most part and i simply thought the dude who called it a hoax was way off base if you were not a dick i would have been happy to go through this with you in a nice way but instead i am wasting your time reading nonsense on an internet forum while i smoke weed and play rocket league you are just entertainment to me and have been from the moment you did not want to actually really about pizzagate you just wanted to make someone feel bad for not being able to prove a fucking conspiracy theory to you lolol it a fucking theory guy i think this theory might have some merit you do not and you are a dick it as simple as that ,1,conspiracy
Thorumar,it cool that you believe all of that bro i happen to believe that there a chance there is some truth to it could the pizzagate theory be absolutely wrong fuck yeah it could you know what would help lay all of this to rest a formal investigation like the one they said the dc police did until foia requests revealed that to be a complete lie it seems like all anyone wants to do is say you are wrong it fake and you are a part of that crowd you do not have to believe it but you shouting it fake show me basic proof that it real then is simply ignoring what i am saying why wo not they investigate a group of people who hang out with known convicted pedophiles who use code words like pizza related handkerchief maps post pictures of babies calling them ho retard using predator lingo and symbols the list goes on you do not have to believe it but people have been investigated for much much less even if nothing were to come of the investigation that fine it the fact that no one will even talk about it and wants to sweep it away with fake news that makes me believe it more than anything so congratulations if you are trolling we have both wasted way more time than we should have here and wet probably both believe what we believe more thang when this conversation started maybe i will start a twitter and start spamming memes out just to celebrate this momentous occasion of nonsense https voat co v pizzagate do not forget to do your own research ,1,conspiracy
Thorumar,if you had started with i do not agree what evidence did you see that could possibly make you think an investigation is warranted that seems absolutely insane to me i would give you links and be super friendly about why it is that i personally believe that i also would not push you to believe anything you do not want to i honestly do not care at all what you believe about it what i truly do not understand if you are not trolling and sliding a practiclly dead thread when you got here altogether is why you are so concerned that someone would believe a conspiracy theory on r conspiracy why are you so fucking hurt that i would believe that what i have seen warrants an investigation ,1,conspiracy
Thorumar,https voat co v pizzagate have fun bro there a lot of information there that you have clearly never seen before do the research yourself do not demand i present it you chose to enter the debate and you literally are asking me to stage it for you if you do not understand who the key players are or what they would potentially be charged with that not my fault you come in throwing ad hominem and implying i think people should be charged already i simply stated i think there enough for an investigation and you go straight to name calling you clearly have an opinion so do you know the theory or not if you do know enough about it then you understand what i am saying without me linking 759141839 links to you so either do your own research or own up to the fact that you do not have any way to refute the theory either way you are a douchey troll so it fun fucking with you ,1,conspiracy

Thorumar,did you somehow find wmds in iraq are you sure you know who set off chemical weapons in syria did hillary have a 98 chance of winning did she beat bernie fair and square did she have good answers without being given the questions ahead of time the msm has told you all of these outright lies as sensationalized truths and anyone who questions their narrative is called fake news they are not talking about shutting down t d or censoring facebook posts they are talking about silencing any opposition to their real news do you really want an entirely biased media with no smaller players involved to check their facts and question their narrative i am not ready to give up the freedom of speech and the freedom of the press whether msm or not no news source should be silenced as soon as we bestow the power of monopoly of information to the msm people will be trying to buy them off will the msm report on their biggest sponsors if said sponsors are actually committing crimes would they sacrifice profit stability for truth i have my doubts and that enough to know we should always have smaller competitors otherwise who will report the reporters ,3,Futurology
Thorumar,it interesting that you fear trump doing exactly what the msm is attempting to do do not read wikileaks let us tell you what it says do not read fake news we are the only real news the msm has been caught doing exactly what you fear being super biased with an agenda screwing over bernie and conservatives to promote their candidate and on top of that they are trying to make it so that their ministry of truth is the only acceptable outlet of information and that what people seem to want so it will probably happen if trump did what you are saying there would still be msm to counter any truly outright false reporting who gets to decide if msm is outright lying when they monopolize information i am glad you fall on the side of reason and freedom of speech but i truly think you are looking at the wrong place for the ministry of truth i truly believe the media and politics are corrupted by corporations and special interest groups that being the case i believe we should always have alternative media if the msm actually speaks the truth they should not be bothered by people questioning it if breitbart says the sky is blue is that fakerealnews or realfakenews and if msm says it green no one should have a monopoly on information ever ,4,Futurology

Thorumar,no there is not and yes these people exist and are equally wrong they do not represent the whole of christianity and clearly misunderstand one of its central themes love thy neighbor no matter how they sin because we all sin i am glad we could find something we completely agree on feel free to continue i am sure we will find that we agree on many more subjects as well ,3,uncensorednews
Thorumar,just for those who are not aware the teachings of jesus the council of jerusalem and other new testament teachings john 1 16 17 acts 13 39 romans 2 25 29 8 1 4 1 corinthians 9 19 21 galatians 2 15 16 ephesians 2 15 make it clear that christians are not required to follow the old testament rules about crimes and punishments warfare slavery diet circumcision animal sacrifices feast days sabbath observance ritual cleanness etc so this applies to the old testament but not the new so you have religious texts from islam and judaism saying the same things but christianity does not believe these laws are to be followed after jesus coming so your point is not that the bible says that it that the torah says that gotta be accurate if you wanna truly compare religions got anything accurate to lump christians in i would be glad to hear it otherwise you are just saying jews and muslims are supposed to be violent to one another if they follow their religions thanks for the insight ,17,uncensorednews
Thorumar,i do not know if this is news to you or not but r conspiracy is not exactly trusting of the msm or snopes and we have good reason not to be in fact i bet more people here are suspicious that you work for ctr or some other shill network to downplay this topic than think you are just locked in the msm brainwashing either is possible but it proven that whether you like it or are a part of it out not there is indeed a conspiracy between the members of the dnc the media and high ranking officials to rig this election they pay people to shill they prep chosen candidates they control there narrative they have been proven to work with groups that openly advocate and plan voter fraud so how do you prove a lie well if it comes from this group of people who are proven liars then you should start with the idea the there is reason to be skeptical these types of meetings happen all the time i am sure you think politics is overrun with corporate power and money what democrat money cannot buy a secret meeting or two prove it wrong or you are shilling plain and simple,1,conspiracy

Thorumar,my sentiments exactly ,1,RocketLeague
Thorumar,this does not change anything for most players in the game the top tier of players do not need incentive to keep playing the mid tier players will still have no idea how long it will take for them to get to the next rank for all i know it will take all season 2 to rank up once we should all be able to see our mmr ,7,RocketLeague

Thorumar,the best argument for this being goty is that none of us has the time to write a thousand word essay the others can take a break or beat the game but the same cannot be said for rocket league if we have that kind of spare time you know where to find us not to mention that psyonix is the greatest development team ever they listen to the community provide great updates and they price everything so unbelievably low that most players would feel wrong not buying it i would say more but it rl time gg,2,RocketLeague
Thorumar,happy cake day ,1,RocketLeague
Thorumar,i do not understand why people are downing this you are using the proper pc pronoun and stating a fact if she gets a dna test it will come back showing it came from a male is male by sex the offensive part because unless there some pussyfoot new pc word like birthmale or something this seems like a totally acceptable statement ,15,funny
Thorumar,first i want to apologize for assuming i understood your intent i do understand why old testament verses came to mind first but when i read your comment i have to admit it came off like an angry atheist trying to bash christianity by using the old testament as i previously stated the two are not as connected as people think and i hate the idea of turning people away by using misinformation using logic and reason sure plead your case and let the masses decide but i hate when people stack the deck to win the argument so if my response came off a little harsh that would be why with that said i will try to do a quick once over of the subject at hand to give you a better understanding it is pretty complicated so i am sorry if this ends up being lengthy there are a few answers to your question the old testament is a history of the entire family of jesus it begins with the creation of adam and leads down the entire family tree of jesus so first and foremost it is literally a history book secondly many of the passages in the old testament give prophecies pertaining to the coming messiah christians believe this is jesus and therefore reference these prophecies through the old testament as proof that he is the one true messiah they could not scrap the stories and keep the prophecies so the entire thing stayed for reference of sorts finally it is the story of man original covenant with god reading it helps to understand the nature of god it is the story of how he first contacted mankind the rules that he handed down may seem a little crazy and it near impossible to sum then up without studying each one one at a time but the general idea is that to the outside world the israelites had to be seen as a perfectly pure group of priests in order to build trust and share the word of god when jesus was sacrificed the second covenant was made nullifying the first both covenants were sealed with the blood of a lamb the first being a literal lamb the second being jesus this is why he is the lamb of god i only mention this to show that they are two separate distinct covenants without having to look up the new testament quotes that say that the old laws are no longer applicable the only actual law of the new testament is love thy neighbor but that does not mean the old testament is not important i hope this helped even if you do not believe in religion it pretty interesting feel free to ask me any questions you might have ,1,InternetIsBeautiful
Thorumar,i hope you at least understand that these verses do not ridicule christianity they ridicule judaism christians are not bound by any laws in the old testament it pretty much a history book at this point and i notice you have only provided old testament verses to ridicule religion i guess there nothing wrong with christianity islam hinduism or any of the other religions using those verses alone makes you seem more antisemitic than anti religion and if i had to take a wild guess i would assume that your attempt to ridicule christianity which makes you an uneducated antisemite ,1,InternetIsBeautiful

Thorumar,this post is against subreddit rules not trying to be a jerk just a heads up you cannot post anything calling out specific toxic players by name unfortunately there no report option yet and people get mad it happens just lol at them and move along is all you can really do ,1,RocketLeague
Thorumar,if you talk like this during matches i would not be surprised if your team is throwing them on purpose no one likes that guy and honestly if you are blaming your team you probably play too offensive i used to feel like every team i played with was terrible but then i got a lot better and now i trust 99 of the random team mates i get learn to pass properly and you will see most people can back you up after all your hidden mmr is matching you all for a reason they are pretty much as good as you are ,8,RocketLeague
Thorumar,1 5 seconds between first and second jump if i were you i would just go to free play ignore the ball and start doing single jump aerial second jump flip until it feels natural then maybe go to aerial training and hit them late and low to get a real feel for it ,1,RocketLeague
Thorumar,this is how i felt until i started branching into solo and 2s that was right after i took a hit of about 200 and stopped caring about my rank,1,RocketLeague
Thorumar,i personally hope so i understand the other side of the debate but i really want to play wasteland without wasting time in non ranked ladders ,2,RocketLeague
Thorumar,i have not experienced this whatsoever but thanks for bringing a new opinion to the mix had not heard that yet ,1,RocketLeague
Thorumar,i do not think the problem is fairness it not like the other team is playing on flat ground y know it would just be one more thing to learn have fun with just because one guy is really good at aerials does not mean we should remove boost from ranked everyone has the same chance to be good at aerials and everyone has the same chance to be good at wasteland ,3,RocketLeague
Thorumar,i definitely understand this point of view perhaps mine is a little selfish but i am digging wasteland so far and usually only play ranked i do not really want to stop climbing the ranked ladders but i really want to play wasteland occasionally and i do not really want to play or leave regular matches until i find it ,5,RocketLeague
Thorumar,i would be cool with that ,2,RocketLeague
Thorumar,i doubt psyonix is specifically against it if the community ends up wanting it in ranked i am sure psyonix will have no problems with putting it in ranked this post is quite literally trying to see where the community stands edit sorry for being a dick what is your opinion ,3,RocketLeague

Thorumar,you really just have to ignore the bad ones the good people far outnumber the bad if it really bugs you you can turn off the chat but honestly some assbags are going to be in any game you play even one with as awesome of a community as rl you gotta take it with a grain of salt y know ,3,RocketLeague
Thorumar,this is reductio ad absurdum no one said they should sell them you are reducing the debate but adding an absurd statement it fine that you disagree but your argument is poor it lasted for more than three days and no one is asking psyonix to sell them ea style just to actually make the holiday unlocks special by not giving you a chance to get them every single year but yes we can agree there should be year 2 unlocks added whether year 1 is locked or not ,2,RocketLeague
Thorumar,fair enough but i will say that every game that locks the cosmetics has had me guaranteed to play next year and guaranteed to play until i unlock everything i can see why people disagree but i always love the feeling of unlocking something you know you wo not have another chance of unlocking it got a thrill that is not anywhere near unlocking things you know you will see again i probably wo not even rock my halloween setup next year because it just does not feel special but hey too each their own it just how i feel ,1,RocketLeague
Thorumar,i do not know about you but 1 i hardly ever even notice someone else setup 2 i would not be jealous of alpha beta sarpbc players had gotten something specific and most importantly 3 psyonix will already be doing something similar with end of season ranking unlocks did not hit gold league sorry pal and did not play first year sorry pal seem to be the same thing to me it does not have to be something totally different either a different face for the jack o lantern ghosts instead of bats for the boost just something that says i have been supporting psyonix for over a year now and they appreciate that ,6,RocketLeague

Thorumar,weed use and heroin use are connected like a murderer and a ufc fighter are connected a man who has killed someone has probably been in a fight but a man who gets in a fight wo not necessarily kill someone if your only data is asking heroin users if they have tried weed your data is inherently skewed correlation does not equal causation ,1,videos
