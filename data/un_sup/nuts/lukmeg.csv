lukmeg,you would jump on a 470 at 100 now but why would you when the next guy offers it at 95 and the next one at 90 ,2,Amd
lukmeg,depends on the supply let say it gets to a point where all the 480 get unprofitable for mining that point is similar for most miners the only variable that is not common is electricity costs but to get into mining you need cheap electricity already so its not a big range so the point of unprofitability is similar at that point all those gpus go into the second hand market are there enough gamers to absorb them never in the history of gaming has been such a phenomenon and crypto mining was a lot smaller so the waves of second hand gpus supply were much smaller sure a 480 for 144 can look interesting now and given the historical trends of second hand gpus but when has there been a wave of second hand gpus like the ones to come when you have lots of guys trying to outmatch each other to sell you the same product prices can get very low its supply and demand if demand stays the same but supply goes crazy prices are going to crash and there is a second factor to consider gpus used for mining are on 24 7 and often over clocked they are more likely to die early than a gpu used for gaming given this knowledge its very possible gamers avoid second hand cards that are known to had been popular for crypto mining because they could be buying a fried chipset so that even less demand i personally believes miners are relying on old trends too much if they expect to unload these cards at decent prices on gamers ,7,Amd
lukmeg,the traditional banking system is way worse for the environment ,5,Amd
lukmeg,there is a fault on your logic though if mining fails there are a lot of you in the same situation so a lot of cards would be coming into the market at once i highly doubt you could get 60 80 of the original price in that scenario if its you that decide to quit for whatever reason then yes your assumption is valid but if gpu mining fails for whatever reason there is no way you are getting back 60 ,62,Amd

lukmeg,exactly to be honest the fight for government mandated net neutrality in the usa has always looked stupid to me i get that people really believe its the only option but if you take some distance you see how not only stupid but useless it is the regulation will always be questioned and fought has its problems like not allowing cheap limited services that can help poor people and does not solve a lot of other problems lack of competition in the usa telco market creates like high prices poor speeds and abusive costumer support if there was a real push to remove local regulations that give the telco companies an effective monopoly that would be a real game changer that would bring real net neutrality on top of cheaper prices and better service but it goes against the ideology of the democrats and it would hurt the telco companies for real so you wo not heard about this option anywhere ,3,technology

lukmeg, luckily most people realize that a simple blocksize increase will never get us to the type of scale the coffee buyers want this is a blatant misc characterization the problem is we want a decentralized bitcoin not one in which developers decide economic parameters as if they are a central bank it is fine that devs adjust non economical parameters but economical parameters should be decided by a market mechanism otherwise under core economic model bitcoin becomes centralized and ripe for regulatory capture in the future i do not know if it makes economic sense for a coffee to be stored in the block chain and neither do you nor do core or unlimited developers anyone saying they can decide if some purchase belongs in the blockchain or not is anti bitcoin there should be a market mechanism that automatically adjust the economic parameters so then users can decide to use first or second layers based on a decentralized economic calculation that is why people oppose core and its the point core and its clique refuse to discuss and just handwaive asking for a blocksize increase is just a short term solution given the deadlock that has ensued ,6,BitcoinMarkets

lukmeg,my point is that in the past the corporate world was not so feminized you could trashtalk and banter and it was seen as normal boys will be boys what does that have to do with what you are saying ,1,asktrp
lukmeg,corporate game is like that feminized you can not be a traditional alpha in a corporate environment in the present times if you want to talk shit and banter you have to do it outside of corporate hours and in a different social group while in the corporate environment you have to act like a good little bitch ,0,asktrp
lukmeg,i can feel your anxiety through reddit posts imagine how he feels you living with you and all a man hates this situation i can tell you the more a women pressures me to compromise the less i want to i understand your situation is painful for you and your natural instincts are screaming you to get security out of this man i get that but while being a women has a lot of privileges and shields you from the hardships men have to go through it has its negative parts too one of them is that in a lot of situations you are forced to be more passive than you would like think about it you want him to be the man and the captain but you also want to convince him to do what you tell him in this particular but very important issue is he the captain other than in name then and be honest once you are used to that security years past would you look at him the same way if he just gave in to your desires and married you because you pressured him if you are introspective and honest enough you know the answer is no the circumstances you and him have put the relationship in a bad place i believe worse than you realize you because you have been too pushy and somehow sneaky about the marriage thing him because he has weaseled out of the situation has accepted conditions he was not ok with then has gone back and forth and then uses bad humor to keep some sense of distance instead of going straight on to the issues that not manly behaviour i can tell you he feels trapped he feels good with you and the relationship but also trapped its hard to understand that feeling for a women binding a man to you is a great accomplishment its not the same for a man now he is faced with two options one go along with everything but spend the rest of his life knowing that he really did not chose two break the relationship he has no wiggle room because he most probably loves you and the relationship but he wants to feel like a man choosing so can you see how that would make him feel trapped at this point you can break the relationship or back off the pressure and give him space so he can chose for himself if you do not want to break the relationship i would go speak to him and tell him something along these that you realize how hard and how much pressure this situation puts on him tell him that you love him and that he is your all but you are ok backing up to a situation in the relationship that makes him feel more at ease and in control that you could have been a bit too pushy at times and you are going to try to be better at that and actually try but at the same time tell him you are confused and worried because he has been too inconsistent has accepted situations to then go back has accepted situations without fully acknowledge the consequences and that is not how a man a woman can trust behaves tell him that you are giving him your youth so the minimum thing he can do is get his shit together and be consistent there is nothing that hurts more a women than to waste time on a man that just string her along to not be alone tell him that if he wants to leave it will hurt you but he should do it as soon as possible and after the pain is gone you will be thankful for him being responsible tell him that while he will get his space you need him to behave like a man and give you things straight and consistent not act like a child that goes back and forth that you do not want him to accept any condition he is not happy with but that once he has said yes you can be sure he is really for it at the end you are the woman you have the superior emotional skills and social intuition to guess where he is really at is he a good enough loser coasting with you is he a young men with alpha qualities struggling to develop which happens to all alphas is he just stringing you along until he finishes college there are a lot of possibilities but nature gave women superior social skills so you could better navigate these situations you need to take a guess and act accordingly but if you decide he is worthy and trustworthy you need to back off otherwise just break it now and look for someone else to start from zero and do not recreate this situation again ,10,RedPillWomen
