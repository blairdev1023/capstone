TheAndredal, a you do not know what an argument is kiddo as you have yet to submit one b this is also not a goddamn argument which actually supports the contention that you are not only philosophically illiterate but also that you do not know what a goddamn argument is you are defending riley dennis who thinks not being attracted to the same sex or transgender people is homphobic and transphobic you do realize this right if hopping a border makes you an illegal immigrant and to have committed an illegal act makes you a criminal then jay walking makes you an illegal pedestrian and a criminal as well false one is walking over a street illegally and one is being in a country illegally breaking the law every second you are in that country again learn what law is and the difference is this appeal is essentially no different than if i were to ask you to explain to me the fundamental metaphysical difference between a man who is 5 8 and a man who is 6 0 and you were to respond that one is taller than the other well no shit einstein we already know that i am asking you to describe the metaphysical difference between the two things not the aesthetic difference you insipid twit that is a strawman argument as i made no such claim i said one is worse than the other supported by fucking law oh well shit why did not you just say so you make mongoloids look like geniuses not ad hominem just an observation another ad hom roflmfao is that how you think genes work holy shit kid ridding a bike might be beyond you you should probably learn how to walk first yes you can have a disposition to have low iq in your genes did not you do biology in school ,1,SocialJusticeInAction
TheAndredal, a you are wrong b this is not an argument and therefore it does not refute the previous argument that i advanced and c i reject your definition on account of the aforementioned argument you philosophically illiterate dweeb you do not understand the argument you do not understand law and you just resulted to an ad hom again that an awfully audacious statement coming from someone who can neither construct an argument to save his damn life nor understands what an ad hominem fallacy is read the thread aristotle quote me where i stated illegal immigration is not a felony then what the fuck is your argument where is my strawman well shit dude i am fucking convinced now one is a crime and the other is a crime such a blatantly obvious metaphysical difference if only you would been so explicit in your explanation sooner and the difference in the punishment is different what is so hard to understand lmao did you just submit an implicit ad hominem fallacy against riley dennis holy shit you are dumb i am fucking done mate you lost the debate no sound arguments if any offered no refutations presented you have got nothing go ride a goddamn bike oh god that not an ad hominem calling you a fucking idiot is an ad hom and you in fact did that in this response claiming victory over an argument filled with ad homs shows how illiterate you are doing arguments i made an observation about riley dennis not an ad hom i feel sorry for your kids if you ever reproduce cause your genes seem to have low intelligence,1,SocialJusticeInAction
TheAndredal, learn the difference between an argument and an assertion kid ad hominem fallacy is you are a moron therefore you are wrong no it not for fuck sake i gave you the fucking definition your post is thus one big non argument followed by a strawman where the fuck is the strawman you are really fucking bad at this if you cannot explain to me the metaphysical difference between jay walking and border hopping then you literally have no argument with which to defend your objection to my initial statement last chance kiddo failure to submit an argument is a tacit admission of defeat i already gave it to you one is a felony and you are a constant criminal one is a smaller crime which you most likely do not even go to jail to and riley dennis does not know anything about anything he makes everything about race and sex,1,SocialJusticeInAction
TheAndredal, you do not understand what ad hominem is kid ad hominem is you are a intellectually vacant retard therefore you are wrong again using an ad hom https yourlogicalfallacyis com ad hominem ad hominem you attacked your opponent character or personal traits in an attempt to undermine their argument ad hominem attacks can take the form of overtly attacking somebody or more subtly casting doubt on their character or personal attributes as a way to discredit their argument the result of an ad hom attack can be to undermine someone case without actually having to engage with it example after sally presents an eloquent and compelling case for a more equitable taxation system sam asks the audience whether we should believe anything from a woman who is not married was once arrested and smells a bit weird your entire argument is that illegal immigration is not a felony which is literally wrong in every sense,1,SocialJusticeInAction

TheAndredal,from the director that was a big part of my pitch the very first thing i made was a look book of what i wanted the world to look like and what the kids should look like and the high school should look like i lived in new york for thirteen years and it should look like a school in new york it shouldn t look like a school in the midwest in the 50s so i pulled a bunch of pictures of kids and documentary photos of kids in schools and that was part of my pitch and everyone was really into that and followed through with the casting which is so so cool i love the kids it was colorblind initially because it was everyone like any kid ever we just put them on tape and sometimes it was there were some situations were a kid was just great and there wasn t a specific role for them but because it s a high school we can have so many kids and it was an opportunity to be like well this kid is great we don t have a specific role for them but maybe we should create a small role for them or think of a way to incorporate them in some other capacity when you re developing the story and the script while you re casting you can keep an open mind to look for the best kids that s what they did i think i remember reading that s how judd apatow did freaks and geeks where they just sort of looked for kids that were interesting and then shaped the roles around them a great thing about kids is they re just themselves and can t help it a lot of the times so to be able to craft roles around these kids is better than trying to force someone into a preconceived role ,1,SocialJusticeInAction

TheAndredal, i am only using collectivist arguments because i do not know what your specific beliefs are my original comment was addressed to the mra community in general i have argued with people who have said similar things to you before so i am making the assumption that your beliefs are not so different if you lay out your stance clearly i will be able to make specific criticisms of your beliefs otherwise i will have to keep arguing against mras in general i do not have any beliefs i do not follow any ideology i look at facts i am not saying that men cannot be raped or that boys are never traumatized by sexual encounters with older women i am talking about this specific case it does not seem like he was forced or coerced at all if they kept it going for that long then it seems likely he enjoyed it to at least some extent the judge seems to agree with me given how light her sentence was and he is far more knowledgeable about the specifics of the case than both of us why does it then say that it only rape when you are penetrated then according to most laws in the west then how do you know he was not coerced you are again victim blaming and saying he enjoyed it the judge agrees with you because women always get off regarding stuff like this this wikipedia page has the stats on statutory rape by gender https en m wikipedia org wiki statutory rape wprov sfla1 the problem is that you blame this disparity on sexism and double standards in the justice system which probably does play a role for what it worth rather than differences in behavior between men and women this is why we wo not necessarily find the stats that helpful in this debate and it probably best to focus on this specific case wikepedia i a shit source and there is a disparagment women serve 66 less sentance for the same crime that is discrimination http www huffingtonpost com 2012 09 11 men women prison sentence length gender gap n 1874742 html https www law umich edu newsandinfo features pages starr gender disparities aspx,2,MensRights

TheAndredal, the comments are all saying she got off easy people always say these things in r mra when similar stories are linked to i assumed that your opinion would be something similar for this reason sorry if that not the case so why are you using collective arguments fact is i know that at the age of 15 i would have loved to fuck some of my female teachers and the same is true for many guys at that age the two of them had sex multiple times over the course of the summer he was clearly into it to some extent at least this is not even close to a male teacher physically forcing a 15 year old girl to have sex with him the latter is clearly traumatizing in a way that the former is not just because you would does not mean it right saying that he was into it is like saying when a woman was raped that she liked it also women can force boys just like men can force girls also i would need a citation that it not traumatizing for boys now lest you think i consider the teacher actions in this case to be completely ok i do not this kid was not old enough to consent and i do not doubt that he will come to regret this later on the woman certainly should not be allowed to be a teacher and deserves the punishment she got she was in a position of power and abused it if the kid is not old enough that makes this rape i like how you can also speak on behalf of this kid without knowing the boy she should be sentenced i am also betting she will try to get money for the child in the future i only disagree with the false equivalence that you people constantly make with genuine rape sexual assault in which there is force or coercion these are far far worse crimes often leaving the victim traumatized and deserve a harsher punishment it just a fact of life that in these cases the perpetrator is far more frequently male again a collectivist argument what the hell do you mean you people i would like a citation that they are male please i would like to agree with you but i do not listen and believe,5,MensRights

TheAndredal,the only thing close to being acceptable is option c but that just really bad is this really everything you managed to get together after people explicitly said they do not want the rule 3 we want the community to manage what is acceptable there is no option for this at all you have willingly ignored the community great fucking job the rest is just bad all around ,3,KotakuInAction

TheAndredal, as oppose to the old r3 that did the same in both cases articles are judged by the dominent theme no change there no as opposed to before r3 i have seen one or two people addressing the no memes issue i have yet to see anybody address the no meta point mind giving me an example that addresses r9 specifically because people know you do not listen and i am talking about r3 because that what this thread is about i think you would have gotten feedback on them if that was the topic of discussion you can not claim people are not talking about it when it not what the thread is about r3 does not limit anything thematically except for the reintroduction of no memes which is not exactly new either but was thrown out when the last r3 was introduced that your opinion people here disagree so still no answer on anything we are specifically prohibiting with r3 content you are prohibiting content from being posted here again the sheer volume of reports and mod mails about why is this shit allowed here is several magnitudes higher than voices calling let the community decide you can believe that or not but that does not take away the need to strike a balance between the two so why are not they posting in here if there are so many i am skeptical about a claim without evidence your choice is to either constructively work with us in finding improving that balance and tell us where and how you are willing to make some concessions on your end of things or you can keep on being pig headed and let the decision making be up to people that are willing to see both sides of the coin i tried that it got ignored i was insulted and ridiculed by your fellow mods i can tell you one thing for sure the extremes on both sides of this issue wo not ever be happy with us and that something we are all happy to live with then look at the goddamn feedback in here you asked us now listen ,3,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,what are his crazy leaps ,1,SocialJusticeInAction
TheAndredal, and what exactly is there in rule 3 that limits content that was not allowed before beyond for the first time actually including campus issues and general journalism ethics specifically gamergate related topics like journalism censorship and even gaming because you say if there a hint of politics it haram well outside the no memes thing that is which has not actually been an issue you ever brought up specifically either nor the no meta r9 for that matter the only two bits that actually do make a bit of a difference in content none of which are exactly new to the sub either and i have yet to hear any sort of outcry about yet people in this thread right here hate it alrighty if this is really an issue about content allowed or not i would have thought that these two things would at least get some minimal attention but they do not explain is there a theme you are missing maybe we forgot to accord more points to mlp related issues specifically what what theme remove the entire point system i am really not all that invested in the new r3 but beyond that i still have to hear one coherent argument beyond muh feelings as to how the new r3 is a step backwards compared to the old r3 which definitely had it own mod consistency issues and therein lies the problem remove the rule and you will stop the inconsistency let the community decide,3,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,rule 3 you can not be serious ,2,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal, more bullshit first of all i have already stated that i am not invested in the new r3 in that thread of yours on kiainanarchy as you well know second of all my opinion on the matter does not matter at all if the sub is that vehemently against that rule yet the sub was against these rules this is just one more personal attack and some sort of roundabout way of yet again trying to insinuate that i am trying to push my own opinion at the cost of the sub where am i attacking you i am attacking all the mods for acting dumb of course once more totally lacking any sort of evidence or even the most tangential link to remotely prove anything of the sort tell you what next time you accuse me of something you would better have your t crossed and i dotted or i might start finally taking offense at all these spurious accusations lacking anything remotely resembling fact you accuse me of having done something wrong and you would better be able to provide a link then i will be happy to discuss to matter with you and anybody else what sort of evidence do you want i told you look at the comments in this thread i have crossed my t and i you are the one claiming personal attacks here mate yes you and the rest of the mods by implementing rules and ignoring criticism insulting me and others and you claim we are the one attacking you give me a fucking break ,1,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal, it all feelings insinuations and accusations just for the sake of variety it would be nice if a little more of this stuff was actually based on coherent arguments supported by some facts and evidence alright take a look at the comments here the comments that are most upvoted want the rule gone or massively restricted that my evidence too much of this shit is pushing agendas based on perceptions simply not born out by the facts and perceptions at that by people that only see half of the story since they do not see the endless and perpetual stream of reports by people complaining about some of the posts we do allow on a regular basis i do not have an agenda i want this place to be better you also lack the consistency of how you mod the sub i am still in favour of anything that helps improve mod consistency here but if you think that there more than just a tiny minority here that wants to go all free for all you are simply utterly mistaken and basing your facts upon a rather myopic view on things this sub is split on issues such as socjus politics focus on core issues etc etc etc and it is neither in your interest nor in our interest to start drastically picking a side in this so if i am so wrong why are the majority of people in this thread saying that then you the mods told us to give you feedback we are giving it to you and you do not like it not caving to your personal every whim is not the same as not listening to the community as a whole and claiming otherwise is disingenuous at best to be generous so what have my demands or so called whims been then i have never said i speak for anyone else except myself but i am not the only one who holds these views and your fellow mods seems to be ok to use sjw behavior by blocking and throwing out baseless accusations i would clean up my own ranks first before i start criticizing the community i will categorically state once more that i think we have a pretty damn good balance between focus and flexibility in the content we allow here and any great changes either way will just piss of more people than we are already pissing of now http imgur com a 1r70z people disagree with you mate beyond that the new rule did not make any content ot here that was allowed before if anything we specifically included campus matters and general media ethics as allowed topics shit rules are still shit rules this whole panic about mods wanting to dictate the discussion here is entirely fiction really so listen to what the majority of people in here want and remove r3 let the community decide what we want otherwise you are a liar and a hypocrite this is not a free for all chan and it will never be a free for all chan there are limits imposed on us by reddit limits imposed by the subject matter at the core of gg and kia and the reason we are a community in the first place is because we find common ground on a number of specific issues yet you want to limit the freedom of speech outside of those sitewide rules like r3 you do get the irony of this being an anti censorship sub and then censoring comment right you also contradicted your last statement there it these issues that are at the core of gg at the core of kia and at the core of why we are the community we are and it is our job as mods to foster this community by trying to foster the common ground between all of us and who gets to decide that it you mods not the community you are deleting threads and implementing rules people think are dumb ,3,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal, ullshit i admit when i am wrong all the time and i regularly say so and change a call and i am happy to do so ok admit the new changes were bad then more narrative that simply not true in a bad faith effort to put more of a wedge between mods and community what narrative look at the feedback here they are massively against r3 and the new changes i did not do anything to put a wedge between you and the community you managed to do that yourselves,1,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,they wo not realize that,2,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal, any post that tries to drag kia away from it primary goals and into areas best left for other subreddits unless gamergate is directly tired into it also deserve to be clipped away i say we should let the people on the sub decide that,1,KotakuInAction

TheAndredal,agreed ,1,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal, i really do not agree with this perception we do not look for reasons to remove something this is not something we use to get our kicks much easier to approve something and not get into an argument about a removal the tendency will always be to approve not to remove it sure feels that way you never give any explanation for the removal just use the bots to do it for you the poster is guilty until proven innocent,2,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,well that the mod mindset they just remove shit they do not like,2,KotakuInAction

TheAndredal, the only reason why it a political issue to you is because you believe that the answer lies in switching between the left right spectrum all the while completely failing to address the fact that there are anti gaming media assholes on both sides and where did i state otherwise so no i am not going to fall for it you can take your partisan left wing right wing bs and shove it up your ass i am in it for defending my games games media and nerd culture nothing else lol ok nice ad home and no you cannot make it that simple of a strawman you cannot just claim it bs and say you wo not to defend games these are politicians and because political leanings this is happening and i want them out of it as well but you cannot ignore that this is political that would be retarded as fuck,2,KotakuInAction

TheAndredal, politics i know ever since the us pre election started everything is now about politics and people just cannot shut up about it but that still does not make it a main pillar of gg the election was not part of gg bad journalism was and the whole sjw thing has made gg political from the damn start but the amount of agenda driven political bullshit that has nothing to do with this sub has been ridiculous at times what agenda gg mostly leans left for example posts like liberals conservatives any other ideology i currently hate now again want to do a thing that barely deserves a sjw or censorship tag while linking to nothing but a shitty article that uses tweets of nobodies as source that most certainly not one of the main pillars of gg but just someone trying to bring in as much of his political bullshit as possible i would like to see several citations for that and again gg is political and always has been you are just tone policing of what people want to post and you do not like it do you know what you can do downvote it,2,KotakuInAction

TheAndredal,looks like i am talking to myself now that just so weird 3,1,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal, right there in the comment i linked that the mods informal knock it off before i have to hand out warnings warning i mean c mon you say you are part of this community yet you are saying you have never seen that used before give me a break so you got a warning before you got a warning yeesh sounds harsh what was your point in saying that you were glad i was not a mod anymore except for being condescending that was my opinion yeah it is bruh you can spin it all you like but it still an ad hom alright whatever you say mate saying you act like a petulant child is an ad hom now alrighty ,4,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal, looks like you are wrong buddy as per usual alright where is your strike or warning i do not have your approval oh boy what an absolute disappointment that is so what is your point here except for being condescending child apparently is not an ad hom in whatever delusional reality you live in i am assuming so telling that you are acting childish is an ad hominem no it not when all you can do is insult my intelligence or throw ad homs my way then you do not have a good argument and another ad hominem here as well you are really bad at this you wo not suffer any consequences from this anyways ,5,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,alright which am i guilty of badgering harassing another user across multiple threads including persistent u mentions and or replies trolling posts and comments which are clearly not intended to generate discussion but rather just aimed at generating as much drama and outrage as possible divide conquer posts and comments designed to drive a wedge in the community especially when those posts are repeatedly based on speculative or unverifiable info ,6,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal, i like how you just completely glossed over me disproving your accusation that i was demodded for being a child also stopping trying to enforce rules here buddy you are not a mod and it really cringey report my comments or tag a mod in if you think i am breaking rules otherwise idgaf well you are a former mod the rules wo not be applied to you so even if i do report you nothing is gonna happen to you i am glad you are no longer a mod because of the way you act now you are not worthy of such a task when all you can do when responding to criticism is use ad homs and hide behind that by throwing out lulzy accusations that are immediately disproven by anyone with even a modicum of intelligence so me saying that you are acting like a child is an observation and was a guess there was nothing to debunk there it also funny how you again have to insult me to try to make an argument,4,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,i am keeping it civil he the one violating r1 ,6,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal, already did this song and dance a few days ago with another dipshit wanna try again or will you double down on your retardation r1 violation to be a former mod you seem to be a really bad at following the rules you were suppose to follow uh no that not how it works buddy keep trying though it amusing to watch you crash and burn how am i gonna crash and burn you are the one throwing ad homs here mate you really need to work on your debate skills here,3,KotakuInAction

TheAndredal, we all know that when you say community you mean you and your clique it been transparent since day fucking one oh fuck off i do not have a clique way to poison the well this is the shit we do not accept from you act like mods not like sjw with accusations and no facts i am gonna need to see some evidence to back up that claim i am looking through the comments here and the majority so far seems to agree with either the rule to be entirely removed or that you do not dictate the content here,4,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,no there is no irony in that statement you cannot please everyone and you are the one ignoring criticism here and completely deflecting here,3,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,how there is nothing that can force them to relinquish any power,2,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,right so i am just a really passionate sockpuppet then ,2,KotakuInAction

TheAndredal,dude they removed a lot of shit that was relevant to this subreddit because they did not like the content i hate to break it to you but right now the mods cannot be trusted to make that kind of judgment where it too much subjectivity going on that much is clear unfortunately,6,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,agreed,5,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal, keep the rule 3 as is but force every post to show its math on why it relevant have mods simply check the math to make sure it right no because the mods themselves do not even agree and it way to much subjectivity that goes with that,2,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,welcome to kia and their authoritarian rule,3,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,good suggestion,3,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,it just needs to go imho,3,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal, because the last thing we need in a freedom of speech oriented forum with built in voting mechanics is letting the plebs decide what can be seen and this is the problem i have with the mods and how they are running this into the goddamn ground,3,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal, gg is far too important to have its narrative hijacked by a bunch of opportunistic conspiracy mongering partisan fuckheads who could not care less about video games ethics in games journalism or nerd culture except it not just gaming and journalism that gg was founded on ,3,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,welcome to kia,6,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,sure i am just a sockpuppet ,3,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,exactly and they are not held accountable,2,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,who is wanting this sub to completely mod free ,5,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,i agree to this,2,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,except you have all the power here and i have squat i have no say i and i guarantee that my and similar voices will get ignored just wait and see people do not want you to control what gets posted here the rules also are too much open to interpretation you should not have any say with content unless it unverifiable repost dox or just an insult to everyone here this thread wo not change a goddamn thing except for what you mods already have decided on there is no accountability for anything you do ,2,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,that why we have rule 7 do not post unverifiable things rule 3 needs to go,4,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal, some of the things said by the mods tonight has really soured me to this whole subreddit from the clique ish nature of the responses to criticisms to the i dont give a fuck about you attitude most of the mods seemed to adopt all of a sudden that the reason i stopped coming here and stopped posting threads ,4,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,dude this is just gonna be ignored they do not give a fuck,4,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal, given how the mod team has handled the last couple times people tried to tell you that rule 3 needs to be junked or completely rewritten i do not think this is going to go well for anyone they refuse to listen to the community mate because clearly the userbase can not be trusted to think for ourselves after all it not like we have a years long track record of figuring out shit ourselves or anything p s starting off with the premise that the other side is motivated by support for clickbait narrative and bullshit is not a good idea that exactly what they are saying they are saying we are too stupid to post good content just go watch the stream on netscape channel,4,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,good suggestion ,1,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,agreed,3,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,yes i completely agree ,3,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,that a bad post it has never been entirely just about the media it been about journalism games sjw politics and censorship those are the main pillars of gg,5,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,they seem to think that,5,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,no they will just use this an excuse to ignore good posts and suggestions like yours and kill this sub unfortunately,2,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,they do like their echo chamber,5,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal, posters are having to check arbitrary boxes off to satisfy the mods about their posts is not a good policy except that wo not happen if they just remove the entire damn rule all together and just let good content flow to the top,6,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,no because they do not like it when they do not control the narrative,5,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,exactly ,5,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal, i see the current rule 3 as a way of the mods showing how they moderate regarding off topic posts they are being more transparent how dare they if you do not believe that there should be an off topic rule you are in one camp if you believe there should be one then we are just discussing what that should look like that is a cop out they remove anything they do not like,2,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,nothing new there,3,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,and they should be held accountable,3,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal, as one of the longer serving mods i have served under multiple rules systems for the subreddit when we get rid of an off topic rule we see a massive increase in complaints against the content that is now allowed and if that is what the community wants then fuck them you cannot please everyone also it kinda rich that you demand me and others to post in here yet you use the excuse that people complain outside of these threads about off topic threads getting posted here ,4,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,because the mods want to control everything posted here and they want to dicate the content in here,7,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal, i do not want kia to devolve into predominantly political discussion too bad so sad gg has always been about politcs you do not get to dicate what get posted here ,2,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,i agree anything should go here the community should decide the content,2,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,she literally the opposite p,3,SocialJusticeInAction
TheAndredal,right cause i have major issues and getting triggered here ,3,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal, any and all criticism will be dismissed as witch hunting they are already doing that ,5,KotakuInAnarchy
TheAndredal,well blame the fucking mods for giving this sub a slow death,4,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,i would watch the reaction to that,1,SocialJusticeInAction
TheAndredal,i said this a month ago and nobody gave a shit unfortunately,2,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,dude what the fuck is wrong with you ,3,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,the problem here is that the mods do not listen,2,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,look at the comments,4,SocialJusticeInAction
TheAndredal, looking at the situation further it is most likely an outsider trying to take advantage of the chaos pink got mad and jumped to the conclusion that you all were involved because you have been flinging shit her way repeatedly justified or not i do not discord i do not care it on reddit mate also sending it to us and yet accusing people on discord of being responsible is pretty stupid would not you think ,7,KotakuInAnarchy
TheAndredal, edit just a recommendation you might want to edit the user name out of your post even not linking it you are effectively helping spread the dox by spelling it out and as i said the admins have been informed so you likely do not want to get caught up in the suspensions that will be issued so her not doxing anyone and spreading awareness that there is a dox out there is banhammer worthy ,3,KotakuInAnarchy
TheAndredal,so if i have an question or an issue i cannot talk to one of your mods now because she blocked me ,3,KotakuInAnarchy
TheAndredal,that does not prove shit that it came from the discord it was dm ed to me on reddit ,7,KotakuInAnarchy
TheAndredal,i am sure your witch hunt against me is fine because that what we are calling all of this now are not we ,5,KotakuInAnarchy
TheAndredal, you know that sending people to your own posts from outside reddit has been used by the admins as an excuse to shadowban people except i have not sent anyone right now i have more important shit to deal with like the fact that your friends are doxing me guilt by association fallacy i do not know who the fuck are you talking about prove it or shut up and btw i never called you a cuck i do not know where you got that i have screenshots of you calling everyone that i also never called you an sjw or ggr but you are sure acting like one now i have screenshot proof done with you blocking all comms from you and yeah i know you are gonna whine about me blocking you for the next 18 months oh so this is acceptable behaviour on reddit for a mod u handofbane u nodeworx i have not brigaded i have conversed with you on stream and on reddit in good faith and this mod is on a blocking spree accusing me of things ,2,KotakuInAnarchy
TheAndredal, you made jack pull down his images of the same modmail and made him apologize for posting it i did not make jack do anything he did it himself and we are good as far as i am concerned that modmail was there in that thread to poison the well at the time of the post me and him have since made up and why are you speaking for him you also made me delete the modmail image from discord i did not make you delete shit you deleted a lot from discord because you got called the fuck out for the third time now listen to the stream where the admin definition of brigading was read i don care if it was read i am giving you the goddamn definition you and other mods have given as a definition on your goddamn board i did not brigade shit i disproved your claim i tweeted a link and i tweeted the modmail and two mods did the same thing you are the hypocrite trying to claim the high ground here while going behind my back and calling me an sjw a cuck a ggr and lots of other things on discord i know now your apology was not sincere,3,KotakuInAnarchy
TheAndredal,i looked over the links you gave you shared my modmail privately but have an issue with me doing it really here is your definition of it http archive is viar3 do not make posts like let give that idiot a piece of our mind if you come across something stupid someone said on the internet so where did i state anything like that i gave an example of the mod team being out of control you are basicly blaming me if anyone sees that post and does something that like blaiming bearing for what his audience does do not post a call to action to downvote some submission on reddit you disagree with in fact all links to other subreddits comment sections will be automatically removed by automoderator where did i do that if you want to point and laugh then post an archive but brigading dogpiling and call to arms posts against individuals will not be tolerated rule 2 is a factor regarding whether the person counts as a public figure if they do not be certain to anonymize the information and most importantly look but do not touch if you choose to take action offsite in direct response to something posted here you will be dealt with as having violated this rule if not sitewide rules so me posting the link and sharing the link is what now i had one sentence which was not even a response as was denied that fucking response by you guys so again oh wise one where did i do any of this posting a link to something does not mean brigading if i post something and tell everyone to downvote something that is i have never done that if that the case you and ra should also receive a strike on your accounts because you did it on the discord as well ,8,KotakuInAnarchy
TheAndredal,so linking to a thread is now brigading are you serious the sub is open to anyone threatening me does not helpyou one bit how about the bot tweeting out links to twitter that a exact same thing so you are literally saying me having opinions and posting a link as brigading is fucking pathetic you are the one calling me sjw cuck ggr i think you need to take a long look in the mirror as you define brigading as just posting links is really reaching i am on my phone now but will address your tweets that you claim as evidence ,7,KotakuInAnarchy
TheAndredal,should not it say heroines is not that title sexist ,0,sjwhate
TheAndredal, obviously there is a group of people who do not like putting in effort on both sides your opinion on both sides i dislike it because all your spamming does is keep people riled up and on target which is not what i want kia for again your opinion me and others disagree with you also being riled up is what started all of this and frankly the repeated assertions of we are louder so obviously we are right majority etc is stupid where have i claimed this this sounds like projection the mods are wrong about a lot of things but they are not so wrong about that if anything the mods are handling this well by trying their damndest to keep it all centered on the rule 3 issue as the are volt is fairly well spread between those of you upset over it and those who are upset at the mods acting like their shit does not stink and simply want them to follow the same rules as everyone else but hey it is not like you dumbfucks have ever fallen into that trap before right you mean mods being dishonest as fuck and ignoring the community also nice ad hom again in the last sentence,3,KotakuInAnarchy
TheAndredal,am i wrong if i am so wrong why are people protesting it without my involvement ,3,KotakuInAnarchy
TheAndredal,so you think the self posting is why i am not posting there you must be ignorant as hell ,3,KotakuInAnarchy
TheAndredal,i certainly hope so but when pink accuses me of brigading with no fucking evidence i have serious douts,6,KotakuInAnarchy
TheAndredal,well yeah but as i said i think they are gonna ignore the community,5,KotakuInAnarchy
TheAndredal,so you just post the most lazy links where you show all my threads show me where i have posted much regarding breitbart ,3,KotakuInAnarchy
TheAndredal,no show me evidence if i am breitbart light and just spam ,6,KotakuInAnarchy
TheAndredal,i think you are optimistic after speaking to bane and ra yesterday i have serious doubts there was no acknowledgment from them that there is a problem or that the community wants change it just outrage and a witch hunt that what i got from it they are not sjw i would never accuse them of that but atm they are behaving like them they are ignoring their audience which they work for and think they run the place they want to control what kind of content is worthy of the place instead of letting the community decide what they like or do not like,5,KotakuInAnarchy
TheAndredal,oh so prove it then ,4,KotakuInAnarchy
TheAndredal,right i am shilling breitbart please show me this staggering evidence of spam and shilling of breitbart cause i have not only shared breitbart ,5,KotakuInAnarchy
TheAndredal,yeah you just showed how big of a retard you are,7,KotakuInAnarchy
TheAndredal,well that sucks but the mods will ignore all criticism against them and call it a witch hunt ,6,KotakuInAnarchy
TheAndredal,eh what i do not post there anymore and fuck you mate,7,KotakuInAnarchy
TheAndredal,amen,11,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,right it not like am not saying that in a stream going on right now and giving suggestions and trying to get answers from bane or raaraara,1,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,i agree,7,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,i will what i said in my meta thread it seems to me that this subreddit has confusing posting guidelines when it comes to gamergate i have been part of it since the start and i think there needs to be some changes regarding how things get allowed here gamergate has always been political not necessarily taking sides in politics but it been part of its history my suggestion is that anything that mentions gamergate should be able to stay up here no matter if it political figures involved it is relevant for the sub the sub has always deemed what is relevant and what should go to the top it should not be up to the moderators to what goes on this subreddit mods should avoid people getting doxed uncivil discussion with nothing but insults reposts and unverifiable threads the subreddit should also adhere to the white and blacklist that is set up on the guidelines the threads should be allowed in here if it has relevance to art games free speech ethics journalism or tech the best would be all of them meme should be allowed as they would get upvoted by the community by what they like we also avoid it being a bernie hillary trump sub by allowing political posts if they actually use gamergate in their article otherwise direct political articles should not be allowed on the sub as they pertain no relevance to gamergate there should be political ish posts to be posted if 2 or more categories are fulfilled as i mentioned eariler there should also be an open forum with feedback regarding mods when mods have acted outside of the mod role or not followed the rules themselves that should suffer consequences perhaps a three strike law with a 3 month probation for each strike because as of right now there little to no communication between mods and the community if one of them does not like you they can mute you for 3 days in the mod chat more power to the community,18,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,what a surprise ,7,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,remove it entirely gamergate has always been about politics so completely remove that rule also remove the point system entirely let the community post what they deem is worthy you moderate spam doxes etc you should not moderate content,30,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,welcome to what we think is retarded,-4,Drama
TheAndredal,right implying no one here is more autistic,1,Drama
TheAndredal,that was not a joke and if it was an attempt at it it was very poor ,3,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal, ,3,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,it a r1 violation ,3,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,so what did not i answer then ,2,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,what is your point ,1,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,http imgur com a npmul,2,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,i replied to what you said ,2,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,why you are not gonna do anything about it,2,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,how about you have a mod blatantly violating r1 ,3,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal, buddy you are being so retarded here that i cannot even come up with a snarky comeback not like this is a r1 violation you are defending bad mod habits action and their overall behaviour,2,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,technically does not mean that i am wrong mods have not been punished for their indiscretions ,3,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,shill ,6,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal, buddy you are being so retarded here that i cannot even come up with a snarky comeback yes i quit not because the sub was mad at me or had any issues with my moderation but because of real life responsibilities at my job you can spin that in whatever way you want to try and prove whatever point you are trying to make but at the end of the day we both know you are just grasping for straws not at all it not like people are furious at the mods and people like you are ignoring criticism and are shilling for the mods calling people retards and other ad homs hell i have screenshots of a mods calling me and others sjw cuck ggr ,2,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,yes you do you warn them and punish them there are several posts that are deleted in this thread to suggest otherwise mods on the otherhand do not get punished,3,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,that rich of you trying to be all objective ,1,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal, kia users are dead they are not your audience dude they are just fucking better than us,10,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,nice d c shill here,3,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,i guess the witch hunt against me is just something they like to ignore,2,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal, as bane already stated in the sticky we largely ignore r1 violations against moderators he also conceded the rules need adjusting and a meta thread is forthcoming so you admit mods are above rules that nice like the metathreads in the past where suggestions have been ignored ,6,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal, we will see what happens in the thread tomorrow you mean when you delete this thread ,6,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,he doing it on reddit ,1,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,oh sure like you do not just mute people on modmail for no reason ,3,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,exactly and u handofbane is ignoring all of this criticism i have screenshot people posting here so they cannot be deleted by them this is not a small crowd being unhappy with the mods it a large amount of people,2,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal, i will say this though i am definitely not on board with the do not witchhunt other mods thing like i get it it unnecessary drama and starting shit ai not okay but when you are already pissed off critiques and lynch mobs start to look one in the same we fucked up in that regard once and i hope the current mod team does not follow that mistake it does not look like they recognize their own fuck ups,7,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal, the mods are not generally dicks to people yes they are if you have been part of the discord debate you would know that to be a lie they do not care what we have to say,7,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal, i look at the mods possibly overenforcing a rule to keep the subreddit on topic then i look at a bunch of retards accusing the mod team of being sjw infiltrators trying to sabotage the board i do not care if the reasonable critics points have some merit they are being drowned out by the retards i hope they all quit the subreddit and go form r ggrevolt we can get rid of all the retards in one fell swoop and have some rational discussions on here for once any issues with the subreddit rules we can work out in peace and quiet no the mods are using their power to silence topics people like because of their retarded new rules also nice one of poisoning the well by accusing people of being retarded that breaks rule 1 you are also saying that these people are ggr divide and conquer strategy ,2,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal, they were accusing a mod of being a sjw shill that a personal attack in violation of rule 1 no that an accusation a stupid one it not someone namecalling someone a retard ,2,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal, i have long suspected that pinkerbelle is an sjw infiltrator here to control opposition congrats you found one comment ,2,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,crazy except that people think the mods have fucked up and are still fucking up and there are no sides here,1,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,ok,1,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal, there a little clue to the problem they arent one of my moderators they are our moderators and that the problem,10,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,that would imply that mods even listen,4,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,ja und hat nichts mit dir zu tun,3,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,never forget people posting here do it for free,7,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal, stop being an unbearable faggot rule 1 violation,6,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal, this is not a free speech sub what the fuck are you talking about ,4,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,totally you sound like a mod shill ,6,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,how can i get out of this chickenshit outfit ,4,SocialJusticeInAction
TheAndredal,yeah let ignore a stupid rule mods abusing their roles and ignoring criticism also calling this a witch hunt is retarded which you are now part of,5,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal, for not giving in to a shitty attempt at a witch hunt against a moderator oh fuck off with that shit ,3,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,oh fuck off with that shit you are now trying to poison the well by showing what people report here so you can backup this thread getting removed and ignoring all the feedback i would happily send it to you if you had not had a habit of muting people just because you are asspained that your pet post got removed does not mean that gives you the right to play d c against moderators who make decisions you disagree with all this post is is a roundabout way of bitching about rule 3 implementation you are just choosing to do so by way of trying to turn pinkerbelle into your scapegoat rather than complain about the rule itself directly you are the one that sounds like someone who has asspain atm ,6,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,i have screenshot it and it more than what you claim it is,3,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,come to the discord i am sure you will have more fun there,3,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,exactly ,5,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,except that everytime i show my displeasure i get muted in the modmail,4,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,no you have made a rule nobody wanted you do not like being criticized,1,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal, interpretation is subject to debate disclaimer this is my interpretation really really you cannot even figure out your own goddamn rules now ,2,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal, reread that line seriously now step back and try to figure out how the hell you managed to twist do not witch hunt into no criticism allowed stop being disingenuous there a difference between i think x is being approached wrong and this mod is a sjw trying to destroy the sub fucking well get that through your heads no you are being dishonest here you are threatening people because they are criticizing a mod,9,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,nice strawman there,7,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,i made a topic about this a month ago and it was largely ignored by the mods,14,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,if that were true the discussion you are talking about is not happening because of the mods,2,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal, i logged off to play vidya for a few hours came back in to 38 messages in my inbox made an edit to the sticky comment because some people cannot seem to understand the difference between witch hunting and criticism yes you do not know the first goddamn thing about the difference no moderator is perfect and we do overturn decisions several times a week and yet no one is held accountable for anything my solution would fucking fix that that said i absolutely will not bend over and take it when someone decides to direct their rage at something else at one of my moderators for doing their fucking job no you mods are not doing your job you are ignoring the community you are introducing rules no one wants and having your own echo chamber while removing threads if they fucked up it will be dealt with that a lie you guys abused your power against me several times and there were no consequences ,23,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal, everyone please understand that the mods have taken up their position because they believe in what this community stands for and they genuinely want what the rest of us want so much so that they are willing to paint a target on their backs by being moderators with sjws the way they are being a moderator is much more risky than being a mere user beyond that there much more hassle much more stress much more crap to deal with every day they put up with crap from all sides from genuine community members from concern trolls from genuine sjws it only natural and expected that they would not respond well to direct attacks on members of their team but mods please understand that the community is very nervous of power grabs very suspicious of anything that looks like a hostile takeover they have seen community after community they once loved be twisted warped and ravaged by over bearing moderators with personal agendas please be aware of that and please be more tactful in your revisions to rules still not an excuse they have their own rules and are now threatening to ban people who witch hunt the mods it is unacceptable and the reason i stopped coming here i talked about this a month ago where was everyone then nobody wanted these rules and they just made them anyways they do not care about us they just want to make their own rules in this community actions speak louder than words i do not give a fuck what they say their actions do ,9,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal, if you classify threads like this as witch hunting then you have placed yourselves as mods above public criticism that exactly what they are doing the only way we could ever complain would be in modmail individually one user you can mute at will against the entire kia mod team without the public ever being able to see the arguments being made or weigh in you are taking away our collective bargaining power which is all community members have to hold mods accountable in any online forum that the beginning of tyranny that asking for the only accountability you have to us to be in the form of kia mods investigated kia mods behind closed doors and found no wrongdoing this is exactly what i said a month ago ,27,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,or xenomorphs take over the other half,5,SocialJusticeInAction
TheAndredal,sshhhh gender is just a social construct,2,SocialJusticeInAction
TheAndredal,cause i like hearing what people have to say why would i consider your opinion ,2,SquaredCircle
TheAndredal,xenomorphs,5,sjwhate
TheAndredal,that homophobic 3,2,SocialJusticeInAction
TheAndredal,basicly they say that strowman could actually be a guy wwe could rely on and knows what he doing in the ring that basicly the tldw,1,SquaredCircle
TheAndredal,really so if a post is valid you need to prove that it valid instead of the mods actually giving a proper reason of why it not worthy of the sub ,17,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,and you claim the rules are clear right ,8,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal, i am not seeing a problem here of course you do not ,16,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,yeah i stopped posting here because of the mods,25,KotakuInAction
TheAndredal,well she has the pussypass,1,SocialJusticeInAction
TheAndredal,i just say gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayu ,6,SocialJusticeInAction
TheAndredal, no one ever said that a woman strength undermines her femininity actually that exactly what the sjw are saying,4,SocialJusticeInAction
TheAndredal,true,1,SquaredCircle
TheAndredal,because social justice something something,3,SocialJusticeInAction
TheAndredal,well that would mean these people are not retarded and get that,5,sjwhate
TheAndredal,well that intersectional feminism,9,SocialJusticeInAction
TheAndredal,girls from hbo,1,SocialJusticeInAction
TheAndredal,otherwise it racist,14,sjwhate
TheAndredal,true i still think it a shame,2,SquaredCircle
TheAndredal,hmm i still would have thought that heyman should have been the one running the ship there for longer ,2,SquaredCircle
TheAndredal,well yeah after he got caught smoking weed and they fired heyman and butchered ecw ,2,SquaredCircle
TheAndredal,welcome to sanity mate,2,SocialJusticeInAction
TheAndredal, however based on the fact there are 26 thousand people on this sub it would not be shocking if some fair enough also i am a liberal not a conservative,1,sjwhate
TheAndredal,might as well be but i would need some evidence for that tbh,1,SocialJusticeInAction
TheAndredal,but you are assuming then that a lot of people do not you are now assuming people here are breaking the law as well without knowing everyone ,0,sjwhate
TheAndredal,how do you know my political leaning at all i have an argument against the wage gap it is illegal to pay women less just because of their gender does it happen sure but also happens to men and you should sue if that happens ,1,sjwhate
TheAndredal,experience time off education overtime promotion negotiation simple factors ,1,sjwhate
TheAndredal,well yeah they had no effort into their own site and completely ignored people plea about getting people the title like rvd and other wrestlers,2,SquaredCircle
TheAndredal,and you do it actually very simple to find out and the wage gap has been debunked so many times already ,0,sjwhate
TheAndredal,true but it was the early internet days where things were unorganized,2,SquaredCircle
TheAndredal,well yeah i do not think they speak to each other,2,SquaredCircle
TheAndredal,yeah i remember this because i was also part of forums back then,2,SquaredCircle
TheAndredal,i doubt it,1,SquaredCircle
TheAndredal,as far as i remember it he did not do anything his friend however did a lot of stuff and he could not really control them just like it was said in the podcast ,1,SquaredCircle
TheAndredal,give me a citation then ,0,sjwhate
TheAndredal,yeah i never really heard it from him before this part of that podcast was really revealing to me,1,SquaredCircle
TheAndredal, you shifted on the topic riots when i approached the possibility that the alt right could beat up black people i drew my own conclusions and i asked for evidence no i asked if i am a racist,2,SocialJusticeInAction
TheAndredal,the 4 is hours worked and overtime etc still not a wage gap,0,sjwhate
TheAndredal,that sucks man,1,SquaredCircle
TheAndredal, because you guys seems more focused on knocked out trash cans than the death of living human beings citation needed and what do you mean you so tell me this am i a racist ,2,SocialJusticeInAction
TheAndredal,show me alt right people who are organized inciting riots ,2,SocialJusticeInAction
TheAndredal,and the trailer dropped and now there are french soldiers two people are not a rule ,1,SocialJusticeInAction
TheAndredal,oh i am sorry the alt right are in the streets beating people up oh wait ,2,SocialJusticeInAction
TheAndredal,me neither i am going to buy it used,1,sjwhate
TheAndredal,i put on my shirt the wrong way i am joining isis ,2,sjwhate
TheAndredal,fair enough,1,sjwhate
