mrcassette,most jobs in the us have higher wages than the uk i think the median annual police patrol officer salary is 53 141 as of may 30 2017 with a range usually between 44 255 62 719 however this can vary widely depending on a variety of factors ,1,conspiracy
mrcassette,i was commenting about this yesterday these sort of statements scare the crap out of me as a non us citizen any idea of dealing with the police here genuinely terrifies me for the sole reason that they seemingly can get away with pretty much anything ,1,videos
mrcassette, i would imagine it a lot better being a cop in the uk than in some of the high crime areas in the us yeah for sure knowing that anybody you approach in almost any situation could have a gun would be enough to have you constantly on edge as for wage the starting salary for police constables in england wales and northern ireland is between 19 383 and 22 962 rising to 37 254 at the top of the scale achievable after about seven years in scotland it slightly higher starting at 23 493 and rising to 36 885 achievable after about ten years ,2,conspiracy
mrcassette,was watching a uk police show yesterday brit now in the us and i would forgotten how friendly 99 of them are and genuinely want to help even being polite and working with criminals once arrested to make sure all the evidence is heard and it dealt with fairly and openly even in the worst circumstances i know not all police are like this but the majority do seem a lot more caring than the us that i have seen but once money is involved everyones attitude can be swayed ,3,conspiracy
