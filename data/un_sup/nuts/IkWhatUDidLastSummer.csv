IkWhatUDidLastSummer,can it be much more 1 sided than only 9 being in favor of the event thats about as 1 sided as it gets the opinion of the non vocal minority has been shut down dont say minority about something that is by far the vast majority unless u want to look like a complete idiot ,1,2007scape

IkWhatUDidLastSummer,you are welcome a trick you can do is smell to coffee in between testing scents that way it will sort of reset the smell and one scent wont interfere with the new one youre testing and have in mind that skin chemistry is a thing as well so a scent may work different once its applied to your skin ,1,fragrance
IkWhatUDidLastSummer,theoretically you can but practically theres no chance so therefore i say its impossible a greater chance you will hit the lottery the way fishing works is that theres an initial starting phase that lasts 1 tick then theres a waiting phase that lasts 3 ticks and then a chance phase that lasts 1 tick this means you have a potential chance of catching a fish every 5 game ticks this chance is obviously lower on sharks than it is for monkfish but every 5 game ticks theres a chance a shark will appear in your inventory 5 game ticks is equivalent to every 3 seconds you can potentially obtain a shark ,8,2007scape

IkWhatUDidLastSummer,change your wording to after failing a poll because bots dictated it one of the best money making methods in the game yeah another guy talking out of sheer ignorance let me tell you this how about this go to wilderness now pk for 1 hour and every time you kill someone you write down the number of bones he dropped if this even comes close to the best money making method in the game i will give you 25m cash you got this comment on it how does that sound just record it and put it on youtube and should i mention as soon as this update takes place bots would stop immediately doing green dragons and it would not nearly be as profitable pr hr also it doesnt impact the economy except for making it more profitable for legit players since this is really just taking bones from 1 player and giving them to another its not like more bones enter the game dont talk about something you dont know ,1,2007scape
IkWhatUDidLastSummer,maybe read before commenting i have killed tons of green dragons without being pked and the wilderness is generally for playerkilling thats what its intended for so cant come to you as a surprise that people get killed when entering the wilderness yes i do go to the wilderness alot im basically there 10 14 hours a day i said i dont pk much thats a huge difference also let me remind you to maybe read before commenting also it should maybe be reconsidered whether it should just be hard wildy diary that gives access to this since its mostly high level player with wildy elite obviously noted bones with hard diary would only work when killing people with bones in the inventory and not when killing green dragons urself yeah you disagree because all this will do essentially is to move money from bots to legit accounts and make green dragons more profitable in the long run with fewer players doing it ,1,2007scape
IkWhatUDidLastSummer,again you are talking out of sheer ignorance and it wouldnt be the best money in the game sometimes you are gonna spend several world hops finding a bot within your level then green dragon might pj you then you gotta kill the guy then other pker tries to jump you because he wants some loot as well then you spend money on runes then you gotta bank occasionally then you are gonna be unsuccesful on kills and the most important factor bots would stop doing it so it would not be worth at all doing unless they decide at one point going back to botting green dragons and like i said i would much rather want a legit player to get hold of the bones than i would want a bot to sit with the money theres no way this would even come close to be able to compete with the best methods of making money in the game not even on the first days and after that bots will die out and find other methods for making money ,0,2007scape
IkWhatUDidLastSummer,thats why i wrote also it should maybe be reconsidered whether it should just be hard wildy diary that gives access to this since its mostly high level player with wildy elite obviously noted bones with hard diary would only work when killing people with bones in the inventory and not when killing green dragons urself ,0,2007scape
IkWhatUDidLastSummer,what would it change i think you are being a bit ignorant here its not like more dragon bones and green dhides enters the game they go from a cheating players hand to a legit players also this would mean less bots would bot green dragons as its probably not worth it ,-1,2007scape

IkWhatUDidLastSummer,i am a guy who votes no to every update in the game that is not qol but heres actually one i voted in favor of because i think its a piece of content that will do alot great for the overall state and health of the game theres only one reason that this failed the poll and that because of bots should we let bots dictate the shape this game should be in and are we gonna let them get away with it among the no voters besides the great majority of them being bots theres also a few ignorant people being all like muuh i hate pkers i do not want to give them any power and then there are maybe a few green dragon killers being like nope it may be good for the game but i kill green dragons and i dont want to be killed by pkers but theres really no need to have that attitude because this update will boost the green dragon economy and dragon bones and green dragonhide will most likely be worth more well idk about green dhide since its prolly tied to alch price so current green dragon killers that arent bot will actually benefit alot and theres also gonna be less crowded at green dragons and so it will be easier to find kills and shorter downtime so you can probably kill more green drags each hour i do not pk much myself but ill probably see if i can kill some green dragon bots just for some fun if i see someone who is not a bot i will obviously off him but i know every pker may not have that mentality but even in the case just remember while ure under attack by the green dragon you cannot get attacked by a pker so just glory out when you see a pker bots will not be able to do that because they will only register a pker after they have been attacked unless they come up with something smart also it should maybe be reconsidered whether it should just be hard wildy diary that gives access to this since its mostly high level player with wildy elite obviously noted bones with hard diary would only work when killing people with bones in the inventory and not when killing green dragons urself ,1,2007scape

IkWhatUDidLastSummer,thanks sir that was exactly what i was trying to say ,2,nba
IkWhatUDidLastSummer,sorry if i did not make it clear enough im not the best when it comes to explaining things what i mean is that athletes born today are better athletes than ones that were born 50 years ago just out of sheer nature by this im not saying that an athlete born 50 years ago cant be better than an athlete born today obviously comparing them in their primetime but what i mean is that objectively speaking athletes today are just better and thats because of a number of reasons i think its a bit silly to say oh it only boils down to this theres alot of reasons for it for instance look at someone like maurice greene if there wasnt a way of comparing him 1 1 to other sprinters people would still to this very day potentially consider him a greater sprinter than usain bolt arnold schwarzenegger is another example regarded one of the best bodybuilders and pioneers of bodybuilding and he played a huge role in many aspects of society and the way man viewed himself etc but theres no way he would ever come close to winning mr olympia in 2017 in his prime because of a lot of reasons like genetics more medicaments available today much more competition today more people committing to the sport more knowledge like alot of reasons contribute to the overall state that athletes in 2017 overall are far surperior athletes to the athletes of 1990 another way is just to look at how incredibly many athletic records are broken constantly to the point where no records are from back in the 90s almost i know its inevitable in a way but still sorry i hope it makes a little bit of sense im just saying that overall athletes today are better athletes than athletes that lived 50 years ago thats obviously just generally speaking so by that wilt can still be a greater athlete than lbj idk enough about wilt to make the comparison with him ,3,nba

IkWhatUDidLastSummer,they are doing some very very basic stuff tho since there are no enemies urban warfare is extremely difficult compared to regular war because theres so many places you cant have vision of when its not an open terrain and you may not be fully aware of how the building is constructed you gotta have cover inside outside the building etc its difficult on so many ways these kids probably wouldnt do so well against trained soldiers they made some mistakes like when opening a door you dont wanna have the guy peaking and securing be the guy who opens the door as well because if he got shot immediately the rest of the group would be in a bad position and hes too vulnerable when hes the one to open the door but obviously thats not an issue since they arent facing any threats so they can get away with the mistakes theyre making they have had some basic training thats evident ,5,watchpeopledie

IkWhatUDidLastSummer,meh dmm was okay to watch but his runescape streams are generally boring its almost the point where im annoyed when i watch ice play runescape because hes so god awful mechanically in a pvp fight he never watches his prayer or health he cant click properly he cant switch weapons its so painful to watch it hurts thats why dmm was only just tolerable because the fun content was watching him with his scuffed 400 deaths but besides that his runescape content is just meh i love his real life streams tho i think its interesting and i think his encounters with other people strangers are something unique and you know the most fked up shit will happen on his stream as well what i hate is just the callers ruining so much content like theres alot of places he cant go and he gets interrupted alot its just a huge annoyance ,1,2007scape

IkWhatUDidLastSummer,ofc its good that they patched it but that doesnt change the fact that they patched it way too late just look at the ridiculous amount of maxed combat players and look at people with 200m def xp or people with 70m atk str def just from afk the consequences are still very much evident to this very day why because they fixed it too late the only proper way to really fix it would be to either roll back those that got xp from being afk or simply restart the entire game or reset everyones combat xp to 0 and i quite frankly doubt that people would be in favor of that so just removing it was a good move but it was defintely done too late ,-1,2007scape
IkWhatUDidLastSummer,actually we are heading towards eoc ironically enough because of the polling system because 75 or more wants easyscape at this point in time its evident ,0,2007scape
IkWhatUDidLastSummer,yes they can win if they actually did something when it was first mentioned already after a week of zulrah there was several threads complaining about how op it was and at that point we had only been paying the consequences of its opness for one week so yeah jagex can defintely win if they patch it early just look at nmz afk and splashing due to that being 6hr we are still seeing the consequence of that today people have maxed alts just from doing afk nmz back then and people have 200m def from it and there were more people max combat after 1 year of nmz afk than there ever was 5 years of runescapes release and that even had more players lol ,0,2007scape

IkWhatUDidLastSummer,how come so many people happen to be reading too much into this whole ice puts an arm around this girl you think theres a 101 textbook guide with a definite answer on how to pick up women when they are infact all different and therefore should be treated approached diffrently id say putting the arm around her in this case is 99 better than what any neckbeards on this sub would do in this position what ice is doing is essentially leading its showing confidence its showing hes alpha it makes him stand out to other guys particularly because no1 else would have done it from what i can read in this comment section so thats another way for him to distinguish himself from everyone besides what he already does we are talking about a girl who is doing well for herself and a girl who gets many offers on a daily basis because everyone wants to hook up with a girl like that leading the way like ice does is totally the right way to go about it and those saying its cringe are all people that would probably do awful around her and probably around girls in general cringe is a subjective feeling you have i didnt cringe at all autists are typically terrible at understanding and picking up social cues so it would be easy for someone like ice to misunderstand and misinterpret the situation and make the wrong decision but that doesnt happen at all when ice puts his hand around her does her facial expression suggest to you that wow this is weird and off putting no it doesnt at all she seems super calm and it seems so natural and she is all smiles so there was nothing wrong with the decision when shes just standing there next to ice poseidon and mexican andy shes standing out in the open shes exposed she may not be totally comfortable with the situation she doesnt know what will happen 100 etc so what happens when ice poseidon puts his hand around her is that hes leading hes showing the way hes making her comfortable hes showing her that he knows exactly whats about to take place and it makes her relaxed tl dr you did a good job in this case ice poseidon by putting your arm around her and it seemed like the most natural thing in the world to her as well when you did it you probably wouldnt have put the hand down if she responded in a weird manner when you did it but thats whatever you are ice after all cx ,-2,Ice_Poseidon

IkWhatUDidLastSummer,incorrect barely anyone lives by the old testamente anymore and the new one doesnt have violent passages and yes islam does encourage to kill all infidels and everyone who doesnt believe in allah so you can be sure if 99 of the populaton were muslims the last 1 world population would be killed 100 ,9,watchpeopledie
IkWhatUDidLastSummer,safe to say you are completely wrong just look at the incredible number of violent passages in the quran isis represent islam perfectly heres just a few and kill them wherever you overtake them and expel them from wherever they have expelled you and fitnah is worse than killing and do not fight them at al masjid al haram until they fight you there but if they fight you then kill them such is the recompense of the disbelievers fight them until there is no more fitnah and until worship is acknowledged to be for allah but if they cease then there is to be no aggression except against the oppressors ,6,watchpeopledie

IkWhatUDidLastSummer,items are not lost on death idiot you have 1 hour to get them back gravestones never lasted that long you spawn with majority of untradeables in ur inventory so it doesnt even make a difference theres currently 25 000 players playing runescape back in the day there was over 100 000 and that was with punishing death mechanics where you would lose everything if u were to die at rock crabs for instance except for 3 items and u wouldnt have time to get it back so quite frankly you are 100 incorrect as to that being the reason people dont play this game lol zulrah is way too op in terms of money u can get more magic logs hr from zulrah than u can cutting magic logs and doesnt take into consideration all the other drops u get also its super easy once u get the hang of it doable with 75 magic ranged even 1 defence so yeah the average player will defintely be capable of doing zulrah ,-1,2007scape
IkWhatUDidLastSummer,yeah its a mechanically interesting boss ,1,2007scape
IkWhatUDidLastSummer,already feels like a private server in so many other aspects and not just the nievescape aspect of it like the house pool restoring everything nothing lost on death every item in the game slapped onto zulrahs table etc stuff like that is completely things mechanics a private server would have every monster in the game in one cave is another but its one of the smaller problems in all of this glad they fixed it either way ,2,2007scape

IkWhatUDidLastSummer,no but all just bystanding should defintely be punished not as hard as the guy actually hitting but they should defintely recieve a punishment for not doing anything the act of not doing anything is terrible and in this case its a no brainer he cant even be considered a bystander he can be considered involved in the assault because hes on the team with the guy he doesnt prevent his friend from doing it its really easy to cool him off when hes friends with him go inbetween he actually encourages him he films it when he goes to the ground he doesnt give a fk about him either in that situation he should be giving first aid calling the police asap just the fact he didnt do that is 100 punishment he should be charged for publishing the video as well he should recieve the same punishment as the assaulting guy 100 ,-1,watchpeopledie

IkWhatUDidLastSummer,if you think grinding for rep is the least fun part of any mmo i wonder why u picked runescape out of all mmos just quit the game and find any other mmos that isnt nearly as long of a grind the thing that seperates runescape from any other mmo is that its really hard a long journey to get maxed on not anymore those since its easyscape on osrs now as well but u get the point it was pretty hard to achieve max in all stats when osrs was released ,1,2007scape

IkWhatUDidLastSummer,i cant believe we have this dense people running around freely in our society holy crap most of these pirates are local fishermen is pure bullshit and goes to show that u know nothing about what ure talking about heck majority of these dont know what fishing is they are nothing but criminals using this as their way of income its not like they use it as an alternative u dumb delinquent ohh today im gonna fish my trout and salmon and feed to my 3 poor kids and the next day im gonna be violently kill shoot and loot and entire crew and its members lmfao what do you think this is you dont even understand the concept of pirates let me give you the literal definition so that you can get a grasp of what youre trying to talk about piracy is an act of robbery or criminal violence by ship or boat borne attackers upon another ship or a coastal area typically with the goal of stealing cargo and other valuable items or properties those who engage in acts of piracy are called pirates the anology with a store owner defending his store from robbery is absolutely 100 on point i will give you that the store owner is the russian warship and those carrying out the robbery are the somali pirates glad you brought that up also i dont talk about an entire region being villains im talking about pirates being villains read and research before you make assumptions ,6,watchpeopledie

IkWhatUDidLastSummer,oh not this bs again idk why the same pathetic sjw appear in every thread to defend this religion every single time fact is christianity moved on islam have not just check the numbers of people killed in islamic terrorist attacks as im in the middle of typing all this youll find that several people are being killed in the name of islam and you cant just say isis doesnt represent islam without backing it up why do they not i will claim that isis does represent islam pretty well and i can find several verses to back that standpoint up heres two that reads 2 193 and kill them wherever you overtake them and expel them from wherever they have expelled you and fitnah is worse than killing and do not fight them at al masjid al haram until they fight you there but if they fight you then kill them such is the recompense of the disbelievers 2 193 fight them until there is no more fitnah and until worship is acknowledged to be for allah but if they cease then there is to be no aggression except against the oppressors moderate muslims do for the most time not cause a problem why because they are not really religious and because they do mainstream things like dating drinking alcohol banging chicks and what not have you so can we really consider these muslims they are obviously not the ones we are talking about but to deny the obvious problems that exist within islam is just beyond foolish and flat out ignorant if you want to educate urself a little bit on the subject heres a link for you http www pewforum org files 2013 04 worlds muslims religion politics society full report pdf in the link youll find that 1 1 billion support sharia law thats crazy considering what sharia law is and that just goes to show that islam does not bond with western values in any possible way ,27,watchpeopledie
