gm2,well this also assumes that your area of practice is pretty wide open many professsions are pretty close and people talk to each other a lot at the management level most people have a friendly relationship with others in the profession even if they are competitors so if i am contemplating hiring someone who was suddenly available i would definitely make an unofficial phone call to the person former employer and have a conversation ,2,Futurology
gm2,here what i did graduate with bs get full time job with decent pay wait a year or two to learn the profession and get comfortable i waited 5 because i was not sure i wanted to go back to school talk to your employer about going back to grad school maybe they even have tuition reimbursement most employers support more education because not only does it make you a better employee but it looks better to customers to have a well educated staff reapply to grad school take night and or online courses in your free time take 3 or 6 hours per semester including summers and you can graduate in about 2 years with an ms pay it as you go with your job salary and you will have an ms and be debt free you are already paying living expenses with your job salary so the only expenses out of pocket are tuition fees if you need help with those take a small loan i did 16k because i decided to quit my job the last semester i paid that off in maybe 2 years with no sweat ,2,Futurology

gm2,i read through the advice others gave and it all pretty good i will summarize my experience with a 4 year old daughter and 6 month old son 1 you are going to get frustrated sometimes do what you need to do but do not shake the baby and do not take out your frustration on mom or the baby it going to be better soon 2 colic is pretty common both my kids had it they start crying about 7 pm and nothing you do will make them stop until about 10 pm it only lasts a few weeks and then goes away by itself see rule 1 3 newborn poop does not really stink when breastmilk is all they get it is a pretty mild smell you are going to get some on your hands sometimes but it washes right off they will be fine on the changing pad when you are washing up 4 have a rocking chair beside the crib because you will be rocking the little one back to sleep a lot buy a new one if you need to 5 they go through a lot of diapers maybe 10 a day for a while amazon mom is your friend 6 i do not think men are hardwired to deal with the newborn infant stage we were supposed to be hunting buffalo and shit during this stage deal with it for the few months it lasts and at about a year they will be walking and talking and it will be a lot more fun i can deal with my 4 year old no problem but the 6 month old is a trial for me 7 do not let the baby sleep in bed with you and your wife it tempting as hell because she will have to get up to nurse every 2 3 hours at first but if you do this the baby will not learn to sleep alone in the crib not to mention it is a safety hazard for a newborn at 6 months the baby is ready to move into his own bedroom and he will sleep so much better there you will all get a lot better sleep if you resist the urge to bring baby into your bed get a wireless sound monitor and or a wireless ip camera to keep tabs on the little one if you want but he should be sleeping in his own bed ,1,AskReddit

gm2,well see my response http www reddit com r iama comments 33s9qx iama traffic engineer ama cqpxikg to u kevinkit above other than that you are talking about making concrete traffic barriers high enough that no one can see over them and that a lot of concrete expense personally i think you could justify it but on the other hand i suspect once business owners got wind of it they would complain because now drivers cannot see the cracker barrel or whatever on the other side of the road and unfortunately that a real consideration engineers have to make ,1,IAmA
gm2,yeah actually there is one thing i have seen that works it was not technically designed to prevent rubbernecking but instead to prevent the sun from shining into drivers faces but it really works the same way you know sometimes there are concrete barriers between the lanes right well in some places where the angle of the road is just right the sun will shine directly into drivers eyes at certain times of the day so the design i saw was to install these paddle type plastic things on top of the concrete barriers that are angled in such a way to block the sun when it is low enough to be a problem this has the extra effect of preventing a view of the other side of the highway except for at 90 degree angles or close to it that prevents rubberneckers but it probably kind of expensive to do that mile after mile and so you mainly only see it when there is a need to block the sun glare ,1,IAmA

gm2,i saw that and i think the world owes these guys a debt can one of you nuclear engineers explain why the melted fuel getting into the water filled basement would have resulted in a second larger explosion seems like it would have maybe caused a lot of steam but why an explosion unless the whole thing were airtight and just pressurized until it burst but that seems unlikely given that the roof of the building was already blown off ,3,pics

gm2,ha no i have not seen that one kind of hard to imagine how they arrived at that did they dust their hands off and say that should do it honestly i am sure it got built piecemeal over the years and they put in whatever would fit still pretty funny ,1,IAmA
gm2,yes if the agency chooses they can install advanced loops to start the detection process while the vehicles are still approaching here a screenshot from a camera showing an advanced loop here http i imgur com t8ggxwx jpg the same effect can be done with inductive loops and radar is designed specifically for this ,1,IAmA
gm2,scooters and sometimes even motorcycles are a little problematic for detection there are a few types of detectors currently in common use 1 inductive loops they are wires cut into the pavement and they look like this http i imgur com qwgmoko jpg sometimes they are circular or smaller squares but in general they are a set of wires that are laid into the pavement they work when something metal like a car is nearby which changes the induction value in the wire which can be sensed by the controller as a vehicle 2 video vehicle detection systems vivds cameras like this http i imgur com 2twivte jpg they can analyze the video to determine when a vehicle is present 3 radar detectors all of these technologies struggle to some extent with small profile vehicles like a scooter your best bet is to present as wide of a detectable profile as you can if your detector is a loop try to park right on top of one of the wires preferably the middle wire in the quadrapole system shown in the photo if it a camera and you can kind of angle yourself when you are stopped that gives the camera a wider target to detect if none of those work maybe the detector is not working at all i would recommend that you call and tell them what you told me and they can make some adjustments you can increase the sensitivity of the detectors and if they know there is a problem maybe they can solve it that way ,3,IAmA
gm2,yes the signal cycle length and green time for each approach is designed based upon the amount of traffic present and they can be changed on a time of day or day of week basis so if the expectation is very light traffic at a particular hour the engineer may have specified only 15 seconds for the maximum green time at which point it cycles away and serves another approach maybe they are getting more traffic than they expected and that why the green time seems inadequate to you if that the case call the traffic engineering office and ask them to take a look at it maybe the traffic patterns have changed and they do not know it they are usually happy to help with a citizen request ,1,IAmA
gm2,their sirens do not really have anything to do with it although they are typically on when the vehicle is running hot and preempting signals usually they use an infrared emitter that sends a beam to a detector at the signal which can then let the controller know to give green time to the proper phase of the signal there are also gps based systems which can calculate the arrival time of an emergency vehicle even when it is around the corner and not within line of sight we have designed a couple of those systems recently i do not know what irvine does but yeah emergency vehicle preemption is a real thing and it will sometimes cause phases to skip for a couple of minutes while the ambulance rolls through ,3,IAmA
gm2,personally i have not seen any systems using google data for traffic policy implementation but maybe that will change we were recently selected as a consultant for a city around here for signal design signal timing and its and i know it was based at least partly on our inclusion of a purdue university professor who research involves real time performance measures evaluation typically that involves installing detectors on the roadway but maybe we can find a way to use google crowdsource data there would probably be potential for journal articles and more traffic groupies if we could figure that out driverless cars it would be earthshaking if it went mainstream and widespread but i am not expecting it within the remainder of my career probably about 20 more years there are too many legal and policy issues to sort out first and those kinds of gears grind exceedingly slowly just off the top of my head how do you get a computerized guidance system to recognize quickly changing roadway conditions lane closure tree in the road etc the way a driver brain does can it be programmed perfectly who is liable when the first inevitable fatality occurs with a driverless vehicle if we make adjustments to standard signal or roadway designs how does that affect the driving algorithm ,3,IAmA
gm2,your mission should you choose to accept it is to drive through this roundabout http i imgur com 3vcvqsq jpg ,4,IAmA
gm2,i like clearview i have never thought it was hard to read at all i agree that people just like to complain about things ,1,IAmA
gm2,ok so there are different ways to define level of service for a traffic signal you normally use the control delay ie delay in seconds per vehicle caused by the signal itself for a freeway a lot of times you use operating speed if you wanted some other metric you could define level of service as anything you wanted if you mean do i think we should have something more specific than level of service c then my response is probably no it just a way to describe how the facility is working in a general way which is usually sufficient for things like reports to other engineers you can always provide more detail if it is needed i am not sure which controversy you mean about the highway funding there are several the gas tax needs to be higher and maybe indexed to inflation but that considered regressive toll roads are not very popular but they are probably not going anywhere because states just do not have the money they need to fund big projects maybe the answer can be a combination of things a one time adjustment to the gas tax roadway impact fees to developers or perhaps tie the tax to property evaluations with a certain amount allowed to be deducted those are things decided above my pay grade ,1,IAmA
gm2,interesting scats is a computerized traffic management package i take it we rode the bus a lot in dublin temple bar the guinness brewery the old jameson distillery etc ,1,IAmA
gm2,i think there is potential for its to be applied to bike routes but it would take a commitment on the part of the cities to implement it the main value of its is getting information to and from the user what information might we want to send to the biking public maybe street closures stuff like that the challenge is going to be justifying the cost for the infrastructure the economic incentive of keeping your travelers informed is much smaller for bikers than it is for drivers but maybe in a big city where there is a lot of commuting and delivering going on with bikes you might justify some kind of dynamic message sign or maybe an opt in message delivery to smartphones ,1,IAmA
gm2,low 6 figures with 12 years experience ,1,IAmA
gm2,yeah there one system called rhythm that was deployed in a few places a few years ago the hype for this thing was incredible as in it just made traffic congestion almost non existent but the reality is that it did not work as well as advertised and it has caused some problems and fallen out of favor lately i am sorry i do not know the details but i bet you can find some lessons learned type analysis out there somewhere i might look them up myself to be honest so the answer to your question is that yeah some attempts have been made to analyze the platoons flowing down the street and time the signals to match but it has not really been done well at this point ,2,IAmA
gm2,do you mean the ramp meters signals that tell you when you can go up the ramp and onto the freeway those are to control the level of service on the freeway facility itself basically the theory is that you prefer a higher level of service on the freeway than on the local roadway network if you have to choose one or the other as for wealthy politically connected citizens they do have more influence over the traffic system than your average joe one job i was at the mayor demanded and got a signal at the entrance to his subdivision even though the warrants were not really met everyone in the traffic department was opposed to it but political pressure was applied to the department and the order came down from on high to design and build it more generally every city in the world is heavily influenced by the people who develop within it and developers are typically rich guys or they could not afford to make the investments so yeah just about every city is designed the way some rich guy s thinks it should be not necessarily a bad thing but sometimes it is ,1,IAmA
gm2,noted i will check that out ,3,IAmA
gm2,after thinking about this question for a few minutes i think it can be compared to an access management policy you do not want to let every single business construct a driveway onto your street and you do not want unrestricted left turns into and out of driveways because doing so increases accidents and congestion so you do things like build medians and make people turn right into and out of driveways improving safety decreasing congestion by making people drive a little bit further so if you want to extend the analogy to streets instead of driveways you can definitely argue that an arterial with 10 residential street intersections will experience a better level of service than the same length of arterial with 20 intersections remove some of them force people to use more of the capacity on the ones that remain and the system as a whole performs better maybe that did not directly relate to braess theorem but it a pretty good analogy i think and one that we do encounter a lot ,3,IAmA
gm2,well keeping in mind the main street is going to always get the lion share of the green time i would say it more likely 4 5 minutes of average wait time either way it a pretty long time your typical urban cycle length is on the order of 90 150 seconds so we are talking about tripling that queues lengthen pedestrian wait times lengthen etc i think you would get a lot of calls ,1,IAmA
gm2,if you mean how practical would it be to have a series of signals turn green for a few seconds while a car goes by then turn back to red immediately not very at least not as portrayed in the movie it might be possible if you were able to both compromise the network and you understood how to program traffic signals the signal controller software can be pretty esoteric depending on what kind of controller you would have better luck getting a preemption emitter like fire trucks have that could get pretty close to the effect from the movie but getting the signals to change back to red would take some thought maybe you could have another emitter on the back of your car and shoot the signal from the other direction after you would passed the signal will always time its minimum green after a preemption so depending on what the time setting is you might could do it ,5,IAmA
gm2,yeah call the traffic office and say that you believe that a detector is out at whichever intersection it typically a hardware failure and sometimes they do not know about it or maybe they do not have budget to fix everything so the ones getting complained about take priority ,2,IAmA
gm2,yeah that a good point they will break down if they are saturated but typically you would do some studies to figure out what kind of traffic to expect within the design life of the facility and design it to accommodate that traffic ,2,IAmA
gm2,keep fighting the good fight brother ,3,IAmA
gm2,not too late but i am getting ready to go visit my grandmother and your question is more in depth than i have time for at the moment i will think about it and respond tonight ,1,IAmA
gm2,no i am not very good at c s i have only done like two cities but i wish they would implement a way to exert more control over the traffic every intersection has a signal and there no way to control the timing that would be a good upgrade once you are a certain size to be able to add a traffic engineering service but it might be hard to program ,8,IAmA
gm2,to me if you integrate or differentiate it is calculus ,7,IAmA
gm2,you can test it go there and do not press the button and see if the crosswalk activates after a minute or two if not it still needs to be actuated chances are that the button was replaced to upgrade the signal to a accessible pedestrian signal aps those are mandated now and they typically have audible messages for visually impaired pedestrians if the button is physically difficult to press it may be stuck or dirty call your local traffic office and ask if they can check it because it should not be hard to actuate the signal if it is working properly if people take one thing away from this ama i hope it is that they should call the local traffic engineering office and ask questions they are there to help and they do not mind citizen calls at all as long as you are reasonably polite the way you describe it makes it sound like a mid block crossing ie not at a regular traffic signal is it a hawk crossing like this one http i imgur com y2n2jrn jpg ,3,IAmA
gm2,i have always been pretty good at math but differential equations the calculus class you take after cal iii was pretty tough two rules always go to class no exceptions and always attempt the homework even if you do not know where to start figure out where you have gotten stuck and ask the professor to help you ,6,IAmA
gm2,i would say that it depends on what is causing the jam the 1 thing that would help prevent delay is if people would stop rubbernecking things on the other side of the freeway other than that probably not a lot if one of the lanes on your side is shut down there going to be delay no matter what you do changing lanes and stuff has a minimal impact on the overall flow if the interstate is jammed i do not know that one lane vs the other moves any differently with the obvious caveat that if the outside lane is stopped the inside lane might move a little faster and vice versa during free flow traffic the middle lanes tend to move a little better usually the right lane is kind of congested because of weaving exiting traffic merging with entering traffic and the left lane tends to get crowded because people think it the fast lane so that leaves the middle lane s to flow a bit better ,8,IAmA
gm2,the deal with cloverleaf intersections is that they are cheaper to build than a full interchange with direct connect grade separation bridges that why dots like them they provide a reasonable level of service for less money your merging anxiety is not their concern baby ,12,IAmA
gm2,hey brother and might i add damn you because i had just finished my drink and no one had replied in a while so i was going to bed it nearly 2 am here but now that another question has surfaced i must respond so let me take your question by points hi i am a mechanical engineer from sydney australia and find traffic engineering fascinating especially how braking downstream can cause traffic jams upstream even when there no blockage at the 0 12 point in the video watch the white car slow for no apparent reason i think he may have been instructed to do so but no matter he slowed the guy behind him slows and the guy behind him slows some more and so forth it causes a shock wave that is a real term traffic engineers use and we can calculate the speed of propagation of the shock wave there is also a shock wave for acceleration when things speed up again i think of it like a slinky it slows down in a wave and it speeds up in a wave too the way we manage it is to try to not let it happen in the first place people do not want to crash in traffic so there really no way to stop the shock wave from happening if a big sudden slowdown occurs if the incident is large enough it may help to have dynamic message signs dms on the road to inform drivers ahead of time that there is an incident ahead but that mostly to prevent secondary incidents not to solve the problem itself if your question is why does the white car slow down in the first place that a hard question to answer it could be a lot of things maybe a dog ran out in the road maybe s he was looking at the radio etc edit i wanted to add some specific detail to this the most common cause of slowdown and the shockwave effect is too many interchanges ramp entrances on the freeway i cannot really comment on roundabouts because that is not my area of expertise but i know a lot about freeway traffic and access management is problematic i have visited tokyo on a few occasions i have never been to tokyo but anthony bourdain makes it sound nice i have a couple of thoughts about how to explain your experience there 1 tokyo is one of if not the most congested cities in the world every tiny little bit of improvement to traffic there corresponds to a large increase in mobility and commerce so it is very much in the interest of the city leadership to make sure things work as efficiently as they can they no doubt invest a lot into traffic engineering projects to make sure things are optimized now having said that i do not know where you were driving in tokyo were the streets one way were they 6 lanes with lots of right of way we traffic guys can do a lot if we have some of constrictions removed and those are two of the biggest constrictions do you know of any examples of any countries or cities who manage traffic really well or interesting systems used around the world places that can invest in public transit do well places i have been that have good traffic in the subway but do not have good traffic conditions on the roadway network london paris rome frankfurt i think did not ride subway in frankfurt and cannot swear that there even is one munich new york san francisco they have bart no subway here dallas we have the dart and it ok basically every world class city oddly i do not remember dublin having terrible traffic but that may because i was drinking a lot of guinness and riding the bus everywhere without a care edit i realize a made a list consisting of one item that what i meant to do second edit i put on men at work while writing this response so thanks for that cargo is one of the best albums ever if i ever ask you a question i will expect that you put on zz top or maybe buddy holly ,10,IAmA
gm2,you heard right in general roundabouts are safer and more efficient than signals if the driving population in your area is savvy to the roundabouts and how to navigate them then they can be useful the reason you do not see more of them in america is that the typical driver is not used to seeing them and they complain about the mere thought of implementing them but studies show that they will reduce crashes and there is the obvious benefit that they do not take any electricity to run and they do not go into flash in the morning rush hour to cause delays because of a power spike i think you will see more and more of these being implemented depending on where you live in texas they are slowly becoming more popular edit to say it is important to light the roundabouts correctly and design them to allow proper turning radius and they do consume more right of way space than a signal does in general so those are also some reasons why they have been a little slow to show up but i think going forward there will be more of them because the benefits outweigh the costs ,19,IAmA
gm2,the pedestrian buttons are designed to work thusly you press the button that sends a signal to the controller that there is a ped who wants to cross the street in most cases it will wait until the time in the cycle when the corresponding vehicular movement is scheduled to get some green time at that time you will see the walking man sign on the pedestrian signal head to tell you when to walk what it wo not do is stop opposing traffic early so that you can cross it just lets the controller know that there is a pedestrian crossing the road and that it should not allow the cross street phase to terminate early if there are no cars there to use it it will time your pedestrian interval so that you can cross the street but if you are crossing the side street instead of the main street it is likely that the main street was already going to get its full amount of green time anyway so your pressing the button does not do much except show the walking man indication on the pedestrian signal head to tell you when it safe to walk the timing of the green intervals wo not change i guess the answer to your first question is that it may change the operation of the signal a bit if you are crossing the main street instead of the side street but otherwise it does not change the operation of the signal much assuming that you are at a fairly heavily traveled intersection at least if you are at a signal where there is very light traffic then you might get extra green time to cross as a pedestrian that normally would not be given because the streets at that intersection may not be programmed to allow so much green time for so few vehicles as for the weight sensors they are used in some places but they depend on the pedestrians standing at a known location and they are prone to failure because people like to hit the button and then kind of mill around and they may not stand on the correct spot to trigger the pedestrian phase ,20,IAmA
gm2,those stoplights you refer to were designed by engineers in a competing company seriously there are a bunch of reasons and most of them have to do with not making life miserable for traffic on the side streets we could get perfect progression but it would require a 6 minute cycle length and that would suck if you just wanted to pull out of your neighborhood and go to the donut shop right ,18,IAmA

gm2,i see a lot of what appear to be teenage public policy pundits responding so i will give you my take as a mid 30 guy who usually votes conservative we do not like obamacare because of reasons the us government is more of a broadsword than a scalpel and not known for doing anything efficiently and this is no exception as most of us expected americans have an idea that people should take personal responsibility for their own actions and this includes paying for their own angioplasties after shoving cheeseburgers down their throats for decades we do not like being told that we must purchase a product even if we do not intend to use it if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor what a bunch of bullshit and anyone who was not a damn idiot knew it was a lie as it came out of his mouth it only going to get worse as aca starts to tighten its requirements more and more doctors are going to pull out of it my wife is a physician and her clinic is not participating in it because of how little it pays and how much of a clusterfuck it is she lost patients because of it but it is not financially feasible to continue with it edit damn i should have said prepubescent public policy pundits to achieve maximum alliterative points ,-1,AskReddit

gm2,i am a professional traffic engineer my observation is that the high resolution modeling described is a solution that may be outdated before it is implemented modeling typically involves analyzing collected data to make predictions about future performance but we now have the ability to relatively cheaply deploy traffic data collectors along streets and just as importantly the communication channels to bring them all back for analysis adaptive traffic signal timing systems have been around for a long time but they were typically not so great because the processing power and communication bitrates were pretty low with those problems being solved with recent technology i think we can start doing some better real time signal timing a guy down below linked an nchrp report about adaptive traffic control and i think that will be more widely deployed going forward ,1,science

gm2,anyone can be an eligible receiver it all depends on where he is lined up at the snap of the ball here the rules because i am seeing some confusion in this thread there must be exactly at least 7 players lined up on the line of scrimmage the line where the ball is there must be exactly no more than 4 players lined up at least 1 yard behind the line of scrimmage all 4 people behind the line are eligible receivers including the quarterback he can legally pitch it to the halfback and then catch a pass from him only the two end people who are lined up on the line of scrimmage are eligible the last ineligible man must be covered by an eligible man on the line of scrimmage ie the ineligible man cannot be closest to the sideline on that side of the field the first two points and the last one are why you sometimes see the tight end take a step back then go into motion across the formation and at the same time the split end on that side of the field takes a step forward it because he has to cover the ineligible man on the line of scrimmage failure to do so results in an illegal formation penalty in the nfl the referee has to make an announcement when a non standard numbered ie any number 50 79 or 90 99 player is reporting as eligible but that to prevent subversion of the game through crazy trick plays more than anything as far as i know this is only a rule in the nfl source played a little football back in school ,10,funny

gm2,yeah typically local government supports the rlpe cams to a greater extent than the state government does in texas we have a law that 50 of the revenue from the cameras has to go to a state traffic safety fund another example of how austin was trying to make it less attractive to put them in i am pretty sure that santa fe would have brought the hammer down on las cruces if they would started cutting off people utilities for non payment i see on this site http www ghsa org html stateinfo laws auto enforce html that nm limits rlpe systems in similar ways to what texas does if not even more severely in nm there can be no warrant issued no driver license points and the city can only collect enough from the fees to pay for the operating costs ,1,news

gm2,i am a traffic engineer as far as i know there are only two companies that provide the rlpe red light photo enforcement cameras american traffic solutions based in arizona and redflex based in australia here a pro tip most states have enacted legislation that sort of reluctantly allows these things to operate in my state of texas for example there must be signs posted minimum 200 feet ahead of the stop bars showing photo enforced or something similar there must be signs for all approaches even if only some of the approaches are being enforced there must have been a traffic study done of the intersection which showed a high collision history and that efforts have been made to mitigate the collisions prior to installing the rlpe cams furthermore in texas it is not legal to issue a warrant for your arrest if you do not pay the ticket they cannot report it to your insurance agency or to any credit agencies the only teeth these guys have is their ability to put a hold on your vehicle registration but even then the county tax assessor collector has to agree to that in my county the ta c has publicly stated that he has no intention of doing any such thing lately they have gained the power to stop you from registering your vehicle online but you can still do it through the mail or in person at the courthouse oh they will send you threatening letters with vague language like you may be subject to judgment and or fines if you do not pay us but there are no teeth in that threat at least in texas this is true tl dr investigate your state and city laws and make sure you are not paying a fine you do not have to also make it a hassle by requesting the traffic data from the city prior to paying the fine document your request and if they do not provide it you should in theory have a valid defense against having to pay ,4,news

gm2,so maybe we are using different terminology my wife and i have 3 million dollar term policies on each other 20 year term policy ends at age 55 the cost is about 90 per month our permanent life insurance policy allows us to contribute as much as we want including 0 if that suits us we do not lose anything save the amount of growth our regular contribution would have gained over the years is this vitriol i am getting from the armchair investors on reddit due to a terminology difference edit to say even if a permanent life insurance policy lags behind the average stock market gain it is also proof against recessions lawsuits and tax increases so that worth something there ,1,AskReddit
gm2,i have seen some people claiming that but no facts got any information about it because it seems hard to beat a fund that allows tax free growth has no contribution limit accessible at any time and any age not subject to lawsuit and grows at about 8 term is like renting a house may be a bit cheaper but you get nothing for your money ,1,AskReddit
gm2,well you are wrong there are plenty of reasons to buy permanent life insurance despite what you say there is a reason lots of people do it i guess we are willing to bear the scorn of internet millionaires such as yourself ,0,AskReddit
gm2,the government has a vested interest in people having enough money to provide for their own retirement and old age once you are too old to work any more you will either provide for yourself or become a burden to the public therefore it is to everyone benefit to provide incentives for long term savings to be used in retirement also the funds are taxed upon distribution so 401 k accounts are funded on a pre tax basis but they are taxed when they are distributed back to the account holder so when you contribute to a 401 k you are essentially deferring the taxes until a later time you do get some tax incentives for doing it this way because the tax bracket you fall into depends upon your income for that year so if you get old and retire and you have your house paid off and only need to withdraw a minimal amount of money from your 401 k you will pay a lesser percentage of tax on that money than you would have if you would been taxed on it when you were getting a regular salary lastly i would point out that the reason people do it this way is largely because of the tax implications if as you say the government was not already offering tax breaks to people they would not be doing the same thing with their money they would find a different way to invest and save also keep in mind that 401 k funds are typically invested in broadly diversified portfolios including stocks and bonds this is how they grow these funds also provide capital for the entities they are being invested in which boosts the economy tl dr the government wants you to be self sufficient during retirement so they give you an incentive to save during your working years ,1,AskReddit
gm2,yes dear god the growth charts are pretty amazing if you contribute 20k per year and do not liquidate any of it in 30 years its cash value is worth something like 3 2m assuming current dividend rates not subject to suit and can be cashed out at any time and for really rich people the best part is there is no limit to what you can contribute ,2,AskReddit
