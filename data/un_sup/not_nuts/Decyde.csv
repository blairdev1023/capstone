Decyde,no they are not looking a the numbers most of the states that are taking in more than they pay are the poor southern states my state and many other states that are not as populated are paying more per captia than california we are getting less than 1 per 1 collected in taxes back now the bigger issue other than tax dollars is what politicians are voting for i would be pissed having to sit through all the election stuff to hear candidates just talk about large states this and that to attract voters large states would be battlegrounds and they would take a brief timeout to go visit the medium ones and the small states would not get crap ,1,Political_Revolution

Decyde,he did and the ump allowed it i remember him talking to the ump after they had 3 walks and the 4th kid came up to the plate doing the same squat stance at that point the coach talked to us and told our pitcher to start throwing the ball inside the plate the next 2 kids got hit with the ball and the one after that fell back and to the ground and at that point the ump called time out to talk to the coaches there was arguing back and forth and the ump told them if any players were over the plate in the strike zone when a pitch was thrown it an automatic out if any kid is hit purposely outside of the strike zone then the game is forfeited and we lose ,3,instant_regret
Decyde,yea our coach was a good guy for the most part he yelled at an ump here and there on horrible calls that were plain as day but other than that he was a good guy but in the event i talked about above the other teams first 3 batters came up to the plate like they were hovering over a toilet taking a poop there was 12 balls thrown in a row with their 4th batter coming up doing the exact same thing the coach called time out and asked the ump to say something about it and he said it was fair that why he told the pitcher to throw the ball on the inside to get them off the plate and stop trying to focus on not hitting them if they get hit crowding the plate limiting the strike zone it was their own faults i remember the 4th kid getting hit in the elbow and the 5th kid getting hit in the knee the 6th kid came up to the plate and got brushed back to the point he fell and the ump called time out after they all talked the kids on the other team did not do that the rest of the game and we ended up winning by 5 or something runs after coming back down by 5 at the top of the first ,1,instant_regret
Decyde,actually looking back our coach was in the right spirit of the game aside teaching kids the shitty way to play baseball just to win some games then is not what little league is all about imo it learning the game properly to continue playing it in the future teaching kids poor stance and non proper batting etiquette will stick with them in the future same could be said about our coach telling our pitcher to brush back their batters but after going 3 3 on walks with 12 straight ball and their 4th batter coming up doing the same crap it would have been an annoying as hell game to stand out in left field while there was 50 walks in the first inning ,3,instant_regret

Decyde,and i am telling you she was flat out telling people hogwash while running and was not keeping any campaign promises remember that debate she promised to do in california oh that right her supporters said she was the winner already and even announced it before the final votes were cast like sanders said she needs to convince people of all those things he supported that she did not openly support and she failed to do so i believe 4 years of trump will put the us in a better spot than 4 years of clinton ,2,bidenbro

Decyde,what is the point of having an exchange then if you cannot find a single other person to just buy something for in your own life then i would not believe you you sign up for the gift exchange to get something neat for yourself you would not normally buy or did not know existed ,1,todayilearned
Decyde,you do not even have to do that but when the person has no comment history you do not know anything about them they will post some obscure thing they want that you never even heard of and do not know what to get them so you just get on amazon and buy them some of the first things that come up they have it already and are annoyed and upset at you for their own shitty gift that you thought was neat the thing that just annoyed me to no ends was not getting a gift the first time but a rematcher not sending out a gift the second time after that it just oh well we hope you had fun sending out something sign up again next year ,4,todayilearned
Decyde,oh yea i have been rematched a lot and nothing pissed me off more than not getting something again at that point i think i am done completely regardless if my friend tries to talk me into signing up again my brother is having a kid soon and my other friends have kids now so i would rather just buy them something for 20 than hope i get something i might want in an exchange ,2,todayilearned
Decyde,yea it actually does reddit exchange is just horribly massively flawed there people who make 20 accounts every year and make a few posts and then sign up for free things and never send anything out they cannot stop them from doing this because there no checks in place to really do so if someone makes a new account in october they are pretty much good to go for signing up for the following years exchanges ,2,todayilearned
Decyde,i am good to quote rick morty that just slavery with extra steps having to jump through hoops to obtain and spend tokens on people who send out gifts defeats the purpose of an exchange now that more of my friends have kids i would rather just throw the 20 down i was going to spend on someone else and just get their kids something ,1,todayilearned
Decyde,i signed up for the condiment exchange last and wanted something hot or spicy for burgers or sandwiches i bought 30 worth of local mustard seasoning and so on for my exchange and in return i got a 2 bottle of spicy sauce for chicken wings that i ended up throwing in the trash because it expired it was clear they just got on amazon and typed in spicy and bought the cheapest item and had it shipped to my home ,17,todayilearned
Decyde,it happened too many times to myself and those around me that sign up it one of those things where my friend still signs up here and there and will talk me into it it just really pisses me off the amount of people who spent more on shipping than they did on whatever they got the other person thought in the gift excluded ,2,todayilearned
Decyde,yea it always a hit or miss but more often there are a lot of people with multiple accounts who make towards the end of the year to get multiple gifts what pisses me off the most about the entire exchange is when you get mad you did not get anything and people tell you it the thought of sending a gift that counts no it really is not there people you know who would have enjoyed a x gift more not expecting to get you something in return if you are going to say that ,2,todayilearned
Decyde,i would take it and donate the same amount to a charity bucket if they have one or just give it to them as a tip ,1,todayilearned
Decyde,the real shaft is when you get rematched with someone who does not send you anything at all one year my brother got a guy who just got his own apartment after moving out of his parents house some crappy outlet store was closing in my area and i manged to snag a cookware set for cheap and clipped over 500 in coupons that a normal person would need for cleaning and everything supplies in exchange he got matched with some lady or her kid and he got a box of their leftover stocking stuffer candy his comment to his gifter was that he works out and eats healthy so anything along those lines would be great it could be a recipe book workout anything or so on he took the box of unsealed candy and just tossed it in the junk and we looked as her and her 2 kids ended up getting over 500 worth of stuff from people ,3,todayilearned
Decyde,here the kicker to it i normally bought the gifts for my brother and friend and we did a lot of gift exchanges in over 23 exchanges only a few times has someone ever matched or beat the cost or thought put into the gifts sent out you hear all this praise about how great it is to give a gift and it selfish to get mad you did not get anything fuck those people you signed up for a gift exchange which is a contract meaning you send something and you get something if i am going to throw 30 50 at someone without getting something in return i am going to buy my friends 3 year old a gift rather than a stranger who probably is not sending out something in return ,17,todayilearned
Decyde,yea it would i got lost in the rant overall i have helped my brother and friend out with ss and have sent out more than 23 gifts combined in all of those 3 have ever matched or beat the amount that we have sent out and some of those the bar was set at 20 depending on what i got or the exchange i just honestly do not know who the fuck signs up to for the second round and does not send a gift ,1,todayilearned
Decyde,that alone is why i would never pay for another persons order always asshole who would loop around and order 50 worth of stuff and then the place pressuring you into this is fun just pay 50 since your 10 order was paid for fuck all that if i want to be scammed i will sign up for reddit secret santa and get shafted for the 7th time either getting no gift 5 times or some cheap item just to get credit 2 times ,637,todayilearned

Decyde,yep his name was on the company and he was blindly taking the money without doing any real work i assume he did not go to jail because he hired attorneys that pointed out he was not affiliated with the criminal activity that did not stop him from getting huge fines and i would imagine his legal fees were hundreds of thousands too ,8,funny
Decyde,you cannot do that he paid a lot of money in legal fees to get the finest instead of jail time so they are not just going to let you declare bankruptcy to wipe that out i do not know but i am sure they garnish his wages on his checks directly the guy was a prick but it somewhat understandable from being at the top and then just falling lower than what you ever thought was possible ,0,funny
Decyde,because he came into work everyday with a shit attitude and refused to change he hit rock bottom years before he was hired where i worked and fuck off is not an acceptable response in the workplace when you need something from someone his life is a great example that you can lose more than just your investment when you invest in things ,1,funny
Decyde,i am not sure you know what you are talking about anymore you seem like you are under the impression that revolutions are just killing everyone you do not like and being done that how you jump from one dictatorship to another in this situation the people are hoping the government outs the corrupt people and are able to hold new elections for officials ,3,worldpolitics
Decyde,if you want to point that out then i was just out of high school and did not owe millions the rest of my life to people the point is that investments carry massive risk just because you are young does not mean that you lose only what you initialy put in i was investing in a 401k and a roth my grandfather started up for me i surely was not turning a blind eye while my property was used in smuggling drugs and human trafficking ,-1,funny
Decyde,no far from it it a invest your money wisely and realize you have more to lose than just what you put in this guy went from having a family 10 ish in a company that was making a lot of money to wishing he had nothing he went so far into debt staying out of jail that his wife left him and took the kids on top of having to pay a lot of money in fines he was in his 30s when i worked with him and the stress of his life made him look like he was in his 50s ,-4,funny

Decyde,there mixed feelings about this and unless you yourself are not in this situation you and i do not really get to sit back and judge them i mean shit i am pro everything while i am sitting in my home or job with no resource for anything i will sure as shit say stand up for yourself and your country because i am not the one being shot in the street with that being said once you start killing police officers then deadly force will be used on people you are a person in a crowd right now but once full dictatorship mode goes in you are not the only one who is dying they will prison or kill your families and so on like other dictators have done in the past the same thing is like arguing that you do not approve trump being elected so he should be removed with violence so hillary could take over ,9,worldpolitics
Decyde,you would risk escalating things to where they use deadly force it would be the same as if you found all the officers homes and harassed their families to the point in which they stand down the military would move in and things will escalate to the point people are going to be dying more than they are right now ,2,worldpolitics

Decyde,sanders did not start running his campaign before he legally was allowed to there also video evidence that the clinton campaign were busing people around poling stations and then when the story broke it was all hypothetical and that person is no longer working here the numbers did not add up at all during the primary it hard to tell what was fake news and what was real news this past election cycle with how much propaganda the clinton paid for to flood everything so 100 yes a nobody anyone heard of for the most part wiped the floor with hillary so bad that she had to use some of the most dirty tricks in the book to win the primaries ,13,SandersForPresident

Decyde,it annoying to deal with and every state is different with my home my neighbor put a driveway on 3 feet from the property line and with the wide opening if i had to park 5 feet away i would be parking in the middle of where my house is and could only fit 1 car there some states that prohibit parking in front of driveways but the only law is no parking 20 feet from the curb in front of fire police or rescue ,1,mildlyinfuriating
Decyde,yes some states prohibit parking there but there are no federal laws that state it is illegal you cannot legally have a vehicle towed blocking a driveway regardless unless it is posted or parked in private property doing so will open you up to a lawsuit from the owner of the vehicle and many times the tow company will not remove the vehicle without permission from the police in many cases the police will just give a fine to the operator and attempt to contact them rather than tow ,-2,mildlyinfuriating
Decyde,and like i said there are no federal laws that prohibit parking in front of driveways like this yes some states have laws to prevent this but not all do getting back to above about having the vehicle towed blocking your driveway you will open yourself up to a lawsuit having it towed unless there a sign or something posted that states people are parked in a tow away zone ,-3,mildlyinfuriating

Decyde,literally said show me the law that states you cannot block a private driveway on a public street i do not need you to rehash any moral laws that people think exist that do not there are some laws in place about where you can park on public streets and hoa get around this law by making the streets in their residential areas private drives by maintaining them but a driveway does not make the public street your property because it exists there so once again there is no federal law that states people cannot park in front of your driveway on a public street ,-6,mildlyinfuriating
Decyde,this generally is not the same as blocking a driveway on a public street as hoa that do this are located on private drives in this case they can have you towed since it would be the same as parking in someones driveway but like i said above unless otherwise posted or against any current laws you are allow to park on any public streets you wish yes it morally makes you an asshole for parking like this but it not illegal ,0,mildlyinfuriating
Decyde,then cite the law that shows i am wrong i do not care about moral laws in that a police officer will show up and attempt to contact the owner and then have it towed the fact of the matter is that people are allowed to park on public streets unless otherwise noted that they cannot or there are laws that state they cannot ,-7,mildlyinfuriating

Decyde,it technically not illegal to park in front of a private driveway almost everywhere in the us i have had vehicles towed before but they were parked in a shared driveway and the driver who parked their car there did not have permission to be on either property when it comes to the street like this you generally want to give 3 5 feet on both sides for the owners safety but if you do not like your neighbor there no laws stopping you most places from parking close to or on like this the laws that do exist are for police fire and rescue and those do not transfer over to personal residency the reason why i know this is i like my neighbor but they one day decided to put a drive way in 3 feet from my property line i told him i did not care because it did not matter if i did or did not he was doing it but i told him i have 2 cars parked in front of my home as well as the neighbors on the other side we are parking 4 cars there so you will need to be careful driving out as i am not leaving a 5 foot empty space in front of my house to accommodate him edit you people seem to have a problem understanding rights when it comes to private and public streets unless you are not following the law and or parking in a location where it posted you cannot park in accordance to the law you are allowed to park on any public streets that you wish edit 2 it bothers me people think i am wrong but cannot cite a federal law that states having a driveway in front of your house makes a public road your private property if i am coming off as an asshole then good it bothers me people spread misinformation because they think it right while i am an asshole i personally do not block private drives out of respect for the homeowner ,-13,mildlyinfuriating

Decyde,and you are flat out wrong again the biggest fuck up of the clinton campaign was not pushing policy to show what she was going to do damn near all of her adds and crap was anti trump and no reason why anyone should vote for her trump actually gave answers during debates and did not just spin questions like 9 11 was bad and the worst part about this was clinton was given the damn questions in advance and soft balled questions by her paid hills so before you try and even say sanders and clinton are one in the same they are not the clinton have been selling this country out since the 90 and it great to see their empire falling apart since they cannot take that legal bribe money anymore ,1,SandersForPresident
Decyde,a 2 party system is fucking stupid when people are elected they do not even do their jobs and just turn into fundraising assholes who do not care about the people who voted them into office they would sell your ass out in a heart beat if it got them money so they could take a break off from fundraising ,2,SandersForPresident
Decyde,it was not hard to single out sanders supporters since the vast majority of them just registered as democrats sure doing a purge will get some clinton votes in there but many of them were sanders overall we heard the dnc tell us we were crazy to believe the rumors that they were fucking sanders over left and right and we saw for a fact those rumors were true i am honestly just shocked how close it was with the dnc and clinton pushing him out ,1,SandersForPresident

Decyde,while being entitled to an opinion does not make it right trump being elected was about the best thing that could happen a strong message was sent that the american people were not eating the same bull shit crammed down their throats by those who thought it was her turn it honestly embarrassing how people are still crying about trump being elected and throwing shit at him in hopes to distract everyone about how shitty the dnc and the democrats acted this past election ,3,SandersForPresident
Decyde,know what is fucked up about this if you had time warner they send you all this spectrum shit that you do not even qualify for they will tell you it for new spectrum customers and you can argue with them how you do not have or ever had a spectrum account and they do not care you are paying almost 50 if not more for switching your service from time warner to spectrum the loophole with this is if you can get another person who lives at that residency to sign up in their name it will count as a new account ,12,conspiracy
Decyde,and you are stupid for even saying this sanders told everyone that if he did not win the nomination to not listen to who he supports for the general election i am sure you will sit here and tell me how clinton was what this nation needed when she ran one of the most corrupted campaigns in history even the dnc colluded to make sure sanders was not the nomination which speaks words about the entire democratic party ,3,SandersForPresident
Decyde,well she was not running against him during the general goes to show you that polling numbers are one of the dumbest things you can measure anymore how many people actually own landline phones anymore ,9,SandersForPresident

Decyde,a coworker of mine saved up about 125k for his sons college he was accepted to perdue and within that first year flunked out and spent all that money my coworkers wife made him leave the home for a month because she thought he was going to kill his son so life pro tip do not give your kid money for college if you save do not tell them until they graduate and then pay off their loans it not the 80 where parents pay for college anymore ,2,AskReddit

Decyde,you are really great at being a fucking moron are not you you lose some civil rights when you board a plane thanks to 9 11 if you have a problem with being bumped from a plane then do not take a plane ever again united airlines did nothing wrong with telling the man to leave and it was the police who assaulted the man the person at fault in all of this is the person who threw a tantrum thought talking to his lawyer means anything at all and then running back onto the plane forcing all the people on the plane to leave for an hour because he was acting like a spoiled child so yea i am pretty great at reading what actually happened and are not just circle jerking taking 1 side because i want karma ,1,pics
Decyde,i use to work at mcdonald back in high school and a manager would do this to me my parents dropped me off and would only pick me up in 4 hours after i left this new manager realized this and when we were slow made me clock out she was a complete bitch and i put my 2 weeks notice in not too long after this she would always say well you can clock in when we get customers if you want but you need to clock out right after you take and make their orders ,1,personalfinance
Decyde,i hope you are joking because you are having more of a tantrum than the guy in the video you give up a lot of rights when you board an airplane and the fact of the matter is the only rights you have is to document it get off and file a complaint later if you have any problem with this and the contract you signed that states they can bump you from your flight then you need to stop crying on reddit and never take a plane again ,-1,pics
