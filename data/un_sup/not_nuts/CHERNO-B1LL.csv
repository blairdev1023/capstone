CHERNO-B1LL,to be clear i am not against this proposition and i was not suggesting keeping heroin illegal just implementing a more considered approach when it comes to substances that are known to be highly addictive and destructive all drugs have inherent risks and some personalities are more prone to abuse than others there are treatment clinics specifically for candy crush addiction in china as are people in underprivileged circumstances as the article states we will likely see an uptake in would esigner party drugs and cannabis use but the addiction and mortality rates with these drugs are lower especially if the quality of things like ecstasy and cocaine can be controlled that does not mean we wo not see addiction but it is more treatable less common and less ravaging i am all for treatment and education over prosecution that a cycle we are all tired of it helps no one and the stigma is downright damaging my concern is just over removing hurdles to access i would rather see the risk of buying and being arrested replaced with a process of education and monitored access think of it like guns in america these licenses may only be issued or renewed after the applicant has undergone a background check and safety training and has passed written and performance based tests showing that the applicant knows how to safely load fire and store a gun and has knowledge of relevant firearms laws http smartgunlaws org gun laws policy areas gun owner responsibilities licensing of owners purchasers replace gun with whatever addictive drug you are looking to obtain and tweak it more towards education and support and you have something that benefits the user and the health services you can get it if you want it it not even that hard as long as you are not a distinct threat to yourself or others it legal but it undeniably dangerous and you need to know what you are getting yourself into understand the risks involved get to grips with best practice when it comes to usage and how to get help before it too late those already addicted could still benefit from the program and not have to deal with the shady criminal underbelly while new users have every opportunity to consider their choice and their options ,2,ireland
CHERNO-B1LL,i am not against the proposition maybe i am misinterpreting it but i would not see the point in the half measure of decriminalising possession but not selling it one less obstacle to trying it which means a more open market for the dealers yes it frees up money time and resources and we can steer those who need help in the right direction but as long as there are dodgy dealers there will be abuse heroin is too addictive for there not to be and greed is too common for it not to be cut with all sorts of other shit it better than nothing but regulation also neuters the gangs running the drugs and financing who knows what else why not go the whole way ,3,ireland
CHERNO-B1LL,as much as i am for the legalisation and regulation of drugs heroin is poison and should not be in the same league as the rest decriminalise it maybe but at least generate some sort of education programme licence as part of the process of obtaining it and limit access revoke licence for abuse ,7,ireland

CHERNO-B1LL,long exposure absolutely reveals more the even matte looking water betrays the fact that this is a long exposure shot which lets more light onto the sensor over time bringing light and details out that you may not be able to see the eye is still an incredibly powerful sensor itself but it cannot process the light from an image over time it can usually see a lot more than a camera can capture by just pointing and clicking which is why i am wondering how much the reality differs from the image ,2,EarthPorn

CHERNO-B1LL,the fact that they take the piss out of the word taffer in the game makes me think they believe themselves to be better than the originals without ever doing anything that gives them legitimacy they never prove themselves smarter or more engaging but act like they are honouring a legend they do not understand it like nick kroll giving a tribute to robin williams and we are just supposed to take that as he best we are going to get they took on two of the greatest gaming franchises in history and made them mediocre i will never forgive them for that both deus ex and thief should have been landmark releases for those franchises they have such a long way to go before they even deserve a shot at making these games make hitman the stunning jaw dropping innovative showcase of potential that it should be and i will happily let them at the dna of the two greatest games of their genre otherwise fuck off and make another tomb raider technical showcase for everyone to ignore with different ips and let the fans enjoy the franchises that deserve to be amazing ,1,Thief
