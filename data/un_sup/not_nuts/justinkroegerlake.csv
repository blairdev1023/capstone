justinkroegerlake,i would not recommend a using directive for any large namespace std is just the one that always show up in examples obviously using namespace boost would be worse ideally yes all c programmers would know all of std but there just so much in it that it not realistic using declarations are fine within non header files since they do not dump everything and though i rarely use them i do not discourage their use verbosity is fine and good if it gives clarification it bad when it redundant ,1,cpp
justinkroegerlake,you do not have to respond if you do not want to less verbose is not necessarily better you could write one letter function and variable names for everything you could never use const you could use auto return types on everything outside of headers when would you not want a using namespace std and again standard library headers can include each other without your knowledge ,1,cpp
justinkroegerlake,less verbose does not mean better and you do have to worry about anything in std stdlib headers can include each other i am only talking about using directives again what is the point of namespace std if you are going to always bring everything into the global namespace anyway ,1,cpp
justinkroegerlake,stderr is unbuffered correct stdout is line buffered to a tty and fully buffered when it not if there unflushed output when the program terminates abnormally it might not make it out using declarations are fine using directives are the problem if using namespace std was the right way to go we would not even bother having a std namespace at all everything would just be global things also get added to namespace std over time so even if you somehow memorized everything in the stdlib it can change also c is a disaster of a language but definitely getting better ,1,cpp
justinkroegerlake,stdout is line buffered if outputting to a tty so you would not need to flush to see output if your stdout is a file or pipe then it actually does have a significant impact using an entire namespace is not trivial idk everything in namespace std and i have seen students actually get really confusing compiler errors when unknowingly causing a conflict ,1,cpp
