Crappyblogger,step up your pickle game ,0,food
Crappyblogger,even with a small risk the risk is way higher than the reward in my opinion like u houseofteeth said if you want the garlic flavor simply add some during searing i find most add ins when cooking steak as flavor inhibitors ,2,sousvide
Crappyblogger,also why add garlic and onions to the bag when the test is about salt and it affects whole garlic cloves are also typically a no no for sous vide and torch only sears are weak ,16,sousvide
Crappyblogger,this risks are nearly non existent if you follow proper cooking temperatures clostridium botulinum will not grow at recommended cooking temperatures for sous vide food for example you can cook a steak to 130f medium rare which is above the temperature in which clostridium botulinum can grow if you tossed a steak in at 115f on the other hand this creates an ideal environment for food poisoning ,1,LifeProTips
Crappyblogger,good question and this is definitely the part that people have the most trouble with it good you know this much up front you should have no problem learning the tricks once you do make the plunge like you said super hot cast iron pans are the best way to get a nice sear really quickly since sous vide is all about temperature consistency we want to limit the amount of time on the pan first step is to ditch the olive oil and get some avocado oil 500f smoke point so you do not set off all of your smoke alarms then get your cast iron to 450f to sear i then add the steak and flip often every 15 seconds or so after about a minute add some butter to then pan this helps develop the crust since the butter fats burn up pretty quick keep flipping for another 45 seconds the torch is nice to help further develop the crust without overcooking the center and like you said torches work wonders for things that are not as flat i use the sansaire searing torch to help crisp up the tough to reach areas on a rack of ribs ,2,LifeProTips
Crappyblogger,yep those wegmans steaks have a peelable plastic cover the glue can fail on those and leak ,2,sousvide
Crappyblogger,sandwhich bags often are but you should verify by reading the box nonetheless these should not be used for sous vide as the plastic is much thinner and cannot hold the temperatures as well as freezer bags ,1,LifeProTips
Crappyblogger,yeah the sub was mod less for quite some time we just started revamping it a couple months ago so a lot of the guides are in progress my site is sous vide guy http sousvideguy com if you google for sous vide machines it should be at the top yes you can definitely start with a ziploc bag and temperature controlled water this of course requires a bit more work since you cannot leave it cooking because you will have to keep dumping in more hot water to try to keep the ideal temperature if you did not want to dish out the 100 200 for one of the common sous vide machines you can always get a programmable temperature controller which connects to crockpots rice cookers i think there one made by dorkfood and inkbird on amazon they are like 30 ,4,LifeProTips
Crappyblogger,i have some details on my site here http sousvideguy com best sous vide machines 2017 benefits for a summary sous vide enables consistent temperatures from center to edge your food is cooked at the exact temperature you set the device to more tender meat better flavor since everything is sealed in a bag with nowhere to escape and its crazy easy to do ,1,LifeProTips
Crappyblogger,i would consider myself an avid early adopter always buying new gadgets that eventually come out of kickstarter or on amazon launch pad sous vide turned into a healthy hobby because it was fun to test out new foods have people over to eat make unbelievable steaks really easily and of course eat better most people think sous vide is for steaks but it really hits the entire spectrum the people in r sousvide are unbelievably creative and are dishing up everything from creme brulee and cheesecakes to fruit infused liquor and starbucks styled egg bites but basically you can do an unbelievable amount with these devices i am not sure if this is really a negative but planning ahead is required for sous vide since some things take hours to cook if you are the type that waits until you are hungry to start planning a meal you will have to start planning ahead a bit ,48,LifeProTips
Crappyblogger,hey i am one of the mods over at r sousvide and also run a website http sousvideguy com dedicated to this stuff ziploc freezer bags are bpa free the only slight concern is that the seals can break at temperatures above 155f however most sous vide cooking at least for meat is done much below that ,845,LifeProTips
Crappyblogger,yep the magnet is still there seems just as strong too so no change there ,3,sousvide
Crappyblogger,i agree but honestly i do not know too much i would change on the joule to begin with if they were to launch a whole new version with new features i guess we cannot complain about a price drop although i am curious how things will play out with the upcoming launch of anova nano ,4,sousvide
Crappyblogger,as far as i know that correct i just emailed them let find out edit so they responded pretty much immediately and said they are actively working on a euro version but do not have a firm date yet however they expect it to be their next announcement ,6,sousvide
Crappyblogger, here a direct link to a few images http imgur com a kmwvk nothing too exciting although a price drop is always good i do not think the device feels any cheaper without the stainless top and bottom either way it a pretty good day to jump on one for those who were considering it because they never have sales looks like the discount is on amazon and their site ,3,sousvide
Crappyblogger,yes the sub was essentially mod less for years up until a few months ago we plan on populating these with info i already started on a beginners guide stay tuned ,5,sousvide
Crappyblogger,i did 140f for 7 hours for a few squeamish guests and they enjoyed it ,3,sousvide
Crappyblogger,i agree i only do thighs at 165f ,2,sousvide
Crappyblogger, dropping them straight in http truecouponing com wp content uploads 2015 09 oscar mayer meat hot dogs 16 oz1 jpg but really i just got back from the butcher http imgur com d9oa8z1 with 9 ny strips cut 2 2 5 thick ,3,sousvide
Crappyblogger,be careful adding oil to an already hot pan it can engulf pretty quickly heat your oil up as you heat your pan up go out and buy some avocado oil you can get the pan up to 500f before smoking i aim to get my pan right below the 500f mark so that i do not fill the house with smoke yet still hot enough to get a good sear,4,sousvide
Crappyblogger,i also heat the cream beforehand and slowly whisk in the egg mixture ,1,sousvide
Crappyblogger,i often go straight from freezer to sous vide so i use my vacuum sealer before freezing the meat just personal choice though ice baths are your friend safely drop the temperature prior to smoking so you do not overcook the brisket it like cooking it twice but it absolutely the best method for what you are trying to do some people add liquid smoke to the sous vide cook for added smokiness ,1,sousvide
Crappyblogger,see idk why you are smoking for 3 hours post sous vide but only smoking up to 145f pre sous vide just smoke it after up to 145f like u alabamaaviator said post sear smoke is encouraged or else you will have a mushy crust from it sitting in juices in the bag 1 vacuum sealers definitely are not necessary however i do use one frequently i mainly use ziploc bags for fish 2 what temps were you cooking at ziploc bags should not be an issue under 155f or so and even then it usually the seal that gives out and not the bag itself ive never used target brand so unless you were cooking at high temps i would try to go with ziploc ,2,sousvide
Crappyblogger,maybe i am not understanding the question but how does smoking it before versus after not result in overdone brisket cannot you smoke it after but still take it out before it reaches too high of a temp or are you hoping the smokey flavors enhance the sous vide cook either way i do not see any safety issues with this ,2,sousvide
Crappyblogger,the common way is to cook the brisket sous vide then finish it in the smoker ,3,sousvide
Crappyblogger,lol this is awesome i love how many jian yang erlich interactions there are so far this season ,16,sousvide
Crappyblogger,yep you are spot on codlo kickstarter launched when sous vide machines were still expensive by the time they finally started shipping them anova was hitting the shelves nonetheless it seems to be a reliable product but for what it is the price just needs to be a lot cheaper than circulators ,1,sousvide
Crappyblogger,i did not buy it they sent it to me to review its my understanding they will have to rethink pricing now that circulators have decreased so much i also would not purchase this unless it was lower than the cheapest circulator ,1,sousvide
Crappyblogger,yeah i can see both ways cooked sous vide though i think it cuts and eats like a steak ,2,sousvide
Crappyblogger,yep you are correct it a combination of a few things heating elements on the base of the unit stainless insulated tubs and tight fitting insulated lids immersion circulators use heaters which are confined to a smaller area of the tub and they are also being used in less ideal water baths less unsulation which is why they warrant a circulator ,2,sousvide
Crappyblogger,i am actually in the middle of reviewing this now http imgur com unjf2na this was a kickstarter funded product that originally launched in 2014 one thing to note it no longer called codlo grant creative cuisine bought them out last year and it now called the uno so once the remaining amazon sales of codlo wear down you will likely see the uno version right now the price on their site for the uno is really high not sure what their plans are yet for that but i do plan on asking them at a glance the main benefits are one of the smallest products for sous vide you can use a crockpot or rice cooker you already own and possibly price the price factor will be interesting to keep an eye on as immersion circulators keep dropping in prices this thing would need to be at a lower cost than the cheapest immersion circulator in order for it to have a chance ,2,sousvide
Crappyblogger,tri tip if anyone says otherwise they are lying ,5,sousvide
Crappyblogger,how unripe were the pears if they are too unripe cooking them wo not make them better you basically want a ripe pear but not overly ripe so that you can handle it and not smush it my bosc pears we are awesome super juicy and soft ,1,sousvide
Crappyblogger, here my recipe http sousvideguy com recipes sous vide red wine poached pears super straight forward for your vanilla bean you just scrape out the beans from the center if you peel the pear and it is a bit rigid still with peel marks you can use a kitchen sponge to smooth it out for a better final appearance ,3,sousvide
Crappyblogger,any although the kindle version is not as nicely formated because kindle amazon review helps the most though i appreciate your support ,2,sousvide
Crappyblogger,have you considered grant creative https www grantcreativecuisine com as well they are built and sold in the uk they do not have a traditional immersion circulator yet but they do have an all in one i used it and liked it http sousvideguy com grant creative cuisine primo review polished precise water oven their other option is the uno formerly known as codlo they bought them out this uses a crock pot or rice cooker as the cooking vessel edit and there also a new one called the twist https www sousvidetools com sous vide home thetwist by sous vide tools just throwing a few more options out there for uk plugs ,1,sousvide
Crappyblogger,where are you buying your steaks first if you are buying them from the same place every time try somewhere else ribeyes definitely should not be tough so that a bit odd what other cuts have you tried my absolute favorite is tri tip 132f for 7ish hours it comes out very tender and is one of the biggest transformations of any food when cooking sous vide in my opinion edit also what temp are you doing them at just realized you did not mention that ,2,sousvide
Crappyblogger,yeah idk those others are not mine i only added one pic looks like imgur updated their site to show relevant posts below or something ,2,sousvide
Crappyblogger,walked right into that one ,2,sousvide
Crappyblogger,just got my first copy of a beginner guide to sous vide that i created it less of a cookbook but instead walks through all of the details including how it works equipment needed tips searing guides and about 20 recipes for newbies all of this info is on my blog though and i also post it here so do not waste your money i did think it was needed though because my dad bought a few sous vide books online after i first told him about it and every pic was in black and white steaks are quite unflattering in black and white ,14,sousvide
Crappyblogger,if talking within reasonable circumstances using a big container the operating capacity is reliant on the circulator not the heater ,3,sousvide
Crappyblogger,thank you marked my calendar for those dates i have not fertilized ,1,lawncare
Crappyblogger,this is not true the extra 100 watts simply helps the unit pre heat faster even so the difference is barely noticeable i tested both of them http sousvideguy com anova precision cooker review sous vide perfection and the 800w preheated to 135f in 24 minutes while the 900w preheated in 19 minutes the big difference between the 800w and 900w is bluetooth only 800w or bluetooth and wifi 900w ,7,sousvide
Crappyblogger,damn i suck at this ok thanks do you think there anything else i can be doing i am in the northeast lawn is pretty thin and gets weedy especially in the back yard as we live right on the edge of the woods and there a bit of shade there the front gets a lot of sun however it still not great maybe i should grab a bag of seed and spread it out lightly to help thicken it ,2,lawncare
Crappyblogger,come on man you are putting too much into it just eat it but yes i used a fork ,2,sousvide
Crappyblogger,just cracked it like you normally would ,2,sousvide
Crappyblogger,yep i dunked it in boiling water for about 45 seconds to help solidify the whites a bit more although i do not always at this temp the whites are not usually all too runny this time some of the outer egg white stuck to the shell after boiling however it did end up creating a perfect looking egg ,3,sousvide
Crappyblogger,nothing they can just go straight into the water ,2,sousvide
Crappyblogger,only added the chili sea salt to the avocado the 5 minutes between adding that and taking the picture brought some moisture to the top ,5,sousvide
Crappyblogger,egg 167f for 15 minutes on toasted and buttered rye with avocado chili lime sea salt pepper chives ,8,sousvide
Crappyblogger,yeah i do not mean standard as in replace the current clip but instead it would be cool to have it included in the box as an adapter for attaching to larger containers ,2,sousvide
Crappyblogger,this defeats the purpose of sous vide ,1,sousvide
Crappyblogger,they are probably already spying on us through the device just like the microwaves http crooksandliars com files primary image 17 03 kellyanne microwave jpg ,4,sousvide
Crappyblogger,this makes one of the best devices even better however i hope future joule sales come with this standard instead of an add on ,7,sousvide
Crappyblogger,probably depends on your vacuum sealer but for my cheap food saver i can choose where i place the end of the bag and then just hit seal so i will feed the bag in a little further to a spot on the bag that is not sealed yet and do it again ,1,sousvide
Crappyblogger,i double seal every bag at least even if i am not doing a long cook i did a 36 hour chuck roast last week and sealed it 4 times ,3,sousvide
Crappyblogger,a 45 minute conversation ended up being one quote but it was still pretty cool to do ,7,sousvide
Crappyblogger,agreed this is one of those things that aim for looks over taste but damn if that is not a nice pic ,2,sousvide
Crappyblogger,awesome thank you for the detailed info ,1,HomeImprovement
Crappyblogger,i know what i am doing this weekend looks awesome ,3,sousvide
Crappyblogger,good stuff but did you cut that with a paring knife ,4,sousvide
Crappyblogger,where are your times temps coming from are these pasteurization times a 1 5 filet at 155f for sure does not need 2 and a half hours to be cooked good concept but needs a lot of work imo ,2,sousvide
Crappyblogger,also use this was the first sealer i bought still works perfectly fine definitely recommend it for the price ,1,sousvide
Crappyblogger,i am utterly shocked by the amount of people up in arms about this app and making an account you bought an app controlled tech appliance i am actually shocked they did not have this as a required step from day 1 with that said they listened to the unrelenting uproar and it currently the top post on this sub https www reddit com r sousvide comments 65rhs5 anova will no longer require user accounts to use that they no longer require one for using however you bought the wifi version and from what i gather you will need to make an account or use it manually,13,sousvide
Crappyblogger,i make frozen tri tips all the time however i seal them in my own vac bags beforehand so i can just drop them right in from the freezer i usually cook for 7 hours 24 hours is definitely not necessary for this ,6,sousvide
Crappyblogger,i mean he not wrong ,3,sousvide
Crappyblogger,i do mine for 7ish hours temp depends on your preference i have done seasoned and unseasoned i personally would not go through the trouble of unthawing just to add some salt cook it from frozen and add some sea salt before serving ,1,sousvide
Crappyblogger,i am not a pear expert but i believe bosc pears are ideal for poaching this one was amazing very juicy and ripe tasting while still being firm enough to handle it the asian pear i did was too firm as well so give it a shot with the bosc ripeness obviously plays a role in the firmness as well so maybe yours was a bit too under ripe you definitely do not want to poach a very ripe pear either or it will just fall apart ,2,sousvide
Crappyblogger,you can say this for 75 of the food here let have some fun with these devices ,11,sousvide
Crappyblogger, definitely just omit or reduce the added sugar in the ingredients list to taste if using a sweeter wine politely painting a picture here but perhaps procuring port from my pantry is preposterous ,8,sousvide
Crappyblogger,cooked 178f for roughly 45 minutes i used a cabernet but really any dry wine will do created a concoction containing sugar cinnamon cloves etc to spice it up served with vanilla ice cream pretty fun dessert step by step http sousvideguy com recipes sous vide red wine poached pears the bosc pear was much better ,6,sousvide
Crappyblogger,i really am not sure but i have a rolled up skirt steak sealed in the freezer right now i am assuming once cooked it might hold that shape a little and not be as easy to sear but we will see ,1,sousvide
Crappyblogger,they mentioned they would be sending one to me to review when ready but have not heard from them in quite a while i agree this is not an every day sous vide machine it intended for those who want to start their cook as they leave the office without worrying about temperatures from the ice hack method ,2,sousvide
Crappyblogger,likewise it one of my favorite things to make i either do cheesesteaks or french dips the day after ,1,sousvide
Crappyblogger,i have not had good luck either tried store bought cukes sliced into spears and local organic pickles did not have an amazing crunch and the flavor was off i could not even pinpoint it i think my first batch following chefsteps was way too sugary so i used significantly less and then it just tasted like i was eating a floppy vinegar soaked cucumber i plan on trying more this season with trying out a few of my own concoctions ,2,sousvide
Crappyblogger,i use eye of round for a more traditional roast beef style or tri tip for more steak like sandwiches ,1,sousvide
Crappyblogger,i am not sure what you are asking from us you seem to be set on 40 50 minutes or less for some reason for one it depends how thick your tri tip is i have had a few that definitely needed longer than 50 minutes to ensure it was cooked through also tri tips are usually cooked longer to make them more tender i personally do 5 7 hours ,7,sousvide
Crappyblogger,do 140 especially if you do not remember ever eating pork tenderloin and it only needs up to 2 hours or so i did not like 130 it was too squishy here a pic of one i made and steps to do it http sousvideguy com recipes sous vide pork tenderloin this is one of my favorite things to sous vide ,2,sousvide
Crappyblogger,best part of the meal ,1,sousvide
Crappyblogger,equip your armor long sleeves and oven mitts worst part for me is the cleanup amazing how far the oil splatters can reach ,2,sousvide
Crappyblogger,used a wegmans branded mojo sauce but added chilis lime and more seasoned sea salt to the bowl ,3,sousvide
Crappyblogger,marinated in a chili lime mojo sauce for 24 hours cooked 155f for 2 hours added pepper seared in avocado oil on a cast iron topped with a chili lime sea salt also served with shrimp which was cooked in the same marinade but not sous vide ,2,sousvide
Crappyblogger,yep all of the books say the same thing they are mainly useful for those who are new and are grabbing a device on amazon just toss a cheap book in their cart to get started instead of scouring the internet i do not think any book will ever beat an industry leading website just from a content limitation perspective ,2,sousvide
Crappyblogger,i am on mobile right now but i believe this one had quite a lot of black and white photos and lots of fluff i hate fluff but either way i think it a beginner guide not necessarily full of unique recipes i am actually 80 complete with my own beginner guide book as well i looked at a few on the market to try and find what not to do so far i think nomiku book is the best the pics in that are amazing ,2,sousvide
Crappyblogger,flavor no but subjectively many people get a better crust with it simply due to avocado oils higher smoke point i personally turn down the heat when smoke starts billowing and that does not happen until 500f with my avocado oil ,10,sousvide
Crappyblogger,zero seasonings pepper before sear sea salt and more pepper before plating ,5,sousvide
Crappyblogger,it does not take much longer i would even say an extra 30 mins is enough i did the hour here since it was just unpacked from dry ice and was super frozen ,2,sousvide
Crappyblogger,yeah if you have the options definitely no one in their right mind would buy this regularly over a local purchase i thought it was cool so gave it a shot and was impressed by it i also do not have costcos where i live my best option is likely wegmans which is something like 28 lb for their prime and it all about perspective i disagree with his opinion on no taste difference these for sure tasted aged with the buttery flavor then again their site says around 14 days maybe it was longer who knows either way i am still undecided if i will do it again ,5,sousvide
Crappyblogger,from the homepage the beef is dry aged a process that lends richer flavor and tenderness apart from a few niche butcher shops and restaurants it s almost impossible to buy dry aged beef anymore and the meat is dry aged for approximately 14 days to enhance tenderness and flavor then processed into steaks roasts and ground beef and faq why do you dry age the beef dry aged beef tastes better and is more tender supermarket beef is never dry aged and the very best steakhouse beef always is 14 days is not long but enough to taste it and yes cost is up there ,4,sousvide
Crappyblogger,yep that it it only available in certain states i believe edit oh they are shipped in sous vide ready bags as well ,2,sousvide
Crappyblogger,i do cast iron only ,1,sousvide
Crappyblogger,bingo,1,food
Crappyblogger,135f for 6ish hours salt and pepper before sealing seared with avocado oil and butter then topped with maldons salt flakes plated with a mushroom risotto not as good as a tri tip but still good ,4,sousvide
Crappyblogger,my understanding is it does not have the traditional corned beef texture at lower temps ,1,sousvide
Crappyblogger,i wanted to eat and it happened to be cooking for 7 hours by that time ,6,sousvide
Crappyblogger,my bad y all,5,sousvide
Crappyblogger,store bought corned beef soaked in water for 24 hours in the fridge to pull off some of the salt cooked sous vide for 7 hours at 185f refrigerated overnight to aid in slicing toasted on a non stick pan and topped with cheese and russian dressing yes i am missing sauerkraut but we had over 2 feet of snow outside and was not making my way to the store still good without it but i wish i had it i feel like traditional methods may taste a bit better since store bought corned beef can be a bit salty by cooking sous vide even after soaking in water however it slices much better ,2,sousvide
Crappyblogger,oh i agree i am not saying go buy the 400 polyscience since it preheats a few seconds quicker i was just curious if this showed any build quality measurements especially between like wattage units i was expecting more variation ,1,sousvide
Crappyblogger,the polyscience creative surprisingly heated faster than gourmia gsv140 even though it has a smaller heater however the price point between the two is quite large i guess that shows that even though polyscience is expensive it performs well my anova is currently being used by my friend out of state i would really like to measure that a second time just to be sure there was not a fluke that day can any anova users back the claim that it takes over 20 minutes to preheat to 135 ,1,sousvide
Crappyblogger,jesus i am all about this i actually just bought pistachio butter but have not even tasted it yet i wonder if i can use this ,2,sousvide
Crappyblogger,zero chunks it was perfectly smooth perhaps timing is a factor i do not have their app open right now but i believe their cooking time was well over 1 hour right ,1,sousvide
Crappyblogger,they also use 176f quite a bit lower than the 190f i use i will have to try it with and without hearing the cream ,1,sousvide
Crappyblogger, it not pointless imo http www cookingclarified com 2011 03 temper eggs it to temper the eggs so they do not curdle when you drop them into 190f water heating the cream and slowly tempering them brings them up to a higher temperature without curdling i could be wrong though if it works by skipping that step then even better ,1,sousvide
Crappyblogger,i think it depends on the torch you are using if you are using a small kitchen torch for desserts you can probably get it perfect without worrying about shattering i was using the sansaire bernzomatic setup which has a massive flame so i wanted to be extra careful i did not have one shatter however i also did not test the limits ,2,sousvide
Crappyblogger,i used the regular mouthed 4oz jars i like them in the smaller portions for such a rich dessert that way if people want more they can just grab another ,2,sousvide
Crappyblogger,190f for 1 hour used a sansaire searing torch to caramelize the top sugar since that flame is so large i had to make sure not to over do it and shatter the glass while i did not get the entire surface brown it still has a wonderful glass layer because i melted down the sugar two times instead of once that most recipes call recipe http sousvideguy com recipes sous vide creme brulee also im addicted cannot stop eating these i really love the lemon raspberry combo ,4,sousvide
Crappyblogger,true good to know i have only done 1 2 ,2,sousvide
Crappyblogger,i know lighting plays a major factor in color but that looks over 130 was it more pink in person if not i would just double check the water temperature ,2,sousvide
Crappyblogger,i would definitely recommend the 2hrs max for a lamb rack they are so tender to begin with lamb by itself is a bit more gamey than beef but lamb at 135 140 is one of my favorites ,2,sousvide
Crappyblogger,it does added 3 to the bag for cooking remaining was used for clarified butter ,1,sousvide
Crappyblogger,thanks that just clarified butter with a tiny bit of lemon sides included sun dried tomato risotto and steamed broccoli ,1,sousvide
Crappyblogger,id say a bit in between still primarily frozen i really only thaw the outside enough to extract it from the shell but it not frozen solid since i put it in cold water for 20 30 min before pulling the meat out of the tail ,2,sousvide
Crappyblogger,yeah 140 is more firm like traditional methods ,1,sousvide
Crappyblogger, here are the steps http sousvideguy com recipes sous vide lobster tail kenji guide has you skewering the tails and boiling them to remove the shell but that too much work imo i place frozen tails in cold water to fully defrost them and then carefully remove the shell ,3,sousvide
Crappyblogger,i had zero issues with the texture i will probably try going a bit lower in temp next time just to try it it was slightly firm but not as firm as it would be after steaming or any of the other traditional methods definitely give it a shot ,2,sousvide
Crappyblogger,nope straight out of the bag imo lobster only needs a generous amount of butter and maybe some lemon i added parsley to the bag as well during the cook and yes i will absolutely do lobster again sous vide it unbelievably easy and i think has a better end result vs broiling steaming ,5,sousvide
Crappyblogger, check out the faqs in progress https www reddit com r sousvide wiki faq should shed some light on both your questions joule and anova are mainly suggested in the sub but there a lot more options out there cheaper too my recommendation is at least a 12qt container if you plan on buying one or just use a pot ,2,sousvide
Crappyblogger,i would just seal it now without adding salt pepper the night before i believe the salt will toughen up the steak in that amount of time salt pepper after the bath and before searing ,3,sousvide
Crappyblogger,i can assist here he used two different types of bread ,1,food
Crappyblogger,locked as the comments are becoming untasteful and it appears op was not even looking for help or advice op contact anova customer service ,7,sousvide
Crappyblogger,1 tsp lemon juice yes that was included forgot to mention ,1,sousvide
Crappyblogger,did not mix before cooking it was very separated when i pulled it out blending it fixed all of that i thought it was good ,3,sousvide
Crappyblogger,i did just added info ,3,sousvide
Crappyblogger,sorry added info above i thought i posted it when i submitted the pic but guess not ,3,sousvide
Crappyblogger,both the eggs and the hollandaise were cooked with sous vide i loosely followed chefsteps guide but ended up doing my own thing dropped 4tbs butter 1tsp lemon juice some salt 1 egg yolk minced shallots pinch of cayenne put the bag in the water without mixing dropped 4 eggs in as well cooked everything at 147f for 1 hour blended the hollandaise mixture toasted some english muffins seared up canadian bacon served with freshly chopped parsley ,4,sousvide
Crappyblogger,the cabinet on the top is from the island it was unfinished oak and i did 2 coats of golden oak like they suggested but it still way too light should i sand them with like 100 grit paper so they absorb more and let the stain sit for 15 min ,1,woodworking
Crappyblogger,took one of my kitchen cabinet doors right to sherwin williams to match gave them a piece of oak to test on they ended up saying the zar golden oak with 2 coats was a match i found it hard to believe since my cabinets are quite a bit darker than golden oak but i went with it this picture shows the new cabinet door top with 2 coats and the one i am trying to match on the right should i keep going with more coats or go back and ask them to tint it ,1,woodworking
Crappyblogger,anything over 350f will start to sizzle i usually aim for 400 before i put it in and try not to exceed 500 i use a 500f smoke point oil and there few things in the world my wife hates more than a house filled with smoke so i think all of those guides out there that say to wait until your oil is smoking is just ridiculous that is unless you have a heavy duty exhaust fan ,1,sousvide
Crappyblogger, only had it on for a couple minutes flipping every 30 seconds need to work on that maybe cook it to a lower temp knowing it will rise in the pan torch alone never did that to me i would not do that kinda defeats the purpose of sous vide you want to avoid temperature gradients i flip every 15 seconds at least i think it helps prevent overcooking one side at a time add butter after 1 minute that also helps add to the sear another tip is to grab an infrared digital thermometer to check the surface temp of your pan they are like 10 bucks that way you know your pan is hot enough to sear i am not sure yet if i would do pan for lamb still never noticed any off tastes with a torch and just thinking about how oddly a lamb rack is shaped just puts me off from using a pan for it i would definitely recommend it the top of lamb racks have some fat which render much better in a cast iron pan you can easily rotate the rack to get all of it touching i just think torch only is too thin of a sear ,3,sousvide
Crappyblogger,completely agree i cannot think of many things more suited for a torch laziness defeated me remembered i needed a new tank which was in the garage because i had an extra and did not think of it until everything was ready to be served do you torch only i prefer to do a pan sear torch i do not like the taste crust from torch only ,1,sousvide
Crappyblogger,you can eat tuna however you want but yes rare to raw is common i personally would not eat it straight out of the bag since sous vide usually gives off a funky smell until you sear it however i have not tested that with tuna if it looks smells fine give it a go ,2,sousvide
Crappyblogger,i personally do not cook ahi tuna with sous vide all it needs is a quick hot sear however i believe serious eats put out a recipe for it edit here http www seriouseats com 2016 09 food lab complete guide to sous vide tuna html ,4,sousvide
Crappyblogger,salt and peppered before sealing cooked 135f for 1 5 hours quickly seared on cast iron did not break out the torch for this one added butter and rosemary towards the end of the sear tip slice after two ribs instead of one if your party size allows for it ,2,sousvide

Crappyblogger,agreed the cooking times just seem dangerous and unnecessary ,5,sousvide
Crappyblogger,there are certain tools i steer away from at harbor freight one of those happens to be things with gas flowing through them ,4,sousvide
Crappyblogger,hey look dexter morgan joined our sub,9,sousvide
Crappyblogger,interesting i will give this a shot next time ,1,sousvide
Crappyblogger,curious what they cooked it at like i mentioned below i did not like 135f that i see others doing in the sub it seemed mushy to me 140 145 firms it up a bit while remaining juicy but hell i am not a top chef judge this could taste like garbage to them but heavenly to me ,6,sousvide
Crappyblogger,exactly i have only ever known overcooked pork before sous vide so the difference is unbelievable and what makes it even better is how cheap pork is ,3,sousvide
Crappyblogger,id like to get other peoples opinions on this first the current metric conversion bot being used around reddit posts whenever fahrenheit is mentioned not a command could get annoying thoughts but believe me i know we in the us are the weird ones ,1,sousvide
Crappyblogger,143f just under 2 hours marinated in a raspberry vinaigrette for 24 hours beforehand used juices in bag and remaining marinade to create a sauce not pictured for the cost its amazing how great pork tenderloin is with sous vide i have cooked one at 135 140 and 143 wife and i prefer 143 the most because it a little bit more firm but still incredibly juicy personally 135 seemed too squishy ,6,sousvide
Crappyblogger,my question is how when it the joints of the pre assembled cabinets and not where i lined up not going to disassemble home depot cabinets i think i will listen to u 66666thats6sixes and hope the installers can shim ,1,HomeImprovement
Crappyblogger,awesome and just to make sure they will shim the top of the cabinets under the granite and not the bottom of the cabinets i am about to screw these puppies into my floor edit now that you made me double check the front could be lifted up http m imgur com hwxcca5 some so i should just make sure this is level and then the installers can handle the top part ,1,HomeImprovement

Crappyblogger,damn beautiful pics ,3,sousvide
Crappyblogger,that what prevented me from trying this yet looks like baby food but dang your pic looks good well done ,2,sousvide
Crappyblogger,after all they all do the same thing right ,2,sousvide
Crappyblogger,you are asking for recommendations besides anova and joule but these are the two most often recommended brands in this sub so i am not sure what you want us to tell you i have used and written reviews on almost every device available including nomiku and polyscience that you mentioned imo i rank anova joule sansaire and gourmia over nomiku and poly nomiku has an oddly clunky user interface polyscience is really good but you will fork out more money lots of options so you have to elaborate on what is deterring you from anova joule to help you narrow down choices ,7,sousvide
Crappyblogger,thanks that exactly how i did it at first not only does is fill the house with smoke but it also much easier to overcook cause a larger gradient ,5,sousvide
Crappyblogger,this is a follow up from this post https www reddit com r sousvide comments 5s48gf ive been perfecting my sear tenderloin 132f 2 ref share ref source link in which many people seemed interested in how i did it the basics include a high smoke point oil and butter to obtain a really good base sear then using a searing torch to finish it off and fill in the spots missed finally pour any hot juices over the steak when finished to re crisp top photo credit to u knuckle cracker that an awesome looking steak ,6,sousvide
Crappyblogger,did you refrigerate ice bath before the oven sorry if i missed it in the album last time i tried a brisket the oven sear dried it out too much i find it hard to do brisket better than a smoker but i am still going to try again ,3,sousvide
Crappyblogger,season as you like i just use salt pepper 132f 7 hours is my go to for tri tip one of my favorite things to sous vide ,2,sousvide
Crappyblogger,thanks it does not at all i have tested quite a bit with this which i will talk about in my full post in a couple days but essentially using torch only to obtain a sear like this will give a burnt taste what you want to do is first perfect your pan sear then top it off with the torch just a bit to hit the spots the pan missed ,8,sousvide
Crappyblogger,a new thread it will be a day or two because it a bit lengthy ,5,sousvide
Crappyblogger,tonight included cast iron avocado oil butter at the end topped off with a torch typing up a pretty in depth guide to getting the perfect sear equipment do and dont etc i will post the link when finished for anyone interested edit link to guide https www reddit com r sousvide comments 5s8apo as requested heres my indepth guide to sous vide ref share ref source link ,43,sousvide
Crappyblogger,where did you hear this i have never heard this one yet i use garlic all the time ,-1,sousvide
Crappyblogger,yeah i like the gourmia lineup i recommend them as budget friendly purchases so long as anova is not running a sale if you can grab an anova for the same price or lower i recommend that route i have the gsv130 and gsv140 both still work great the 150 just came out which has wifi have not used that one yet ,1,sousvide
Crappyblogger,curious how much you have used it before it started whistling it does sound like you need to clean it here a short video https youtu be 70dl54caqmi i captured of what the joule should sound like noise levels for those curious ,1,sousvide
Crappyblogger,i would never pre sear in replacement of post searing only in addition to post searing imo post sear is necessary while pre is optional ,4,sousvide
Crappyblogger,i have used nearly all of them here are my rankings http sousvideguy com joule is currently my favorite immersion circulator and tribest sousvant is my favorite all in one oven ,3,sousvide
Crappyblogger,i have the same ring weird ,1,sousvide
Crappyblogger, tl dr joule rocks http sousvideguy com chefsteps joule review beautiful refined powerful sous vide ,2,sousvide
Crappyblogger,i agree it definitely is which is why i think it needs to be sliced super thin eating it like a steak is a definite no go i would not say i was disappointed but i would change my expectations away from a traditional roast ,1,sousvide
Crappyblogger,eye of round for sure will try it again but next time with a slicer to make french dips ,3,sousvide
Crappyblogger,i need a slicer for sure to get thinner cuts for sandwiches meat was really cheap but turned out good dropped it in boiling water for 30 secs before seasoning bagging i only do this for a long cook seasoned with sea salt cracked black pepper garlic and onion powder sealed and cooked for 24 hours very tender flavor was there ,1,sousvide
Crappyblogger,that purely your choice we cannot help with that personally i wait until i am home to cook it eliminates uncertainty did i add enough ice is the device going to catch my house on fire probably not but it always in the back of my mind ,1,sousvide
Crappyblogger,i reviewed the gourmia gsv 140 http sousvideguy com gourmia gsv140 review more power better design for 90 on sale my thoughts are to go for it like u redoctobyr mentioned the components are pretty good powerful heater circulator but reliability is still up in the air since its a new release it feels slightly cheaper when using it vs anova joule but that also why they can sell it for 90 might not last forever but it can introduce you to sous vide for really cheap and let you see which features you really want later on ,3,sousvide
Crappyblogger,sweet thank you ,1,subaru

Crappyblogger, if you went up to your boss tomorrow and told them you re planning a week long vacation starting tomorrow do you think it would be as simple as that to get the time off well by becoming an entrepreneur you can say goodbye yo having to worry about that apart from the typo most real entrepreneurs would have even more difficulty taking time off this article is terrible ,1,Entrepreneur
Crappyblogger,definitely purchase a scale and print the labels yourself,2,Entrepreneur
Crappyblogger,most importantly sell products people want the traffic will come ,1,Entrepreneur
Crappyblogger,this seems scammy i apologize if it not but i am sure people will be hesitant to send their valuable ideas to sharks over the phone ,4,Entrepreneur
Crappyblogger,so do you want to blog or freelance web design for blogging all you need is traffic to make money however you may need to define a niche ,1,Entrepreneur
Crappyblogger,do some keyword research see if the effort involved is something you care to attempt even at its current state the site is paying for itself though ,4,Entrepreneur
