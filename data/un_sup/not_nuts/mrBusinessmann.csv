mrBusinessmann,i wholeheartedly agree many of these responses have spoken that my relationship with joan is an issue i truly believe that it is not and i easily picture her in my life for decades to come for decades to come as a friend and as nothing more but absolutely as nothing less ,0,childfree
mrBusinessmann,that seems like a smart conviction to have trust is definitely important as it allows freedom and autonomy ,3,childfree
mrBusinessmann,this is exactly where i am at but i worried i was being biased and not seeing where i could be wrong in this ,2,childfree
mrBusinessmann,she worries about having to compete and is using that to avoid it all together jane and joan have not actually met each other and i am not texting joan when i am with jane ,2,childfree
mrBusinessmann,how so i do not mean to say she would get serious with me if i dropped joan just that she does not know if she can be serious with someone who has an ex as a best friend ,3,childfree
mrBusinessmann,that very true i would like to think there at least a small amount of inherent trust that can either be built upon or destroyed when a relationship begins ,-1,childfree
mrBusinessmann,no wrong answers i am thankful i can discuss these things with this community she said she is worried about having to compete with an ex i tried to explain i have no feelings like that and would squash joan if they ever came out in order to not ruin the friendship ,3,childfree
mrBusinessmann,i do not know i see it as purely joking similar comments are made between male friends we all played high school sports where homosexual humor developed and we all see her as a bit of a bro ,-5,childfree
mrBusinessmann,it would be nice if she shared your views ,0,childfree
mrBusinessmann,ahh i can see that making sense i have treated one as a booty call in the past but only after emotional feelings subsided completely ,2,childfree
mrBusinessmann,no not too long about 2 months feelings came on much stronger and quicker than expected or that i have experienced in the past and she in the same boat i think pretty quickly into learning about her i knew that i wanted to get serious with her i am not exactly doing anything that makes her uncomfortable it simply the fact that i have a very close friend that i was intimate with in the past i am friends with joan because i genuinely enjoy her company and we know a great deal about each other why would this be a red flag if joan were not an ex are you saying close friends of the opposite sex scream danger i am hesitant to push her away because i feel that not the correct move i have always been bitter when i can no longer hang out with a friend male included because they have entered a monogamous relationship i would not say my past with joan is important enough to throw away a relationship as much as i feel that a relationship should not require dispatching a friend i hope i covered all your questions ,1,childfree
mrBusinessmann,i have actually not brought this up with my friends jane asked her friends if it would be a bad idea and it was a unanimous yes i suppose there could be a problem with my relationship with joan but i do not recall any sort of sexual tension and anytime banter regarding our sexual past comes up it met with a sort of sarcastic ew by both parties that ends that i could be too close to the situation but no one on the outside has ever said you two should be together ,3,childfree
mrBusinessmann,i agree i think she has some issues she needs to work on while not with anyone else i asked if she has ever tried being alone for a while as it was a pretty good way for me to improve myself she said she hates being alone and is never single for more than a few months which is very alarming to me,3,childfree
mrBusinessmann,you are asking the right questions and i know it there just that one part of me that heartbroken,3,childfree

mrBusinessmann,that very interesting do you have any idea on the correlation i do not want to get back with any of my exes i ended all but 2 and those were both mutual as it just was not going to work out this was all before cf life ,4,childfree
mrBusinessmann,she is not asking me to throw away my friendship she just sees it as a red flag good advice though i appreciate the insight ,3,childfree
mrBusinessmann,i am not i have had my consult and scheduled the procedure but opted to start a small business shortly after so i have not had the opportunity to save the funds and had to cancel it i was actually the first to bring up the cf thing apparently there a strong chance she cannot have children due to medical issues ,8,childfree
mrBusinessmann,that extremely unacceptable and it would be easier to let this go if that were the case she is not wanting me to end my friendship with joan she has been burned in the past by a similar situation and is unfairly juxtaposing that experience onto me and in turn dismissing me as a partner ,1,childfree
mrBusinessmann,i do not have any animosity towards any of my exes should not that be a good sign and i talk to most of them occasionally but joan is the only one i truly treasure ,1,childfree
mrBusinessmann,this is what i keep telling myself when trying to accept that this can go nowhere she has not seen how joan and i interact yet she feels so strongly she knows the whole situation ,0,childfree
mrBusinessmann,she did tell me she has jealousy issues but that does not really worry me i am pretty good at making my sos feel no need for concern regarding my faithfulness i think jealousy is healthy for the most part thank you for your input ,-1,childfree
mrBusinessmann,she is not trying to dictate who can be in my friends circle just that my current friend could be an obstacle she does not want to encounter you are right though patience is key ,2,childfree
mrBusinessmann,i am pretty sure 2 is where she coming from she been burned before i do not really want to expend the energy trying to convince her that there no sexual interest between joan and i or if anything is there i doubt either of us would act on it as i do not see that as necessary seems like it would be a poor start she is not dictating who i can be friends with just that my current friends are a potential obstacle she does not want to encounter ,6,childfree

mrBusinessmann,i am pretty sure it biblical in the bible shephards are hard working men considered to be the salt of the earth or inherently good people that are without sin you are favorite superhero could be considered as the salt of the earth whereas there are many references to demons possessing a ram head even satan himself is often depicted with a horned goat head i believe this is mostly associated with christianity though as there are several greek and roman spiritual entities with goat like features that are not inherently evil ,2,ELIActually5
mrBusinessmann, safest is going to be 100 subject as you have said meeting certain standards is the only way we can gauge a level of safety empirically personally i wo not be able to make a judgment until i actually get the thing on however the tech is very enticing to me which is why i went ahead and ordered one i am not the one to whom you should be directing this question i do not represent skully and i do not speak for them i have no grounds to defend this helmet ability to do its job i bought the helmet because i could and it is intriguing that about it ,1,motorcycles

mrBusinessmann,i do not know why this is getting combative i am not trying to call you out on anything i can absolutely see out of my mirrors and their entire existence is definitely to provide rider awareness i personally think they do a poor job on most bikes i can see much better by simply turning my head and it takes less time to do so than to use my mirrors to get the same information regarding my surroundings why am i going to bother with a 1500 helmet from an unproven maker i am not trying to force anyone into getting this helmet it absolutely not for everyone i have explained why i am getting it and that all most people feel the same way you do there are several classes of consumers adopting a new product or idea most people wait until something new has already seen time in the real world and there is nothing wrong with that the helmet price point will most likely come down after the item has been in the market for a few years once the majority adopters get on the train ,1,motorcycles

mrBusinessmann,i worked full time throughout college and graduated with a bachelor from an in state research university it not that i think my 35k debt is crippling i just think it is outrageously high my repayment plan is very fair and i have been able to stay on top of it easily i fear that tuition will soon be on par with medical bills in that with the rates increasing yearly as they are students will eventually never be able to pay off their loans the american health system is wildly overpriced due to all those that receive medical care but are never able to pay for it as it stands now 14k of my student loan debt will be waived at the end of my repayment plan i just think it sucks that an education is so important and attractive yet it has such a large price tag ,2,AdviceAnimals

mrBusinessmann,i see your logical thinking a raise you superficial thinking it cool i really enjoy the idea of the 360 degree rearview as side mirrors are pretty useless mine are at least and i have on more than one occasion found myself needing to see what was coming up behind me as well as how quickly i was approaching traffic in front of me on the other hand the safety brought about by this helmet will vary from rider to rider a set of gear and a really nice helmet could be had for the same price if not less but let not forget it would not be as cool ,2,motorcycles

mrBusinessmann,true but would a woman see that as an acceptable compromise to personally carrying a child i have considered freezing a semen sample but it quite pricey for something i most likely would never use something like a one time fee of 1300 per potential child and a 600 yr maintenance fee ,1,childfree
