swolemedic,you were on both i am not that familiar with tizanadine but looking at the molecule it very similar to clonidine i always think it neat how meds like clonidine are kinda similar in structure to vasopressors i do not know your cardiac history it entirely possible that alpha blockers would be beneficial to your cardiac health my point is that i do not think they are something people should take without supervision if you have been prescribed both odds are it safe although do not get me wrong doctors make plenty of mistakes my neurologist was pissed when he heard about a couple of the fuck ups the docs made with me as long as you are not mixing it with a bunch of new meds or something ,1,steroids

swolemedic,that would be the most likely symptom but other things can occur and let not forget we have a guy in here who went into cardiac arrest recently who thought he was healthy i find most people think they are healthy until they are told they are not i do not think the risk to reward is worth it for the average person,1,steroids

swolemedic,i can think of plenty of cases where using an if during an apology would in my eyes at least be appropriate ever have to make a judgement call that negatively effected someone i am sorry if any of my actions harmed you would be appropriate then because sometimes you can do the right thing and someone is still hurt by it it does not mean that you necessarily regret your decision but that you feel for them do i think the person originally in question was a jerk yeah but if i made an advance on someone and they denied me and i apologized saying if that offended you i am sorry i fail to see how that makes me a bad guy because i would only be in the wrong if they were offended by it,15,bestof

swolemedic,1 private companies that used tax money with the promise to provide internet access for the people 2 i dont care if t d exists 3 any post with something like upvote so people see or even promoting that is considered vote manipulating a subreddit like meirl upvotes shitposts on purpose but no coordination or requests are permitted t d has a history of doing that shit and when they got walled off multiple attempts to make subreddits get pro trump posts to the front page were made with cries about censorship i do not know what truth you think you know that everyone else is oblivious to,5,technology
swolemedic,i mean its one thing to not want to try it if you have an underlying medical reason but otherwise i mean come on you dont gotta keep doing it just give it a try you should totally show her comments from random redditors saying she should take it in the butt you will get brownie points ,3,todayilearned
swolemedic,t d kept purposefully vote manipulating to get controversial posts to the front page that banned in all subreddits if something makes it to the front page on its own its one thing but when you have masses of people voting on things with the intention to spread their message thats an issue and what people seem to forget is reddit is privately owned and you arent entitled to any service they provide they didnt get rid of t d they only enforced what they did due to repeated vote manipulation even funnier to me is how people give reddit shit about censorship when in t d if you do anything but suck donalds dick you are banned,7,technology
swolemedic,yeah but then by that logic so is all of the internet ,3,technology
swolemedic,not really im pro net neutrality but even in a net neutral world we have some forms of censorship like child pornography to compare cp to not letting t d hit the front page would be ludicrous ,5,technology

swolemedic, then when companies want to pay more for better access from isps you do not think thats right because they do not need to throttling is what is not allowed by net neutrality all of our data once it hits the isp servers is treated equally if net neutrality is gone then companies like google will need to pay more for the service they want and how will people favor the better product if the new companies do not have the capital to pay for internet fast lanes to provide service to their customers that can compete with a big company like google start ups are not known for having a bunch of money laying around ,5,technology
swolemedic,they were throttling in areas charging more for extra bandwith etc before net neutrality that the whole point were you not paying for your internet access pre net neutrality ,1,technology
swolemedic,also you realize the whole point of net neutrality is so companies don t have to pay more to compete right ,3,technology
swolemedic, by that logic lets make a leap and say you support a flat tax rate i do not google should be able to pay for higher speeds just like you pay for higher speeds they already pay for their bandwith and speed just like i do there is also no networking reason to throttle right now we have more than the infrastructure needed in america australia has enough to not need throttling they even experimented and showed it was unneeded you are also still making assumptions you have no fucking clue how many forms or whatever they would have had before or otherwise you are making assumptions ,3,technology
swolemedic,please show me what exceedingly difficult paperwork the fcc imposes with title 2 and net neutrality because last i checked having all packets of information have equal priority is pretty straight forward,6,technology

swolemedic,interesting i do not plan on living anywhere that needs satellite internet any time soon but that good to know,1,technology
swolemedic,what is your argument against net neutrality other than fuck net neutrality i asked for an argument not your emotions,9,technology
swolemedic, we do not need someone to fight against everything obama did simply because you do not agree with it statistically speaking trump voters are the ones who benefited the most from the aca although they seem to not realize it or maybe they do and that why there has been such an outcry at town hall meetings but i find many people want to just overthrow anything obama did not because they disagree but because it was obama fox news was shit talking obama in his first few months as president for things like using fancy mustard there was nothing the man could do that was good in the right eyes ,1,technology
swolemedic,i am sorry what pro net neutrality arguments are propoganda ,36,technology
swolemedic,but satellite internet is great verizon tried selling me on that shit because half my apartment complex was wired for fios and the other half was not yet and they wanted me to use dish for the interim which ended up being a year firstly i said fuck no because not only am i not allowed to have dish but i can get cable at the same damn price they also told me that the dish was my own private line and that would make it faster i told them i doubted that even if i had my own private satellite and private receiving station that my latency would still be slower,100,technology
swolemedic,i am sure some statisticians have come up with theoretical numbers i do not have one on hand i am saying it would take a hooooge number of people disrupting the economy for an extended period and then they would be stupid not to do something about it even if trump did not want to stand down if that was the public reaction to him for any reason he can be deemed unfit to lead and pence would become president ,2,worldnews

swolemedic,he could be far up his ass i also think it likely that he hates americans and donald trump on principle and the fact that trump has not said anything about the incident has been pissing americans off this is like a slap in the face what are we supposed to apologize for exactly detaining two people who were kicking people in the face who were then let go or even worse our protesters so now it forces trump hand but i think erdogan thinks trump will either ignore it or potentially suck up or something not escalate it and when trump does what trump will inevitably do americans will be furious ,0,worldnews

swolemedic,i know i am kinda dorky compared to some of the r steroids mods you should really see some of their snapchat stories on there but being a mod does not automatically mean you are some power hungry autistic kid i think a lot of the mod hate comes from people who have trouble understanding the functionality of reddit many seem to believe that all mods and admins are interconnected i know some run multiple default subs i am not going to argue that but the fact is that in r steroids we have only spoken to the admins a few times and those were times over users who were problematic enough we felt needed a site wide ban if anyone can prove to the admins that another user is breaking the rules of reddit not just a subreddit then reddit will almost invariably sitewide ban them something people in undelete should remember,1,space
swolemedic,depends on the subreddit r steroids has primarily used a mix of members suggesting other members when we announce we need new moderators some have offered very rarely do they get it and some consistently good posters get directly approached by the mods but the majority of us are a mix of all the ways well known posters who other reddit users recommend and then mods also agreed ,0,space

swolemedic,i am pretty sure you can have raynauds without having bloodwork that is consistent with it in other words your labs could look normal when you are not things like an elevated ana crp etc could be indicative of things like lupus but are not needed for raynauds i recommend seeing a doc coming from someone who puts off shit until seriously ill it better to treat shit before you end up debilitated ,3,aww
swolemedic,was gonna say it sounds like textbook raynauds but you should get it diagnosed by a doc to make sure also not trying to be alarming but while raynauds itself is usually just annoying but otherwise benign it often an indicator that you have potential autoimmune conditions,3,aww
swolemedic,yeah it also used in the debate for the cause of ms from viruses theory i believe its around 40 percent of all patients who have tm without signs of ms at the time of the tm attack develop ms within the next 5 years,1,aww
swolemedic,improving so far but the docs think i likely have something like devics disease its like ms but slightly different so its possible it can come back i just pray it doesnt come back in the form of acute transverse myelitis again that what i had am recovering from,2,aww
swolemedic,nope transverse myelitis is just the universe fucking you in the spine if anything they think my recovery was benefited by having extra strength and muscle before getting sick i mean it was bad enough at one point it started to effect my breathing i couldnt urinate walk etc which was weird for being a previously strong dude,3,aww
swolemedic,sorry to hear it happened to you too it sucks my condition is unclear at this point i have a variety of shit going on and my neurologists think a good chance of ms or devic disease even though my transverse myelitis did not look like typical ms on the mri i had done i have gained some muscle back in my upper body but my legs are still shrinking i am 4 months in to recovering from the big attack,2,aww
swolemedic,i have been able to get some back but i do not know how much i will be able to get back or keep i am 4 months into recovery also i have a variety of conditions they think so transverse myelitis is not the only thing that is keeping my gainz down for my legs in particular i have been having circulatory issues around the joints that they think could be reynauds but would be a pretty nasty case if so so my joints are weak as fuck due to the poor blood flow ,10,aww
swolemedic,transverse myelitis is the only diagnosis i have been given so far in regards to diseases effecting myelin nerves i am seeing more specialists soon,2,aww

swolemedic,yeah it kinda funny how it all comes down to perspective i guess like many steroid users especially those who do not use more typical recreational drugs they think their steroid use does not count as abuse and likely mean a high incidence of certain mental health issues but we just kinda tend to ignore that here and keeping with the perspective i personally think that while i sometimes smoke too much or on more rare occasions take a larger dose of etizolam than i should my use is pretty much just medicinal at this point i would much rather use a non recreational benzo for my muscle spasticity and i am going to speak to my docs about that the next time i see them because really the goal is relief and not recreation my use when i got into the hospital was relatively light all things considered the only period in which was heavy was about a week and a half leading up to my hospitalization which made it so surprising to both me and the docs that i had such strong withdrawal symptoms like you know the questionaires they have and the formulas they use for when someone has a benzo or alcohol problem they can treat it right i did not meet the criteria for that treatment despite blatantly needing it they thought i could safely just stop and i was honest about both frequency and quantity my typical daily dose of etizolam for the spasms is about 3 4mg over a 24 hour period it was 2 3 for months but during my si joint injury pain the dose went up a bit and while i could be rationalizing 3 4mg used to be a very mild starter dose for me even without tolerance whereas now i tend to do something like 5mg every 6 hours so soberish i am not doing my drugs of choice which would be uppers and benzos in low doses of course are therapeutic for my type of ailment the pot i feel zero remorse over,1,steroids
swolemedic,if you need 5 min to look at an ekg you shouldnt be reading a patients ekg i agree its absolutely outrageous what they try to bill for it odds are the insurance said dude didnt need an ekg we wont pay and they just sent op the bill instead ive had more ekgs than i can count recently and my insurance negotiated at least one of them down to like 15 bucks edit 15 total for the ekg not my out of pocket,3,todayilearned
swolemedic,there are a bunch of reasons why you may have paid for that ekg they may have even sent you a bill you werent responsible for happens all the time but you need to work with your insurance your insurance has to provide you with an explanation of benefits detailing how much they were charged what they negotiated it to what they paid and what you owe if you get a bill for something other than what your insurance said its almost invariably the company wanting more money either from you or the insurance my understanding of the current laws is it depends on your plan but they will cover any additional expense the medical company tries to bill you if they give you a hard time and they will ask to do a group call with the biller you and your insurer i just spent hours the other day dealing with thousands of dollars of bills im not responsible for but the medical companies insisted i owed nope they do it this way because most people assume you wont go through all of these steps or that you even know about these things i pay a fuck ton for my insurance and my out of pocket max is 1000 a year in and 2000 out ive been getting bills for many times that yeah no ,2,todayilearned

swolemedic,i have seen both endogenous test and exogenous the more telling studies would be exogenous where physiological range doses did not make a difference for example something like roughly 100 versus 150 mg per week was used in a study i am going off memory here and showed no difference between the two,1,science
swolemedic,except there are plenty of studies on the behavioral effects of testosterone abuse and the effects tend to be insignificant aside from horniness and some report a sense of well being which i guess could be confidence it a stretch,1,science
swolemedic,subcutaneous tissue typically refers to the fat under your skin otherwise why have the designation of sc subcutaneous injections instead of iv or im ,1,science
swolemedic,that has no bearing on anything i said 100mg would make your testosterone levels skyrocket if injected the bioavailability is low and part of that reason is the aromatase enzyme in fat ,1,science
swolemedic,if you look at the studies on the differences in muscle development performance within physiological ranges the differences are negligible im mobile but ergolog has at least one i believe the z is the correct spelling its the aromatase enzyme that causes aromatization https en m wikipedia org wiki aromatization but i do agree that supraphysiological testosterone will result in elevated estradiol through increased enzyme activity ,1,science
swolemedic,gel may be the most popular as it the least scary and most heavily pushed by big pharma but that does not mean it the most effective also nobody is doing iv testosterone intramuscular im is how they do it even still the methodology is failed these were healthy subjects who would not be prescribed testosterone gel,1,science

swolemedic,this study did not test for that i am saying we have no way of accounting for certain things they did not account for so there are flaws in the research and there no way to absolutely positively say testosterone is the culprit there a good chance it is it just they did not take all the steps they could to make it more definitive plus this has very little real world implications based off how they tested it,4,science
swolemedic,that precisely what i said right ,1,science
swolemedic,i am just saying that equally as possible as i see nothing in this test that could account for that change for what it worth anabolic steroid effects on mood are debatable on a personal level i become less aggressive and less cranky when i am on anabolic steroids corticosteroids like prednisone are associated with steroid psychosis and mental changes anabolic steroids do not have the steroid psychosis risk aka roid rage ,3,science
swolemedic,firstly while you may be able to see a cognition change on paper i doubt you would see much behavioral change in real life aside from increased libido secondly this does not look into longer term testosterone use and only idiots use testosterone that intermittently but yeah there could be some behavioral changes that can be statistically relevant but we do not know why or if the effects are sustained from this study,1,science
swolemedic,lol i was hoping someone would get my always fucking it up joke i realized it was kinda subtle but i like how you think my friend,1,WTF
swolemedic,i reread it and they did not use any ai in this probably since that would make it even harder to account for the effects of testosterone alone what i think is really fucking dumb is how many ftm transgender people are not given ai despite the fact that they make significantly more aromatase enzymes than biological men i can kinda forgive the researchers but how few physicians prescribe ais to trans people bothers me it not my problem but you made me think of dumb times to not use an ai haha,1,science
swolemedic,lol i was in the er back in december stomach bug bad enough i ended up having an acute coronary fun and i was taking my hoodie off as the doc was asking my prescriptions and he asked me why i was on testosterone and just replied oh when i got topless the real reason is hypopituitarism but they tend to just assume steroids with some of them i have been honest and told them i had my levels tested because i wanted to do a cycle of steroids and found out that i had problems that way it the truth and it seems to help with a lot of docs thinking its from steroid abuse ,1,science
swolemedic,you think you can science well prove it yo ,1,science
swolemedic,lol there are plenty of studies that have even shown prosocial behavior from testosterone like increased generosity steroids have a bad rap because of congress and people confusing corticosteroids with anabolic steroids not their actual track record,1,science
swolemedic,im injections can use long esters and can be administered regularly enough to avoid large peaks and troughs i inject twice a week and my values are plenty stable much more so than anyone i have known with gels as their levels will vary by the hour and someone with injections has much more stable levels than that estrogen will increase on its own with testosterone administration and every man has a different ideal range some men will benefit from aromatase inhibitors even with normal hrt doses especially men with higher body fat percentages iv replacement is impractical for a slew of reasons intramuscular is the gold standard for trt i am not sure where you are getting your info ,1,science
swolemedic,those patients in the start of testosterone replacement therapy could have entirely different effects as they are going from hypogonadism to normal range ideally whereas all of the participants did not have hypogonadism if the goal was to make a study applicable to testosterone gel users i think they failed if their goal was to see the immediate effects of testosterone it eh,6,science
swolemedic,yep it not readily water soluble but you can iv administer testosterone suspension in water hugely impractical for both recreational and medical users but for studies like this it would be useful,3,science
swolemedic,no because this study was performed on men who still had natural testosterone production which should really not even be the case with men prescribed testosterone gel for two reasons 1 is that you should not be giving men with normal testosterone supplemented testosterone and 2 is because they will stop making their own testosterone and rely on the gel so this study is not applicable to anyone ,2,science
swolemedic,find me where they state the fsh lh estradiol or any intermediate hormone levels testosterone alone does not pain a complete picture,2,science
swolemedic,these effects could be gone after a short time period of testosterone gel administration from negative feedback exogenous testosterone shuts down natural testosterone production pretty hard i am saying we do not know what the effects are from due to the flaws of the study as testosterone is not the only hormone that could be effected here,23,science
swolemedic,i saw no mention of other endocrine hormones being tested other than testosterone if i said they didnt test the testosterone levels i meant to say the other endocrine hormones i blame the ganja,1,science
swolemedic,asking to be normal range if the goal is replacement is completely reasonable i personally only renew my script when i need to travel and just use it illegally ive dealt with too many dumb endos like i changed insurance and had to see a new endo who said i looked too muscular and didnt believe that i needed it anymore and wanted me to cold turkey stop it no serm for 3 months to get another script thats when i said fuck it,2,science
swolemedic,kinda it would only be applicable to the first few times of using the gel before natural testosterone production ceases,2,science
swolemedic,why suspension would at most be slightly irritating ,1,science
swolemedic,i mean id feel better at 200 versus 74 but why the hell would you accept that thats not even in healthy range yet and a decent percentage of guys have problems below 300 350 my life was relatively normal too i had one doc insist that since i could get a boner life was fine fuck that i took over an hour to have weak orgasms,6,science
swolemedic,youre probably right but we cant say for certain because this was too unscientific,1,science
swolemedic,firstly paragraphs are your friend after that im not even sure where to begin absorption varying person to person is exactly part of how this is flawed and did you even google what an aromatase enzyme is i thought i sufficiently explained it but its turning testosterone into an estrogen it has nothing to do with odor you may be on hrt but have a fundamental medical misunderstanding of hrt,6,science
swolemedic,injections are optimal for trt ive been on trt since my early 20s for hypopituituarism before i ever touched an illicit steroid if the goal of the study was to test the side effects of transdermal hrt if it is thats retarded then its hugely flawed but if its to see the immediate effects of testosterone on behavior its not awful my recommendations are just fine in my mind ive advised hundreds if not thousands of people over the years in the use of steroids for both recreational and medicinal purposes does that mean what i say is gospel no but i like to think i know what im talking about compared to most,1,science
swolemedic,youre fundamentally correct in my experience going from low was 47ng dl when i was in the hospital to what seems to be my happy dose is huge but after that the difference starts to become less and less noticeable i probably couldnt tell the dif between 800 or 1000ng dl you also need testosterone to produce myelin i found out after coming down with transverse myelitis,8,science
swolemedic,im mobile so i dont have a link on hand but estrogen absorption is about 2 hours peak plasma and testosterone is a similar number if i recall correctly i know the aromatase enzyme is not the fastest or strongest but it still a valid factor especially when dealing with such a narrow time frame hell another issue with the study is that this is only a transient testosterone increase and it possible people may even build a tolerance to the mental effects an iv bolus would be the best way to account for immediate testosterone effects,22,science
swolemedic,not necessarily im mobile so i dont have the link on hand but elevated estradiol levels in men causes some mood instability and serms like tamoxifen have a high rate of mental side effects in men as well and there is tons of anecdotal evidence online with steroid users who take large doses of testosterone and aromatase inhibitors to reduce the conversion of testosterone to estradiol and they have significantly less to no mood issues reported compared to a guy with out of control estradiol levels,34,science

swolemedic,for some reason i do not think this has any bearing on your impulses do you even have high testosterone lol,1,science
swolemedic,for anyone familiar with hrt they would know that this is fundamentally flawed in so many ways they use a gel which is notorious for having inconsistent absorption as well as high rates of aromatization which is the conversion of testosterone to estrogen due to the increased aromatase enzyme found in subcutaneous tissue if they used iv testosterone base or even intramuscular testosterone base then the study would have more validity ,3084,science

swolemedic,when i said ditzy i really meant stupid i know girls can be excessively bubbly or whatever when flirting like this one girl whose profile is all about fitness but no offense if fitness is your whole life you need to be fitter than her lol so i tried to see if she had anything else going on upstairs and it seemed like no shes a cute gym bunny but that seems to be it and that would drive me nuts,7,steroids
swolemedic,ya will motha fuckas having tinder successes suck ive gotten some hot matches but they were stupid as fuck and maybe if i spoke to them in person i could get blinded by the attraction but theyre just so fucking ditzy so i meet up with these two who looked not unattractive but not hot but had personalities or so i thought the first one and i smoked on 4 20 at her place and we got down to it quickly i went down on her but shortly after i started i realized bro you dont know this chick and just fingered her instead she came hard squirted like a god damn fountain somehow i got shit on my hand wtf but i was nice about it and she tries so hard to convince me to fuck but no condom nnnnope didnt even offer me a blowjob i got the fuck out of there next date the girl and i meet at a restaurant and i no joke walked past her as she waited outside because it didnt even look like her profile i didnt recognize her at first she was like a 7 in her profile a 4 in person but i figured fuck it lets get dinner maybe she will be interesting nope boring as fuck to be fair she had warned me she has anxiety and it was palpable in the beginning but still plus when it came time to pay she didnt even make an attempt to offer anything thankfully her food was inexpensive and if she was actually interesting i probably would have paid for it without thinking about it but its like wtf full body or close to full body pics are a requirement now i dont know how to anticipate no personality when texting they seemed cool but odds are if they will misrepresent themselves in a pic they will do it for their personality too but then cant you just fake it at the date ugh whatever off to the not pt gym for the first time in months ,49,steroids
