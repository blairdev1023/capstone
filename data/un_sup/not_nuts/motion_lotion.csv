motion_lotion,you wo not take 5 years off your life by starting trt at your age it will most likely be dramatically more than that it your body though and your choice and it clear you have made up your mind so feel free to dm if you have questions i do not know what the threshold for hypogonadism low t is there but around here in the states we usually prescribe it around 250 ng dl and under you will have to look up the specific numbers for the uk but i can show you how to tank your levels to the 100s if you want the only issue you will have with that is most endocrinologists are going to start you on clomid or something that boosts lh fsh to try to raise your test levels first these can have a nasty positive feedback effect and eventually crash you the same as just injecting so it not the best long term solution you will mostly likely just have to play dumb or greatly exaggerate how bad the side effects are to convince them to go the anabolic route once you have gone that route they will go with testosterone i believe in the uk your docs use test enanthate we use cypionate here that part is easy i can show you the dosing and proper injection schedules while you will want the doc to show you needle sterility and safety you will get very accustomed to 23 25g syringes and your ass being a pincushion the single most difficult thing to do on trt is manage estrogen related sides different men aromatize at different rates some are very prone to it others can get away with no ai at high doses unfortunately even here we suck at dialing in ai doses so it a big hit or miss between aromasin arimidex and letrozole you have to figure out what suppresses estrogen sufficiently without absolutely annihilating your lipids i have found arimidex is very harsh on this that all i can really say for now i would hope you reconsider but if not feel free to message me with further questions and how to cheat the blood work i once had 100ng dl and can show you a screenshot in private if you would like ,1,PEDs

motion_lotion,yeah i never try to outbox boxers i mostly put the ear muffs on keep a high guard to defend against everything and pummel with low kicks and go out of my way to clinch i love using knees against boxers they handle it so poorly then again you can always get clipped on your way in and there nothing worse than someone who figured out your timing countering you with a cross right after you threw a leg kick ,1,sports
motion_lotion,lucky for you i am into that ,1,WTF
motion_lotion,your test levels vary throughout the day depending on so many factors while natty i am usually around 600ng dl lean 6 1 195 lbs but i have seen it as low as mid 300s when stressed and overworked i have also been as high as 800ng dl i have an advantage because i can test at my job anyway your levels are not that bad yes you will get gains more slowly than someone with test levels a bit higher but there no reason you cannot improve those with proper diet rest and training you will just have to work harder it not worth manipulating your doc just to have slightly higher test levels that come along with a life time of issues like heart problems estrogen armotization doctors are terrible at dialing in ai high blood press that are related to trt if you crash your hpta at such an early age you will be in for some serious trouble as you age work natty for now maybe even run short cycles of aas or sarms then pct off but do not go jumping into trt at your age when i guarantee you can still make progress do some research get an idea of what you are signing up for a lot of our trt patients fully dr supervised with pharmaceutical grade ai have serious heart problems do you really want to risk dying 10 20 years earlier because you wanted to be swole at the age of 18 if you decide to go that route and i cannot convince you otherwise consider giving me a direct message i work directly with an endocrinologist and am well versed in trt so i can answer questions and help you with the difficult parts like dialing in proper e2 control ,1,PEDs

motion_lotion,you have met some good cops clearly there nothing wrong with that and the majority of us cops are solid but that not the issue the issue is when cops are bad nothing gets done take this idiot arresting a public defender here he was completely out of line yet the judge dropped the charges a year later for no reason regardless of how bad the police mess up the good ones will stick up for the bad ones completely abuse your power and beat the shit out of a suspect he was resisting arrest shoot someone and your bodycam malfunctions enjoy your paid vacation followed by returning to the force as soon as it blows over mess up really badly and shoot an innocent victim the grand jury refuses to indict police in the states are out of control and immune to the consequences of their actions for the most part we investigated ourselves and cleared ourselves of any wrongdoing is basically their stance on everything you have rights but they have ways around each and every one of them ,0,videos

motion_lotion,155 is his fighting weight not his walkaround weight fighters dehydrate before a match to fight in a lower weight class then re hydrate the day of the fight conor walks around at 170 175 and dehydrates down to 155 to make weight i am the same i fight at 185 but really walk around at 200 ,1,sports
motion_lotion,yup they are two different sports i train mma and muay thai and boxers of equal skill light me up with their hands once you throw in kicks knees and the clinch i start to really handle them if i am fighting a straight boxing match i just get destroyed conor vs floyd would be the same floyd wins in the ring conor wins in the octagon i will still gladly buy the fight anyway ,106,sports
motion_lotion, teleports behind you pssh nothing personnel kid,1,MMA
motion_lotion,i would love to read a werdum overeem fight assuming it does not turn into a rehash of their first butt scooting one i remember that knee my heart sank for a sec when he threw it because i thought he was about to go the route of cub swanson right there ,1,MMA
motion_lotion, i just cannot understand how you people keep saying this ffs that is nothing in terms of real wealth yeah it big money to you and me but 120 million cannot even buy some things on this earth 120 million is big money to any fighter what exactly does conor need to buy that 120m in addition to his previous winnings would not be enough if he invested that even half intelligently the return would be monumental think of shaq and how he has a good 100 or so side businesses like restaurants and car washes 120m is set for life ,1,MMA
motion_lotion,it would probably kill me right now too my two best climbs are rainier winter and mt whitney which are not even close to everest in any way i am going to attempt cho oyu around this time next year and am training extremely hard but even that does not fully compare i want to see how i handle a safer 8000er before going for everest or any of the more difficult giants i have done the trek to everest base camp via plane from lukla and talked to my fair share of mountaineers there and want nothing more than a shot at it someday it seemed like everyone was upset with how commercial and busy everest is and that some of the more hardcore mountaineers have moved on to other mountains but that just my personal anecdotal experience it obviously an extremely tough ascent but regardless it not longer considered impressive on the same level as the other 8000ers i suppose i worded my last post poorly ,2,climbing

motion_lotion,straightforward and cyborg do not belong in the same sentence i love the girl and will always watch her fight but she whines and generally just spews so much bullshit ,2,MMA
motion_lotion,i do not recall him complaining after werdum faked the takedown and knee would him to the shadow realm i do not remember him complaining after losing to stipe he been pretty straight forward in who he whines about after the shenanigans with lesnar the results for steroids were in almost a month before the fight but the ufc let him fight anyway to save the card can you really blame the guy he seems to only go after fighters who have popped for peds i cannot blame him for being upset about the inconsistent iv usage but at the same time he really needs to stop focusing on old fights and worry about the upcoming ones ,4,MMA
motion_lotion,i train my ass off and i definitely learned a lot from your writeup that i am going to try to incorporate in my game some of these techniques are difficult to follow while being an armchair fighter so i had to rewatch them a few times that gives me so much respect for how well holloway pulls this off live with split seconds to react and against aldo great analysis man do you plan on doing one for hunt vs lewis or overeem vs werdum ,1,MMA
motion_lotion,ya it definitely a distinct tam thing i have seen it from them a lot i have tried it before but i usually end up eating a knee to the head ,21,MMA
motion_lotion,i was genuinely curious as to what your reasoning was you have explained nothing any random idiot could quote the first amendment the interpretation behind it pertaining to the travel ban is the tough part i do not think you provided any proof you mostly just went on a massive strawman followed with childish trashtalk and finished by accusing an entire subreddit of supporting terrorism do you ever get into actual debates or do you just sling insults around like a petulant child you have at least one valid point i am clearly an idiot for expecting more out you ,7,uncensorednews

motion_lotion,awesome write up i noticed that too holloway kept pressuring aldo whenever it seemed like he was going to reset back to mid octagon and get into rhythm i love holloway timing it so unorthodox but awesome i was seriously worried after the 1st round that aldo had his timing and was going to finish it hard i was glad to be completely wrong on that ,5,MMA
motion_lotion,i understand aldo was giving the thumbs up but he was being hammered for minutes without responding you understand as well as i do what it feels like to get your ass beat in a ring octagon you know pride makes you do some questionable things especially when you want nothing more than to win we fight in the only sport where each loss means you actually got your ass kicked it the ref responsibility to protect us from ourselves and the other fighter you can say it was early and maybe it was but i believe the ref should be protecting the fighter from himself too you cannot eat shots like that every fight especially with what we now know about cte maybe he would have recovered most likely not i would rather fights end here where it quite obvious it was over than a few strikes later when aldo was actually fully unconscious as a fighter i feel you should understand that more i do not want to end up in a nursing home in my 50s drooling like an idiot because of unnecessary shots aldo blocked a good deal of those shots but how many got through quite a bit landed flush behind the ear the back of the head the chin etc what weight class do you fight at btw and what is your style i am looking to go professional soon but i am really enjoying amateur and even smoker fighters yes i know those are a bad idea ,1,MMA
motion_lotion,i am the same way i know what we saw but at the same time i do not necessarily think it was 100 evidence of a ghost it definitely could have been but i have been reading into infrasound and other theories and if there was any place that would have had an issue with it that was one i have talked to various professors for explanations and honestly only the infrasound one holds any water but i am always open to other theories i have even talked to various mediums and other ghost hunters but as i said before i felt like i was being scammed more than anything here some pics before we tore the place down http imgur com a cmlrx the morgue pictured here was right next to the hallway there a pic of us mid demolition and a pic before we started i removed the exif for obvious reasons at the end of the hallway pictured was a kitchen where we would see it vanish i could not find a pic of that it somewhere buried on my laptop ,3,AskReddit
motion_lotion,i would love to do something like this again i have joined some local ghost hunting groups but i felt like i was being sold snake oil tbh and just could not get into it like them i am a man of science primarily and i have a weird feeling just does not do it for me compared to seeing a floating humanoid reach into a cupboard i was too busy trying to figure out if i was having a stroke or not a good 40 people saw him her and i am still alive so i guess not if i had to describe it i would say a vaguely humanoid shape two arms neck head torso with no distinguishing features just darkness night or day there was no facial features minus a nose no fingers and where the feet should have been there was nothing it kind of glided as it walked and stood about a ft taller than me i am a tall guy the arms moved normally but what i would call legs moved wrong i do not really have the words to describe it and all of the upper body movement was correct the lower body was completely off which made me extremely uncomfortable for some reason i have other pictures of the place if you are interested the ones from the morgue came out well and i took pics as we knocked it down for good ,5,AskReddit
motion_lotion,nothing ever came up it did not matter if we used droids iphones my gf canon camera i do not know cameras well but it was a lot of money nothing ever showed up but an empty hallway i took one so called ghost hunter there and he had an evp recorder that picked up some interesting noises voices that were not there if you wanted to hear us trying to talk to it the guy seemed like a nutjob to me though i begged some of my actual professors to go but none were interested i wanted an actual man woman of science to check it out unfortunately nobody believed me ,9,AskReddit
motion_lotion,he stood on the side of it not directly in the path he tried to wave talk to it but it ignored him completely it just went straight to the cupboard as usual and vanished ,8,AskReddit
motion_lotion,back before i finished uni i worked for a demolition crew and we handled old prisons hospitals office buildings etc while destroying one psych hospital in a place called marlboro we were removing ballasts and asbestos from the ceilings before knocking the place over and a good dozen of us saw the same spirit it would walk down a short hallway turn into a kitchen then reach into a cupboard vanishing it always showed up at 3 05 and we would bring different crews over to see it like clockwork it would appear it seemed completely indifferent to anyone present one of our braver guys stood in its path and it did not react in the slightest it just kept going for said cupboard a good 3 dozen of us must have seen it before we finally tore the place down for good and it never returned i even borrowed the building keys from my boss and would bring my buddies and gf back in the middle of the night to see it whether it was 3 05 am or pm it always showed up everyone figured i was full of it until they saw the same spirit reach into the damn cupboard and vanish of course we tore down a good 20 buildings after that and did not see a single interesting thing besides random bums stealing copper but i will never forget that place as a lifelong skeptic i do not know if we all temporarily went insane or what ,32,AskReddit
motion_lotion,taking 70 shots in a row without responding is not intelligently defending yourself i have been training for 7 years and am a local amateur lhw i understand the concept of defending yourself but simply throwing on the ear muffs and hoping for max to gas is not a solid strategy many shots were landing through the gaps some were hitting the back of the head and the amount of blood pouring out of his face was impressive any other fighter would have given up which is a testament to aldo heart but eating that many shots while turtled up is not intelligently defending in fact if this was not in brazil vs one of their legends i believe bjm would have stopped it much sooner there was nothing premature about that stoppage he could have ended it sooner and only the just bleed fans would complain ,1,MMA
motion_lotion,how many unanswered shots did he eat while turtled up ,3,MMA
motion_lotion,you might be underestimating that number ,6,MMA
motion_lotion,great response you sure changed my mind in the future if you cannot contribute to the conversation like a rational adult consider not bothering at all because you look like a petulant child right now perhaps you could explain why you are so triggered maybe explain what is so awful about what i said that would lead you to only being able to proclaim fuck you i am completely open for debate and hearing why i am wrong but if that the best you can do why would you even bother ,1,worldnews
motion_lotion,claudia vs jessica andrade rose vs joanna ,1,MMA
motion_lotion,i would not either but i do not want them to run it back again so soon let rose get her chance while andrade and claudia can fight ,2,MMA
motion_lotion,from what i gathered claudia felt sort of betrayed by her team in brazil because she was always second or third focus behind the male fighters like aldo and company when she moved to the states not only did she get new training in areas she previously lacked she also had top notch coaches who made her their 1 priority she seemed to really adapt well to that and the states so maybe she felt a bit betrayed i am not really sure but that one guess ,10,MMA
motion_lotion,aldo was giving bjm the ref the thumbs up and communicating he did not want the fight stopped he made the choice himself and he the one who has to live with the consequences had he not done this the fight would have been called much sooner aldo shows no signs of brain damage yet mma is not as bad as boxing when it comes to this due to our lack of a standing count and modern medical care but there definitely a chance he will be heading that way if he keeps taking beatings like this ,1,MMA
motion_lotion,yes that actually is where i draw the line there a difference between taking a shot that could end up with a simple knockout and another vastly different shot that could lead to paralysis if you do not see the difference well it would be best if you did not comment on things you do not understand there a reason doctors would only approve of mma as long as blows to the back of the head were restricted ,6,MMA

motion_lotion,get ready for the b b b but not all muslims are terrorists argument of course not all are terrorists but there a pretty large amount who are we brought the migrants in with the best intentions here in the west and it has done nothing but stab us in the back hopefully people begin to wakeup and eventually do something about it because ignoring attacks and changing facebook profile pics after each slaughter is really getting old ,6,uncensorednews
motion_lotion,do not bother arguing with people on that guy level nothing will change their mind the rest of us will have to band together and do something about it while idiots like him put their head in the sand and whine incessantly because this is really getting old we brought the migrants and other muslims in with nothing but good intentions but it obvious it was a mistake and we are in for a rough few decades here hurr durr not all muslims of course not all muslims are terrorists nobody claims this ever the more you have in a country the more violence you have there a pretty fucking strong correlation at this point and anyone with half a brain knows what the problem is not all muslims are terrorists but the vast majority of terrorism is muslim based at least since the troubles ,29,worldnews

motion_lotion,ngannou hype train will be derailed the moment he fights someone like cain werdum stipe jds or hunt he has the physical ability but his striking def look really sloppy and beating the corpse of arlovski does not mean much these days someday he might be a champ but that wo not be for a while as he requires years of training to match his physical gifts rose has no chance against jj i do not know if this one is controversial and i am a big rose fan but she nowhere near ready for joanna she will get murdered on the feet worse than kk did i hope she keeps training and wrecks contenders until she prepared for the champ cyborg popping for winstrol is always mentioned then people claim it just a cutting steroid i have known more than my share of female gym buddies who took winny and while it may be mild for men it absolutely bulks the hell out of females while keeping them lean and dry i guarantee she has abused tons of testosterone for years as well but by no means is stanozol a weak steroid the way some comments downplay it chad mendes excuse for getting usadaed is complete bullshit ghrp 6 is never prescribed for psoriasis that like saying i took trenbolone for a sore throat some peds should be allowed i do not think fighters should be allowed to juice hard but trt should be legal as long as blood levels are around what a normal male would have something between 300 and 950 ng dl of test would allow older fighters to keep their careers going longer it would also help fighters heal more quickly so i believe they should be allowed to take hgh gh secretagogues like mk677 to recover from injuries this does not mean i believe they should be allowed to run deca eq tren in the octagon but a few peds here and there would benefit the sport if handled under doctor supervision and strictly regulated ,43,MMA

motion_lotion,lighthouses like this were constructed very slowly typically a group would go out during low tide and work on a foundation then pack up a few hours in they would return anytime between the next day and next week to continue work and gradually pour more and more concrete until a decent base was established it was extremely slow work you should read up on some of the lighthouses in the north sea iroise sea they are both extremely prone to violent weather due to the water depth and you can read in full detail how they were built this one is called la jument i believe but any of them would be a good read ,7,megalophobia

motion_lotion,500 month is not bad at all depending on how much you put down i would not mind thrashing one around for 3 years and leaving it in ruins for the next guy they will definitely get you for a lot when you turn it in a new set of tires triple the cost for every ding dent etc ,21,cars

motion_lotion,proper estrogen control is the most important aspect of keeping a stable mood on aas you are obviously going to need to learn the intricacies of aromasin arimidex or letrozole that one is only for the hardcore cycles and see which works best for you everyone differs on how much their body aromatizes test some guys are extremely sensitive others will have e2 levels of 45 on tren test cycle if your e2 spikes you will find your moods swing out of nowhere or even as a result of the stupidest triggers ie some idiot cutting you off on the road leads to blinding rage normally you would ignore that but if your e2 is out of control you better believe you are ready for a fight shouting contest at the least it difficult to control this aggression with high test and well controlled estrogen you will definitely be more assertive and quick to stand your ground but you wo not have that excessive unreasonable roidrage this does not apply if you take some compounds like halo the test aas based aggression is more reasonable the e2 based aggression is not besides pct proper ai usage is the most important part of any cycle and you definitely need bloodwork to make sure your e2 is not too high i had a client with 550 once on 500 test e week as you can guess he was ridiculous angry all the time but when we figured out his aromasin dosage he was back to his stoic peaceful self even with test levels 1800 arimidex worked as well but we had lipid issues from this compound direct message me if you have any questions regarding ai aas and i will answer them to the best of my abilities ,3,PEDs
motion_lotion,have you seen how fast the smaller guys are even the guys fighting 155 make me look slow and i am fast for my size yeah they do not hit as hard and have less grappling strength and reach but you are seriously underestimating the results of training if you think you could just casually stroll over and pick them up as for dj i do not think either of us would land a single punch while he gradually circled around constantly popping either of us it might take some time but all chins can crack eventually what martial arts have you trained man ,1,MMA
motion_lotion,i think we are at the point where it obvious neither of us is going to convince the other agree to disagree man ,2,MMA
motion_lotion,no shit there was a vid of conor drilling a counter left it not exactly rocket science think of the jds vs cain fight when jds starched cain the first time everyone was going on about jds being a potential goat and completely superior to cain remember what happened when they ran it back the next two times i am not saying aldo better than mcgregor i personally think conor is probably better but we have no way of knowing from that 13 second knockout that left many questions unanswered and a champ as dominant as aldo should have had a rematch but conor such a big draw that he gets to call his shots and aldo is not worth the risk to him ,1,MMA
motion_lotion,ok you might be able to last 20 seconds 30 if you are somewhat trained is that better ,2,MMA
motion_lotion,we are not trying to kill each other it just hard sparring there no animosity we are both just trying to improve even if he leaps and bounds ahead of me still ,2,MMA
motion_lotion,because i like a challenge and his build is almost identical to mine same height reach strength etc he enjoys hard sparring and so do i it one of the best ways for me to learn even if he kicks my ass more often than not i definitely learn more from fighting him than anyone there except maybe our one semi pro heavyweight but he hits like a mack truck if i am even just holding pads ,1,MMA
motion_lotion,we do not know if that was a fluke or if conor really is that much of a superior fighter there always a thing called a puncher chance i will give you an example my muay thai trainer is better than me in every way we have fought a few times and on one of his best days he blocked 40 of my strikes while all i landed was a teep i got lit up another fight though i knocked him down on my first right hook and easily won i wish mcgregor would rematch aldo as that would be an absolute war and we would see for all if that was a fluke or if he is just that pro many newer fans do not remember aldo 18 fight win streak against a murderer row of fws and because of that one loss his career is vastly underestimated by hordes of newer fans ,11,MMA
motion_lotion,this sub and many other sites tend to turn on fighters once they lose mma is a sport full of front runners and usually when a fighter loses we literally watch them get their ass kicked fighters lose a lot of stock each loss yair got absolutely demolished by frankie but he young and will be back stronger than ever i believe he will be a champ someday as long as he stays focused and learns to manage distance better ,3,MMA

motion_lotion,oh yeah clearly no light heavyweights ever train fight in amateur mma muay thai nothing ever happens if you think i am bad you would not even want to hear about any of our heavyweights you are absolutely delusional if you think you could beat mm in a fight if not outright retarded probably the latter he would be on top of you smashing your face in before you could even process what is happening even if i was full of shit i am still better than some random fatass who does not know the difference between you are and your and thinks he could beat a p4p great despite never stepping foot in an octagon ,2,MMA
motion_lotion,i know it good to be skeptical and question things but you are taking it a little too far ,1,Shitty_Car_Mods
motion_lotion,i am well over 6ft and 220 lbs lean i have been training for years and could give you a lobotomy without breaking a sweat i have also seen bantamweight guys beat the living fuck out of lesser skilled heavyweights dj vs some random loser on reddit who does not train would be the mismatch of the century he would choke you out or have you in a pool of your own blood in 30 sec flat to be fair he would smash me easily as well but i am not the idiot who thinks a random cheeto fingred redditor could beat one of the p4p greats ,1,MMA
motion_lotion,if you are looking for something milder try ibutamoren mk677 it a growth hormone secretagogue that helps with joints ,1,MMA
motion_lotion,i have run both but bold seemed to help my joints more deca also had nastier sides with bold you mostly just need to worry about using the right ai ,1,MMA
motion_lotion,i tore my left rotator cuff when i was younger and it has lagged behind my right for years now bjj and wrestling were awful i am fairly decent at them but i end up with random shoulder injuries here and there that require me to take a break from lifting sparring the one that i think works best for me is muay thai i can focus heavily on the clinch knees and elbows if the shoulder is hurting but i feel a lot of dedicated muay thai training really helped strengthen my shoulders i do not get injured even remotely close to how i used to but am always careful keeping them flexible and try to land on my right side when i am taken down muay thai or even kickboxing would be right up your alley if you cannot get the full punching power because of your shoulders you can still be vicious with your knees kicks and elbows ,1,MMA
motion_lotion,do not forget equipoise boldenone that stuff makes your joints feel like they are made of iron you can never go wrong with deca though unless you do not know how to handle estrogen prolactin sides ,1,MMA

motion_lotion,japan loves freakshow fights did you see gabi garcia vs a random grandma ,9,MMA
motion_lotion,eddie always has a way of turning things into a brawl and that where he wins the only fighter he did not impose this on was mcgregor which just shows how good conor is ,1,MMA
motion_lotion,go eddddddddiieeeeeee is that his wife or something i hear her in every alvarez fight and she always rapes my ears ,4,MMA
motion_lotion,ah gotcha yeah i think you are right bisping cardio is unreal and he has good defense vs everyone not named hendo if he can survive the first two possibly 3 rounds i could see him outworking yoel to a decision win i could also see yoel giving him a lobotomy in the first round as well though ,0,MMA
motion_lotion,the b b b b but conor argument is ridiculous yeah conor does what he wants do you know why it because he makes the ufc more money in one night than the last 4 5 cards combined bisping does not have that kind of star power gsp is popular but he does not move the needle like that either other fighters are not conor they do not deserve ridiculous fights and get to dodge actual competitors because they are not him and their 250 300k ppv buys do not compare to 1 2m that conor brings in it really not that complicated and i wish fighters would return to this being a sport before the ufc goes the route of boxing ,3,MMA
motion_lotion,that not even true in the slightest this sub went nuts when bisping clocked rockhold and the amount of bisping support was at an all time high when he decided to fight hendo people were confused but many seemed to accept a company man being given one freebie chance at vengeance before going back to fighting contenders people started turning on him when the gsp fight was first announced when they found out it wo not happen until fall is when a large portion of r mma turned on bisping this is coming from a bisping fan he should not have said he will fight yoel if he was just going to make excuses and stall to fight gsp ,3,MMA
motion_lotion,that would be unfair to yoel look what happened to jacare people were calling for his title fight for months especially before romero decapitated weidman but now he mostly an afterthought why should romero risk losing one when he earned a titleshot 3 times over ,1,MMA
motion_lotion,the kid is lean as fuck and well over 6 ft tall where in the fuck do you figure he a sack of lard also why would you hate on some random innocent kid just because his dad is holding up a division bisping deserves the hate not his kid ,3,MMA
motion_lotion, he not scared of romero he scared of the potential coincidences the potential consequences of fighting yoel that a pedantic argument you got there buddy i was a bisping fan and nothing made me happier than his upset vs rockhold i was on the fence about hendo but figured it was a one time deal to avenge his worst loss but now we are just getting ridiculous he should be pushing to fight yoel or at least whittaker this whole gsp idea is nonsense i would be terrified of romero too to be fair but i am also not the mw champ of the world fight a contender for once bisping i would like to root for you again ,2,MMA
motion_lotion,yeah i had something similar happen when i tried to check a leg kick i managed to check it with my dick and then disappoint my gf in bed for a week while it healed i never forget the cup now ,2,MuayThai
motion_lotion,definitely bring a cup a lot of guys go without it but you are guaranteed to take some accidental blows to the crotch whenever you get to inner leg kicks a towel for obvious reasons and a change of clothes if you do not want your car to get drenched with sweat on the ride home bring a waterbottle some gatorade and if your hands are prone to injury bring some wraps mouth guard gloves as well we usually use 16 oz but some guys use the 14 oz in sparring here ,2,MuayThai
motion_lotion,half a mil for one night of work and a training camp is not dog shit even after taxes yeah other athletes make more but for how big of a draw woodley is he definitely making a good deal of money the real fighters to worry about are the undercard guys risking their health for 10 10 or less woodley is set for life if he plays his cards right downvote me all you want but you have a very ridiculous definition of dogshit hell that 500k for one fight imagine what he racked up with the other wonderboy defense and the potential maia diaz fight ,0,MMA
motion_lotion, this sub sure has attracted a lot of airheads recently you are in no position to talk about attacking people character when you opened the argument that way there no proper debate to to be had we have both said our share you are not going to change my mind nor will i ever change yours i am just saying some random druggie is not an authority on recognizing satire nor do you have any way of knowing if this is or is not serious or not it quite possible it is but worse things have been said not in jest to be fair though yes i do enjoy attacking people character especially when given so much ammo to work with ,0,thatHappened

motion_lotion,he made 500k in his second wonderboy fight you have a very strange definition of dog shit ,0,MMA

motion_lotion,or we would rather discuss mma combat sports nobody is interested in your moral outrage ,2,MMA
motion_lotion,or they are just people who want to discuss mma instead of listening to someone whine about the word choices of a guy who gets punched in the face for a living ,3,MMA
motion_lotion,i had the same issues not retracting my hands quick enough it something that really takes time to get used to you will also get absolutely destroyed by leg kicks at first due to your balance being off even if you think it not when you look back on now from 6 months in the future you will realize how bad your balance was grats on taking the next step though keep sparring and you will eventually be the guy beating the shit out of the beginners ,2,MuayThai
motion_lotion,today i learned choking someone is not effective fighting do you also boo when fights go on the ground or only when the spanish fighters are losing ,1,MMA
motion_lotion,ok so you basically have no idea how the sport works then i got it ,1,MMA
motion_lotion, but anyone who disagrees with some random druggie 30 seconds browsing your comment history i think you are confused not in the least bit a 2nd grader could figure out what your point is i just think it ridiculous you can be that certain on something that is clearly ambiguous ,0,thatHappened
motion_lotion,nobody has ever seriously said anything that was over the top random people never lie to impress strangers on the internet nothing ever happens you have no way of knowing this chick could be completely serious it could be a joke but anyone who disagrees with some random druggie is clearly an airhead right ,1,thatHappened
motion_lotion,are you sure you saw the same fight i did masvidal had one flurry at the end of round 1 that did not stagger maia yeah he landed some clean shots but if you turn off rogan biased commentary and actually watch it you will see maia was fine round 2 masvidal landed some kicks and won but where exactly do you think he won round 3 maia 1 3 masvidal 2,0,MMA
motion_lotion,most threads i do not see that you better believe there always at least one guy who thinks nothing ever happens and everything is a joke as if nobody has ever posted ridiculous fantasies that clearly never happened every single post on this sub has at least one baseless atire accusation ,1,thatHappened
motion_lotion,there always has to be at least one guy claiming it a joke or satire you have no way of knowing and plenty of redditors have told stores that clearly never happened in complete seriousness ,1,thatHappened
motion_lotion, you have not made an argument at all you are projecting there i have made multiple arguments you just ignore them then go with childish trash talk because you cannot counter them as i have said before you have got nothing and we both know it i resort to the same trash talk when dealing with someone on your level but at least i also have an actual understanding of the topic at hand nobody ever asked about your conspiracy theories of course you did not ask i was just correcting your false info mistakes if you think any of these are some wild conspiracy theory you are more naive than i thought and that saying a lot with the garbage you have posted ,2,MMA
motion_lotion, well excuse me princess relax sweetcheeks it not that serious i am just curious as to how that happens with arimidex as it not a suicidal inhibitor like aromasin and tends to only lower blood levels of e2 by 50 the 90 is spot on for asin at least you must not be very sensitive to aromatization and have fairly low levels of estrogen naturally did you have the same issues running more than 150mg test ,1,MMA
motion_lotion,i know you could not care less but if you do not even know the basics of what you are arguing your opinion is irrelevant i have not only said it i have provided an actual argument that you ignore completely only to mindlessly say b b but they found it in a boner pills and then move the goal posts i am saying you are gullible falling for something that is clearly bs but was just an excuse for jones to save face if you cannot see that or present a reasonable argument you should really just downvote and move on ,3,MMA
motion_lotion,they are not even close for most men until you are running a massive cycle on pharm letro my joints hurt more than you could imagine and getting a boner was completely out of the question on a large dose of arimidex asin all i really did was look cut dry i have tested many samples of the various ais serms for friends clients in the bodybuilding community and only once has letro been legit and actually needed it was for a buddy running tren bold anavar and dbol at the same time who was already extremely estrogen sensitive at least we agree on the one thing about jones though eh maybe you have more reliable sources than i have seen but i still believe actual letro is hard to come by ,1,MMA
motion_lotion,that changes everything there a difference between a tainted supplement and some guy popping for drugs that are used to cycle off of anabolic steroids there a difference between someone treating their psoriasis and someone using it as an excuse to take ghrp 6 one is an athlete making a mistake the other is a willing cheater trying to game the system if you do not understand what i am going on about maybe it would be best to not comment on things you do not understand as i said before it quite a surprise to find both of those in a boner pill and i gave my reasoning why then gave you another example of mendes gaming the usada as well this is the part where you explain why i am wrong or admit you do not know anything about the topic ,6,MMA
motion_lotion,i did not realize 20 month was unattainable for someone making minimum wage as i said before i had a storage facility while i was a broke college kid making even less than that there absolutely nothing preventing an athlete from having one in the event that they take multiple shady supplements for years it really not that hard to throw them in a closet to cover your ass ,0,MMA
motion_lotion,90 of the time i test chinese made letrozole it another highly dosed aromasin or arimidex real letro is fairly pricey and unlikey to be in a boner pill and most of the chinese sources sell fake after fake the only substance that is faked more often would probably be boldenone eq a world class athelete with access to pharmaceutical grade drugs who was trying to pct absolutely would be just the person to pop for that along with clomid you seem to know a decent amount about ais and pct but do you seriously believe that jones accidentally popped for both of those drugs due to a boner pill ,0,MMA
motion_lotion,yeah but i was more asking for you to explain why an expensive women breast cancer drug that causes erectile dysfunction in men was found in a boner pill i am really curious as to your reasoning i am aware of the excuse jones gave and it makes about as much sense as mendes taking ghrp 6 for psoriasis likewise why would a one time deal cause letrozole levels that were elevated enough for him to pop after the one pill that without even getting into why clomiphene was in there as well ,1,MMA
motion_lotion, how long are you keeping them however long the usada statute of limitations is if they can test for up to 8 years later you better believe i will be holding onto them for that duration it really not that difficult to throw random things in a storage unit then clear it out once or twice a year i do the same thing with documents and various equipment from my career i do not see why fighters cannot do the same how long are you keeping them is a fighter who gets into the game young like sage northcutt just going to have a small complex somewhere in the nevada desert by the time he is chuck liddell age do you not know what a storage unit is even when i was a broke college kid i had no issues affording one you really think sage northcutt cannot throw away 20 month better yet it not that hard to just toss it in a closet garage basement if you have that option you are acting like this is some impressive feat but it really quite simple ,1,MMA
motion_lotion,you can never call something that close a blatant robbery the fight could have gone either way as it was a razor thin split decision a robbery implies there was a clear cut winner there was not masvidal did a little damage at the end of round 1 with 15 seconds left but at no point was maia staggered or wobbly on his feet after masivdal had spent 4 minutes barely surviving multiple rnc attempts the 2nd round masvidal clearly won with his body shots and solid kicks but once again maia was nowhere near finished and the damage was not anything to write home about the 3rd maia controlled completely and i do not see how you could give that to masvidal under the old rules masvidal had more damage but i believe rogan hyped it up more than maia was hurt maia was also much closer to a finish but it easily could have gone either way i think they made the right call but would not be shocked if masvidal won under the new rules ,1,MMA
motion_lotion,alright then i guess you do not really know much about pharmaceuticals and the supplement industry do you even know what those two drugs are used for and why they are highly unlikely to be in some guy gat supplement random dickpill especially letrozole seeing as how we use that at my hospital for treating women with breast cancer right now and pay out the ass for it ,3,MMA
motion_lotion,i do not believe she worded it that way ariel really twisted her words in the title to make it seem more dramatic ,2,MMA
motion_lotion,rose is much tougher than you give her credit for jj is going to win decisively but do not expect even for a minute that rose will quit ,1,MMA
motion_lotion,i feel like both clomid and letrozole in the same cheap supplement would be quite the surprise would not it what about ibutamoren ,4,MMA
motion_lotion,for a professional fighter whose career can be ruined over these things i fail to see the insanity is it really that hard to throw a bunch of used containers in a closet or storage facility in case you ever need to defend yourself it sounds like a pain in the ass but where the insanity ,2,MMA
motion_lotion,that one of the more ridiculous things i have read in a while maia fought i am possibly the worst title fight in ufc history against anderson silva granted a lot of it was anderson fault for refusing to engage but if the ufc had any interest in him as a champ he would have had a title attempt a few fights ago they definitely wanted masvidal to win and i would say the same about condit there definitely a striker bias since some fans consider bjj boring ,1,MMA

motion_lotion,i cannot argue that maia vs anderson was the worst titleshot i have ever seen remember dana giving the belt to anderson trainer because he was too embarrassed to award it himself after that shameful display it a tough decision to make because they do not want a boring ww titlefight but at the same time wonderboy vs woodley 2 was one of the worst i have ever seen with woodley tdd and striking i do not see him vs maia being a snoozefest the way a counterpuncher like anderson vs maia was ,5,MMA
motion_lotion,an act of desperation he was not even looking at silva he was looking at the ref and gesturing towards the mouthpiece if he had focused on the fight instead of the mouthpiece he would have blocked or dodged the flying knee easily it was a bad call by bisping but i do not see the desperation at all ,2,MMA
motion_lotion,do you also think his decision was affected by bisping clearly dropping his guard and motioning to herb about the mouthpiece that was clearly a mistake from bisping but it obvious that flying knee would not have hit if it was not for that obvious miscommunication i do not think he wanted to end it like that 5 sec before the bell if bisping had just said forget the mouthguard and actually paid attention we would not be having this argument eh ,1,MMA

motion_lotion,everything is satire nothing ever happens there absolutely no way a cocky teenager would consider his iq ridiculously high due to video games ,2,iamverysmart
motion_lotion,no maia was going for the rnc constantly but masvidal is a fucking beast with amazing cardio grip strength who was able to prevent him from sinking the choke that finished condit in 2 minutes this is less about maia being mediocre at finishing and more a compliment of masvidal amazing tdd and sub defense masvidal is definitely the real deal i do not see how that takes away anything from maia ,14,MMA
motion_lotion,chill with the psych 101 who hurt you passive aggressive insult you do not have to be hurt to think that prankers should be able to handle the consequences of their actions as i said your argument about intent instead of results is invalid regardless of the prank if you cannot handle people getting upset or not taking the prank well you should not be doing this in the first place ,49,AskReddit
motion_lotion,with female combat sports you have to grade on a curve we are a sexually dimorphic species so they will never have the speed power the men do but compared to the other women jj is light years ahead the only gal who can compete is gadelhia and she has a lot of cardio striking def to work on ,3,MMA
motion_lotion,i do not get people complaining about maia i am more of a muay thai guy but i love watching him fight if the ground game bjj bores people so much why do not they just watch glory kick boxing as it nothing but standup an mma fighter should not be penalized because he good at only one aspect of the game ,33,MMA
motion_lotion,i train with heavyweights even though i am a middleweight the amount of power a 6 4 240 lb guy puts out is insane sometimes a fully blocked hw punch hurts just as much as a landed punch from a smaller guy due to your arms being plowed into your face at that size one mistake and it lights out at welterweight mw there significantly more breathing room imo ,13,MMA
motion_lotion,their intention is irrelevant the results are what matters even if an airhorn prank for example is done in jest hearing damage does not care if you were just playing a prank bro my dad had one in his truck and used to mess with people with it it significantly louder than you are expecting and your ears will be ringing for hours if you are close to it i would not be the slightest bit shocked if it could cause permanent damage you should understand why people get angry when confronted with something like that especially when they are already working a horrible job for shit pay like a drive thru cashier they have every right to get angry and the douchebags err prankers should be ready to handle the consequences of their actions i wanted to rip that damn thing out of his truck every day ,44,AskReddit

motion_lotion,i have met plenty of amazing cops i have also had extremely negative experiences with cops while doing absolutely nothing wrong besides driving to my nightshift job the amount of times i get harassed far outweighs the positives the only time i have ever needed the police was after a car accident got hit by a drunk driver and the entire time the cop was screaming in my face were you speeding son many cops are regular people i am sure the majority are great people even that does not change the fact that nothing happens to the bad cops who abuse their power i would wager the majority of people feel nervous as opposed to safe in the presence of the police ,10,Showerthoughts

motion_lotion,i am not pretending to have any knowledge all the info i claim is sourced from the endocrinologist at the hospital i work for for personal reasons i have consulted him numerous times during my own anabolic adventures and for helping patients anyway to sum it up though the two drugs jones popped for are used for a few reasons letrozole is mostly for anti cancer in women none of which are even remotely close to what you mentioned we give clomid to men for fertility issues and to aid those who are coming off of various steroids clomid increases lh prouction aka lutenizing hormone you can explain how that not a hormone if you would like but it would be easier if you just admitted you do not know what you are talking about lh along with fsh another hormone then tells the body to restart natural testosterone production after being suppressed during a steroid cycle that 95 of what we use it for sometimes it aids men who have natural hypogonadism but i have not seen that frequently letro is much worse and harder to explain it reduces estrogen by a huge amount something like 98 in men we give this to women to combat breast cancer but some men use it for heavy steroid cycles to combat the side effects of excess estrogen aromitization it very critical for ending a steroid cycle to avoid side effects like bitch tits water retention temper problems etc you can explain how i am wrong or how these drugs are in any way related to baldness liver issues i would actually really be interested in you attempting to argue it because we both know it would be bullshit ,1,MMA

motion_lotion,he popped for clomid and letrozole the letro is even more suspicious ,3,bjj
motion_lotion,sure clomid is used for a few things but in men it either for fertility or to increase lh production lh or lutenizing hormone is responsible for triggering your body to produce natural testosterone this is very useful for men with naturally low test one look at jones will tell you he does not fall into this category or coming off of a cycle of steroids the rationale being that steroids suppress your natural test production and clomid starts it back up again it very indicative of a recent cycle letro is a little different but used together with clomid as an estrogen blocker like aromasin arimidex but a stronger version letrozole is normally a drug for women with breast cancer as blocking estrogen in the breasts is often a large part of the treatment hence the expensive cost compared to other drugs even clomid anyway since testosterone and other steroids aromatize into estrogen one of the most important parts of running or closing out a cycle is blocking excess estrogen lest you get bitch tits moody acne and very aggressive letrozole is difficult to get but is essential for high powered cycles with heavily aromatizing compounds and is very useful for coming off of a cycle the one time it bad is for men not cycling anything it drops estrogen too low not on issue on gear which leads to erectile dysfunction mood disorders extreme joint pain and poor athletic performance between that and the price there no way it was in some random supplement or dickpill ,1,bjj

motion_lotion,he 9 1 and his only loss was a close decision to an opponent who popped for ibutamoren that a pretty solid argument for a titleshot right there ,2,MMA
motion_lotion,the dude would be 10 1 with his only loss being a controversial split decision to someone who popped for ibutamoren he deserves a titleshot there nothing left to prove and having to face a killer like rockhold would be completely unfair to him he was already willing to fight him but if he loses he will never see a titleshot that frankly he should have had 2 fights ago ,5,MMA
motion_lotion,no you cannot call him guilty for that but you can call him guilty for failing a drug test for mk677 that is an expensive and new growth hormone secretagogue that would in no way be present in a cheap supplement this is just as reasonable as jones having a substance that kills boners estrogen in a substance that supposedly was being used to help ed it not the end of the world that he got caught using mini hgh but if you truly think that was accidentally in a supplement i have a bridge to sell you ,19,MMA

motion_lotion,it absolutely speculation we cannot exactly have a peer reviewed doubleblind survey and investigation into why it happened but it still an interesting convo i have only rolled for two years but even i could see that chael made mistakes even a 2 month experience novice would not make something was clearly off it possible he cracked mentally it possible it was fixed it possible he just choked we cannot be 100 certain but that does not mean it does not warrant discussion ,2,MMA
motion_lotion,i agree completely i have rewatched it many times without audio and while it was a solid punch i think khabib was not that hurt his legs were clearly still under him he was still tracking johnson the entire time he was back to pressuring right after this is definitely a case of rogan exaggerating a hit just like in mcgregor vs diaz 2 when nate had his first flurry up against the fence conor dodged blocked every shot and maybe 1 landed clean but organ casted it like the fight was over ,2,MMA

motion_lotion,where did i say rda out muscles his opponents i am not saying all pressure fighters rely on brute force to out muscle their opponent i just said cyborg specifically does which makes your rda counter point completely irrelevant cyborg relies on brute force with her aggression she not crisp she not precise she just happens to hit like a freight train which is pretty damn effective for her you could argue against that but i do not think many analysts will agree with you ,9,MMA

motion_lotion,but holm is cautious and very quick on her feet she picks women apart and avoids the clinch nunes swarms with pressure which leads her right into the clinch all it takes from there is ronda usual judo toss into armbar she packs a lot more heat than holly but they are two very different fighters ,3,MMA

motion_lotion,i hate when people create false narratives then argue against it like they are being controversial during the fight i remember everyone complaining about silva after the fight i remember everyone complaining about silva years later and still everyone blames it on silva i dont know anyone who blamed maia for that shitfest it weird pretending there an argument when we are all on the same side of the circlejerk ,70,MMA

motion_lotion,maia no spring chicken one loss at this point in his career and he may never see a titleshot he worked for this long enough there no reason to do anything but wait at age 39 ,5,MMA

motion_lotion,one of my best friends growing up was a dealer he would put advertisements like this on craigslist a good example would be selling a worthless poster for a stupid amount of money but in the description it would say nice star wars poster little bit of mold though with mold being a codeword for magic mushrooms in our area every area seems to have its own codewords slang but this is a very common move sometimes posts would not even be a code they would have some obscure item nobody in the right mind would buy just like this as a way to sling drugs like snickers bars for a certain price would be 8balls of coke green beans would be weed etc ,18,delusionalcraigslist
motion_lotion,yup nate is so awful with words that it almost eloquent in a way like a movie that so bad it becomes good ,0,MMA
motion_lotion,no that ignores the reality of cyborg weight training every year she seems to tack on a few more pounds while the competition stays right at bantamweight first she was 160 then she was 165 in the last fight vs lansberg she was 175 in the octagon she simply carries too much muscle mass speculate on steroids all you want compared to similar females she should lose a small amount of the bulk which would still give her a massive power and size advantage but would put her in the range of more fighters her weight cut is only so brutal because she makes it that way i do not think she has any intentions of fighting without a massive size advantage ,13,MMA

motion_lotion,she almost died because she only fights if she has a 30 lb advantage over her opponents if she would shred a little muscle weight would not be an issue for her first she was walking at 165 then 170 against lansberg she claimed to be 175 she should just drop the weight and fight like everyone else once she out of the usada testing pool she can gabi garcia herself back up to whatever strength she wants ,21,MMA

motion_lotion,how old are you ,0,Justrolledintotheshop
motion_lotion,you are definitely living in the past here a lot of this was true in the strikeforce days but is no longer relevant firstly they were scheduled to fight twice one time cyborg popped for roids the other time she backed out since then ronda moved down to 135 and has fought how many times she defended her title 6 times at 135 let that sink in in a volatile division ronda has found her ideal weight and based all her training around it meanwhile cyborg constantly moved up and up in weight she used to walk around 155 then it was 160 then it was 170 according to lansberg she was 175 in the octagon last fight she loves having a strength advantage over her opponents then bitching about having a rough weight cut she has about the same frame as holly holm who is a big bw but still makes 135 she just does not want to give up her muscle gains i cannot blame her but at the same time it hypocritical to call out women 30 lbs smaller than you especially when you consider what role steroids may have played in her bulking up ,1,MMA
motion_lotion,yes many male fws walk around 165 to 170 and still make 145 easily some struggle to make 140 yet others have made bantamweight there no reason she cannot make even 135 but it would entail losing a bit of muscle mass which she is vehemently against ,2,MMA
motion_lotion,it has nothing to do with gender it all about her complaining and calling out women 30 lbs lighter than her reem popped for roids and has since lost some mass but imaging if he stayed ubereem whilst also calling out middleweights he then finally gets offered two catchweight then surprisingly cannot make weight after running his mouth for years i was a cyborg fan for a while but i cannot stand her anymore she refuses to fight anyone unless she has a massive size advantage then refuses to talk about anything but her weight cut ,2,MMA
motion_lotion,i have drawn blood thousands of times and have not once seen that i can ask around at work tomorrow but even the worst hyper coagulation i have experienced bodybuilding patient who is a heavy roid user was not like she described ,2,MMA
motion_lotion,disliking someone who is whiny and entitled is oh so creepy good job dude you sure showed him ,1,MMA
motion_lotion,and how long has it been since she fought at that weight if she walks around at 140ish these days and cyborg walks around in the 170s surely you can see the size discrepancy ,5,MMA

motion_lotion,his last opponent popped for pct drugs you cannot pin that on him ,3,MMA
motion_lotion,i hate this so much my buddy while watching browne and werdum grapple kept yelling just get up dumbass i told him it not that easy with a 6 4 bjj blackbelt on your ass to which he bragged about the time he shrugged off a 140 lb manlet it blows my mind how annoying casuals can be when discussing mma ,4,MMA
motion_lotion,ya you are probably right it makes me sad dj is not more of a draw he such an exciting fighter ,1,MMA
motion_lotion,yeah they all walk around above 145 but that irrelevant because every single fighter minus some hws on the roster walks around above their weightclass cyborg walks around at 170 whereas most bws are 150 or so she a huge fw a normal bantam weight would absolutely have to bulk the fuck up to be around her size and unfortunately that not too easy for women to do naturally ,2,MMA
motion_lotion,yeah she did one good fight night card in brazil they can still have her crush a random can here and there to fire up the brazilian market how would adding a 145 division around that help them financially if it did the ufc would have done so long ago ,2,MMA
motion_lotion,because most women have a hard time getting big enough for fw without doping cyborg roided the fuck up and got an awesome physique but not many women want to do that i cannot blame them why should they bulk the fuck up just to fight cyborg when all the competition is at 135 there no reason cyborg cannot lose some weight then bulk back up once she out of the usada testing pool but she clearly relies too much on a size advantage to do that ,4,MMA
