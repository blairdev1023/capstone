farleymfmarley,the issue lies in the diversity no matter what unless the entire human species is placed under one strict government think hardcore dictatorship meets futurama style planetary government there going to be differences in the way everything is learned and taught what we find acceptable here where i live in the us may be considered as bad as murder somewhere else in the world and that goes both ways the governments of the world have their own goals and beliefs and while for the most part we as humans can agree on shit there too many differences the way we are educated here is different than there or there and so on for example when i was growing up and was learning about say ww2 america was made out as badass 01 kicking the door down and saying heard you fellas need help to the allies before gunning down the axis powers with a tommy gun while lighting a cigar and getting a blowjob however i was taught that way because i am an american and i was learning that from the american education system the way that was taught in germany italy japan england canada and every other country is different with different emphasis on different aspects therefore in my mind i am supposed to have this patriotism like murica fuck yeah fuck everyone else this is hamburgers and m16 country bitch and this is presumably how it works everywhere else in the world as long as it works this way people are gonna become radically patriotic or religious because that the way they are taught and that gonna continue along with terrorism racism and the belittling of others simply because they are different and hail from another land ,2,news

farleymfmarley,1 try to avoid snorting addy in general if you do snort them only snort the pellets from xr idk if it the same exact way with ir and xr but snorting ir had me spending about 3 days in a blur that felt like less than a day had passed and i was feeling drugged out and completely out of it the whole time because i was railing lines of crushed ir tablets and then popping a couple more ir tablets i barely slept the whole time and i felt like i was literally dying for a week or two after 2 every time i take adderall it works for me provided i take a high enough dose but i am used to taking 90mg ir 1 3 times a day because i stupidly kept upping my dose because i felt it was not working as well i cannot explain why it works on off for you but do not try to keep upping your dosage you will just build a tolerance and waste a ton of pills stims are confusing man and they affect everyone a little different if you are taking a low dose a cup or two of coffee is said to potentiate the effects and i can somewhat confirm this it may have been placebo but i felt better for longer when i drank coffee after dosing 30mg if it really comes down to it man and you just are not getting much use from stims well that why god gave us pot ,6,Stims

farleymfmarley,i could not really tell you but in my opinion and what several youtubers who have spoken on the subject also believe is it more that youtube is trying to gain more advertisers as in more companies and businesses paying for ad space it seems like they are trying to make the site seem as family kid friendly as possible so more people are willing to contact them to buy advertising space it would not really be that hard to have certain ads only play on non age restricted videos and the rest play on both restricted and unrestricted videos they would make a lot more money that way and they would keep their viewers and content creators happy,3,Drugs

farleymfmarley,not in a weird way but that makes me glad i have just gotten out of having to deal with the back and forth ya know turning 18 and all that lol but seriously that good to hear that your kid has parents who can get along and take good of their kid while still making sure the child gets to spend time with both parents it the worst thing when the parents fight over you and get into stupid huge arguments about what they think is best for you gotta put any negative feelings towards the other parent to the side and focus on the kids wellbeing first i am jealous the last girl i dated who played video games anywhere near as much as i did just asked to borrow games or for me to download games from my account to her console or to borrow my mic she was a stupid cunt to be honest and now she has two games to play on a 360 while i have 30 something games on my xbox one and like 70 on my 360 ,4,gaming

farleymfmarley,nah man they will expel you for that shit in the school district from my home town and i have heard read been told by a multitude of people students teachers staff and parents the rules and how the staff treats these issues is almost exactly the same in the majority of school districts in my state maybe that just this state but i feel it probably more a nationwide thing any of the schools would suspend you for 10 days with recommended expulsion if you were caught drawing anything that could be considered related to drugs or drug use at the middle high school at least they would send you to the in school suspension room have you call your parent s off the phone in there and have them bring you a new bag for something like this they would also probably confiscate the bag never return it you would have a talk with the school safety officer member of the local pd who job is mostly sitting in his office at the school did not do jack shit but was a chill dude always brought a box of donuts for the other staff in the office your locker would be searched if they were really on edge that day oh boy here comes the lockdown drill and then the drug dogs sniffing each and every locker bathroom and classroom in the school the school i went to had a very strict dress code while they did not say you could not have piercings colored hair that sort of thing i noticed a lot of teachers and staff making really harsh and negative comments about the styles kids had these days whenever a student like that was in earshot there are also a lot of schools both public private that wo not allow students those kinds of freedoms to have unnaturally dyed colored hair or any piercings besides the ears and in some places they cannot even have ear piercings the modern day american education system is a pitiful and poor excuse of a joke that treats their students like shit while a non drug using student could draw something like this on their bag it gonna be assumed that because the design is similar to something a drug user would draw that the student in question is 1 a drug user in this case specifically psychedelics 2 they probably have drugs on them or in their locker because drug users are stupid and bring drugs onto school property for fun 3 enough of a risk to be suspended from school because kicking them out 1 10 days for art is really helping their education and have drug dogs called in their locker and possessions searched they find nothing and suspend the student anyways and nobody who in a position to do anything the students have 0 power to affect how their school is run we tried at my high school the two years i was there before i transferred to an online school i am sorry for typing so much and leaving you so much to read but after reading your comment i felt the need to inform you that the worst they can do is send you to a counselor is by far very very wrong i am sorry that you believe that how things go these days but the way america runs its schools today is flatout awful and a huge part of why a lot of today youth are uneducated overworked swimming in a cesspool of stress related mental disorders and why it become much more common place for there to be a news story about a bullied teenager or whatever could not handle the pressure anymore and offed themselves than it has ever been before tl dr dude i am replying to said the worst schools will do is send you to a counselor for some pretty basic things that are not harming anyone when schools will punish students for those things or refuse to allow them to be a part of their school until they change those things to fit their standards as a senior in high school i had to say something to correct them ,3,LSD

farleymfmarley,what i am saying bruh i am mostly smoking with close friends and one of them always gets me back when he gets paid if he cannot just match me 1 4 blunts with his own bud money but there a couple close friends i am gonna have to and some i even already have cut off from my smoke sesh because i felt they were only showing up to use me and the 1 2 other people who threw in for our weed it okay if sometimes you cannot match me i will still smoke you out if we are cool and i know you will come by with at least 2gs and smoke me out after you have been paid to get me back but these motherfuckers smoking on my fucking weed almost daily and never throwing in for more or even 1 3 dollars to replace the rellos they smoked with me are really starting to piss me off man lmao,1,ArtOfRolling
farleymfmarley,if that so let me ask you you one of the guys who buys extra bud with their normal sack and smoke the extra they bought or are you one of the guys who dips into their sack they are selling from and roll a blunt or pack a bowl every so often while they are waiting for people to come pick up the sack or hit you up to get some a friend swim is sort of interested in distributing 2 3 oz a week swim lives in a place where under 100 grams is a misdemeanor possession charge with 0 risk of jail time a max like 2 300 fine and while swim is a smoker they are not sure if they should damage their profit and lose 40 50 off every oz or if they should just save some of the profit and buy a big bag to smoke on until they have flipped the rest of their bud and made enough money to buy another big bag with their normal amount ,3,DrugStashes
farleymfmarley,i am sure i have had them and do not remember but i do not think i have ever bought those before where are you from i am in ohio so northeastern us and i am really not sure what brands besides swishers white owls and backwoods are a nationwide or at least multistate brand ,1,DrugStashes

farleymfmarley,is there a notable difference in taste burn time flex bendability while rolling compared to hemp papers ,1,DrugStashes
farleymfmarley,element never heard of those i roll backwoods as a special occasion sometimes the occasion is just me celebrating the fact i am a living breathing person blessed enough to be in a position in life to be able to roll a backwoods my standard blunts are usually white owl white peaches blueberry zigzag wraps original flavor or like strawberry mango swishers and if i am getting one of those cheap more than 2 rellos per dollar pack brands i will typically get like showtimes usually blue palma flavored ,2,DrugStashes
farleymfmarley,idk how to do currency conversions and i am too lit and preoccupied rn to really do the math via google but i pay 25 for about an eighth give or take 5 so sometime i will get an even 3 grams or i will get an even 4 anywhere in between you ever come to the us and find me here ya boy farley marley i will hook you up big time give you an oz for like 200 most people i know spend 220 260 some people even spend 280 in us dollars for an oz and it blows my mind people pay that much ,1,DrugStashes
farleymfmarley,i will have to look into that personally i am no longer a fan of raws the dude who founded and owns raws is a dickhead and hit the popular stoner rapper and taylor gang member berner with a lawsuit or some shit because berner was endorsing raws in his music and publicity pictures for instagram and all that and berner decided to start his own papers line like wiz khalifa did the dude who owns raws flipped out and did a bunch of bitch shit and taylor gang said fuck you and imma have to side w the rappers who make up the majority of my smoking playlist lmao but i will use raws if i cannot find another all natural hemp paper in the correct length by burn so good do you mean like it burns slower and lasts longer or it burns more evenly or what man ,3,DrugStashes
farleymfmarley,backwoods are 100 natural tobacco leaf the taste the smell and especially the price show for it they were hard to roll to me because you have to kinda moisten the tighter end of the blunt after following the line of the wrap you need to loosen from itself to unroll and rolling them up takes the exact right level of moisture and dryness equally throughout the leaf to roll it correctly and not either have it too loose and have bud getting in your mouth and falling out having it burn up too quickly or too tight and it hard to get a good hit out of and you end up having to twist and roll it to knock bud out and loosen it up and then it loose in some places and tight in others i learned how to roll blunts from watching friends roll and just trying it i was able to roll joints for like two years before i could roll a blunt and that helped greatly but i recommend anyone trying to learn to roll a backwoods should find a video tutorial on youtube or whatever there videos on rolling in general and rolling larger backwoods like mine was just find the right video for what you are trying to do and save hours of practice and countless wasted tobacco leaves ,2,DrugStashes
farleymfmarley,yes sir to be honest i would smoke with each and every one of you in all the drug and weed specific subreddits we would all come together and roll multiple pounds into a giant blunt or joint and smoke together ,1,DrugStashes
farleymfmarley,idk why you got downvoted dawg i love backwoods and the actual smoking of the blunt but goddamn it the roaches are such a pain in the ass i prefer throwing a roach into a bong or my one hitter and smoking it down like that rello and all but backwoods since i only roll them fat are damn near impossible to smoke without breaking open and it annoying as hell to load 2 3 bowls to smoke the bud rather than just throwing it all together into the bong and taking fat rips for a half hour with a friend or two ,3,DrugStashes
farleymfmarley,i do that if ive got a fresh sack of bud i am too impatient to save up enough spare cash to buy large quantities of bud so i will spend 20 60 on bud every day to twice a week depending on how much money i have got to spare so there days when i have no bud left i will check my little trapbox i keep stuff in when i am mobile out and about if you do not know the slang and i will always have some loose ground up bud in there or in the grinder and i throw roaches in there a couple times i have been lucky and had so many fat roaches i was able to roll about 2 8g blunts other times i have had two or three stingers i mashed into a ball and threw in the bowl with some resin and tiny ass nugs and had to sit there taking a few hits every so often just to keep a shitty weak buzz all day it sad to say but i really hate going a day sober i can wait til 9 10 at night to smoke for the first time that day but the whole day without any bud i am irritated and rude to everyone lmao,1,trees

farleymfmarley,all in all still have a fat roach left about a half hour this is me and two other people they were taking two hits and passing it they are lightweight and do not smoke nearly as much as i do because they have self control and i was taking 7 8 hits and passing it tasted amazing and thick clouds of smoke on the exhale 10 10 would do it again ,11,ArtOfRolling

farleymfmarley,never did oxys and addies together they are both opiates and as far as i am aware there is no adverse interactions between them the only thing i would keep an eye on is dosing more than you should painkillers typically come with the generic tylenol mixed in which is one of the biggest causes for overdose death in the us so do not take a whole lot google the numbers and letter on the pill see the dosage probably take no more than 1g of the tylenol and 20mg of the oxys do not over do it because the effects are not as strong that the stimulant ,1,Drugs
farleymfmarley,try harder you are just trading one addiction for another bro i was your age popping kpins snorting addies smoking weed and drinking in 20 minutes time every day it not worth it ,1,Drugs
farleymfmarley,do not use any mind altering substance to kick an addiction you will just get hooked on the next thing weed is not physically addictive but it really hard to quit you get bored with life and can have trouble with sleeping and eating as well as get anxiety just kick the opiates bro shit is dumb you are too young for that shit ,1,Drugs
farleymfmarley,no opiates adderall do not really interact although taking opiates while on any sort of speed is pointless as you wo not really feel them i take about 15 25mg of hydrocodone if i am having a bad crash off 90 120mg adderall ,1,Drugs

farleymfmarley,amphetamine salts are a very addictive and somewhat dangerous substance to abuse and i have suffered the withdrawals and it many symptoms from fatigue to extreme depression more than once but it never occurred to me that caffeine while not recommended in most circumstances would probably help me lower my dosage so that i have an easier time quitting after i graduate lmao my first time on addies was in 7th grade with 60x5mg ir i wanna say tablets but i may be wrong and i was supposed to take one before and one after school and those worked fine maybe a little too well and i do not recall any withdrawal symptoms happening after i quit during summer break every time since then has been getting them from someone else last time i used addies quit i started popping and later on snorting a 5mg before school when i kicked those i had some fatigue and irritability but other than that nothing major however this time around i went from 1 30mg taken orally keeping me up from 7 pm on a monday to 10 11pm tuesday night to 4 30mg crushed and snorted in 1 3 line doses throughout the day and sleeping for 2 3 hours a night now every 2 6 hours after my last dose began to wear off i get insanely irritable and angry with everything in the world as well as twitching shaking in my limbs slightly and a very strong craving for more i may begin drinking a coke or two with every redosing to help me out thanks for the idea man ,1,Stims

farleymfmarley,man i am at a point that my tolerance is so high the effects are barely noticeable beyond not losing my focus every 20 minutes like when i do not take it upping the dose would not only make it harder to not run out and feel like shit for however long it takes to get more but also increase the side effects so the effects lasting longer would not bug me i will take one my next dose i have started forcing myself to eat more and it has made a noticeable difference but i still feel pains a little bit here and there ,1,Stims

farleymfmarley,i am by no means a seasoned battlefield player i used to play battlefield 4 on the 360 and a little bit of battlefield 3 and bad company two but i eventually i got bored and went back to cod because i was so bad trying to use arcade shooter tactics that only work on tdm or domination and even then just barely i absolutely despise the direction the cod series has taken and i find the ww1 setting very fresh this it the first battlefield game i have taken seriously and up until about a week ago i was one of those guys camping on operations only gamemode i really play enjoy although conquest has its moments with a 10x scope on the russian 1895 then i started using support and assault and loved them both i still use the scout class a lot but i usually use the gewehr 98 infantry rifle i prefer iron sights wayyyyyy more than a scope my next level up i will unlock the mondragon the only rifle i have really liked so far from the medic class is the cel rigotti optical but the small clip size gets me killed sometimes thanks for taking time to write all that out i am gonna try and be more aware when i go for a revive years of cod has drilled into my head that rushing a corner spraying is the best way to go and i am slowly learning that you cannot really do that much in this game ,1,battlefield_one
farleymfmarley,you get it man 100 i will admit sometimes my ego can get a little big but since we are all honest here i go through a lot of highs and lows with how i see myself some days i wake up and look in the mirror and see the good in myself i am not the best looking but i am decent enough i might be carrying some extra weight around i could probably stand to lose but not everyone finds thin people as attractive compared to people with some weight i do not mean some weight like you need one of those scooters at walmart to shop if you are at that point and not trying to change anything you are just not taking care of yourself and imo that the least attractive thing a person can do not care about themselves that does not mean that you should put yourself first in every situation but sometimes you should come first other times you gotta see if whatever you are dealing with is actually significantly worse than those around you that you have the choice of helping and sometimes helping people just to do it is better than any high you could get from any kind of drug ,2,Drugs
farleymfmarley,wow times flies man i did not even noticed you had replied until 7 hours later lmao i think i played that before that one of those games where there a lot of waiting late game right you buy buildings or whatever to increase your income and use the profits to buy better buildings right or am i thinking of something else ,1,Drugs
farleymfmarley,man if we ever meet my nickname is actually farley marley hence why i made it my username lmao but if you ever meet a somewhat short for a guy 5 8 ish maybe a little taller now it been awhile lmao chubby long haired bearded pothead going by farley some people mispronounce it but it said how you would think like marley but an f instead of an m ask him what grade he was in when he started growing facial hair it a thing i often tell people when asked about my beard i have had the full beard growing in since the end of 8th grade beginning of 9th and began growing chin hair and a mustache in 6th 7th grade so if this friendly overweight hair covered pothead going by farley tells you 6th 7th grade 98 chance you have found me remind me of this conversation or even mention r drugs and reddit in general and i will probably remember you i am down to smoke some herb maybe some addys or lighter opiates if that your thing i do not really like drinking but i will partake from time to time and i have never tripped on anything although i may be interested in tripping with someone who has experience and i cannot touch hard drugs i was turned off from those at an early age seeing family members struggle with addiction and abuse of shit like morphine heroin crack meth coke and some even scarier things maybe you call that bias and i know there plenty of people who are regular habitual users of hard drugs who still live a happy life making good money have a nice home with a nice car and a loving family but i just could never bring myself to try any of those things if you are serious about being down for it reply with what if anything out of what i said i would do and let me know which things you are down for always interested in meeting new people and while some drug using folk are sketchy and less than trustworthy most of us are honest hard working people with colorful backgrounds stay safe and much love man ,1,Drugs
farleymfmarley,first off thank you for such a positive comment some people seem to scroll through sub looking for others to put down or insult for no reason lmao death is a funny thing because while nobody really wants to die and a lot of people are actually terrified of death and it understandable why we as humans have come so far and figured out and solved so many complex things as a species that we as a single person find it mind blowing that somebody was able to solve such a deep and complex problem after thousands of years of just not understanding for example since i feel that someone may read this comment and not get what i mean think of that kid in high school algebra who always raised their hand always got called on and always got the right answer meanwhile you are on your 70th page in your note book of scribbles because you decided that to put it how i felt algebra is complete bullshit invented by a madman with a strong hatred for 14 year olds that kid who always knew blew your mind because they were able to solve easily what you found impossible that times a thousand is how at least i feel at some of the most complicated things humans have done considering we went from sharp rocks and foraging just to survive into the next day to having our shit so together we had the time to send a man to the moon and bring him back home the reason death is scary is not because we do not understand what it is we know what death is we know death is the cessation life as we perceive it when someone dies they no longer move or breathe or walk or talk or anything their brain shuts off and all the cells that made up that brain that in turn made of that unique person stop working and rot into nothing we are scared of what we do not know which is what comes after death i knew a guy that i was friends with for the majority of middle school and high school and we still talk from time to time he was one of it not the smartest people i have ever met he did not believe in any religion he believes that when we die that it it over and he accepted death and has said he will feel no fear when it his time personally i believe that maybe there something after but instead of wondering and trying to figure it out i am just gonna stay in the present and face death when it comes for me i am not afraid to die and i have made it clear to my close friends and family that if they wake up one day and i am gone to not worry about me because i was alright and i accepted my death and faced it with a smile at some point wether it be 5 seconds after i hit post on this comment or a billion years from now i will die and i am okay with that as long as i can die knowing i did good in the world and left a lasting impression somewhere in someway wether it statue in my honor publicizing my life work or even just my memory being passed down to the children of those who knew me memories of the good i did for people and memories of the positivity i tried to bring into the world sorry for the long response but reddit is the one place i feel like i can type out my thoughts and opinions and at the very least have someone read it you may have a negative response and if so that fine because i know that somewhere in your memory i have made an impression and if i die like i said 5 seconds after i post i will die knowing i did what i wanted to have a good morning day evening and remember to be safe you are in r drugs and i would bet its safe to assume you are a drug user like me we have never met and probably never will but your positive attitude and outlook despite losing your closest friend and seeing you and your friends drift apart as time goes on that is honestly a really painful thing to deal with if you were a close group of people and you put a little bit of that positivity into me when i read your comment so thank you ,1,Drugs
farleymfmarley,exactly i can understand someone not understanding what for example concentrates dabs wax etc is because that not really a common thing that more for the dedicated stoners who know they can handle it but just about everybody in america particularly any of those with access to the internet or just have not lived sheltered lives knows what pot is they may not know what a plant looks like or be able to say whats good or what is bad etc but if you ask them what weed is there a 95 chance they know i actually just spent about an hour both on the phone and facebook messaging my friend because he wanted me to explain to him everything i knew about concentrates he told me that one of the people he frequently smokes with my friend is a new stoner i have known him since 3rd grade we have always been close friends i was the person who got him high for the first time about two years ago and i had to teach him how to hit a bowl properly he enjoyed that experience and if we happened to run into each other i would typically have some dank rolled up in my pocket or a bowl ready to be packed he would take a few hits and be in the clouds fast forward from the last time i smoked with him in october i got dude way too high because he just kept letting the bowl get passed to him despite me telling everyone that he did not have as high a tolerance as we did and that he did not need to smoke anymore because i did not want him to green out on me he ended up laying down and trying to sleep on a public bench in front of an ice cream shop at 10pm in the freezing cold lmfao and about a month ago he texts me hey wanna smoke i have some 30 minutes later he shown me his grinder and dope ass bowl and we have smoked 4 bowls and he was wanting to pack up another i taught him how to roll joints and blunts and now he more outgoing in group smoke seshs because he feels more comfortable and less like he being judged i feel proud that i helped him go from a nervous awkward guy trying weed for the first time to an outgoing social smoker that loves being around other people and sharing his positivity with them ,1,Drugs

farleymfmarley,damn 8000 that gotta be crazy i am a well known person in my peer group 14 20 years old because that the age group that hangs out around here a couple youngins like 13 here and there that act grown but have a panic attack if they go two hours without a blunt of dirt weed and a newport menthol and 22 23 year old nobodies that love hanging around flush with cash kids that wanna try every drug under the sun people who i swear i have never met say hello to me on the street or show up at a smoke sesh or something i am at and sit by me talking to me and i gotta pull the ol sorry what is your name again but goddamn 8000 people that very few nearly a 4th of the amount here lmao but man i feel it i love my friends my real friends not those friends you see when you see or hang out with once a month or less i tell my people i love em everyday and remind them to be safe because it real hard losing somebody close to you i actually have a funeral on saturday for a friend that got killed a week ago and i am not even sure i am gonna be able to handle it without breaking down in front of everybody i love these people with everything in my heart and soul and i realized that after going through some grieving and some drugs i used to be a real bad person with trust issues and anxiety and i was known to use and hurt people and just brush it off i changed after some hard times and ive made up as much as possible to the people i hurt but sometimes my anger cannot be handled and i am a dick everyone is like that tho luckily there one or two people who feel what i am saying when i am vibing out and talking about something deep that for whatever reason i find important or conversation worthy ,1,Drugs

farleymfmarley,that the federal governments own fault if trump was as intelligent as he and others claim he is he would get legalization of marijuana at the federal level and start taxing everything within a couple years the government would be able to pay off like a 6th of our national debt but instead these stupid fucking games are played by the politicians because their stupidity is growing every day kill off the people addicted to the prescription pills by letting them od and get paid by pharmaceutical companies or start taxing the potheads who will spend the next 60 years smoking either illegally with nothing gained by the government or legally with a big fat pile of cash stacking up from the taxes well let just have more people od on insanely expensive pills and put all the potheads in jail that will solve our problems ,3,Drugs

farleymfmarley,i mean meth is illegal but people do it anyways i think in sweden or something like that there a place you can go to that you can safely do drugs as in you can bring your heroin or crack or 30 xanax and take them in a comfortable place with on hand staff that are nurses and doctors who if god forbid you od or have something go wrong can treat you instantly supposedly once those kind of places became a thing death by overdose in places with them went down considerably but the government will do what it does and the people will remain divided on the stupid shit that will happen regardless of a law saying you can or cannot ,8,TwoXChromosomes

farleymfmarley,i myself am biased against heroin because i have seen how it can destroy people lives but i do not judge anyone for using it unless they have a problem by problem i mean like the two heroin addicts in my city who broke into an old man like 80 beat him repeatedly beat him some more because he did not have any cash on hand for them to take then ransacked and robbed his home so they could sell shit to get a fix he managed to escape and go to a neighbors house and call the police but the two who did that were never caught ,5,Drugs
farleymfmarley,log spikes can be upgraded and generally are better as a long term defense because once they are upgraded they will last awhile before needed to be repaired replaced and i believe they do damage but to get them made is like 30 wood per spike while i believe it 30 iron to upgrade fully the wood spike traps cannot be upgraded can be repaired and cost like 5 wood but unless you make sure to repair them frequently you will have to replace them a lot and a horde could probably break them all down pretty quick ,2,7daystodie

farleymfmarley,that goes both ways man who the hell are you to say i got the season pass for infinite warfare too i am not gonna bitch about 10 for four extra maps i remember when 4 mp and a zombies map was like 20 or some shit on black ops 1 i still bought em i do not think i should get free content for a game i did not buy a season pass for that is not what i paid for developers do their job they are giving us six maps and winter crash for free is not that good enough for you no someone feeling entitled today you would probably be pissed if you worked your ass off to remake maps you did not have to and then had people thinking because they paid for a season pass for another game they should not have to pay for your shit on your game ,-1,CODModernWarfare

farleymfmarley,the way the whole thing was set up and how it was carried out the point of the video that smoking is in fact worse for the human body than vaping is something i agree with but how poorly this was done is just giving misinformation for people taking in more than vaping less harmful than tobacco combustion is ,1,Vaping

farleymfmarley,no because if we are talking the original golden only one of the analog sticks would work the other would not do anything so no people just need to quit bitching about cheaters and find something else to play that is not a good comparison at all tbh a keyboard and an xbox one controller can each have x amount of buttons controller buttons and triggers keys on the keyboard and the mouse mapped to an action within the game you do not get some kind of special secret insta 360 headshot rpg noobtube flash grenade thing you can do because you have a keyboard if we are talking online multiplayer show me the part of the tos that say you cannot have a device that lets you use a keyboard or mouse while you play however i do agree that if you are competing in a tournament of any kind there probably gonna be rules to standardize what you are using you do not get to go compete for faze or optic and use that kinda shit ,1,Infinitewarfare

farleymfmarley,you 100 should slow your pace if this is you coming from a game like black ops 3 with jet packs and shit to a game that purely boots on the ground og cod 4 was my first cod and a cod i will always love however i had not played the game in about 3 years when the remaster came out and since then i had to re learn everything practice just tossing stun frags until you feel confident you know how to aim so that your grenade lands where you want it to such as on top of a flag being capped in domination or a second floor window where a sniper has spawn killed you six times in a row after a couple hours of this you will figure out the best spots on most maps to get those extra kills if you see someone doing well see where they are at and what way they are looking the majority of the time it likely that a sight line you will want to use a good example would be any of the second floor rooftops in ambush looking towards the enemy spawn and crouching means you will be able to get people at a distance and effectively spawn trap them until the spawn flips or they figure out how to avoid you and then you just gotta change up where you are at and you will trap them again the most important thing to know is that this is a video game and as long as you are having fun your stats do not matter cheers man ,1,CODModernWarfare

farleymfmarley,having the ability to counter the guy who keeps killing you is great but when you pick one perk or attachment to deal with them somebody else on their team now has the advantage on you because you swapped out whatever was countering their shit it pretty pointless when you try to counter for one thing and someone else starts fucking you up because you cannot counter them anymore i wish class set up was more of your perks can either make you way more effective or make you way worse like how i felt with the acr on mw2 silence it throw on scavenger stopping power ninja and be able to survive the whole match without running out of ammo i did not have to worry about my perks making it easier harder to kill that sniper or guy with the suppressed thermal lmg ,1,CallOfDuty

farleymfmarley,nah man the m16 is my favorite assault rifle level 45 and still using it what i am saying is so many people bitch about how op it is on everything cod related reddit social media so i am saying if they did try to balance shit out the m16 would probably be the first thing to get nerfed ,1,CODModernWarfare
farleymfmarley,man you have commented like six times on this post with nothing but negative ass bullshit bet you used a sniper i bet you are just kinda salty that op did better than you have you are the reddit edition of whiny ass 12 year olds from the good ol 360 days it damn near impossible to camp shipment domination and much less possible to snipe the whole game and get 141 kills man so either go get better at the game and stop being butthurt or shut the fuck up maybe go pick up fallout 4 nobody camping there ,0,CODModernWarfare
farleymfmarley,did not even notice til you said something ,1,CODModernWarfare
farleymfmarley,i got 100 kills with the m11014 shotgun sorry if that not the name i am too fucking tired okay my first match using it which was shipment domination to start off the match toss a frag to your left over the containers does not matter what spawn you start i have gotten double kills that way grab b early on there an open shipping container that if you sit right against the barrel closest to the entrance you will be able to cap it after that run and gun use the semi auto shotgun or the mp5 ak74u some people have done well using the p90 but i cannot stand using it on any map if an enemy is close up just spray aiming will get you killed toss a lot of grenades and try to get a helicopter up before either team reaching 50 points so it actually has time to get you some kills most importantly learn the spawns learn which corners enemies actually spawn in and you not only do not get assfucked by some cunt with an m16 as soon as they spawn but you will flip it around and start assfucking the enemy team ,1,CODModernWarfare
farleymfmarley,it really helps to know the spawns all i have been playing is domination with a little kill confirmed and tdm and i have learned the dom spawns well enough that on some maps i can just toss a grenade and pick up a kill before i start gunning people down with the m16 lmao ,1,CODModernWarfare
farleymfmarley,i agree the original was my first cod and i loved it i loved my first ever match where i got two or so kills and thought i did amazing if they try to nerf something it will probably be the m16 as a lot of people seem to be hating hard on its one burst one kill thing it got going but personally i love the m16 i am level 45 on the remaster and the m16 has been my main assault rifle since level 12 when i realized how amazing it is but once the m16 is nerfed people are either going to start using the ak or the mp5 a lot more and then they will nerf those so on so forth ,3,CODModernWarfare
farleymfmarley,op all i can tell you is fuck a fake friend i have had dozens of them some i was close to other i was not if somebody you put your trust into to hold onto your shit can sit there and smoke it up and obviously not plan on saying so or buying more to make it up to you you need to get your shit back and you need to cut them off do not let not wanting to lose a friend keep someone toxic in your life ,1,saplings

farleymfmarley,it cod related a part of the community not reddit specific cod players in general have been really toxic i have listened to people give others in detail instructions on how they should kill themselves because they did poorly compared to the rest of their team in a mw2 tdm game had to tell that dude to shut the fuck up because he was piss poor too and had to listen to him talk about how shitty my entire team was and how we should off all of ourselves some people are just cancerous man ,1,Infinitewarfare

farleymfmarley,as i have told so many people the most reliable way is to dilute your urine drug tests are testing for a specific measurement or above of thc metabolites and when you dilute your urine you are less likely to show positive before going in to take the test follow these steps 1 urinate 2 drink about 1500ml little under half a gallon of water 3 do not urinate again until it into a cup for the drug test urine should be diluted enough for you to pass good luck ,1,trees

farleymfmarley,a few things but by no means a guide i have gotten a multitude of people stoned for the first time i just got my dealer high for his first time two days ago we smoked a few bowls and went cruising and had a great time 1 keep it chill it pretty clear y all should not be out for a stroll or going to the mall after smoking not until you have a better handle on being chill while high 2 stock up on drinks and snacks you will thank me i promise 3 be somewhere you will be good to sit and chill and do it on a day nobody has work school of some kind church i have seen people get stoned for the first time before week and get fired for it watched a close friend of mine get arrested because he was so high he could not stand up straight and we were freshmen in high school so obviously they knew what was going on as soon as he was sent to the office 4 if you find yourself getting bored either turn on some tv games or listen to music and have a conversation like i said earlier do not plan a trip to the mall or anything you do not want to lead a group of first time smokers around for hours on end it like babysitting 15 4 5 year olds ,2,saplings
