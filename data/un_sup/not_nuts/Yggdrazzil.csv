Yggdrazzil,thanks for elaborating let me preface this by mentioning i am not a native english speaker consider that most western people will have had no formal education with japanese or a language that even comes remotely close to resembling it this gives us a disadvantage in learning that language when compared to languages we normally learn at school also there the culture to consider you can learn the language but i question how much you gain from just learning the language if you do not also become familiar with their culture and it a culture very unlike our own in many ways this makes it even harder to master just to be able to distinguish between it cannot be helped and nothing we can do thanks but i will pass ,1,anime

Yggdrazzil,shounen battle anime you get an early arc or two with an at least moderately compelling storyline interesting characters all amidst their own personal development soon after the first filler arc shows up character development dies off as more and more characters are pigeon holed into their respective role assigned labels the tsundere love interest the comedic relief guy the powerful early arc villain turned stand offish good guy the nearly as powerful protagonist contrast friend used solely to indicate the power level of the protagonist the all powerful mentor that could solve all early obstacles singlehandedly but does not combined with ridiculous leaps in power with each leap in power making the previous power leap and thus story arc more insignifcant soon after the show ends up in the dropped category for me ,3,anime

Yggdrazzil,wow thanks for the huge reply immersion really should not always be top priority for a developer i agree but if you make it a big part of your game the way ori tries with it art music and storytelling i think it important that you maintain the immersion as it amplifies the enjoyment of the game i think that is also it intent the game relies on being immersive and charming at least that how i feel suddenly being confronted by an action sequence that requires anywhere between 10 and 100 tries to memorise and execute flawlessly feels out of place and breaks that immersion drop the immersion and the game loses it charm what remains is a laughably easy very short platformer with a few infuriating action sequences ,1,gaming

Yggdrazzil, except that vader means father in several languages so viewers in those regions were not surprised by the twist at all i keep hearing that being said it feels like none of you who say this take into account the suspension of disbelief that takes place when you start watching a movie i am dutch i watched the films back then i am familiar enough with my own language to realise vader means father in my native tongue it really does not mean we all immediately went bingo that luke dad it could have been symbolic like he is the father of all evil it could have been accidental you do not expect hollywood to apply dutch words in their films we are not exactly a big country and our language is not that popular globally the fact that the word in front of it darth means nothing in either dutch also does not help establish the link you sit down you watch the movie you toss your brains out of the window and fill the empty space in your head with beer and popcorn you hear read darth vader and you assume it just a name title or combination like master yoda or luke skywalker did all you native english speaking people expect luke skywalker to take off and walk into the sky somewhere down the road did not think so ,2,funny
Yggdrazzil,i meet people on a voluntariy basis roughly once every two weeks as well what sticks out to me is that this it does not feel right if i force myself from my personal experience because i do not feel like hanging with people often i have developed a natural tendency to be alone so moving myself to a situation where i am not alone will feel forced really quickly i notice that when i ignore that forced feeling and actually socialise i tend to have fun and be happy with my decision to ignore the forced feeling perhaps this could work for you too i mean if you occasionally would try to resist the by now natural instinct to decline invitations or to decline inviting yourself to social events you could actually realise that being alone a little less often still works for you with the added benefit that you expand your social circle a little just thinking out loud here hope it helps ,0,introvert

Yggdrazzil, its saying the truth ever because man only making good and bad things and good to bad and bad to good too each of them as the experiences from others and from our sides also 100 correct we cannot attain from our side and others but we must to be polite and to overcome those problems in a good behaviour and to make it if possible in a positive way to ourselves and may be to others too if they admit if not admit just move on and to concentrate in our own capabilities and goodness and one possibility is if one man try to teach goodness to other and other take spread those thoughts then its success gradually every people becomes in positive side pfew tough cookie to crack here my interpretation of it this is true man makes things with good and bad intentions some things made with the best of intentions turn out to be used by people with bad intentions while some things made with bad intentions in mind turn out to be of great use for people with good intentions how good and bad are experienced depend on from which side you view it what we experience as good can by others be experienced as bad but we must be polite and overcome our problems by being on our best behaviour and by keeping a positive mindset towards ourselves and others if others do not accept our positive mindset ignore them and teach goodness to others who do accept it and through that spread this positive mindset to even more others gradually the majority of the people we be part of the positive side hmmm this sounds like borg propaganda if you ask me ,2,creepy

Yggdrazzil,i liked toradora but like you say not nearly as powerful any attempt at immersing myself in clannad was cut short by the freaky eye drawing style it creeps me the hell out for some reason that made it kinda meh i did really like your lie in april a lot it feels similar in style somehow easily as powerful as ano hana have not seen angel beats yet i usually take a break before diving into the next soulcrusher still recovering from this show heh not sure what i will watch in the meantime lots of stuff i am interested in has not finished airing yet and i only bingewatch shows for extra immersion i really liked the humor in the working series if you have anything to recommend in that genre feel free to do so ,1,anime

Yggdrazzil,i hope we are referring to the woman because that cat is not showing any kind of loyalty by lying there it probably put there and it probably does not mind lying there getting the occasional pat from its loyal owner but that cat is doing nothing to earn being called loyal ,-51,aww

Yggdrazzil,purely from the pov of a reader whenever i read a story that has no well defined limitations in magic i tend to experience a lot less tension and commitment towards the protagonist plights because there can always be some vague magic that suddenly helps him her along and when there is not it automatically triggers the line of thought why not why is this not solved through magic why is it not at least further explored after all it never mentioned it is not possible so why not it too easy to fall back on deus ex magica when magic is not clearly defined which i experience as cheap writing ,3,Fantasy

Yggdrazzil,that could very well be the case it still is not very interesting on it own the food finding skill hardly worth mentioning as one of the two things we learn about her i would say and yes i am sure they have their horizons broadened by the wizard to a point where simple village life is just too boring for them but that does not take away the fact that it still tears families apart and that it is the result of girls being taken captive against their will for ten whole years i am curious what did you like about the excerpts ,1,Fantasy
Yggdrazzil,goddamnit the redditmarketeers are hard at work for this game are not they considering how shitty both part 1 and 2 were it not that hard to keep improving on them the gameplay was terrible the control scheme was pointlessly complex the inventory system arbitrary the interface unlogical oh how i hated playing these ,0,gaming
Yggdrazzil,have not read any of her other books thought i would give this excerpt as well as the read excerpt bit a try it easy to read but i did not like what i read all that much not sure what i dislike more this dragon man that abducts girls for ten years and then is horrible to them for not being good enough at spellcasting but not really because he gets all sparkly eyed when teaching turns out normal village people are not all excellent spellcasters that can do every spell right on the first try who knew or that agnieszka main defining trait appears to be being skinny and useless without any other kind of identity beyond that oh wait she can scour for food extremely well in the forest for no reason at all why would i want to know more about her is this just another clumsy stablehand becomes hero of the universe setup i do not really understand why the townfolk live near the magical woods either it seems to provide them with no benefits and if those poisonous winds are any indication at all they are dangerous so why live there is it just laziness convenience because as their lord dragon does not require much of them this hardly seems to be enough reasoning as it does cost someone a daughter every ten years and that daughter ten years of her life and they come out altered not wanting to live there or with their family anymore yay good times her story fills me with dread i mean first you are abducted by this wise and powerful but seemingly impatient intolerant asshole of a hermit you know he will do things to you that makes you not want to live with your family in this town afterwards anymore so there that to look forward to then you appear to be completely useless to him just like you appear to be useless at everything but berry hunting and to top it off your captor then leaves you for an undefined amount of time in a tower and you are not allowed to do anything until he returns okay bye i will just try to not die from boredom i guess sure it will turn out she can do magic just wonderfully and maybe she will turn into a beautiful girl after all hurl but i am just not willing to slog through this horrible dreadful prefacing before reaching that transition maybe it because i have not read any of her other books but the beacon fires mentioned at the end feel ineffective at pulling me in why agnieszka is trapped in a tower she cannot interact with them in anyway nor they with her so how are they of any interest i am not saying the book is bad or anything but both excerpts do the opposite of making me want to read the book ,1,Fantasy

Yggdrazzil,you have trouble acting socially because you instinctively avoid situations where social skills matter which is understandable those situations make you uncomfortable after all however to meet other people so included you will have to make use of your social skills there only one way to improve your social skills like any other skill and that is by doing what you most desire not to using your social skills and through using your social skills you will improve them sure you might never become the smoothest talker or the most popular guy in the scene but i am 100 convinced that you can become better at handling social situations than you are right now remember being interested in someone and asking questions will get you a long way into a conversation with anyone people love to talk about themselves being honest about your situation can help too i have never had a bad response to oh i have always been a bit of a shut in but i am trying to break away from that a little poke my head outside a little more often as of late i have literally done what i have just mentioned in the past it fucking awful at times because of the sheer discomfort you will experience especially early on but as long as you keep in mind that it just like any other skill something that you can improve over time by putting effort into it you should be able to endure it i do not feel that it means much but if anyone is interested i had a relationship for five years we were living together and talking about marriage and kids before it ended ,0,introvert

Yggdrazzil,most people start out focussing 1 champ until they hit a wall where no better loot is dropping for a long while the end game is reaching higher levels in grifts no better gear no grift advancement they then usually switch to a new class until they hit that wall again of course there are also people who persevere and stick to one champ but those are minority i feel ,18,Diablo

Yggdrazzil,i am probably not going to be very popular saying this but here goes the fact that you have to ask about handling the weight of a motorcycle leads me to believe you have never used one before in that case starting off on a motorcycle with that kind of power does not sound like the smartest move please consider riding something a little less powerful while getting experience with handling a bike ,1,motorcycles
Yggdrazzil,i just watched all 25 episodes of toradora watched 19 episodes realised it was 8 o clock in the morning slept for 6 hours and finished the rest thanks for the suggestion was not as much of a rollercoaster to me as clannad was as it felt completely obvious who was going to end up with who pretty much from the first episode on clannad was a little more tricky that way regardless it was a fun ride not every show can keep me hooked for 6 hours straight ,1,anime
Yggdrazzil,i rather they take their time to give the manga space to develop instead of throwing filler seasons at us filler seasons kill shows for me the idea of just keeping people hooked to a show by purposefully showing nothing but random non plot related garbage makes me so angry i am getting angry just thinking about it bah ,1,ShingekiNoKyojin

Yggdrazzil,hahaha ja precies eerste paar keer is het nog valt wel mee je vangt een stuk minder wind dan je zou denken en als je maar ontspannen blijft rijden en je hoofd er een beetje bij houdt gaat het prima het is vooral oppassen als je een vrachtwagen of geluidswand passeert dan kan je ineens een flinke duw uit onverwachte richting krijgen maar dat is niet heel veel anders dan in een auto op het eind neuj gaat wel ik heb gelukkig geen zak meegemaakt ,1,thenetherlands
Yggdrazzil,heb je ook al 100x gehoord gut was het niet gevaarlijk op de motor vanochtend ik begrijp het wel het is een makkelijke gespreksstarter maar na de 20e x ben ik niet meer in staat serieus te reageren op die vraag ,2,thenetherlands

Yggdrazzil,remember guys it not about the size of it it how you use it ,1,NSFW_HTML5
Yggdrazzil,i would doubt you would notice it much after playing it from the hd for a while but there really only one way to find out whenever i get the chance to install a game fully to hd i prefer to do that simply to prevent having to disc swap whenever i want to play something else hds are also easier to replace than a disc reader and regardless of how you use your system back things up regularly ,2,PS3
Yggdrazzil,congratulations man ,1,motorcycles
Yggdrazzil,i always leave the disc in the tray the same disc can be in there for months never experienced any troubles of the sort you mentioned and i have one of the oldest ps3 models i am curious if you put in another disc than fifa not for one night but longer if you will run into problems too then you can rule out that its your fifa disc and in that case it probably the disc reader for your sake i hope it the disc though as that a lot easier to replace good luck ,3,PS3
Yggdrazzil,sorry for implying that i did not mean to imply you agree i just caught myself thinking along the same lines and thinking what the heck this should not make sense to me ,2,pics
Yggdrazzil,does that mean i wo not get arrested anymore when i jerk off in my neighbours garden ,2,pics
Yggdrazzil, that makes sense as someone not from usa this bit is what makes me saddest this should not make sense it should be considered batshit insane that liability goes that far ,5,pics
Yggdrazzil,itt short people ,1,funny
Yggdrazzil,0 i will not waste my time searching for hidden stuff that only in the game for you to to find in order to get an achievement out of it without any further purpose in the game it beyond ridiculous to me ,-6,PS3

Yggdrazzil,hi i am yggdrazzil and i have started watching anime i watched some when i was in my teens but being from europe made access to anime hard imagine my surprise at websites like crunchyroll nowadays i blew through a bunch of shows in recordtime bingewatching episode after episode hurray for being single again and watched not in this order clannad bakemonogatari tengen toppa gurren lagann sword art online 1 and 2 psychopass parasyte and have just finished golden time especially clannad some sao episodes and golden time really fucked with me emotionally can you guys point me to more shows like that god i have missed crying like i did during the last few episodes of clannad and golden time i would just like to say thank you r anime and thank you r anime people for creating content for the subreddit also a big thank you for the recommendation link in the side bar ,1,anime

Yggdrazzil,okay bedankt voor de uitleg weer wat geleerd taalkundig is het dus de beste keuze maar qua leesbaarheid ,1,thenetherlands
Yggdrazzil,spoiler alert thar be spoilers abound i will black out the worst ones but i might miss something so you are warned i really liked the start and middle of the show first we are introduced to the parasytes then we witness them maturing settling into society and society responding to that also the protagonist gets more familiar with his abilities and increases his synergy with the parasyte and the main cast characters get fleshed out a little more but after that it quickly devolves into a hero vs the big bad story and if that was not bad enough they make the big bad practically invincible there two ways that scenario can go either the protagonist goes super saiyan and completely overpowers the big bad and oneshots him or he wins through a cheap one in a million shot trick the super saiyan route could pretty much be ruled out based on the premise of the story and the style of storytelling leaving the one in a million shot cheap trick win as the only logical and obvious conclusion to this scenario you can see it coming several episodes away this eliminates all suspense for all the episodes in between until we finally reach that conclusion and because a rather large part of the series is focused on that scenario almost no air time is left for a fulfilling ending afterwards spoilers s big bad dies hero goes back to town get the girl and lives happily ever after a minor hiccup on a rooftop aside i would have liked a more good guys try to uproot the monsters that are becoming more adept at hiding in plain sight approach more possibly with a stronger conclusion along the lines of yes there are monsters out there but they are so much like us and in a way so much better at being human who to say who the real monster the parasytes or us i mean they toy with this notion but could have taken that further to my taste heck i would have liked it more if spoilers s shinichi had not caught his girlfriend establishing beyond doubt that migi was really gone why bother with the whole i am going away forever scene if he going to reappear within the next 5 minutes regardless of this quite negative rant on the show i enjoyed it it does not pull any punches during most of the show i enjoyed endured most of the dialogue and i liked the animation style it could have been better but it also could have been a lot worse by the way i absolutely love the soundtrack and am still looking for a place to buy it i have asked about it before but mostly get links to download or steaming services i would like the pay the artists for their music it that good in my opinion with human being the track i am a sucker for piano melodies in that genre i have been trying to replay it ever since but not a lot of luck so far hoping a clean midi file will pop up sooner or later so i can run it through synthesia ,9,Parasyte

Yggdrazzil,hi i came across this post and i am planning on doing the exact same thing as you i have to wait 2 more weeks for a test run on the r3 have you done a test ride on the r3 i am really curious about how it rides compared to the r6 i really do not need the power the r6 has but i am afraid the r3 will simply feel boring flat stale quickly i am curious how others in a similar situation experience it ,1,motorcycles
Yggdrazzil, good question i do not know but i agree it expensive i am a little worried but then again even when someone is cre m ated you need a funeral director or licensed crematory operator which i will be that as well when i graduate just because someone was cre m ated does not mean they cut have a visitation first a lot of people do that interesting how one letter can change something into the opposite of what is meant ,1,creepy
