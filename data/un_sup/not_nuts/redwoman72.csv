redwoman72,i do not believe that there any reason to confuse the children in how decisions are made there lots of different types of relationships in this world our lifestyle is just one and one that we can and should in an age appropriate way explain if it comes up we decided a long time ago that we did not find it productive to argue about decisions mommy trusts me to decide what is best for our family every family and couple is different but this is what we decided when you have a relationship just remember to always talk to your partner each of us does not always have to be right or whatever is appropriate for your explanation kids are smart we are not warping their views unless we are throwing kink in their face i grew up with parents constantly arguing trust me that was detrimental the loving communicative relationship i have is not confusing gender roles or relationship dynamics i have had kinky friends initiate these types of talks with their teenagers my masters and i answer questions as we need they know my cuff is like a wedding band they see that i do certain duties for him everyday like making him coffee and bringing his drink to the dinner table ,5,BDSMcommunity

redwoman72,others have suggested as much but sometimes there are also online support groups that you can locate people who have a scheduled meeting time online to have a typing chat group is there an amnesia organization you can contact if so i am guessing they can better direct you to such resources i can only imagine the financial losses your family is dealing with medically loss of income but you need to seek therapy for yourself and your children as well their mother as they remember is gone to them as difficult as this is for you these are their formative years and this experience has to be nearly impossible for them to deal with i have no personal experiences to draw from but you can live with a roommate for only so long waiting longer and working harder on this with your wife would be logical but she has to also be willing it sounds like she also is experiencing a lot of anger and difficulty from the loss of years of her life you are either going to choose to make a future together with new memories or you are not i do not see this just as your decision but as something you and her need to eventually approach together ,2,relationships

redwoman72,thank you ineffably sublime but ideally i am hoping to avoid court mediation i think it would make things worse and i have struggled for so long this is the homestretch imo they do occasionally have weekends without activities or they simply cannot attend events because they are scheduled to be with him he rarely attends activities unless it a performance or concert most of those are on weekdays ,1,Custody
