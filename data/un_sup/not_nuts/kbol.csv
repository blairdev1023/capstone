kbol,i met my first boyfriend my senior year of college 21 and now almost 5 years later we are engaged i know the feeling believe me i got my first kiss freshman year of college and did not really have any meaningful relationships between the two events so i felt like something was wrong with me it sucks but do not close yourself off to love you just never know ,2,femalefashionadvice

kbol,oops fixed ,1,AskWomen
kbol,haha exactly like i know flw was pretty terrible but to bastardize his concept that basically buildings should fit in with their surroundings instead of competing with them into every location has one true purpose and you are morally wrong if you do anything other than that one thing is an amount of mental gymnastics that i just cannot follow ,1,AskWomen
kbol,i read the fountainhead for ap english in high school and despite being a huge fan of architecture and frank lloyd wright specifically i hated the philosophy behind it all i think flw was good at architecture but to say that that mindset should be applied to all aspects of life is impossible and frankly unpalatable i am liberal for the us but probably not quite leftist ,2,AskWomen
kbol,i misspoke you are correct formal and black tie optional are on the same plane i am not sure what equivalency i was thinking of to white tie lace still reads more casual to me than what the dress code calls for i do not think it will be an egregious outfit to wear but i personally do not think it fits the definition of formal ymmv ,14,femalefashionadvice
kbol,i normally would be fine with this for a wedding but formal technically means white tie assuming they are not billionaires i would still be a little nervous that if she thinking black tie or black tie optional the length and the lace together push it to not being quite there for a shorter dress i would generally expect the fabric to be something substantial like jacquard it is probably fine but toeing the line a bit you may also want to ask if their church requires shoulders to be covered ,31,femalefashionadvice
kbol,yep we are doing the same all of our guests will be from out of town except us so we are thinking rehearsal dinner wedding party family only hosted welcome drinks everyone first round covered otherwise people are on their own wedding everyone hosted day after day drinks everyone nothing covered we live in a city that a lot of people want to visit anyway so they may not want to come to all the extra events but we wanted to offer them in case they do ,4,weddingplanning

kbol,i think u textrovert is more speaking to the fact of ascribing to a patriarchal norm is at best benign and more likely is still feeding into that defined norm feminism brought us to where i have the choice to take his name or not but my choosing the easier side easier as in more socially accepted of that is not feminist it is not advancing the ideals of feminism nor am i taking on the emotional social sometimes legal labor of going outside of patriarchal constructs similarly women can be caregivers if they want to be or secretaries or what have you but they are not changing the fabric of society by doing so the idea is often conflated that if i as a self identified feminist do a thing that thing is feminist that all she pushing back on feminists can do patriarchal things some often times it is not wrong or bad or anything like that to do so but it is not feminist ,9,weddingplanning

kbol,if it helps it very very very common to not end up with the dress you had originally imagined there was a recent post in here of about 200 brides showing off what they thought they would get vs what they got and i think i only saw maybe 3 people whose were fairly similar i thought i was going to get something like this https static1 squarespace com static 546e5582e4b01a45cc85c69e t 56cf92bf859fd01d9956a0eb 1456444106164 nashville bridal shop and ended up with this https i reddituploads com 7f0d7688a5d44473a16058240130aaf0 fit max h 1536 w 1536 s 4b350f9348c03e182af23b6b56c6060a wedding dresses are just a different ball lol game that being said i agree with the other advice here to try one more appointment worth of dresses with maybe 2 3 that are not a dropped waist ballgown or shaped like that stella york dress just to confirm that there is not another silhouette you might like even more at the end of that appointment reassess how you are feeling and see if your gut is pulling you in any specific direction i think that sy dress is absolutely perfect on you and for a nye wedding as an aside but do not let our opinions sway yours ,2,weddingplanning

kbol,yeah i think that the difference it definitely a different mindset to get used to eg this is an amalfi coast trip not this is an italy trip but it a lot nicer to feel like we have the opportunity to go back and see milan or venice or whatever at a later date instead of we have done italy if that makes sense ,1,femalefashionadvice
kbol,we generally do not move around a ton during our trips so that might be the difference like for our italy trip in may this year we are going for 7 days including travel but flying into naples and spending about 4 days on the amalfi coast then taking the train up to rome for a day before we fly out similarly when we went to greece we had a long layover in paris so we went into the city but otherwise flew into athens were there for a day then went to santorini for 4 both times the island coast was the intent of the trip it just hard to get there directly our 10 days in south africa was barely enough and even though we were able to do overnight at a safari and johannesburg and cape town i would have preferred more time 12 days might have been perfect in that scenario or we should have just stuck with our mo of only going to one destination p long answer long but i think 7 10 days is sufficient for having one main destination but probably would not be great for visiting multiple cities countries at a time ,2,femalefashionadvice
kbol,my fiance and i are like really into dogs whenever we are apart for too long work or something and we have run out of things to say we send each other puppy gifs and the other person has to acknowledge receiving each picture by captioning them because these gifs are usually cute dogs doing funny things we originally called them funny puppies but that somehow morphed into fuh puh if we are joke mad at the other we say ok you get none puh which is a pretty serious threat our dream is to have one corgi and one shiba in the future the corgi will be named porkchop and the shiba applesauce so now every corgi is referred to as a chop and shibas are sauces similar to the above we do not ever say the word corgi corgis became corgums became gums and we like their tums and their bums so that one sticks but sometimes they are called lumpkins or lumps for short which are an especially rare breed of gums because lumps have to be harvested from the ground in the manner of a beet root we just moved cities and have been discussing what we think that means for lump harvest season this year we can very easily have a full on conversation in our personal gibberish language but it makes perfect sense to us ,6,weddingplanning

kbol,bumble lets you set an age range to look for in your area i think it initially set as 5 years of your age but you can adjust it to whatever i am 25 so it was showing me women from 20 30 but i think i would have more in common with 30 year olds than those still in college so i changed mine to be 22 30 ,5,femalefashionadvice
kbol,generally 7 10 days my fiance and i are just both lucky in that we can work from home really easily so we wfh around the holidays haha we also try to generally fly out on fridays and back on sundays when we can unless it prohibitively more expensive so we do not waste pto on travel days ,4,femalefashionadvice

kbol, i have yet to discern the difference haha yeah we get 15 days of pto and one floating holiday and it like why not just 16 days of pto ,6,femalefashionadvice

kbol,as a woman who regularly says i do not care it can be a few things my fiance and i are foodies there are too many places too try and all of them sound equally good i am just as happy with vietnamese as i am with tacos i do not eat nearly as often nor as much quantity as he so i do not want to make the decision based on what i want all the time since it does not seem fair for example i love cafe style places for breakfast because i am perfectly happy with a croissant and some coffee or granola with yogurt and fruit etc but those places tend to not have heartier stuff and he remains hungry even after we have eaten as a sub point to 2 since i eat less frequently i truly may not care about where we go because i am not hungry yet if someone asked you to lunch about an hour after you had just eaten it so you are full from it but not necessarily uncomfortably so do you have a preference as to where you eat i feel this way a lot even around normal eating times like noon or 6pm or whatever i again feel bad making a choice for someone else from my extremely neutral stomach position decision fatigue and yeah sometimes i am being sulky and trying to get him to pick the place i want by telepathy but that not common and it generally in response to not feeling heard when i try to vocalize my wants or if i am already annoyed at him from something else etc ,4,AskMen

kbol,the literal point of a nonviolent protest is to inconvenience people into action first i must confess that over the last few years i have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate i have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the negro great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the white citizen council er or the ku klux klanner but the white moderate who is more devoted to order than to justice who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice who constantly says i agree with you in the goal you seek but i cannot agree with your methods of direct action who paternalistically feels he can set the timetable for another man freedom who lives by the myth of time and who constantly advises the negro to wait until a more convenient season mlk jr emphasis mine ,9,Atlanta

kbol,i am moving to the city my wedding is in in march but both me and my fiance are consultants so we are on the road 80 of the time and do not know the city super well yet we got a full price wedding planner event designer she covers both for 4 000 which is honestly an incredible price for our market and how good she is most comparable vendors i talked to were 8 10k the rule of thumb i heard is that a planner should be about 10 of your budget so i am curious how there enough 80 100k weddings to sustain those shops anyway we are just now getting into the thick of things but she has already proved so worth the money and she has experience working at our venue with other vendors we are interested in etc it has been weird getting used to just how much i can delegate to her but in a good way anything that i like i can dig further into but she said she will cover some logistical stuff like picking a shuttle company that i could not care less about without bothering me about it and it nice to have one less thing on my plate and i would not make this the sum total of your reason for hiring one but she already proven useful as a scapegoat when talking to my mom or other concerned family members i love that idea but planner said that would not work sorry ,2,weddingplanning
kbol, there was an entire episode of the atlanta one about how grooms should not come to appointments tbf the consultants on the atlanta one are generally from the deep south so it just not done in their circles i do not think they would necessarily have a hard and fast rule against it i live in atlanta now and know a few people who have brought their fiances shopping although not at that specific store it just unusual for the kind of people that they cater to the nyc store generally has people coming from all over the us which would lead to more diversity in opinion and practice ,1,weddingplanning

kbol,no advice but i am going through the same thing right now my fiance is really involved in the planning and we are coming to decisions together my mom said that weird usually the groom just shows up which a he took offense to and b i think is the source of her next jab that was well if you do not want me to help plan at all and just show up that your prerogative in a very sulky tone her and my dad had a very small very informal wedding so my older sister is the only one she really planned my older sister is a people pleaser so i think she let my mom make pretty much every decision but i and fiance are much more stubborn than she and i think my mom is struggling to see that i want to have a say in my own wedding is not the same as you do not get any say in it at all anyway solidarity i am hoping that involving her more in stuff that he does not care about my dress floral decor will mitigate her issues with things he does venue band etc but we will see ,2,weddingplanning
kbol,me too i have been engaged since october but wo not be able to start my planning in earnest except for the venue and photographer we already have booked until march so i pass the time by looking at wedding dresses but i do not think i want to buy one this early it like waiting for christmas day except christmas is 14 months away ,2,weddingplanning
kbol,people remember and value experiences much longer than they do things one common sentiment i see is this could be a down payment on a house 1 and while they are right how many people do you know that have lived in the same house all their lives people move circumstances change but your wedding memories last along that vein though invest in things that you and your guests will remember photography food entertainment if a beautiful floral arrangement sparks joy for you get it but if you are getting a bouquet just to have one maybe that an area you can cut back on prioritize things that are important but if it not putting you into debt or anything to have your wedding there no reason to scrimp just because you feel like you should 1 not to dissuade anyone from doing that instead i just think it a false equivalency to a wedding ,4,weddingplanning

kbol, i am just saying that making a size small bigger is not solving problems it creating new ones but is it creating new ones or just renaming old ones i am 25 so this is a sincerely curious question since the current state is pretty much what i grew up with anyway was it that much easier for smaller women to find clothes in stores when they were marked s rather than xxs or have the purchasing choices remained static eg 40 of stock is m 20 is s 30 l or whatever while the sizes measurements have changed if the latter then i could see the issue but if it just a matter of getting used to a new number i see that as more of a quirk of the industry than a real problem ,1,femalefashionadvice

kbol,i work with sql a ton in my job and i got it largely on my sql merits that i gained in my previous role so previous role business analyst specifically in the call routing fell under customer service umbrella dept of a fortune 50 company my role was largely data based but any requests we had had to go through the data team based on the importance of your request it could take up to 2 weeks to get a response from them i had maybe 10 minutes of valuable work to do every day so i requested access to the sql servers we used most often and i self taught from very basic queries and sqlzoo com eventually i gained a large amount of proprietary knowledge about how our call routing system handled and stored data and also ended up fulfilling some runoff data requests for the data team which i appreciated so i could expand my querying skillset and they appreciated because it was less work for them even though i was on the business side i ended up fulfilling more of a technical ba role acting as the liaison between the it team that owned the call routing software and the business users whose jobs were affected by it and or needed data surrounding it current role software consultant our software application layer is based in xml but all of the data is stored in oracle sql databases my job covers the whole sdlc requirements design build test support for our clients so my day to day really differs depending on what phase of the project we are in for projects in the build phase i build them via our application in xml xquery but i can see if what i built looks correct by checking that the data mapped correctly to the database pretty simple queries for projects in the test phase i can do some pretty complex queries that check or update multiple tables at a time based on what bugs we find in the system for an internal initiative i worked on earlier this year i also learned how to code pl sql stored procedures which are the closest things to actually creating software that sql offers i really enjoyed this it definitely requires a different way of thinking about both databases and coding and i do not think i would enjoy this being my full time job but it was a fun side project that helped me learn more applications for my querying knowledge this got into a lot of coding things like variable assignment for loops while loops etc that are not really present in standard queries sorry for the novel i just love sql and think it sooo useful ,4,femalefashionadvice

kbol,long division is just a way of figuring out more complex division problems in contrast to something like 4 2 which would generally be called short division most long division problems are due to the divisor having 2 digits so they are not easily memorized a very simple long division example 40 2 a which can also be represented as 2 40 b now start with the left most number of the divisor 40 and see how many times the dividend 2 goes into that number 4 2 goes in to 4 2 times so put a 2 at the top and subtract 2 2 from 4 2 2 40 4 0 c bring down the next number of the divisor 0 and repeat the above process until you run out of numbers 2 goes into 0 0 times so put a 0 at the top 20 2 40 v 00 00 0 since we are out of digits to divide on the divisor and we ended up with no remainder at the end we know that 2 goes into 40 20 times for a more complex version 40 3 a 3 40 b 1 3 40 3 1 c 1 3 40 v 10 b c again 13 3 40 v 10 9 1 now we are out of digits in 40 to check against but we still have a remainder 1 which means that 3 does not easily divide into 40 luckily we have have partial numbers decimals and by knowing that 40 40 0 40 0000 etc we can continue adding 0s to the end of our divisor to see if we can end up with a 0 when we add these decimals to the divisor we also need to use a decimal in our answer 13 3 3 3 40 0 0 v 10 9 v 1 0 9 v 1 0 9 1 you can see where this is going dividing 40 by 3 will never terminate but the answer is about 13 333 if you know fractions you will know that 0 333 repeating 1 3 so the real answer is 13 and 1 3 this same division logic works exactly the same even if none or all of the digits in the divisor are 0 or if the divisor already has or is only non zero digits to the right of the decimal this is probably what you are already doing in your head to figure out division problems you just did not know how to write it out ,1,AskReddit

kbol,this is a perfectly acceptable feeling to have there will always be someone who is richer or smater or more whatever than you and sometimes it really sucks to have to deal with that emotion and feel like you are being left behind because of it i was just pushing back on your question of how do they do it because it pretty simple they use money whether it theirs or their parents or loans or credit cards the how is disingenuous and missing the forest for the trees you do not care how they have the money you care what that means socially money better clothes better status in life if i am reading correctly even if we could answer that how sufficiently it does not change anything for you we can however help out with more concrete questions like i love x silhouette how do i replicate that on y budget or i have z event coming up what is an acceptable outfit based on my budget location etc ,14,femalefashionadvice
kbol, for reference i agree with you and even if there are parents giving their kids allowances cars whatever carte blanche without the kid having to lift a finger so what their being able to do that is their prerogative and does not change your own station in life it one thing to phrase it as those people are privileged and sometimes it sucks that i am not everyone feels that way i get that but to phrase it as how do they do it just seems intentionally opaque to me empathy is not only reserved for those in a lower station of life than you ,7,femalefashionadvice
kbol,just because your relationship with your parents is strained it does not mean everyone is i am not trying to downplay your accomplishments learning to budget when still in school is a huge boost later but you seem to have issues with stepping outside of your personal experiences since you have repeated this same sentiment multiple times throughout the thread your experiences are what have shaped you into who you are and defined your value set but if you continue to resent people for having a different station in life you might miss out on some valuable experiences having the agency to spend multiple hundreds of dollars on a single item does not make someone bad or frivolous or whatever they just have different priorities and opportunities than you ,32,femalefashionadvice

kbol,i am generally good about not doing this in my day to day life but whenever it comes to vacations i revert to my confessions of a shopaholic esque girl in the gray cardigan tendencies so i go into benetton and pick up the pink cardigan i am about to pay when i notice they have got it in gray as well the most perfect soft dove gray angora cardigan with little pearly buttons oh god you see the thing is i have been looking for a nice gray cardigan for ages honestly i have you can ask suze my mum anybody snip so i buy it the most perfect little cardigan in the world people will call me the girl in the gray cardigan i will be able to live in it really it an investment i think i am somehow convinced that vacation kbol is a distinctive person from regular kbol and deserves to be clothed accordingly ,16,femalefashionadvice

kbol,except for particularly nice localities states everywhere in the us pays around 2 13 an hour for servers which is conveniently the amount of taxes that you need to pay an hour making our paychecks very near 0 i also have to tip out at the end of the night to bussers hosts etc from my tips but the amount is calculated based on my food sales for the night rather than how many tips i get and or claim that means if you general you come in and do not tip i am actually paying you to be there yes retail workers etc work very hard but they always know that they are going to get paid for every hour of work they do which may or not be true for every server you encounter ,18,femalefashionadvice

kbol,i have the atlanta xplrr app but it not great otherwise just wait for events to pop up on my fb feed ,1,Atlanta
kbol,i found this out earlier today you can only use one berry per hit so if you throw a berry then throw a pokeball but miss the pokemon you still cannot throw another berry but if you throw a berry miss miss hit then the pokemon breaks out you can use a berry again i am not 100 positive but it seemed to me that the berry only directly helped the next throw though so throw berry hit was more likely to be successful than throw berry miss hit i am not sure if that a bug or as intended though ,1,pokemongo
kbol,nashville has a lot to offer musically outside of country music i wish more people knew that since i think some people ding it for probably not catering to their tastes seeing regina spektor at the ryman is probably one of my top 3 concerts all time and that was on just a random tuesday ,2,AskMen
kbol,gotcha i took a summer class at unt so i have walked around the square a bit but did not do much besides that i will give it another go again in the future ,1,AskMen

kbol,yeah i used to live in nashville if you want pp go right when they open at 6am or be prepared to wait an hour or two very very good though ,1,AskMen
kbol,i grew up in flower mound so the idea of denton being a destination is kind of mind boggling to me since the only people who i know there i would classify as just townies that never really left my area so genuine curiosity what does denton have to offer i might check it out the next time i am home ,1,AskMen
kbol,buckhead is technically within the city limits of atlanta proper but can sometimes feel culturally like a suburb due to its residents separate skyline etc ,1,AskMen
kbol,on the opposite side of the coin my boyfriend and i both studied abroad in new zealand from the us and each visited sydney for a week and it still at the top of both of our lists of favorite cities in the world although we just went to cape town recently and it a very close second sure it expensive but the city just felt very vibrant to me and i was able to fall in love with it on a college student budget ,2,AskMen
kbol,in the first satc movie i really love this scene samantha relationships are not just about being happy i mean how often are you happy in your relationship charlotte every day samantha every day charlotte well not all day every day but yes every day it just a really important point and i feel like the healthiest relationships i have seen irl do their best to emulate it ,2,AskWomen

kbol,if you do not own other sandals is there a place in your wardrobe for a pair by that i mean is the lack thereof a legitimate hole that you have had issues with before or is it an indicator that you have a wardrobe that does not lend itself well to wearing sandals ,2,femalefashionadvice
kbol,way late but if you like comedy anything on the earwolf podcast network comedy bang bang is their bread butter but i also really like hollywood handbook although start from the beginning with hh they get v inside baseball v quick ,1,femalefashionadvice
kbol, the question i have been wondering is does it make sense to evolve a pokemon if you already have their evolution ie psyduck when i also have golduck this is what i keep wondering the only benefit i have found is your like trainer xp and or having a deep bench for gym battles but it probably better to have a lot of different types for battles anyways instead of having just a lot of pidgeottos haha,1,femalefashionadvice
kbol,haha i did this exact thing with my gyno we are both runners and i mentioned that i have been having a really odd lower back pain recently that i thought might be related just v casually and she was like um that sucks i can refer you to a chiro but i am going to go look in your vagina now ,1,femalefashionadvice
kbol,a new app was just released in the us two days ago called pokemongo that integrates with google maps and puts pokemon in your real world like when you happen upon a pokemon and you go to catch it it uses your phone camera to put the pokemon in your physical environment https i kinja img com gawker media image upload s oa9gmtqn b6dihmcfc2cez9b6q0lo jpg so people are incentivized to walk around to find rare pokemon and items hatch eggs etc ,6,femalefashionadvice
kbol,that incredible all of my coworkers are super into it and there three gyms in our office area so our lunch breaks have been very strategically planned for us to maximize capturing and battling potential ,4,femalefashionadvice
kbol,running when i am busiest is when i make the least time for it but it really recharges me especially since i get really zen during runs and do not think about anything i also bake when i am stressed ,9,femalefashionadvice
kbol,so how many pokemon does everyone have i am at 20 because i am ruthless about transferring duplicates but i am really excited about my 76cp abra and 138cp eevee there also a pokestation within the gps signal radius of my apartment so i also have like 200 pokeballs and 7 eggs lol,6,femalefashionadvice
kbol,i am from dallas originally so everyone on my facebook twitter has a hot take i am infuriated and overwhelmed and depressed ,5,femalefashionadvice
kbol,i am curious to know as well i am not particularly bothered by the use of the word both in context of ffa and the world at large but i do like to come to these kinds of discussions to see people unpack what it means for them ,6,femalefashionadvice
kbol,i understood her point to be the opposite actually she feels feminine in her clothes because she is a woman and is wearing clothes she likes in u eightyeightkate use of the word a girl wearing a leather jacket and stilettos is equally as feminine as one wearing a poodle skirt and saddle shoes as long as both women feel at their peak womanhood in said fits for example i can and do wear plenty of sundresses which some people may call categorically feminine but they are no longer my preferred clothing of choice so it just an outfit but when i wear my favorite jeans swing shirt birks fit i feel like myself and therefore feminine even though it has no elements of traditional feminine qualities if that makes sense ,13,femalefashionadvice
kbol,i have found that the times i try to find the perfect thing i end up waiting too long that the trend and or season is over and i never get to experience it at all which is both counter intuitive and disheartening when half the point of clothes is to have fun with ,11,femalefashionadvice
kbol, fewer better things rhetoric seems like an excuse to throw away the old bad things and spend a lot of time and money shopping for and replacing them with the new supposedly better things this reminded me of how i lol at cuyana fewer better since their catalog is just as big as any other comparable retailer ,14,femalefashionadvice
kbol, i have some clothes from f21 old navy etc that i have worn for a few seasons now and they have held up fine it not like they just fall apart in my hands when i try to wash them you know echoing this i do not know if it an unnoticed correlation eg i am more likely to buy stuff from f21 h m that well made but i legitimately have never had a piece of clothing bust a seam shrink unexpectedly warp etc and i am 100 including all 4 years of college when i threw everything in the w d on the highest heat and did not air dry a thing ,43,femalefashionadvice
kbol, in some ways even the act of forcing oneself to put some piece of clothing on a list turns it into a box to check rather than an intuitive or fun experience i really love this point it articulates a lot of my feelings on why i have never been all that intrigued by the idea of a wardrobe spreadsheet i know they are a godsend for a lot of people here but it just takes the fundamental fun out of wardrobe building for me reducing shopping to a necessary chore akin to groceries or something removes a small spark of joy from my life i do not want to feel guilty for liking trends i do not want to feel guilty for picking up a fuschia shirt when my wardrobe is largely grays and blues i do not want to feel guilty for settling for a pair of uo jeans that i love because i can afford designer stuff mostly i do not want to put my wardrobe on a pedestal it is what it is i buy what i like i wear what i like and i donate what i do not no piece will ever have the longevity you think it will a classic lbd in 2016 looks very different from the one i would have bought in 2010 or 2005 or so why not have fun with it instead ,19,femalefashionadvice
kbol,what about a well tailored jumpsuit there a lot of options for those in varying price ranges and can lean either way gender wise depending on fit and such ,19,femalefashionadvice
kbol,it is the arctic fresh i also have the same flavor in the mouthwash but that one is more hit or miss depending on the current flavor profile of my mouth at the time haha,1,femalefashionadvice
kbol,it looks like the entrance to jafar cave http i imgur com 3l8ibdt jpg ,1,CFB
kbol,i definitely do noooot do mine every day because i am lazy but if i can get myself to curl on a shower day the style will generally last until my next shower i shower every other or every third day depending on how greasy my hair has gotten so maybe finding stuff that your hair likes to do will motivate you to do it once since it will look good for longer than forcing it into something if that makes sense ,5,femalefashionadvice
kbol,i like that it adds dimension without needing a lot of upkeep and appears to look good on a lot of different lengths cuts if i ever decide to grow out my hair again excepting my 6 months of platinum hair this winter i have had some variation of blonde ombre for almost 5 years now and i am ready to find something else that still feels me but is distinctly different ,1,femalefashionadvice

kbol,i have been so bored with my cut color recently that i am hoping it turns out and refreshes me although i am sure my colorist thinks i am nuts for going platinum in november and brunette in july haha i found both of them on ig under tortoiseshellhair but there also some stuff under ecaille and its derivatives which is what i think the style was originally called ,4,femalefashionadvice
