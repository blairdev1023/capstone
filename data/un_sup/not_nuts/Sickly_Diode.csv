Sickly_Diode,i was not trying to provide accuracy if i was i would have said 74 i was trying to provide perspective i was saying 50 is less off than 100 is and it still pretty obvious it far away it just a way of pointing out how huge those error bars were for the original statement ,1,history
Sickly_Diode,you said that so confidently you actually made me double check i am pretty sure that 74 years https www wolframalpha com input i time between 01 2f01 2f1943 and 01 2f01 2f2017 not 75 even if it was released on the 1st of january it would be less than 74 and a half years so i do not see how you could round it up to 75 i said closer to 50 exactly because of this to provide some context for where on the timeline it actually falls not because it was much closer ,1,history

Sickly_Diode,if young people cannot pay for education there are only a few options 1 parents teachers lied to the kid and told them they should study whatever they want and it will be fine 2 the jobs they were going for disappeared or 3 the jobs they were going for pay far too little for the cost of the education those are not the fault of the young adult that are only just getting to grips with the adult world they are the fault of the adults that have let the person down edit you can also take your accusations elsewhere i am not in said camp i can pay my student loan just fine despite it being north of 100k that does not exclude me from being able to understand the situation and sympathise not everything that happens to a person is that persons personal responsibility people commit to education paths before being legally adult enough to even drink and you think they should be made to pay for the rest of their lives if they made a mistake in that we are not talking about a 40 year old that took out a loan to buy a maserati and cannot afford it here we are talking about education ,5,Jokes

Sickly_Diode,if people take out loans for education that they cannot afford to pay back i would say the majority of the blame is on the society education system in particular and parents that raised them this is especially true when you take in to consideration that most these people could have paid their loans back if there were any damned jobs in the fields they studied in and many of those jobs disappeared while they were in doing said education blaming someone for being stuck with student loans they cannot pay back assuming they did not do a degree with no idea of what they could do at the end of it is just blaming someone for being unlucky there no need for that shit ,6,Jokes

Sickly_Diode,it absolutely is a straw man feel free to look up the definition if you are unsure but this is a textbook example of a straw man in no way does my post say that no one with any wealth is allowed to be president nothing about my post even insinuates that wealthy people have been president in the past and its generally not been a huge issue previous presidents have generally realised that being president does require certain sacrifices they have generally managed to keep their personal holdings to a minimum not capital just business interests and or put them in a blind trust if he had put his holdings in a blind trust that would sway the majority of naysayers regarding this i am sure not all but certainly most he could have done better than that and sold all of his interests and still maintained most of his wealth for the duration of his term and buy new ones after but while some might i would not expect this of him using a blind trust however is the bare minimum effort to show he gives the slightest fuck about conflict of interest he refuses to do it and to top it all off fobs people off with bullshit like saying his kids looking after his business is a blind trust as though we are all idiots that cannot even google what blind trust means he then further screws that up by making some of the children looking after his fortune take active roles in government what the actual fuck he reeks of crony capitalism to a degree i have never before even heard of he like a caricature of a corrupt politician and somehow people decide to defend him ,1,gifs

Sickly_Diode,i am genuinely confused about this where would you draw the line if 1 in 10000 people can do it would you say humans can do it how about 1 in 1000 1 in 100 what specific percentage would satisfy you that it reasonable to say humans can do it turning it on its head you most likely would not you say that humans cannot die from falling down stairs just because it only happened to a mere 1 in 1312 of people sampled uk stats for example in other words humans can does not mean all humans nor does it mean they do it being provably possible seems more than sufficient for that claim if they would proven that none of those 3 people actually saw individual photons i would fully agree they have not shown that humans cannot do it and that a higher sample size would be needed before i would even agree that most likely humans cannot see individual photons but they only needed 1 person to prove that it was possible if anything having 3 out of 3 do it makes it less likely it an rare thing because picking someone with a rare ability in 3 out of 3 cases is unlikely especially if they are not genetically related but far from impossible ,17,askscience

Sickly_Diode,where i come from parental leave has 6 weeks reserved for the mother to recover with the father being allowed 2 weeks to help out after the birth then between the two they get to choose either 49 weeks of 100 pay or 59 weeks of 80 pay total but split between them however they choose i think it overall a pretty good system but unfortunately it can end up with the mother taking all of the leave if attitudes are that way inclined in my family and most that i know of the dad did take a significant chunk of that time off though usually close to 50 50 if not exactly in my opinion the more couples where the dad takes the same amount of time off work as the mother the better not only can they help out more at home but it also means there less reason for employers to think that mothers are more of a drain on their resources than fathers ,1,science

Sickly_Diode,ikea seems to actually be the only place nearby that i can get something more than about 6 long ,1,dataisbeautiful
Sickly_Diode,i am not sure what that has to do with the length of the mattress the problem is that if i am not in my bed which is 220 cm long then i am basically guaranteed to be in a standard length bed which means my toes are definitely off the edge of the mattress assuming there is not some board in the way there in which case it even more uncomfortable as i am kicking it throughout the night ,1,dataisbeautiful

Sickly_Diode,you just need to fill that bed with more people ,1,dataisbeautiful
Sickly_Diode,i am shorter than that and still struggled with bed lengths here maybe i am just picky but it not enough for it to be longer than i am tall i want to not bang my head on the headboard while still not feeling the draft on my toes so add an inch or two above your head as well as below your feet including length of feet since toes tend to point downward when not standing and you end up with the bed needing to be fairly significantly longer than your own height seeing as the standard bed sizes here seems to be approximately 2 inches shorter than me it annoying i ended up getting a big ikea bed then a nicer mattress from somewhere else because theirs were not great for people with back problems shifting said mattress to the bottom of the bed and stuffing the top with cushions since my pillow goes there anyway ,5,dataisbeautiful
Sickly_Diode,if you would ever woken up from the thud of your dog hitting the floor because you accidentally stretched your legs out while sleeping you would appreciate the extra length the extra width well i am sure it has it uses one of those beds you could easily fit 3 people in i suppose ,5,dataisbeautiful

Sickly_Diode,it a massive pain in the arse getting a decent size mattress here it pretty much ikea or bust luckily ikea actually uses scandinavian sizes even here so you can actually get 220 cm beds easily i fucking hate how my toes are always off the mattress whenever i have to sleep in any other bed ,70,dataisbeautiful

Sickly_Diode,tricky certainly you could never do it very well i guess my attempt would be to explain that colours help you differentiate otherwise very similar things in a similar way to how they would be able to see differing shapes for example show them square and a smaller triangle of similar luminosity but different colours and slide the triangle over the square which should make it hard to see the triangle for them especially if they are quite thin and flat and explain how the different wavelengths reflected off each object means that you can easily see the difference even when they are right next to one another another person can never know what any of your senses are actually telling you the classic how do you know yellow looks the same to someone else thing but they can understand in what ways it useful to you and how it can be applied ,1,AskReddit

Sickly_Diode,usually when i see people use it it will be something like every method call where the line would be longer than x characters they will put the first parameter on that first line then align all other parameters on their own line to the first character of the first parameter that and the ever popular aligning of in css yay i added a longer css property name than was previously used in this class and need to re align every other line sigh i am sure it can be used in a decent way that just is not my experience of it ,2,AskReddit
Sickly_Diode,that just because the definition made ages ago was that and that only because it was used for columns a column of 4 is too narrow for most things does not mean your editor has to display it like that for code ,2,AskReddit
Sickly_Diode,web development should always use minifiers though ,2,AskReddit
Sickly_Diode,i never do alignment in code it means if something changes method name or whatever you now need to fix the alignment on all the lines aligned to it which makes your commit less concise and clear another level indent is plenty to ensure it readable it really just ocd that makes people insist on aligning it to a specific character ,8,AskReddit
Sickly_Diode,well it not like i am going to tell you you are wrong i do not have read your code but four spaces makes it obvious which indentation level you are at and it should not ever go more than 3 indentation levels deep regularly 4 at the absolute most as such you do not really have to look far over at all the most important thing is to be able to read at a glance and be reasonably accurate larger indentation helps with that imo ,2,AskReddit
Sickly_Diode, do you wipe your ass sitting down or standing up both surely ,1,AskReddit
Sickly_Diode,that specifically a setting in any sensible ide indentation is tabs or spaces but no one in their right mind uses space to manually insert them while we are at it they will all have the ability to display white space so you can see if some numpty used the wrong indentation type for the file ,3,AskReddit
Sickly_Diode,i hate two spaces get the indentation wrong by even one space now you have to read the surrounding code to determine whether it off by one extra or one too few besides the only reason to use that few is massive nesting which i think should be avoided at all cost anyway ,8,AskReddit

Sickly_Diode,hah reminds me of my school where we were not allowed to eat during our lunch break because we were not allowed to be in class rooms during lunch break and we were not allowed to take food outside the class rooms because we might throw it at one another we were given the last 10 minutes of the middle of the day lesson to eat no more no less you had to sit at your desk in silence whether you had food or not then had to leave without bringing food being caught in the halls with food meant it would be binned and you would get a mark against your behaviour grade i always wondered why they insisted on calling that half hour recess lunch break when we were not allowed to eat i suppose it was the teacher lunch break but still ,18,AskReddit

Sickly_Diode,i do not understand how this relates to the question sure those factor in to matching your speed to the wind but the question as i read it is assuming that already accomplished are you suggesting that tyre road interaction affects the wind that you are feeling from the car window beyond having an effect on your speed if so i would be interested to know what you mean specifically ,0,askscience

Sickly_Diode,civil service involves a lot of useful important work such as working in hospitals many of which are more important than learning how to be a barely qualified soldier that will never be in war ,2,IAmA
Sickly_Diode,effective combatant has nothing to do with anything as a man in finland you can choose civil service but you cannot choose no service why should not a woman be faced with the same choice and decide for herself whether she up for military service or wants to opt for civilian service that has nothing to do with combat ,3,IAmA
Sickly_Diode,having babies is not giving back to society and while they do not help carry it to term men are involved in that process too and what does it being prime reproductive time have to do with anything my mum got pregnant and carried me to term while in the army and not as a 6 month conscript either as a lieutenant with 3 years service your attitude to women is really showing in that kind of comment not to mention the fact that the average age at which women have children is constantly going up not down ,4,IAmA
Sickly_Diode,of course they are different and in what way does the biological differences mean that men have to work to give back to society but women do not you are aware that civil service is not mandatory for women either right ,3,IAmA

Sickly_Diode,what you are comparing mandatory service to parenthood i do not even know where to start about how ridiculous that is how about in what way is parenthood mandatory not to mention that the whole point of paid paternity leave is also to make up for some of the differences you talk about ,1,IAmA
Sickly_Diode,it not only now it not been unsafe for the last 60 years or so and let not forget that conscripts are not used unless it a defensive war the chances of that is pretty damned low besides who would actually invade finland russia is the only country that would make any kind of sense and there nothing those 27k conscripts could do about it whatsoever ,2,IAmA
Sickly_Diode,much safer by what metric it not like any remotely significant number of people going through finnish conscription see active service at all let alone somewhere dangerous enough to seriously increase their chances of death or injury in deaths there barely any difference between people in the finnish military and civilians of the same age and it slightly in favour of people in the military ,1,IAmA
Sickly_Diode, that seems fair the service they are involved in is much more dangerous and so should be shorter than the safer civilian one i do not see that logic applied anywhere else in society are more dangerous jobs that people choose to do given twice the pay if so i would expect any beat cop to earn more than a banker ,2,IAmA
Sickly_Diode,let be fair everyone has the option of doing civil service those who do military service chose to do it ,2,IAmA
Sickly_Diode,how is it justified that someone willing to fight and kill people has to spend less time giving back to society than someone who is not how is it justified that men have to but women do not or that only one religious group has grounds to skip it or that people born on a specific set of islands are exempt there a legitimate grievance here whether you care or not ,7,IAmA
Sickly_Diode,i agree with what you have said but i do think there an element of breaking the rule and going to prison making your point more visible here and there a completely reasonable objection to have against the fact that even the civil service is remarkably biased it completely preposterous that men should have to give up 165 347 days of their lives to give back to society while women and select groups go scot free and that worth taking a stance over in my opinion ,2,IAmA

Sickly_Diode,i am not simplifying the issue just because i did not go in to exhaustive detail this is a reddit thread not a thesis i never said particular traits were linked to particular health issues even though that is the case see the english bulldog comment for example the point i was making is that when a breeder is breeding for a specific trait which i hope you will agree that many have done in the past and continue to do today it matters much less to them if in so doing they also cause them to have health issues whether that because of that trait directly or it just happened as part of the breeding process bear in mind that selective breeding cannot just take a single trait in isolation and not have any other effects besides you really do not have to know much about dog breeds to know that these are issues that have been around with various dog breeds for a long time what is worse is that they generally get worse the longer a dog breed is kept pure for as there is essentially zero new genetic material entering the gene pool ,1,LifeProTips
Sickly_Diode,your link is dead looks like it expires after a certain amount of time the english bulldog is indeed a good example of such an issue though and it far from the only one it may be one of the more severe ones but i have not looked in to it enough to be sure one way or another ,2,LifeProTips
Sickly_Diode,i am aware of how dogs came about leaving wild wolves to their own would certainly have been kinder but that not really my point there a vast difference between breeding wolves in to generic dogs smaller than wolves but still large gene pool and essentially segregating dogs in to such small genetic pools that we cause all kinds of illness and breed specific vulnerabilities there are breeds today for example that have an extremely high chance of impaired eyesight or impaired breathing just because the breeders were more interested in a specific nose shape or whatever than the actual very real damage they were doing to the dogs it simply not equivalent to breeding wolves in to dogs ,5,LifeProTips
Sickly_Diode,the making of breed categories and limiting breeding to specific parameters is one of the more cruel and pointless things humans have done to our pets limiting gene pools like that is not a good thing and for what mutts are on average much healthier no less intelligent and just as cute and adorable ,2,LifeProTips

Sickly_Diode,interesting well if it worth anything i wholeheartedly think that we have far too many ip rules and especially the duration of said protection is completely insane personally i would lean towards something like a 5 year patent maximum and maybe 10 15 years for copyright unrelated to death of creator which is significantly short of today laws edit oh and that not to mention a much higher bar for awarding patents software patents in particular is swarming with bullshit patents that are incredibly trivial ,1,changemyview
Sickly_Diode,you are right all software companies there was definitely hyperbole my apologies for letting that slip through but the vast majority of successful software companies are closed source and many of them spend absolute fortunes producing their complicated software which would simply not happen with foss alone there will always be organisations producing foss i am sure of that but i am not convinced that you would encourage that any more by removing ip protections especially since those organisations actually depend very heavily on closed source companies both for direct funding as well as indirectly because many of the biggest contributors are closed source software companies for example the top contributors to the linux kernel have typically been companies like microsoft and intel also most of the big solo contributors are able to do so because they have well paying jobs at closed source software companies i am not convinced we will agree on this but thank you for a civil discussion nonetheless ,1,changemyview
Sickly_Diode,well you are right i did not understand that what you meant that again not patents it copyright but at least i see what you mean if you are envisioning some utopia that has zero ip protection then i do not know what to tell you making software like that is expensive and if you have a society that downright encourages ripping software companies off you get zero software companies sure you get competition in the os market with that approach but its temporary as all software companies eventually go out of business including your knock off one as everyone just gets free copies instead ,1,changemyview
Sickly_Diode,monopolies are not monopolies in fields where new entrants are common if you think windows vs mac and linux was about patents then you are going to have to read up on it it was not linux was free and non infringing and if anything mac had more important patents than windows microsoft spent a lot of money on marketing on making sure that education and business was focused on windows and it worked ,1,changemyview
Sickly_Diode,they lose more money having competition than they lose undercutting new entrants that not supposition it things real companies do in real situations today in certain areas if cost of entry is very low for example it might be unfeasible but there are many areas where this is a very real tactic used and is highly effective microsofts example has nothing to do with patents they had 90 market share and forced companies to not stock pc with linux pre installed or they would lose their oem license and would not be able to sell windows pc which was the majority of income maybe areas with low entry costs would be ok maybe they would not but the industries with a high cost would definitely not be and that a very substantial amount of all business it cannot just be ignored ,1,changemyview
Sickly_Diode,because monopolies are generally capable of spending their way out of having competition and they tend to be extremely hostile towards new entrants in to their areas and have the money to prevent any small businesses from taking off for example a large monopoly can undercut prices so that startups cannot compete by dealing at a loss until the startup runs out of money this happens in many even near monopoly cases or they can create a hostile market environment by creating exclusivity contracts with suppliers or wholesalers or any other applicable entity such as what microsoft did in 90s with their oem agreements or they could simply poach key staff to prevent you from being successful or any number of other legal without anti competitive legislation ways they can abuse their market position to kill startups ultimately money is power in the market place if someone is allowed to corner a market only corporations that are already very rich can even hope to take them on in a monopoly friendly market ,1,changemyview

Sickly_Diode,these people were not there and did not get that announcement though and what they are watching looks like something is wrong even if you do not know much about rockets i do not expect laymen to understand what is going on or even be convinced its gone wrong i am just surprised there does not appear to be even a passing thought that there might be a problem ,1,history
Sickly_Diode,it more the obviously out of control trail that going in a corkscrew motion that the dead giveaway you do not have to know much about rockets to think it odd that they would separate the stages and still have a rocket under power flying around another portion of the rocket if you assume the pieces that disconnect are boosters it insanely dangerous for them to behave that way ,1,history
Sickly_Diode,that does seem likely but i still would have expected some kind of is that normal reaction when the separate bits kept changing trajectory and especially when they kind of corkscrewed ,2,history
Sickly_Diode,you certainly could but it does confuse me that there is not more uncertainty in the dialogue here it does not even intuitively make sense for the separated parts of the rocket to still be firing changing trajectory perhaps the adults seeing it might have suspected something was odd but not wanted to worry the children as it might not be anything unusual ,1,history

Sickly_Diode,i specifically agreed it could be called terrorism under some definitions and the reason there a specific state terrorism section is because state sanctioned events like this are not normally called terrorism most definitions of terrorism also imply unlawful which an act of war often is not either way that does not put these on a level as similar events hiroshima and nagasaki were worse as far as i am concerned but they are not really similar to 9 11 i do not know what to say if that is not clear by now the actors involved were on a complete different scale the act was on a completely different scale the motivations were completely different ,1,videos
Sickly_Diode, the military any military has one and only one purpose to kill people that being said iran military is not present anywhere but in iran why us should be any different why you are sticking your nose everywhere who put you in charge of being the world police who gave you the right to judge people of different cultures me let put aside for a second that i am not an american and deal with the fact that not every american is responsible for what the us army does people can be against that and still live in the country i made no statements suggesting i am the us army 1 fan and agree with all their policies it still irrelevant to what was being discussed as a side note many of the troops you are complaining are all over the world are legitimately placed by the un as peacekeepers or by various other treaties the us army tends not to just put soldiers in areas for shits and giggles they asked you do it multiple times and it a reasonable request maybe they were not the brightest bulbs in the box but they did 9 11 to end the war not to start one i am not aware of anything like that if you have any facts regarding troops in the middle east at the time as well as any information regarding al qaeda reaching out to have the troops removed i would be happy to look at it i still do not think that in any way excuses 9 11 however the atomic bombs were a real life demonstration of what the us was now capable of and hence why japan had no realistic choice but surrender the choice of a civilian target was no doubt influenced by the desire for revenge but at least the goal was to end the war in a single stroke it was absolutely to instill terror it was awful and i hate that it was done to real people that does not change the fact that it was a truly effective way of scaring japan in to a surrender people can and do argue over whether or not the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki overall saved more lives than continuing the war ultimately we wo not know because we do not actually know how much it would have taken to make a ceasefire happen had it not occurred but it most certainly was effective and decisive 9 11 was anything but decisive and effective it was like sticking a wasps nest in the face of an 800 kg polar bear armed with nukes no one in their right minds would have believed it would end hostilities i have never seen anyone make the claim that al qaeda did it to remove us troops before it would be nice if you provided some links to back that up as well if you are arguing semantics and claiming that hiroshima and nagasaki were acts of terrorism then by some definitions it might have been by others it wo not generally we never refer to acts backed by a government as terrorism even if their goal is terror it usually just called acts of war instead it does not really matter because the importance of semantics pales in comparison to both events and it irrelevant what you call it even if you assume they are both acts of terror they are still not terribly similar as a side note i cannot believe you have managed to put up such an extreme position that i find myself defending the us army of all things ,2,videos
Sickly_Diode,i actually find that bit quite chilling it exactly the attitude that gripped the us from that moment and lead to some really horrific shit i get that it was awful and senseless but that does not mean that starting multiple wars is the way to deal with it a horrible event like that should cause people to come together and help each other and while people did that they also looked around them like never before to find people to lash out at in retaliation as well the whole thing is quite depressing and i cannot help but feel like in some quite significant ways the terrorists did win ,1,videos
Sickly_Diode,for one there is a difference between an act performed during war time in an attempt to force an end to that war and an act against civilians in peace time in an attempt to start one more importantly none of the people in those towers were in any way guilty of those bombings so how are they in any way relevant you might as well say there nothing wrong with killing people because people have died in the past ,3,videos

Sickly_Diode, it is easier to have large scale ads that list a pre tax price rather than having a different ad for each city sure but that seems pretty damned weird to me as well different tax from city to city that just seems awkward i guess there are historical cultural reasons for it here the tax is predictable and the same across the entire country i get that easier in a country that smaller though and prices have to include tax to avoid any differences it would be hard to compare prices if some places put the price without tax and some with tax similarly pretty much all groceries have to have a normalised price displayed per 1 kilogram per 1 litre etc for comparison reasons ,1,AskReddit

Sickly_Diode,i understand where it coming from however i think that most people who have been competent with computers for a long time massively overestimate both the importance of that level of competence we specialise for a reason we do not need everyone to be able to fix their own computers and how prevalent that level of competence is i am pretty sure that we have made huge leaps from the boomer generation yes there are still loads of people that are at a terribly low level of computer competence but that getting better fast what is not getting better fast is the higher levels of competence i think this is partly because people who are not especially interested wo not ever get there nor should they have to and partly because at that level the previous generations were actually really good boomers who were really interested in computers got really good at handling them millennials are not realistically going to outdo them by much ,2,Showerthoughts
Sickly_Diode,in my work experience as an it guy i was twelve i came across someone whose monitor was not working i take one look at it and see faint lines barely visible on the screen crank the brightness and contrast up to full and suddenly it works again those days were full of simplistic shit like that along with condescending remarks about how this kid was attempting to fix the problem that had them stumped more than one seemed pretty humbled when it was demonstrated in front of their eyes that even a child could do it ,1,Showerthoughts
Sickly_Diode,in my experience what separates someone who solves 99 of their computer problems themselves and those who need to call for help is simply not being afraid of fucking it up if they try to fix it themselves it not that these people cannot be taught to google the error message and read the results they are genuinely scared that they will break something if they go down that route and wo not even start ,1,Showerthoughts

Sickly_Diode,there also ease with which you can go from having said info to having fixed your problem and the complexity of the information that has to be presented for example if your problem used to involve 20 steps of semi complicated instructions with various warnings about how you have to do steps 4 6 and 10 exactly right or you might fuck up your os but on a modern os it 5 steps of easy to follow hard to fuck up instructions then it has had a significant improvement this kind of improvement is happening though of course it varies between different issues modern software and ux approaches lead to much more user friendly and reliable software that is helping this process in cars as was mentioned before the trend is pretty much the opposite as a concrete example i had a flat battery and could not have my car jump started despite having jumper cables available from my friends car because there a big ass warning saying to never do that because it might damage his battery it went from a slight annoyance that would take 10 minutes to sort out to 60 minutes of waiting for someone to come out in a breakdown van to get me going ,2,Showerthoughts

Sickly_Diode,i agree with your comment but i find it very incongruous that you say hating people for things they cannot control with religion as your only example that truly is something people can control they certainly should not be persecuted for it of course it was just a very strange how you did not include something that actually was not a personal choice as an example ,1,OldSchoolCool
Sickly_Diode,openly perhaps but i do not think the numbers have legitimately grown i would say quite the opposite and you can see that fairly well when you compare young adult attitudes to that of the generation around retirement age politics of hate are still far more common and powerful than they should be but i think we are on a pretty good trajectory we just need to make sure we continue to improve rather than regress ,1,OldSchoolCool

Sickly_Diode,if you are talking about something like this http www top me wp content uploads 2015 03 img 54fc2cde59f2a png they do not fit on every door they do not fit in 3 of my 4 doors for example i have one in the 4th believe what you want edit i also only have 2 office chairs perhaps you could furnish me with a video of how you safely perform rows with one or two of those i will try out handstand progression somewhere else but not against either of the only 2 doors i have that close as both would leave my back fucked if i fell backwards which seems like an accident waiting to happen i am sorry you take it as a personal insult that i would prefer to do exercise in places other than my own home ,1,Fitness
Sickly_Diode,i am not really saying i absolutely cannot i am saying it far more difficult than you guys make it out to be as i mentioned somewhere else i do have a pull up bar for example ultimately i do bodyweight training i just mostly do it at a gym or at my climbing centre because it way easier than doing it at home i do not own any chairs that i could use for rows for example i could buy some sure but honestly i do not know where i would put them i am sure it could be done but the effort for doing that is not worth it when i only pay 15 month for the gym two minutes walk away when i eventually move somewhere bigger i am sure a lot of this will be really easy but it not like it preventing me from working out so what is the issue ,1,Fitness
Sickly_Diode,yeah i am aware of that i do have one and i do use it but mostly i end up using the one at my gym or the one at my climbing centre instead as its much more convenient ,1,Fitness

Sickly_Diode,they did not look like they could be done on a yoga mat a whole bunch of them were involving various surfaces chairs etc any that could be done on a mat alone i could do but not anything involving furniture i am not sure what you are referring to on the back of a closed door but i only have 2 doors that can be closed and they are both narrow doors which prevents a lot of things such as pull up bars from fitting they are also not very sturdy so i would hope you are not suggesting hanging from them or anything i do not know about you but i did not intend it as excuses more of an explanation why it might not be great everywhere i work out at least 4 times a week as it is i do not need this especially i just go other places to do so and it would have been convenient to be able to do stuff outside in the nearby park or something it just is not really feasible in rainy muggy winters ,1,Fitness
Sickly_Diode,read my earlier post i do go to the gym regularly these are reasons i cannot do this stuff at home which is why i have a gym membership ,1,Fitness
Sickly_Diode,yeah i would have no trouble doing this stuff at my parents house there would be plenty of easy places to do it unfortunately they live in a different country and i am not going to travel to them to work out i do not really see a huge issue though it would be nice to be able to do it but i do not need an excuse i go to the gym and i go climbing regularly is it really so bad that i am not doing it at home ,1,Fitness
Sickly_Diode,not really there definitely not enough room for it in the kitchen i can stand in the middle and easily reach every wall in the kitchen i could reach the end of the floor space with my elbows i do not have any table that has a usable area underneath it that used for storage and there no way to do pullups in my stairway that does not involve making holes in the wall and it rented i get that this is fine for most people but i watched the video and i still do not think this could be done in a feasible way in my home push ups i could do but only barely there only two places in this whole house where i could lay down flat without bending at the hips ,-2,Fitness
Sickly_Diode,sure there a good chunk of it that can be done without anything but i would be a bit worried about using chairs instead of something more solid for example it also not the cold so much as the constant rain that the issue with doing it outdoors i do not have an issue with the cold but working out in cold and rain is an issue i also have 0 space to do this at home and if i did i would still be assaulted by dogs and there are not even chairs i could use at work i really do not think the rolling office chairs would be good for this my gym however is essentially across the road and has lots of space and anything i need it not a criticism or anything i am sure it great for the majority of people i just do not think i am in a good place to take advantage of it ,1,Fitness
Sickly_Diode,i wish that was feasible here you could try it i suppose but you would likely catch the worst cold of your life and frostbite as much as it being low on required kit is cool and really useful for lots of people i think my best bet for doing these are still at the gym ,3,Fitness
Sickly_Diode,everyone there does for sure i think the hope is that some people that see it by chance rather than seek it out actively might be on the fence you are right he not there to persuade ken ham or even the people that came out of their way to see it in person but hopefully it can sway some especially younger people born in to that kind of dogma who may not have been suitably exposed to proper arguments for why it might not be the truth tm ,1,television

Sickly_Diode,but i cannot find any definition of anecdotal that means anything like isolated incident hence my confusion they are all similar to this one adjective anecdotal of an account not necessarily true or reliable because based on personal accounts rather than facts or research while there was much anecdotal evidence there was little hard fact synonyms informal unreliable based on hearsay unscientific the evidence is merely anecdotal antonyms experimental scientific characterized by or fond of telling anecdotes her book is anecdotal and chatty of a painting depicting small narrative incidents nineteenth century french anecdotal paintings synonyms narrative full of stories packed crammed with incident ,1,india

Sickly_Diode,a download from steam for me comes down at a pretty steady 19 mb s bytes not bits that way faster than installing it from a disk let alone including switching disks for stuff that larger than will fit on a single disk and that not even accounting for the time involved in getting the disk postage travel time edit it rare for me for the time from decision to pay for a game to actually being able to play it to be more than 20 30 minutes no way could a disk compete with that ,1,gaming

Sickly_Diode,people say that but it exceedingly rare for people to still have a console 20 years later that still actually functioning stored does not mean well maintained i would put money on the majority of my downloaded games being more easily available than my physical games after a similar amount of time in fact i have paid to get digital versions of dos games for dosbox that i no longer have any way of playing despite owning the originals as physical copies oh and the floppies are dead completely unreadable the same thing happens with cds dvds and blurays physical storage is not forever ,6,gaming

Sickly_Diode,but the post he was referring to is indeed about a pc version do you have an example of this happening on a console yet this is not unusual for pc games but digital distribution is better than physical for pc games unless you have a crap connection so it not that big of a deal personally i prefer it when they just email me the activation code instead of wasting the materials and postage though ,5,gaming
Sickly_Diode,on pc i would be hard pressed to name any downsides i give a shit about there resale of course but i never did that even when i used physical media for games other than that i do not know digital is faster easier usually cheaper more environmentally friendly it even makes it easier for me to share my games with friends steam friends and family support is pretty damned good for consoles i do not know since i have never dealt with their digital distribution ,21,gaming

Sickly_Diode,i have no idea where you live but we might have had very different experiences i have not seen anything even remotely like what you described it generally accepted here that a woman has the right to have an abortion if she wants one but i have never met a single person who showed a flippant attitude towards it sex ed where i grew up included information about abortion and the negative effects of it were most definitely included in it on the other hand negative effects of carrying an unwanted child to term were also highlighted significant strain on the body worse for some than others significant change to lifestyle for the duration various risks of health repercussion from temporary to permanent and so on it not like pregnancy is without costs and risks my mum for example had to be in a wheel chair for the last 6 months of her last pregnancy imagine if that was not a wanted pregnancy all that is not even touching on the psychological aspects of it even if you go through with bringing the child to term in a situation where you cannot feasibly keep the child you then have the trauma of giving up that child these are the things that make me think that forcing a woman to carry a child to term is in fact a punishment if there was no way to help it it would be different but not only is there a way it not a difficult medical procedure perhaps the attitudes are different where you are from but i think most people would agree that preventing unwanted pregnancies is always the better option ,1,TwoXChromosomes

Sickly_Diode,ok i appreciate that you are at least willing to allow others to choose differently from yourself i have certainly known several women who most certainly did not want to ever go through with an abortion my mother among them but still very firmly support the right of others to have them if your belief is founded in treating a fertilised egg as a human i do not think there is much chance of common ground there i respectfully disagree with that i find it to be a completely arbitrary distinction though you are of course entitled to your opinion i just cannot quite ascribe the rights and attributes of a sapient human being to an entity that is completely without thoughts feelings or even the ability to sense anything at all as far as my beliefs go the only thing even remotely special about that fertilised egg is its potential and that not really all that rare in this day and age thank you for a reasonable and civil response you never know with this kind of topic how badly you might insult someone even with the best intentions ,1,TwoXChromosomes
Sickly_Diode,i appreciate your position and while i most certainly agree that we should not take it lightly i do disagree on a couple of points for one i do not believe that we as a society take abortion lightly at all quite the opposite some individuals might but i have not seen significant evidence of that i admit i have not done extensive research on this but i do not believe that it common for people who decidedly do not want a child to ignore birth control because they are flippant about abortions what little i have seen of such things has been more to do with youthful immaturity not fully thinking through the consequences of their actions and often because of a failure of their school parents to educate them sufficiently and in time i do not believe it worth us punishing these people further than is necessary though you are free to disagree secondly i do not believe it is at all like killing a human to me there is a vast difference between making someone never have the life they could have had and killing a person a collection of cells that cannot feel pain or suffer in any measurable or appreciable way to me does not fit the bill of a sapient human being i understand some people probably you included disagree in this but i suppose this might be one of those situations where we might have to agree to disagree the potential for life is everywhere in every sperm every egg hell we could even create some out of your hair with sufficient technology i think it unfair to give the potential for life preferential treatment over existing human beings and i believe that is what we do when we effectively penalise a woman because her womb quickened ,2,TwoXChromosomes
Sickly_Diode,accident is probably a poor word for it but i still believe that we are entitled to make silly mistakes and still not have lifetime long consequences when they are in fact avoidable having an abortion is not no consequences either can you honestly watch that video and not feel for those women people do more stupid stupid things than not wear a condom and get away scot free but more importantly there are people that do use birth control and still get pregnant or worse get raped and get pregnant ,5,TwoXChromosomes
Sickly_Diode,first off i do not mean this as an attack on your beliefs or anything i am simply trying to understand your reasoning as i myself cannot really understand your position i realise this is a sensitive topic for many so feel free not to respond i am just curious about what you said abortions that fall outside what you suggested you would support possible injury to mother are generally illegal after a certain number of weeks of pregnancy varies by country probably even by state usually this limit means that the majority of such abortions take place when the fetus is little more than a cluster of cells barely more than what you would find in a petri dish in a biology lab granted with more potential than that given that is it ultimately just the potential for a human that bothers you or is there a point early enough where you would consider it ok i assume that we can agree that while the fetus is so small as to not have a working brain nor a functioning nervous system there is no pain involved for the would be child not the mother and therefore ultimately no suffering beyond the lack of its potential future life does that sound like a reasonable assertion if you do have a problem with the wasted potential for life could you explain why that is we already have more than enough humans in the world some would argue far too many and just because the potential is there there is no need for it to be fulfilled if that was the problem then in my mind masturbation contraception and indeed a man not having sex at least every 74 days because that roughly how long sperm survive in the testicles would be equally bad the same would go for women and their periods every wasted egg is a similar loss of potential in essence this is why i cannot believe that the potential for life is anywhere near sacred to me it seems quite extreme to demand of a women to keep the baby a rapist forced on her even if she gave it up for adoption many if not most children put up for adoption spend significant portions of their lives in temporary homes of children shelters this is not necessarily a good life why would removing its potential for life in a safe and painless way be more heinous than forcing a woman to spend 9 months carrying and unwanted sometimes dreaded child with all the effects that has on her body only to have to go through the gut wrenching process of giving that baby up so that baby can have the chance of a life that already has a significantly lower than average chance of working out well ,2,TwoXChromosomes
Sickly_Diode,the same people that are anti abortion do not keep all biological life as equally sacrosanct after all everything they eat has been more alive than most fetuses hell most of them seem to care less for the life of the mother who is most certainly alive by any sane definition ,23,TwoXChromosomes
Sickly_Diode,if the man did not wear a condom then both parties are equally at fault if a pregnancy comes of it in my opinion of course it the sensible thing to do of course the man should not try to push the woman into having sex without protection but ultimately unless it was rape the woman has agreed to take the risk too in this day and age both parties should know the risks and ultimately any fault is either with both of them or neither or perhaps on the state sex ed in some places though that a different topic either way the repercussions should be kept at a minimum not made worse by the rest of society ,3,TwoXChromosomes
Sickly_Diode,the video shows a woman getting in to a car unless you are privy to information not available in the video it evidence of nothing even given that there is nothing about it being premeditated that means mistake does not apply it a mistake to smoke for 20 years and cause yourself cancer that does not mean people do not do it even knowing it can end that way you of all people cannot come to me with accusations of bias read your own damned posts ffs ,1,videos
Sickly_Diode,making a mistake however big that has nothing to do with your children should indeed have little to no impact on how you are judged as a parent in my view how you deal with it does matter though and the guy in the video posted here for example shows enormous immaturity and dangerous anger issues there that would make me already doubt his fitness as a parent for example you seem to have a berserk button over this though so i doubt there anything anyone could say or do to persuade you that someone that cheats on someone even once no matter why could ever be a decent human being you are not alone in that but i do believe you are wrong about it perhaps we could agree to disagree ,1,videos
Sickly_Diode,ianal but a video of a person getting in to the car with someone else does not seem like evidence of an affair it not like it even close enough to make out any of what is going on ,1,videos
Sickly_Diode,there are definitely more types than that for example there also the type where there are fundamental problems in the relationship but they still love the person and do not know how to reconcile the two an affair becomes an escape from a difficult place that they cannot quite find it in their heart to leave yet because they are still holding out hope i have also known someone personally who cheated every few years because his partner refused to have sex with him at all edit for literally years at a time he found himself begging for sex only to be turned down and ultimately warned her he would go elsewhere as it was only so long he felt he could get by on masturbation alone then told her when it had happened and they would have a row but not split up this went on for years ultimately there are a lot of issues that come from people refusing to accept that we as a species are not very well suited to permanent monogamous relationships ,1,videos
Sickly_Diode,i am not saying there nothing wrong with the system but honestly i think it 100 right that who cheated on whom in a relationship has nothing whatsoever to do with who is the better parent and custody should be about who is the better parent there certainly a strong bias towards giving women custody given nothing especially differentiating the parents and there are issues there but cheating is utterly irrelevant with regards to their ability to take care of their children ,0,videos
Sickly_Diode,things like this are usually symptomatic of other issues that does not mean you want to leave the person in question this is something that far too complex for the simple black and white labels we tend to put on this it like saying why do not fat people just stop overeating it not that simple and they often do not do it on purpose but find it very hard to resist nonetheless ,1,videos

Sickly_Diode,being a programmer there are a few things though i would rather get them all from linux than from mac os such as a better file system and a command line that actually pretty awesome as opposed to one that sucks and one that basically no one uses you can kind of get these on windows but they are built in to mac os which is nice there are also some nice bits of software available for it such as brew which is a kind of poor mans package manager overall i would pick windows for games and possibly general usage at least if you will play games from time to time but i would pick linux for everything else because almost everything mac does well it does better for free having said that if you are particularly invested in mac os or you just like what it looks like and how they do things then it not really any worse for normal non gaming usage so you may well prefer it just for that reason i doubt many people enjoy the process of switching either way though since there are so many annoyingly niggly minor differences ,2,funny

Sickly_Diode,sure that the intent of the question but i was responding to the suggestion of nudism as such a taboo i am well aware there are taboos and i can only imagine they are still there because other people do want to keep them however i assume that the reason u klemnodd brought up nudism was as an example of a taboo that i might want to consider keeping so i responded with that in mind giving it some thought i still find it really hard to find any that i agree with perhaps something along the lines of do not make jokes at a funeral unless it was requested by the deceased and that sort i do not know if that even counts as a taboo as such though and i am not even entirely convinced i would keep that ,2,AskReddit

Sickly_Diode,you are going to have to specify what you mean by stationary in actual space you would pretty much always make this kind of thing relative to a reference point in space not to space itself even if you were to attempt to make something stationary relative to space itself space itself is expanding so what exactly you would do with regards to that would also be a matter of debate moreover the sun and with it the entire solar system is moving relative to the galactic centre so most likely what you are imagining would not be actually stationary a few examples relative to a point on the earth a geostationary orbit is stationary relative to a single point on earth this is pretty much just a matter of getting up to the right altitude 35 786 kilometres with an orbital inclination https en wikipedia org wiki orbital inclination of 0 degrees any offset here will make your craft appear to wobble up and down the same patch of the sky when seen from the reference point and circularising your orbit above the spot you would like to stay above it takes a great deal more fuel but it certainly doable i doubt anyone would want to do this with any international space craft though a space station run by a single country might though especially if the country is along the equator and might want to make a space elevator https en wikipedia org wiki space elevator at some point in the future relative to a point on the moon you cannot do the same thing here as you can do for earth an equivalent orbit would end up being outside of its sphere of influence but you can use the earth moon lagrangian points https en wikipedia org wiki lagrangian point to achieve the same thing relative to the sun this depends a bit on how important you find the rotation of the sun it does rotate but it not terribly obvious which side is facing you if you do not care about the rotation then any sufficiently circular orbit with the correct tilt approximately 6 degrees off the invariable plane https en wikipedia org wiki invariable plane would more or less fit your criteria otherwise it becomes far more difficult a solar rotation is 24 47 days so you would need to match that with your orbital period according to this calculator http www 1728 org kepler3 htm that would mean your orbit would be 2 4677e 7 kilometres from the sun or 0 16495 au as comparison mercury the closest planet to the sun has an orbit of 0 38 au more than twice as far from the sun as you would have to place your craft even discounting the immense amount of heat you would have to somehow cope with this is a pretty improbable proposition for a manned space station relative to the milky way this would be hard to define at least for me let alone actually execute but consider this the solar system is moving around the galactic core at a speed of approximately 792 000 kilometres per hour 220 kilometres per second i have never heard of such a thing as a galactic stationary orbit so i do not actually know how fast that would be but i imagine it would require some very significant delta v https en wikipedia org wiki delta v to achieve i think one of best presentations i have seen to remove some of the common misconceptions in this area is this gif http www universetoday com wp content uploads 2013 12 tumblr mj0vvcqnzx1qdlh1io1 400 gif which shows the solar system travelling through space ,1,askscience

Sickly_Diode,out of curiosity why is that for me controllers work great for a lot of low precision low ish speed stuff or driving in lieu of a wheel and pedals but fps is the exact opposite i hate how slow aiming is i hate how imprecise it is i hate feeling like the game is taking pity on me by making a vague flailing in roughly the right direction end up pointing my crosshairs at a guys head when i clearly did not deserve it i hate that my range of inputs is so limited i need an extra button for a move fast mode wasting one of the already very few inputs available anyway i am not disparaging your preference i am just curious to understand what makes you prefer it since my own experience with it is just one long exercise in sheer frustration ,1,gaming

Sickly_Diode,i am barely younger than you and i still had not heard of this probably because i am from a nation that exports shitloads of oil and therefore would basically never have trouble meeting local demand the price might have increased but i was not terribly concerned about price of petrol at age 1 ,1,gifs

Sickly_Diode,why on earth would you assume that you can park however you like but you cannot block in another car i doubt either would be strictly legal unless it private property but in that case it probably fine either way i just do not see what makes you think you can treat them so differently sounds like you just associate more with the truck driver than the smart car driver ,4,funny
Sickly_Diode,could just be me but i think someone who is already doing something that people consider a significant problem at a young age needs more support and education not less the guy i mentioned that was forced to change schools for example was violent towards teachers including locking some of them in cupboards in lessons and pushing one out of a window obviously he was a huge issue and a disruptive student so they moved him to a school where two adult male teachers could sit in every one of his classes he was mostly violent towards women presumably because a 12 year old boy is not very likely to be a huge challenge to an adult man in a fight while the women mostly just backed down as far as i understood by law he could not be expelled and they had to do their best to continue his education despite all the difficulties i do not actually know how he turned out but i have a feeling that even if it was a long shot teaching him much of anything cutting out his education entirely would be even less likely to be effective ,1,Documentaries

Sickly_Diode,you can be expelled before high school where i grew up you cannot be expelled until you are in further education age 15 19 am i just wrong about when high school is i thought it was roughly equivalent to our secondary school ages 11 15 at worst we could be suspended for a day or two and one guy did get forced to change schools to one better equipped at dealing with him but no actual expulsions ,2,Documentaries

Sickly_Diode,i have merged at 60 mph often dozens of times i have almost certainly merged at 70 mph more than once but it would be hard to say with absolute certainty i have merged at 5 mph a few times too and at less than 10 mph loads of times it almost the norm what of it if traffic is not the same where you live colour me shocked besides what the fuck does that have to do with what i said the distance you keep to the car in front is important all of the time not just when merging edit clarified wording ,0,videos
Sickly_Diode,not to single you out but why do people always seem to think car lengths with regards to space to the car in front i was always taught that that was wrong and you should always always use seconds instead which makes a lot of sense to me 3 car lengths at 70 mph is nowhere near enough 3 car lengths at 5 mph is much more than necessary it also somewhat easier to get a good idea of how many seconds there are between you and the car in front than it is to determine the number of car lengths ,0,videos

Sickly_Diode,sure the code written specifically for glide would not work though some of it could still be potentially reusable but i cannot remember even a single game where a glide capable card was a requirement to play similarly i think it makes sense that if one api is giving you more power or is easier to work with it might make some sense to have some features only work for or or vive or whatever but completely locking it to one piece of hardware over the other does not really have any precedence in the modern pc as far as i can recall and even if any such incidence can be found it certainly not something we should be aspiring to ,1,superhot
Sickly_Diode,what is this referring to i feel like i am missing out now ,1,announcements
Sickly_Diode,having been around for those cards i still do not remember them causing any fragmentation in the gaming market iirc glide was based on opengl in some way and i honestly cannot recall a single game i was not able to play because i had the wrong card while it shares some similarities i do not think it the same unless of course there were significant games that were impossible to run without specific graphics cards and i just never noticed at the time ,1,superhot
Sickly_Diode,well this problem is about exactly such a case some people like mouse acceleration some do not on a console whatever they chose for you would be your only option it a shame they did not make it more obvious how to turn it off but at least you can do something about it on the pc and you almost always can the only game where i have ever come across enough cheaters to put me off on a pc game was gta v ,2,watch_dogs
Sickly_Diode,if you mean when it not set up to your liking you cannot f ing do anything about it so you just have to pretend everything is ok then yes ,2,watch_dogs
Sickly_Diode,yes that will make the devs aware of what the system is capable of but not knowing what customers will have recommended to them and therefore what most customers will in fact be using they will have no way of testing things with the set up most users will in fact have this kind of thing can have a tremendously negative impact at a late stage in the development work ,3,superhot
Sickly_Diode,a reasonable response and i am with you all the way to this from where i stand looking at the immediate situation gamedevs are able to create great new titles they would not have resources for otherwise and those titles end up enriching the vr landscape as a whole even if it takes a few extra months from where i am sitting it largely not enriching the vr landscape as a whole maybe some titles will become cross compatible with other vr sets over time but many maybe even most wo not even if they do we all know that launching on other platforms months later is usually a lackluster affair at best usually half arsedly publicised and generally less important the individual developers might have good intentions but by buying in to these exclusives they are enriching oculus not the vr landscape as a whole even if they plan to maybe eventually think about possibly porting to openvr which they probably wo not get around to in the end because honestly who has the time for that when they could be making a sequel the money from oculus facebook is of course tempting and i do not really blame any developers for taking it but that does not stop me being wary about the direction this is going in and distrusting oculus intentions with this program ,6,superhot
Sickly_Diode, imagine a world where games are amd only or nvidia only but run 10 better and framerates are more consistent some unique features are better supported it was actually a thing 15 years ago it also common on consoles and helps with reselling remasters and restarting ecosystem each generation that exactly what we need on pc that is absolutely not what we need on pc it could not be further from what we need on pc edit added quote also where was this a thing 15 years ago do you mean 25 years ago because i cannot remember anything like that post 1990 let alone post 2001 ,6,superhot
Sickly_Diode,you have a very different experience to me then it incredibly inaccurate for me i remember marveling that it actually got it right once but for the most part it decides that i have gone to sleep way later than i did it usually gets my wake up time as roughly when i get out of bed which can be just as i wake up or up to 4 hours later depending on the day last night it decided i went to sleep at 18 30 when in reality i went to sleep at 01 00 missing by 6 5 hours is pretty bad ,2,pebble

Sickly_Diode,definitely though any attempts to learn the language are usually very strongly appreciated basically anyone younger than 40 or so should speak pretty decent english older people usually know it better than most english american people know a second language but are often less likely to want to attempt it as they are usually less fluent and less confident about their language skills ,10,EarthPorn

Sickly_Diode,yes you are allowed to disagree especially since there no known way of proving whether or not continuity of conciousness exists however what you are saying even if true does not refute any of what i said my point is if this instance of you is destroyed you if there is no continuity of consciousness would not be aware of it nor would you care in fact if there no continuity of conciousness this has already happened to you plenty of times essentially continuously and making a copy and destroying the original you would be essentially equivalent to you being unconscious and then waking again assuming a perfect copy there are essentially two ways i am aware of that this would not be true one the exact molecular structure that is you somehow matters to the self i find this unlikely because it changes over time or two there is something outside the body that is important to the self a soul if you will i find that even less likely though i do not think this is the place to get in to that discussion it is exactly because the brain is a chemical machine that i believe that continuity of consciousness is an illusion we create for ourselves i think that given an exact replica of that machines systems and state it would be exactly the same and there nothing inherently magical about us that makes the current configuration of ourselves anything more than just that machine ,1,Futurology
Sickly_Diode,there not really any knowing whether there is any difference between i a and i b in cases like this personally i think conciousness is only in the moment and there nothing but my imperfectly stored memories that tie me to the person i was in the past in a way that person died long ago unless you believe in some kind of soul ,4,Futurology

Sickly_Diode,you make some good points especially with regards to death as i think prior to us getting married the only thing my wife would have ended up with if i would died would be if i died while working insurance i am not sure i see what protection marriage provides for either of us should one of us get seriously ill though with the possible exception of a marriage where one party was so uncaring and callous as to simply leave even in that case there only so much that can be done at best you would get a bit of money i believe by all means correct me if i am wrong which seems scant comfort in that situation i guess it would be different if you live somewhere where healthcare is not free and there is not a suitable support network for people down on their luck ,1,AskReddit
Sickly_Diode,to an extent though i do not see what that has to do with marriage i am married now but it makes next to no difference to the long term relationship i was in before 7 years before we got married i do not think marriage changes anything financially unless of course you live somewhere with tax breaks for married people but i do not i guess my point is not married single ,32,AskReddit

Sickly_Diode,syllables are not a measurement of quality of language nor of how well it works i did not even even make any comment on the specific word electrocute so let me do that now instead i do not care that electrocution can be described in another way with fewer not less syllables while we are at it i care more that the word is losing the distinct meaning it had that set it apart from other words making it instead just be redundant what is gained by this evolution in language what benefit is there as i see it there are good changes in language and bad changes and why should not someone who sees a change they do not like be allowed to stand up and try to educate people on the proper usage instead of just letting it happen they are not forcing people to comply and attacking their person is not a productive way of dealing with it ,1,AskReddit

Sickly_Diode,not all changes in language are improvements especially when it means you have to spend entire sentences explaining what you mean because the word that used to describe it exactly and accurately has been diluted to the point where it just a synonym for something else this happens all the time and i would rather see people educated in what something means than having the meaning of a useful word disappear because people refuse to learn what it actually means begging the question is one such lost cause for example ,1,AskReddit
Sickly_Diode,not following logic is very different from from random a random choice could easily be logical it just no more likely to the logical choice than any of the other choices people do not work that way at all there always a reason for why they chose something even if they are not aware of what that reason is the reasons might not even make any sense to most observers or even the person doing it but that does not mean there is not a reason ,3,explainlikeimfive
Sickly_Diode,its not as simplistic as that age does affect fertility of course but you certainly cannot just assume that any 20 year old will have an easy time conceiving at will my parents for example tried for over 6 years to have another kid after i was born before they were successful even though they started having children in their early 20s and were actively trying for years two of their children were born when they were in their mid 30s anecdotal evidence aside there certainly been significant research done regarding human fertility and while many people do not appear to have great difficulty conceiving it also certainly common to take more than 3 months of actively attempting to conceive and not uncommon to take months longer than that without being infertile which is why there are loads of guidelines around for various scientifically backed as well as bogus methods for improving conception rates as well as help for people who struggle with it how long is this gear up period going on for anyway i do not think anyone is saying this person definitely did not get pregnant on purpose especially if the gear up period is several months long it just that it easy to jump to conclusions and many people think it significantly easier to conceive than it really is ,3,news
