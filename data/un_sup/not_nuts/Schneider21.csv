Schneider21, america has promised the nigro real citizenship and a fair chance to make the best of himself when the army needs americans to fight for the country it takes nigros along with whites everyone treated the same when it comes to dying cringe you do not get over a prejudice that easily there no use pretending we are different than what we are but we can try to live up to our american promises i would go further and say we cannot do less and still feel ourselves patriots we have promised to respect each other all of us that one of the reasons that makes our world worth fighting for well shit there we go that a message i can get behind ,187,history

Schneider21,i was in the army and went to iraq in 2009 well after the initial invasion so things were very different than the early days we did a lot of security escorts searches cordons etc a lot of time was spent with the iraqi army to help get them up to taking over the whole time it felt pretty obvious the situation would just collapse as soon as we left which made me very sad you could see the exhaustion on people faces but most people were nevertheless polite cooperative and even friendly especially the kids who i just loved i got in trouble from my platoon sergeant for kicking a ball around with a few boys once i just wanted to show them that i dunno we were not there just to kill people we had a number of guys injured in ied attacks and a guy in my squad was killed i was back at base for the day assigned to training a different unit on our vehicles so he had taken my spot in the patrol he was 20 years old too but i saw a lot more iraqis hurt or killed including one that i have never talked about before one night we were attached to some australian unit that was doing a series of raids searches we would follow them as they moved from town to town providing an extra presence i guess at one house shots were fired the story i heard was that the man who lived there had a weapon but all i could see were farm tools lying around the australians left us there with the body as night turned into morning the neighborhood started waking up and we still had no idea what to do it turned out that the man wife and kids were spending the night with family and they arrived home that morning to find us not letting them into their house our translator chose to lie to them and say we were questioning the woman husband inside we did not know he had said this until we were leaving when we were finally relieved by a different unit the translator told the woman her husband was dead and hopped in our vehicle the whole experience of that deployment left me feeling disconnected and ineffective i have been so much more interested in world history and other cultures since then and much more critical of my own nation and its government i know it not much value but please know that all americans even the soldiers are not the way we come off as a whole thank you for sharing your perspective and i am very sorry for your family and your country losses ,95,worldnews

Schneider21,not only do i agree with you 100 i am a bit confused as to why so many people in this thread are whining complaining and arguing the point you are making i am in nearly the exact same boat as you turning 33 soon married another on the way full time job i own an xbox one and a few great tvs a number of months back i was talking with my brother 31 single no kids about how i feel like more of a casual gamer these days to which he expressed utter disgust what i meant i realized was exactly what you have described here it not that i do not enjoy playing games or difficult games or games that require a lot of time investment it that i need games that respect my time and schedule the xbox one blew me away with its ability to shut the system off while you are playing and when you boot it back up your game is right where you left it those few minutes i saved each play session not having to navigate menus and sit through loading screens meant a ton to me having the option to not only do that but continue while i am out and about is an amazing feature i am already making great use of ,10,NintendoSwitch
Schneider21,then you want an xbox one it good that you know what you are looking for and recognize when something is not that ,9,NintendoSwitch
Schneider21,i had a bit of trouble at first but i am very used to it already i think it actually works out better for zelda at least when holding the right joycon especially detached i rest the tip of my thumb about centered on the button diamond the pad of my thumb touches the top half of the analog stick and i really only bring my thumb down to fully rest on the hat when i want to click the stick down for the sheikah scope doing this the a button on the right side is much easier to access than the b button at the bottom i can get a nice action on that button by just bending my thumb slightly and rocking to the side a bit whereas with b it more like a full extension of the thumb which is a bit less comfortable as a repetitive gesture stick with it and soon you will be hitting the wrong button when you go to play something on your other systems ,1,NintendoSwitch
Schneider21,no it does not oh wait yes it does no maybe it does not okay yes it definitely does ,1,mildlyinteresting
Schneider21,yeah i agree with everything you said i am absolutely not opposed to it it just something i do not have a need for or personal interest in because of my particular situation is all i honestly do feel it only a matter of time before netflix naturally comes to the system relating back to the xbox i believe it app availability at launch was pretty sparse too and now has a ton of apps and games available so if we all are just patient i am sure the switch will be everyone dream machine before too long ,1,NintendoSwitch
Schneider21,no it looks a bit too much like the unity editor i think ,65,Unity2D
Schneider21,velvet ,10,gaming
Schneider21, disclaimer this comment is my own opinion and is not indicative of how i feel all switch owners should use their console i personally see no purpose for having media apps like youtube and netflix or even an mp3 music player or anything on the switch i got the switch to play games i have a few smart tvs an iphone ipad and a couple of laptops whoopty doo look at the rich guy right people are already complaining about the storage space on the device so i do not see why you would want to fill that up with apps you can use on your other device instead of reserving it for games that cannot run on those devices likewise if i can get 3 hours of zelda on a full charge i do not want to be cutting into that time by watching an episode of always sunny my phone can be responsible for that and since the switch does not have cell access a streaming service would really only be useful in certain situations where you have wifi anyway again this might just be me but i do not see the point in muddying things up and trying to be a full multimedia device i am fine with the switch as my console on the go that said i primarily watch netflix on my xbox one which is also a gaming console so maybe my opinion on it is influenced by the fact that i already have netflix access points on all my home tvs and i just do not need another one i guess that does not mean the switch should not be that console for someone else though ,0,NintendoSwitch
Schneider21,strongly agree my switch is my first usb c device so i am starting a new collection of chargers that will eventually phase out my collection of micro usbs although given apple obsession with thinness i doubt my phone will be using usb c anytime soon so i will have to keep those lightning cables around too ,2,NintendoSwitch
Schneider21,exactly what i was thinking i do not own any usb c devices is a fairly lame reason to complain about something using a new but standard port type ,7,NintendoSwitch
Schneider21,does shuttle mean bus because that way nicer than any bus i have seen in the us ,2,zelda
Schneider21,i doubt they would want to add new buttons ignoring the fact that there are plenty of buttons as it is two more than the xbox one controller has adding a new sku of joy con with additional buttons opens up a slew of problems and basically splits your console install base something console manufacturers desperately try to avoid i would say it possible these are keycodes programmed into the firmware that were used for debugging during the console development and were not intended to be used in the production release could have been quick access to profilers or consoles or something ,3,NintendoSwitch
Schneider21,judging from post history they are a fairly educated gamer this is likely to be a shitpost ,6,NintendoSwitch

Schneider21,i have the base game so i am okay for myself but my brother was over last night and fell in love with the game and he now trying to put together the money to buy a switch this would be a great gift to give him as a cool surprise very awesome of you to do this by the way ,1,NintendoSwitch
Schneider21,i have nothing to give you but a bit of karma hang in there ,2,NintendoSwitch
Schneider21,my zelda has been shipping now for the last 4 hours with no update on the console yet do they have no concern for my mental well being ,2,NintendoSwitch
Schneider21,i absolutely agree as a developer i just do not want to be bothered with demos as making marketing and supporting the game are enough work as it is but as a consumer i love having demos i cannot recall a time when a demo has turned me off of a game i was planning on buying but i do know of occasions where a demo convinced me to buy a game i otherwise would not have unfortunately the two sides of me are ever at odds and cannot come to peace with this ,2,NintendoSwitch
Schneider21,you guys may be aware but the my subreddits dropdown is getting cut off by the header overflow hidden otherwise looks great love the banner ,6,NintendoSwitch
Schneider21,i would have said 10 minutes is not much notice but then i remembered everyone here refreshes at least every 3 minutes so it still guaranteed everyone would see the note looks good i miss the little animating switch logo but everything else is very clean and pleasing ,1,NintendoSwitch
Schneider21,maybe they thought people wanted more than an hour and a half of battery life ,1,NintendoSwitch
Schneider21,an excellent point of course one thing about botw that really excites me is the impact it may have on the rest of the industry if they can be challenging yet forgiving and treat the player like they are intelligent enough to figure things out themselves and the game is a massive hit then hopefully other teams take note and do the same ,3,NintendoSwitch
Schneider21,right and understandably too i imagine as a developer myself i do not like the idea of a forced demo because it creates extra work and my game may not lend itself well to being demo would if a timed demo forces a start from the beginning maybe i would rather the tutorial not be their demo impression for example unfortunate for consumers in this case but we may end up yet getting some good demos to satisfy our needs ,3,NintendoSwitch
Schneider21,it been posted a few dozen times now i am sure the mods are just doing everything they can to keep this place from being an ocean of duplicate posts ,1,NintendoSwitch
Schneider21,one of the things i loved on the 360 was arcade game demos they were required to be there so i got to try and occasionally buy games i would not have otherwise given a second look on the xbox one demos are optional and they are very rare sometimes big publishers release a version of the game that gives you full reign but limits your time which is great i came very close to purchasing watch dogs 2 because of this from my perspective having lots of demos suggests a confidence in the quality of the games with the idea being that trying it will encourage you to buy it lack of demos suggests the opposite that trying it may discourage you from purchasing i guess we will have to wait and see like always ,8,NintendoSwitch
Schneider21,this looks adorable and it seems crazy complicated to learn how to control but equally rewarding when you figure it out what is the release looking like on this one edit nvm found the trailer indicating march 28th release yet another item added to my wish list ,9,NintendoSwitch

Schneider21,haha my wife was great about me getting the system she never told me i could not get something but i do feel guilty that i buy things like xboxes and macbooks and when she spends money it stuff for the house or our kid she used to play games back in the snes days she loved donkey kong country and kirby avalanche so my dream is that she will get back into it with the switch then instead of sitting around watching netflix at night we can occasionally play a game together a man can dream good luck with your marriage post snipperclips ,1,NintendoSwitch

Schneider21,this works out great for me since i do not have any friends ,3,NintendoSwitch

Schneider21,the poem was awarded a rare perfect score but that not enough let times it by four 40 40 40 40 ,3,NintendoSwitch
Schneider21,snipperclips instantly caught my attention and was a guaranteed buy for me since the only other game i am getting for now is zelda sc will be my first multiplayer game that i will be using to try and win over my wife approval of the system i was stoked to learn it will be a launch title ,14,NintendoSwitch
Schneider21,i think what u sanjisasuke was referring to was that the battery life limits can be overcome with an external battery to handle sessions longer than 3 hours no modern handheld device smart phones tablets gaming handheld is capable of heavy operation for over 7 hours anyway so criticizing it beyond that is not relevant if you anticipate frequent occurrences where you will want to be playing for hours on end without access to your dock you will want to invest in a spare charger car charger external battery etc yes it an additional cost but it to cover what is beyond the normal use case i think ,1,NintendoSwitch
Schneider21,i think the way you are describing it is the logical normal human way of looking at things maybe it a phenomenon specific to video games or maybe it pervades through the tech industry as a whole but i think there a tendency to be critical of free things as a means of assessing its true value since your wallet did not decide that for you in this case similarly if you did pay for it you may feel compelled even subconsciously to defend the product shortcomings as a way of justifying and feeling good about your purchase i have nothing to back this up just thinking it may be the case for some ,1,NintendoSwitch
Schneider21,i was freaking out all day wondering why mine had not shipped yet even went as far as making backup plans for friday night with my brother and nephew if it had not arrived in time did a little googling and discovered there are 4 amazon distribution and fulfillment centers within 30 minutes of me so i imagine you are absolutely right and it will ship out noonish tomorrow arriving sometime late afternoon friday ,1,NintendoSwitch
Schneider21,something i definitely failed to consider were wii u owners who are not smitten with the idea of console gaming on the go your thought process is logical sensible and understandable ,1,NintendoSwitch
Schneider21,agreed i would much rather buy one of these awesome new games over buying mario64 for a fourth time p,1,NintendoSwitch
Schneider21,ah technically correct the best kind of correct d i remember getting into arguments with my playstation owning friends in school over which system was better and at the time we seemed more concerned with which games were available for which system while i had goldeneye mario and oot they were more interested in resident evil metal gear and final fantasy since i usually lost the arguments i guess i convinced myself the system was the weaker of the two but i still enjoyed it plenty ,2,NintendoSwitch
Schneider21,thanks i am glad i have worked so hard to get where i am at too i did not mean any offense with my statement but i honestly do not see how the power comparison makes any sense still if you can only afford one game system you can pick up an xbox one or a ps4 for less than the cost of a switch so if graphical power is an important factor for you then you are probably better off going with one of those other systems right likewise if you do not care about having console like experiences on the go you are better off with a different system i do not recall a time when nintendo ever had the most powerful system on the market and it never needed to in my opinion ,1,NintendoSwitch
Schneider21,ah so it a problem for people with big houses but not us peasants eh i actually considered picking up a 25 hdmi cable to connect the dock to the tv while being able to keep it on my nightstand this way i can easily pop it in and out as needed or change cartridges without getting up and should not have connectivity issues either unfortunately it was an impossible sell to my wife what with having that cable run across the floor and all ,2,NintendoSwitch
Schneider21,well in this case all available research is sort of just other people opinions p,1,NintendoSwitch
Schneider21,i totally was as a kid nes gameboy n64 gamecube but have been an xbox guy for the last 3 generations now picked up a wii late in its cycle but barely even used it this system has me all kinds of excited to becoming a nintendo fanboy again ,2,NintendoSwitch
Schneider21,while i do not agree with the way you phrased it or the claim of being best on the market that right in line with what i was trying to say people who want maximum graphics capabilities with their games are probably already playing them on xbox ps4 or pc the switch as nintendo products often do offers something different that has a value alongside those other systems and does not necessarily directly compete with them ,1,NintendoSwitch
Schneider21,totally nintendo more than any other console lives and dies by its first party support that said i found the nindie announcements yesterday extremely encouraging and am inspired to continue work on a game i started on a while ago with the intent of porting it to switch i can easily see this as being a system where a lot of smaller teams create fantastic games that play to the switch unique strengths ,2,NintendoSwitch
Schneider21,i love that they are launching with one killer game and a slew of smaller titles with great releases slated regularly over the coming year it enough to keep me excited for a good while ,6,NintendoSwitch
Schneider21,agreed i cannot help but imagine a boardroom at nintendo hq where execs are nervously refreshing review sites to see their verdicts anticipating their success or failure over the next few years ,2,NintendoSwitch
Schneider21,also very true launch titles especially those being simultaneously released on the previous gen system tend to not be as impressive as those later in the console life cycle so it may yet be true that switch titles a year or two from now would be graphically impossible on the wii u ,1,NintendoSwitch
Schneider21,i like switchening more than switchmas and will be using that from now on thanks ,5,NintendoSwitch
Schneider21,fair point it sometimes easy for me to forget that not everyone is as rabid with their news gathering as us core people ,13,NintendoSwitch
Schneider21,i hear you i guess for me not being a wii u owner it logical to buy the new system i would also probably make the argument though that it not the cpu gpu boost that the main selling point but getting that full console experience anywhere you go that the big feature here if that sounds awesome to you it does to me it seems like a valuable feature if you do not see yourself using it outside the house much though i can see where it would not be ,2,NintendoSwitch
Schneider21,the full opening to link awakening from the intense intro of the storm raging to the quiet waves of the beach and that suspense building before transitioning to the original theme brilliant i also have a special place for the loz and aol title songs too though with that said i sometimes randomly find myself humming the oot lost woods song unable to get it out of my head ,1,zelda

Schneider21,i am surprised there are as many wired responses as there are 63 at the moment the device itself is wireless so if you intend to play on the crapper lying in bed or otherwise un docked you would probably want a nice wireless network going in your house anyway right so why mess with additional network setup by having the dock maintain one connection while the actual console has another would not this have the side effect of dropping your connection when switching between the two networks as you dock undock it just so much cleaner and easier to go wireless from the start in my opinion ,3,NintendoSwitch
Schneider21,i am a firm believer in the idea that even moronic people are entitled to their opinions that said you need to understand that your opinion is yours alone and when your opinion is that different from the brainwashed sleeping sheep it just as likely that you are the crackpot outlier instead of the only one that knows what is actually going on presenting your opinion as the only acceptable truth is a great way to convince people of exactly that you are really clueless games are not overpriced they are luxury goods and the market determines their value as a game developer i would think you would be absolutely in favor for their increased valuation unless of course you have never actually published a game and attempted to sell it in any case neither i or u asperatology said anything about purchasing a switch its peripherals or nintendo marketing philosophy that started your rant the video referenced in this thread is about transferring knowledge between generations of game designers both old to new and new to old and nothing more really but since you brought it up i am getting a switch i do think the price is fair and i am very excited for nintendo its future and the games coming to its new system and i suspect they will be just fine without you purchasing their products i hope you have a great day and work through these issues that are bothering you ,10,gamedev

Schneider21,i actually like the fact that nintendo assumes we all own smart phones by now and do not need netflix and chrome on our gaming device i have seen criticism that there no cell connectivity in the system either but i see it as if i really want to connect online while on the go i can tether it to my phone i know that everyone does not feel the same and some do not own phones and thus do not have the option but i feel that nintendo made smart compromises to find the comfortable sweet spot ,2,NintendoSwitch

Schneider21,i was born in 84 my younger brother and i grew up on video games my dad was not interested in games he worked long hours and was involved in a lot of community organizations when he did have some spare time his interest in model trains was the only thing i can recall him ever distracting himself with although he never actually called it that my brother and i would make jokes about him telling us to turn off that pretendo and go play outside as a way of making it clear how distanced he was from the whole scene many years later my brother and him lived together in an apartment dad was a pirates fan and my brother liked the phillies so occasionally my bro would often play mlb the show with a matchup between the two as dad would watch while you may think he would be impressed with how realistic it looked compared to the old days he was more likely to point out duplicate fans in the stands or how a player arm clipped through some geometry in the dugout or something he just never found the awe and joy in games that his sons did my dad died in 2011 fucking cancer sometimes i wish i had spent less time playing games and more time doing things he was interested in like tinkering with the trains i did try at times but i think he knew i was not really into it and only tried to make him feel better my daughter was born in june of 2015 i fully expected my life to change to the point where i would not have time or interest in video games anymore not counting the first 9 months which sucked she was not a great sleeper things have not changed all that much after all i have less time overall but still get a few hours a night usually which is plenty the biggest thing that has changed is how i look at the games themselves my daughter is a bit over 20 months now and i cannot wait until she old enough to play games with her old man one time she woke from her nap while i was playing the witcher and she was very interested in how it worked http i imgur com qgkgflp gifv the idea that she may be as nerdy and into games as i was as a kid thrills me but i realize she may have other interests and may even take after her mother and want to play outside of all things the switch excites me because unlike my xbox i can see myself playing games on it with my daughter whether it sitting on the floor of the family room with blankets and popcorn on a friday night or in the back of the car on our way to the beach some summer while microsoft and sony are really pushing hardware to have games impress in a technical sense i do feel that nintendo is the only one keeping the focus on the things that have formed the fondest memories for me sitting next to a person you really care about and playing together that what i am most looking forward to with this system and what i hope will be a source of beautiful memories for my daughter when she has kids of her own someday ,2,NintendoSwitch

Schneider21,when i was in iraq we did not see too many people that seemed to play video games probably had a lot to do with their unreliable power grid and the fact that their country was ravaged by war on base we did have little shops that were run by i think syrians that sold pirated movies and games some of which were fairly recent i have no idea if locals had any interest in the games or if they were sold exclusively to us americans though ,1,NintendoSwitch

Schneider21,i like to think that internally link is a thoughtful and elegant craftsman with words the shakespeare of hyrule even unfortunately he has tremendous social anxiety and can barely speak to other people often appearing nearly mute this causes him endless frustration which tends to manifest itself with outbursts of aggression on people gardens pottery collections and cucco flocks ,13,zelda

Schneider21,considering botw was strongly influenced by the original i would say play at least through the first dungeon of that try to think of it the way us 30 somethings did when it first came out we were going on a grand adventure in a fantastic open world something we would never really seen before that said link awakening is my favorite 2d game in the series i remember being in 4th or 5th grade and talking about it with kids in school and giving each other tips and clues one kid was so into it he would draw maps of the dungeons and share them with me add to that the fact that having a full size zelda experience like that on the go was so unbelievable at the time that it was another huge milestone for the series add the two up and you have got an even better idea why some of us older guys are so stoked for friday ,1,zelda
Schneider21,i was watching two of their staff play astroneer before it came out and as much as i was starved for gameplay footage i could not get past the first 4 minutes they were painfully bad at even basic movement and seemed as if they would never played a game where the right analog moves the camera from watching demo gameplay videos i am not sure that difficult accurately describes the gameplay but it definitely more intelligent it seems you can no longer get away with mashing the attack button to fell an enemy and the solution to puzzles requires you to actually think rather than just find the highlighted solution around the corner this can only be a good thing for the series and for the industry as a whole i hope other developers publishers take notice and inspiration ,3,NintendoSwitch
Schneider21,i wondered this today as well my best guess is that a review is an evaluation based on a set of objective and subjective criteria the end result being a quantifiable score assigned to the product by contrast a preview is looser impressions more general statements that do not try to score the product categorically the difference may seem trivial but with how impactful review scores seem to be in the industry i imagine publishers really care about the where when and how details ,6,NintendoSwitch

Schneider21, is the on board printer the thing in your inventory where you can craft stuff like batteries and solar panels yes exactly what does the full size printer do it allows you to craft larger items that would not fit in your backpack like vehicle parts big solar panels etc i believe you will have to find all the appropriate research items first though ,1,Astroneer
Schneider21,nice i can confidently say that the coolest space mower i have ever seen does it auto collect the organics ,1,Astroneer
Schneider21, how do you make the little tethers that let you keep oxygen while exploring at a long distance if you have some compound in your pack you can craft the tethers using your on board printer then press t on pc down on xbox to pull out a tether and click right trigger to place the tether is the only way to get new blueprints to research those weird balls cubes you find yes at least currently those are more abundant than you might think though look around and investigate everything what are the little things on the side of the machinery for for example if i wanted to build a printer it takes 2 copper but it also has slots on the side of the tech base that you can put any material on those are slots they can be used to attach resource nuggets for storage attach components like solar panels generators etc or in certain cases be the output of the platform device as is the case with the smelter do things like solar or wind power have any affect of your suit or just your base for example i made a solar power thing and then attached it to a piece of my suit so that it was next to the wind speed reader but it did not seem to change anything about how much power my suit was gaining yes they work on your suit too obviously you have to be in sunlight for the solar panels to work and in wind for the wind generator to work ,1,Astroneer
Schneider21,adam mentioned in a dev stream that enabling the debug console was actually a flag they set when building the game so it quite possible there will be no way to access it in any release version which for me is good because i am weak and like to cheat and end up cheapening the experience for myself and abandoning the game ,2,Astroneer

Schneider21,the only partials i have seen actually on the backpack are from partially consumed nuggets like power tethers etc because as far as i know you wo not get a nugget from the vacuum until it fully packed so to speak what i am referring to specifically is if you are vacuuming up for example resin and have half a nugget worth still in the vacuum then you go off and collect a nugget or two of something else and come back to the resin does it pick up with where you were before or do you have to start with an empty nugget again ,1,Astroneer

Schneider21,welcome there so much advice to give but it sounds like you are doing a pretty good job figuring things out on your own one thing i would say is to not be afraid to try refitting your ship for different roles selling a module back or just replacing it with a new one gives you the exact amount back you paid for it so you wo not lose money switching from being a miner to a bounty hunter to a trader the starting sidewinder is free to replace when you die not counting the cost of any modules you installed but still cheap with those so also do not be afraid to take risks practice your combat at nav beacons accept high risk high reward jobs when you get the feel for which kind of activities you really enjoy then you know what direction you should start leaning to buy and customize a specialized ship once you have the funds to outfit a new ship expect to spend as much on upgrades as you did for the ship itself d rated modules are a great place to start since they are much lighter than e and c modules most of all just have fun fly safe cmdr o7,3,EliteOne

Schneider21,i have seen people do it at the beginning but i think it usually at the end of a long block of text for those times when someone starts reading gets bored and scrolls past but then catches the tldr and decides to catch the gist anyway it also works nicely as a recap of what you covered for those who did read everything but are forgetful ,1,EliteOne

Schneider21,yeah it a weird little oversight on the dev part i think you do not need cargo space for the mission delivery but your reward contains cargo and you need room to accept it ,1,EliteOne
Schneider21,yeah it a weird little oversight on the dev part i think you do not need cargo space for the mission delivery but your reward contains cargo and you need room to accept it ,1,EliteOne
Schneider21,totes i never got involved in cgs at first but once i recognized their value i have not missed one since disclaimer i have missed several ,1,EliteOne
Schneider21,i believe if the mission has a reward that contains cargo as missions can now do as of 1 6 you cannot turn in the mission without having the necessary cargo space available ,1,EliteOne
Schneider21,awesome check out our inara page http inara cz wing 286 and click join at the bottom you should receive a response from one of our officers shortly looking forward to seeing you out there cmdr o7,1,EliteOne
Schneider21,player groups organize through inara inara cz there are a good number of xbox specific factions as well as cross platform ones i can only speak for my own faction here so i encourage others to speak out on their own here the paladin consortium is dedicated to assisting new players with learning the game and protecting them from gankers and griefers i have only played with the xbox fleet and they are a pretty relaxed group of guys several help themselves to quite a number of alcoholic beverages during their play time so they are not super serious i suppose i generally only have a few hours a night to play so i also cannot get into things as hardcore as i may like i think you would feel comfortable with us if supporting our mission statement sounds like something you would be interested in ,1,EliteOne
Schneider21,you were not called anything you were acting as if purchasing during the gpp entitled you to something more than what new purchasers were receiving with the current promotion i commented on that but did no name calling please refrain from further name calling and hostile remarks thanks ,5,EliteOne
Schneider21,my lord such entitlement good luck with that ,7,EliteOne
Schneider21,it not bs game prices typically go down over time and it not uncommon for late comers to get slightly sweeter deals to encourage them to purchase you might as well complain that i could buy a 2014 model vehicle at a lower price than what you paid for it new ,6,EliteOne
Schneider21,as a software developer and hobbyist game dev i absolutely agree ,2,EliteOne
Schneider21,which is why i said they support it to a degree ,0,EliteOne
Schneider21,as someone who has to buy all my own games i do not disagree with your opinion people getting stuff for free do not have much right to complain in my opinion microsoft does seem to allow and even support to a degree people sharing in this way so i am not really fully against it i do wish people would just google or at least read and comment in one of the dozens of existing threads on the subject rather than post their own saying the same thing but i guess if everyone followed reddiquette exactly there would be no need for mods p,-6,EliteOne
Schneider21,definitely your best bet fdev is unlikely to allow you to teleport but nothing wrong with opening a new account plus you would get to experience the new tutorial missions this way ,1,EliteOne
Schneider21,i think it perfectly acceptable and common to go with a dbs or even a scout over an explorer i think the reasons people go with the explorer are the same reasons people buy expensive cars irl they have the money and they want it all you can still be a perfectly efficient and successful explorer in a lower cost ship though ,1,EliteOne
Schneider21,nice i did not know this ,2,EliteOne
Schneider21,thanks for pointing to the technical explanation as a programmer myself i am very sympathetic to the devs on this one with an application as complex as ed it to be expected that issues like this rear their head now and then coding the original app is complicated enough let alone when you are modifying and expanding on that code continuously ,1,EliteOne
Schneider21,certain elements are like removing engineer upgrades from npcs what changes like the railgun with beam laser rate of fire are code changes that need to be made in a patch ,1,EliteOne
Schneider21,it does not sound like they are holding back on xbox or anything just that they cannot say exactly when the xbox patch will roll out because of microsoft certification process ,8,EliteOne
Schneider21,nice finisher love the sound effects of those missiles ,2,EliteOne
Schneider21,ah i think this is what happened to me last night thanks for the explanation ,1,EliteOne
Schneider21,it only crashed 3 times for you in the last week you either do not play much or you are very lucky ,3,EliteOne
Schneider21,good question actually you should always have all members of a wing nav lock to the cmdr with the lowest jump range otherwise players whose ships are incapable of making the jump will just sit there instead of jumping with the wing ,1,EliteOne
Schneider21,right classic ,2,EliteOne
Schneider21,wing mates will always be pushed to the same instance when traveling to locations think of it like the xbox party system but for the game logic wing mates share awarded payout vouchers on killed bounties that way you are not fighting over kills and such you can also more easily track each other locations and even nav lock to each other so that when one of you jumps the other if you are close enough will automatically follow while in combat you can see who your wing mate is targeting and who is targeting your wing mate ,4,EliteOne
Schneider21,why not both ,3,EliteOne
Schneider21,ai what would be awesome is if the new avatar generation tools being used for missions also generated npc pilots granted you would still have to fill in a lot of blanks like this sorry fellow who i assume fell asleep at his controls while docked accidentally ran it off the pad and was just coming to as they opened fire ,3,EliteOne
Schneider21,yeah too bad i could not have run into that guy at the hires ,2,EliteDangerous
Schneider21,you just gave driving instructors all over the world a bit of hope for the future ,1,EliteDangerous
Schneider21,when the other ship bites it you can hear my ship computer telling me we are under attack not sure if it was a stray beam at the end of the force of the explosion but either way i think i may have a legal case against the station ,1,EliteDangerous
Schneider21,yeah no ,1,EliteOne
Schneider21,you cannot deploy or fire weapons in supercruise you will have to drop down to normal space like when you are docking but please do not try firing your weapons then then press x to deploy your hardpoints after that your triggers should worlds you would expect them to ,5,EliteOne

Schneider21,haha i know not worth it for what amounts to a mildly humorous army reference thanks though ,1,EliteOne
Schneider21,i suggest hanging onto one type of each ship by purpose since the cobra is a great multipurpose ship and you were likely using the adder the same way it safe to get rid of it i think in other words there not really anything the adder does the cobra cannot do now when you buy your next ship it worth hanging onto your cobra for sure ,1,EliteOne

Schneider21,there no fc at outposts so you will have to go to an orbital or other large station to hear the chatter under audio settings the option is npc voices i believe ,3,EliteOne

Schneider21,yes it just advance stuff to prepare the game client for horizons edit to clarify horizons launched for pc xbox and pc share the same servers so our game clients need to be able to handle the data from the servers for which planets are landable etc ,2,EliteOne
Schneider21,well said cmdr i normally do not get too involved in game communities because of the pettiness and squabbling i chose to dedicate myself to this community because it was such a passionate and yet relatively friendly community and because new players were generally treated with respect and given guidance rather than being belittled i am sure everyone just got their adrenaline up and both sides are coming off stronger than they intended hopefully things will settle down soon enough ,6,EliteOne
Schneider21,i will keep an eye out for you might have to run that ipa dissertation by me again though if there gonna be a quiz ,2,EliteOne
Schneider21,if you have to when you disable fa your ship no longer corrects itself to fly as if you were in an atmosphere newtonian physics are the rule so if you are traveling in one direction drop thrust to 0 and turn you are still moving in the direction you were already going make sense so by boosting away from your attacker who will always start out behind you if he interdicted you turning off fa dropping throttle and spinning towards him you are still moving away from him as fast as if you were pointed away with fa on except now all your teeth are pointed at him it definitely takes practice and i am absolutely horrible at it still ,1,EliteOne
Schneider21,that was me i got my sweet new mic but have not sorted out how to get it to work with my headphones yet i will remain schneider the mute a bit longer i suppose ,1,EliteOne
Schneider21,i have never flown anything bigger than my cobra so i am only speaking from what i have read the big issue i have heard with asps is that all their hardpoints are on the front right this means that anything on your tail is potentially problematic one way around this i can imagine would be to load your hps up with turrets gumballs a few point defense and chaff launchers heatsink as needed when you get interdicted boost away as normal but then switch off fa spin to face your pursuer and just let loose they would still have to chase you down to get to you but they would have to swim through a storm of beams bullets whatever you are throwing at them to get at you if you are feeling extra saucy and want to punish them more when they break off their attack you can throw fa back on and chase them down sounds good in theory but i have never run an asp so i cannot say how effective it might be ,2,EliteOne
Schneider21,they are still there they are just collapsed by default highlight the option with the next to it and press y to expand it ,1,EliteOne

Schneider21,this is a tough one to answer the community is very split on this i am of the opinion that the npcs have been buffed a bit too much but i am also not an expert at the game by any measure if you are afraid of losing all your hard earned credits i would suggest using a low rebuy ship you already own or buying a small fighter for under 1mil take that out to a nav beacon and try your luck against a few low rate npcs try to get a feel for what you are up against now and base your decision to keep playing or wait it out on that check here or the official forums often for any updates from the dev team on potential changes that may change your mind welcome back and fly safe cmdr o7,1,EliteOne

Schneider21,awesome to hear you will have something to remember your brother by so sorry for your loss if you are interested we could organize a memorial procession or something to fly out there or we could escort you to a neighboring system and let you make that last jump alone give you a chance to see your brother as it were and pay your respects in peace o7,32,EliteOne
Schneider21,you are free to express your opinion as you like but please refrain from this sort of verbal diarrhea and pointless whining nothing good comes from that ,4,EliteOne

Schneider21, i think it looks fetching http inara cz data ships 79 79097x1857 jpg part of the vibrant paint pack which also includes blue red purple orange and green versions ,1,EliteOne
Schneider21,like any skill combat in ed is one you develop with time and practice knowing your enemy and his abilities is important as well the anaconda has a large and huge hardpoint on its underbelly i believe so you will want to avoid exposing yourself to that side if possible your eyes should be constantly fluttering between your radar the target panel and the view out your cockpit be aware of which direction he moving in relation to your position and stance keep your throttle in the blue zone for maximum maneuverability when you want to go straight throw it to max but when it comes time to turn drop it down a bit boosting while turning is another great way to turn sharply and can be done effectively even at full throttle manage your power distribution by the second when you need a boost of speed throw 4 pips into eng but then change it back to your wep while beginning your attack run and into sys when you know you are about to take a beating i am far from a combat expert but i am improving all the time and you can too keep at it cmdr o7,6,EliteOne

Schneider21, invest in a prospector limpet launcher if you can hitting an asteroid with a prospector limpet doubles the rock output you will see why you want this in a little bit buy the absolutely best refinery you can the more hoppers the better do not mine in asteroid belts or even res use edtools http edtools ddns net to find pristine metallic rings and travel there while in sc come in close to the ring and slow down bump into the ring at slow speed and you will drop in without taking damage chip off a piece of a rock only one piece when you see it flying off select it and determine what type of resource s it contains the only ones worth collecting are the three ps painite platinum and palladium personally i go for painite alone and settle for platinum only if it a secondary source from collecting painite if it not one of the three ps vent the material before it even finishes processing by using the eject looking button next to the material name in your refinery once you find a rock with painite hit it with the prospector limpet congrats you now will get back to port twice as fast before you fire off a collector limpet make sure you have no rock chips targeted if you do the limpet will collect that single item and deactivate with it unselected it will gather resources until it time expires or it crashes blast away until no more chips come off find another rock while you are looking for more valuable resources any active limpets you have will continue pulling those useless materials in make sure you go in occasionally and vent them to avoid filling your hold with low grade resources doing this you do not even need an escort if you did not go into a marked res you wo not run into pirates if you do boost away and go back to sc then drop in on a different portion of the ring good luck cmdr o7,8,EliteOne
Schneider21,fdev support page https support frontier co uk kb faq php id 321 q points has a small section about resolving issues with your frontier points balance if that does not do it for you i definitely recommend opening a ticket with them near the bottom of the page as i have heard good things about their ability and willingness to help also took care of the flair issue for ya ,1,EliteOne

Schneider21,if you are going for the jobs promising big payouts of 45k creds early on you are going to find yourself in for a tough time those jobs offer a simple first task assassinate a person and then ask you to kill a bunch of system authority vessels after not worth it instead go for a few smaller paying missions out of the gate courier missions and smuggling runs are good early game missions i also really enjoy the better paying ones where you have to hang onto some goods for a while before you are told where to go with them you will get attacked often by npc pirates but you can improve your combat skills on the lower skilled fellows and run away from the bigger boys hang in there and be patient it takes time to get comfortable but it worth putting in the effort ,3,EliteOne
Schneider21,optimized and better looking planet textures including surfaces more accurate lighting in cockpits like surfaces actually being lit by your hud elements instead of light painted on and it all runs faster than before to boot ,3,EliteOne
Schneider21,of course there no need to counter advise my advice the reason i stated for giving my recommendation was because i see so many people try to speed their way into the high end ships right off the bat obviously that what they want to do and that fine i just wanted to assure the op that there was no need to feel pressured into doing this themselves you are free to spend your entire paycheck on pizza rolls and eat them until you throw up every night that does not mean me recommending against it is bad advice or trying to control your life though especially if you asked for advice as the op did ,5,EliteOne

Schneider21,microsoft does not do pre order for dlc as far as i am aware horizons will appear as an option for purchase download on june 3rd ,1,EliteOne
Schneider21,i guess the idea of power managing deployed retracted is one thing more groups is better for when your power plant starts taking damage and has reduced output so keeping only your vital systems like thrusters and power distributor in group 1 means that as you are nearing death and power is failing you will still be able to attempt to high tail it out of there if you have everything lumped under one big group everything will shut down the moment you do not have enough power in other words if all your systems minus the fsd and scoop etc take up 65 going down to 64 output on your plant will shut your ship down ,4,EliteOne

Schneider21,this is a good point people always want to skip tutorials and while the in game tutorials do not cover everything and even kinda gloss over some really important stuff learning how to play will really enhance your enjoyment ,5,EliteOne
Schneider21, xbox seems to lack games like this absolutely correct this is a great time to get in on the fun too the horizons expansion is releasing june 3rd and with that you will be able to land on rocky planets and drive a space go cart around there also plenty more in the works so you will have lots to do for the forseeable future ,5,EliteOne
Schneider21,you will see a lot of posting about get rich quick smuggling runs how to quickly rank up within factions and what the optimal loadout for any given ship is the best advice i can give is to just ignore all that there no one right way to play the game you are free to do whatever you like and you should spend your time doing what you enjoy if making an honest living as a precious metals miner excites you you should absolutely pursue that prefer sight seeing fit your ship for long distance and explore if you have a sense of justice that needs nurturing load up on weapons and hunt bounties the best part is that the game does not punish you for wanting to try new things or even rolling back your decisions so say you used your last credit to fit a high grade power plant in your free sidewinder and now have nothing left to purchase weapons to be powered by it no problem you can sell the generator back for the same price you paid for it you can freely switch from one career path to the other to find your fun do not be in too much of a hurry to get a new ship wait until you have a bit saved up and you feel really comfortable piloting your freewinder around forget docking computers early on learn to fly and whenever you need help do not hesitate to ask hope to see you out there in the black soon cmdr o7,12,EliteOne

Schneider21,this is not the first i have heard of this either from the looks of it the imperial aligned cmdrs are more focused on attacking fed cmdrs outside czs than fighting inside them as they are falling a bit behind in the bond cashing when you enter a cz take a minute to scan the ships in the area if there are a good number of cmdrs and they are aligned with the opposing force it seems pretty likely you will be targeted once you choose your allegiance you can always high wake out and pop back in to see if you get a different instance before committing alternatively wing up and face them head on ,1,EliteOne
Schneider21,i thought of maybe doing this it would be nice to not have to go back to a bare bones ship so i would not feel so naked out in the black good to hear that doing runs in the cobra is efficient enough to be practical thanks for the input ,1,EliteOne
Schneider21, i would also strip the modules from the cobra and invest them on the t6 blasphemy ,1,EliteOne
Schneider21,the difference between the two though 20t cargo in the adder vs 100 in the t6 what about the t6 build i posted makes it inadequate specifically ,1,EliteOne

Schneider21, i am a new player so i am not sitting on millions of credits is there a cheapish ship say cheaper than an asp exp in game that can hold it own in most battles does not sound like the vulture qualifies ,2,EliteOne
Schneider21,when i started out i liked doing small time smuggling and courier missions you can run small jobs in your starting sidewinder but once you save up 70k cr or so you can put together a nice little hauler http coriolis io outfit hauler 02e2e2e1e1e1e2c 02023v00 iw19a awimczkkco bn minihaul for moving up to 18t at once once you save up a bit you may even consider refitting it for mining operations http coriolis io outfit hauler 02e2e2e1e1e1e2c2l 0202c11g iw19a awimczk0rcgyg bn miniminer use that to seek planets with pristine metal rings and rake in the credits gathering painite for a while do not fall into the trap of trying to gain tons of credits quickly to get the more impressive ships the whole point of the game is progression up to that point so if you just focus on getting there as quick as possible you are kinda missing out take your time and enjoy the early game too good luck cmdr o7,3,EliteOne

Schneider21,i have issues connecting sometimes when i first load the game up if it was not fully closed ie shut down for the night booted back up and loaded the game right away i typically just quit the game fully from the dashboard before launching it each time you have to put up with the opening splash screens and everything each time but it does not seem to have a problem connecting then ,3,EliteOne
Schneider21, the paladin consortium http inara cz wing 286 is always looking to fill its ranks with cmdrs who recognize the importance of protecting those who cannot defend themselves if you like the idea of helping new players learn the ins and outs of the games while taking care of griefers and ne er do wells check us out we originated on the pc but our xbox fleet is growing rapidly and with the impending release of horizons we are going to need plenty more paladins to carry the banner see you in the black cmdr o7,1,EliteOne

Schneider21,1 in the galaxy map when you have a system highlighted press right on the d pad and choose the plot route button looks like the line with dots on it this will calculate a route for you and auto select the nav targets when you jump if you select a system that multiple jumps away you will see the lines on the map here solid for ones you can make and dotted if you would need more fuel 2 answered in part 1 above 3 i recommend against buying a docking computer for several reasons for one maneuvering your ship is an essential skill you will want to fine tune and practicing docking is a great way to do that second a docking computer would take up a module slot and with the early ships you are limited enough in that regard better to use that slot for something that can help you defend yourself or earn greater income as far as why they would not show up in your list though i am not really sure i will get back to you after i investigate 4 it depends if you are just going in for repairs or to sell some salvaged goods you just want to find the closest port that has the appropriate services available but if you are trying to turn a profit on some purchases or looking for appropriate missions to take on or looking to do missions for a specific faction it can be worth making the trip to the more outlying stations and sometimes you will have to go there for a delivery too so there that 5 unidentified signal sources uss weak signal sources wss strong signal sources sss distress beacons salvageable wreckage all those sorts of things are randomly occurring events that spawn they appear in your navigation panel i think when you are near them but once you are a certain distance away they will disappear they also do not appear on your system map do not worry though if you miss one just keep flying and you will see plenty more pop up 6 as long as your fuel scoop is powered it is by default it will activate automatically when you fly in the corona of an appropriate star only stars of type f o g k b a and m can be fuel scooped remember fog kbam or kgb foam if you prefer make sure you do not get too close or you will cook and start taking damage ,5,EliteOne
Schneider21,for courier missions you are fine doing whichever ones feel like you would want to do them ones with decent pay and not too far a jump range for example i would not worry about who offering the missions or anything just yet no way to tell what missions a station has until you land all stations offer different missions and they refresh regularly cobra mkiii costs 350k cr if i remember correctly general rule of thumb i have heard is to have at least twice the initial cost up front to be able to combat fit it and be able to afford the rebuy the best advantage i can think of for playing open is just being a part of the community open and solo do use the same universe and ships and everything so yes you can switch between the two as you like you are not at all as likely to be randomly ganked as a lot of people suspect there just something magical to me about flying into some random port and seeing an actual player undocking at the same time but do whatever makes you the most comfortable if you are looking for good people to play with hit up our discord channel https discordapp com invite 0z0jfyxdnyxl5h71 there always people looking to wing up and cmdrs of all experience levels are welcome lhs 3447 is the system most everyone players start at that system and the surrounding including eravate are generally considered the starting area it actually not a terrible idea to leave that area altogether as the few griefers there are sometimes like to poach in the area they know they will find clueless new players near the starting area is the kremainn system which is recently seeing an increased presence by the paladin consortium the paladins are dedicated to protecting and guiding new players so if you want to try open and like the idea of a bunch of strangers watching your back you could try heading there disclaimer i am a member of the paladins you can approach any of the targets you find by selecting them and lowering your speed as you get close then pressing y to disengage supercruise it takes some getting used to and you will more likely than not zip right on past targets quite a few times but you will get the hang of it generally adjust your throttle to keep the eta timer as low as possible without going below 6 seconds there are tutorials out there that can give you more specific instructions than that to stop at one of these points of interest you aim at it and press a your hud in the lower left will show you what it is your distance and speed same as waking to stations keep that timer above 6s and press y to disengage early on i would avoid most of those notices you see flying by as you progress and feel more comfortable in potentially dangerous situations start checking them out unidentified signal sources and weak signal sources tend to be easier engagements while strong signal sources are higher you can salvage wreckage if you like but the cargo you pick up is illicit and must be snuck into a port with a black market and sold there it way more profitable and easier to just run courier missions good luck cmdr see you on open play and possibly our discord channel soon i hope o7,4,EliteOne
Schneider21,when you accept a mission go to your left panel x left and view your transactions tab select the mission and choose galaxy map this opens the target destination in the galmap choose the icon that looks like the points with lines that will plot a course to your destination close the map if you disable flight assist before you make your first jump y rb when you jump to a star you will come to a dead stop otherwise you will be moving forward when you arrive and have to steer your ship away and or hit the brakes to avoid burning up if you do disable fa you will have to re enable it when you go back to normal space like if you get interdicted or low wake into a port or outpost with a course plotted the next system will automatically be targeted when you make a jump so just realign your ship with the yellow reticle on your hud or use the blue dot left and above your radar wait for your fsd to cool down and then jump again if you accidentally or intentionally changed targets like to scan a ship or stellar body you can open your navigation panel and find the system with the plotted lines icon next to it and select it there if you do get sucked into a star gravity well and start cooking do not panic quickly point your ship in the opposite direction of the star use the head look and your radar to figure this out throw all your power pips into eng and thrust to full if your target destination is in fact on the opposite side of the star and cannot be jumped to you may not be able to enter supercruise even open your nav panel and select any other target then try again once you get out of the well find the correct system and jump to avoid being scanned as you enter a port you have a few options one is to try silent running y lb using this shuts the exhaust ports of your ship lowering your heat signature but significantly increasing the internal temp of your ship i stopped trying to do this early on because all i seemed to do was wreck my internals i have never installed heat sink modules what i do is one of two things depending on where i come out of sc in relation to the port if i am near the entrance already and lined up nicely i get myself into position aimed at the mail slot from as far back as possible then i hit the gas and get through the slot before they can scan me if you see a message scan detected it means the scan has begun but you are not screwed yet it takes about 10 seconds to complete a scan so if you can break line of sight by getting inside you will be fine if i am on the side or back of the station i just crawl my way towards the front and keep a look out for sentry ships when you spot them or their trails they leave slow down or stop to avoid getting in front of them after they have passed move in quick and get inside just like you they can only scan what is in front of them so doing this is pretty fool proof smuggling is super fun once you have figured it out if you really like it it worth upgrading to an adder and putting a few upgrades on it to allow you to haul more at a time in my opinion good luck cmdr o7,6,EliteOne
Schneider21,came here to say pretty much exactly this to be honest i was playing the game for quite some time before i really felt like i was starting to understand it hell powerplay still confuses the crap out of me just stick with it and google or ask here when you run into things you do not get and you will be an ace in no time fly safe cmdr o7,3,EliteOne
Schneider21,are you deploying your hardpoints are your lasers and limpet launchers assigned to a fire group do you have enough power to run everything ,2,EliteOne
Schneider21,maybe a silly question but were you at the same location in the game even if you wing up with a friend you still have to physically go to the other location the exception would be once you are together you can nav lock and travel together easier ,1,EliteOne
Schneider21,welcome helping new players is an admirable role to take on since as you know the game has a fairly steep learning curve if you would like to participate in a more organized effort to assist your fellow cmdrs you should look into joining the paladin consortium http inara cz wing 286 we are a wing dedicated to guiding the lost and protecting the weak and it sounds like you would be a great fit for our organization additionally if you have not already you should check out our discord channel https discordapp com invite 0z0jfyxdnyxl5h71 where you will find plenty of cmdrs rookie and veteran looking to join forces and wing up fly safe cmdr see you in the black o7,2,EliteOne
Schneider21,my understanding is that fdev are in fact working on an api i am sure there will be some good companion apps coming out after that i will probably take a crack at making a companion actually ,2,EliteOne
Schneider21,you just reminded me that i am going on vacation on the 2nd ,3,EliteOne
Schneider21,fair point easier to sticky the mod posted one though to control edits and such have faith in your fellow phoenix ,2,EliteOne
Schneider21,in the interest of keeping the front page a bit cleaner all discussions on the release date and pricing of horizons 1 6 should take place in the stickied thread here https www reddit com r eliteone comments 4k4144 horizons16 release date revealed thanks for understanding ,1,EliteOne

Schneider21,in the words of our shadow president our society can only become stronger by lifting those at the bottom not pushing them deeper to that end we must ensure the empire does not take control of the neits system lest their span of galactic oppression grow even wider ,5,EliteOne
Schneider21,i believe it only for nav targets no not other ships ,3,EliteOne
Schneider21,the sidewinder may be the exception to this rule the maximum capacity cargo rack that will fit in a slot depends on that slot class the sidewinder does not have any slots above class 2 and the largest size class 2 cargo racks are 4t you can drop your shield generator and discovery scanner to bring that total up to 8t but you do so at your own risk ,1,EliteOne
Schneider21,i had no idea you were an aussie as i have had no problem understanding you this whole time ,1,EliteOne
Schneider21,the most embarrassing mistake i have made so far is not realizing ships come with cargo modules lower than their maximum potential i was getting by with 16t cargo space in my cobra when i could have been moving 32t the whole time live and learn ,3,EliteOne
Schneider21,as long as you are only going after the metal rings it can be worth it the standard resource site materials are not ,1,EliteOne
Schneider21,you could always sell the ship back and buy a sidewinder to mine you will need mining lasers and a refinery at the least find a planet with metallic rings drop in somewhere and start chipping away i would recommend selling off your weapons and anything else unnecessary and going for the best refinery you can afford otherwise you will be spending a lot of time purging when you could be packing that stuff up to sell ,2,EliteOne
Schneider21,nice definitely my favorite https i imgur com hubietj jpg ,3,EliteOne

Schneider21,i was trying to pick up a bounty last night so i was supercruising around looking for baddies found an npc chasing another npc around and i got on his tail when the hunter finally interdicted his prey i moved in to drop into his wake by the time i had gotten there though there was only one ship the hunter i tried to avenge the destroyed vessel but i proved to be not up to the task and had to flee glad your story ended happier than mine and you know included real people ,2,EliteOne

Schneider21,they do look fantastic i will give them that ,1,EliteOne
Schneider21,you are reading an awful lot between the lines i did not suggest you were claiming your shots were perfect you originally called his picture terrible then showed him your shots to show what he should be going for that what i was commenting on i did not say you should stop or be silent you just demonstrated that you are an ass and i was letting you know that is all if throwing harsh words at others who are sharing their work and then editing those words later to cover your tracks helps you get through the day then well good luck with that but when you are a shitposter realize that there a watchful eye on you so when you do break the community rules it wo not go unnoticed ,2,EliteOne
Schneider21,is the common belief that they are useless or that the cost damage ratio does not compare to simply using multicannons and such ,5,EliteOne
Schneider21,i had a limited amount of time to play saturday so i was feeling a bit rushed took forever to find him followed him around until he went up to the attic and i had to take the long way around since i was dressed as a bodyguard and the chaps at the stairs would have made me by the time i got up there he was just leaving without going into too much detail things got messy i made it out and successfully completed the mission but my rating was very amateur lesson learned take your time ,3,HiTMAN
Schneider21,i think if you had said purrfect you would have been a shoe in ,2,EliteOne
Schneider21,most people are sticking close to the bubble you do not want to be out in the black without an srv and unable to enjoy the new surfaces i would think you would also want to start saving up some cash ,6,EliteOne
Schneider21,good tip i have just been screaming ramming speed and throwing the throttle to full when a chaff cloud goes off zip on past them lose sight plink plink plink shields offline rebuy ,6,EliteOne
Schneider21,it great to give tips and advice but why is your tone so condescending your shots are fine sure but there nothing spectacular about them that makes you some kind of genius photographer and even if there were criticizing someone else work does not make you seem any more impressive the ships in this game are also gorgeous and i for one love seeing shots with them in it it could be more exciting to offset the angle a bit maybe but this is far from what i would call terrible ,3,EliteOne
Schneider21,just celebrate with us damn you but yeah it will probably go away by the end of the day ,5,EliteOne
Schneider21,what you do not have a frameshift wake predictor on your ship p i have seen a few of these posted on r elitedangerous too i am sure it been reported as a bug but would not hurt to add another to the list https forums frontier co uk forumdisplay php f 105 to drive the point home ,1,EliteOne
Schneider21,the mkiv will be arriving with the horizons expansion and will likely be quite a bit more expensive than the mkiii one of the reasons the cobra mkiii is so popular is the package for the price so you should definitely pick it up earlier on to reap some of that benefit ,1,EliteOne
Schneider21,agreed coming from a unary star system myself i am fascinated by the idea of two or more suns in a planet sky when horizons lands i am sure i will be taking lots of pictures of dual sunsets and such have more pictures to share ,5,EliteOne
Schneider21,huh ,3,EliteOne
Schneider21,excited to be a part of the elite xbox one community and all its craziness thanks everyone ,1,EliteOne
Schneider21,the cobra is a nice early game multirole ship the cost may seem high at this stage but with some smuggling runs in your adder you should be able to build up the cash in no time just do not forget to save up enough to add the necessary improvements and be able to cover the rebuy cost too good luck cmdr o7,2,EliteOne

Schneider21,not at all i am saying it someone looking to pvp that does not want to be a griefer i have no problem with people rping a role that puts them in conflict with other players i am merely stating they chose that position simply to pvp and recommending responding to their actions with appropriate reactions ,3,EliteOne
Schneider21,agreed also worth stating that it is worth going through the in game tutorials if you want to be a competent cmdr if when you want to wing up with your fellow xboners check out our discord channel https discordapp com invite 0z0jfyxdnyxl5h71 to see who available and looking to partner up fly safe cmdr o7,3,EliteOne
Schneider21,it seems to me there are always players justifying going against community goals just for the sake of it often justified with some in character reason but in reality it just an excuse to pvp without being labeled an obvious griefer i would recommend bringing a few friends and showing them that the community will prevail best of luck cmdr o7,2,EliteOne
Schneider21,the game is brutal just because missions are available for you to pick up does not necessarily mean they are actually you know achievable i would recommend sticking to simple delivery missions not the same as sourcing the goods yourself and light trading until you really get the hang of things upgrade your ship a bit try taking on wanted npcs near nav beacons if they seem low level enough check out the links in the sidebar here for some good tutorials on different career paths and be sure to join our discord channel https discordapp com invite 0z0jfyxdnyxl5h71 if you want to wing up with your fellow cmdrs fly safe cmdr o7,1,EliteOne
Schneider21,it always exciting when a game community starts to boom one of the ways elite is distinctly different from other multiplayer games is that new players are pretty much incapable of ruining the experience for the long time veterans for example in a co op shooter a la cod an inexperienced player on your team has the potential to wreck your ability to score points and win the match no such correlation exists with ed while it certainly possible to cause a bit of mayhem with a sidewinder experienced players are able to whip them into shape very easily with this power of course comes great responsibility if a new player is harassed constantly and blown up any time they leave port they will grow up to become harassers themselves if on the other hand they are coached into being great additions to the community yes even as noble pirates the galaxy will be all that much better off that why i joined the paladin consortium whose mission is to guide the lost and protect the weak just this weekend i had my first practical assist an adder spinning aimlessly around lawson orbital bumped into me as i was undocking i sent a comms invite to him and discovered he was playing with a friend for a bit and went out on his own only to get lost he was trying to get back to trevithick but had no clue how i winged up with him and guided him back explaining the core game concepts on the way he was very appreciative and seemed to already enjoy the game more now that he understood it better it really is a rewarding feeling when you help someone like this and with the sale and upcoming expansions there will be plenty of people to help soon enough fly kindly cmdrs o7,10,EliteOne

Schneider21,it sounds like a bug when you have an assassination contract active there a chance for the target to spawn any time you low wake into a destination may be increased chance for certain types like uss etc no fire zones are probably intended more as protection from being pvp would so your target action of firing on you likely was not recognized by the game as being in violation of the rule it may be worth it to report the bug to frontier https forums frontier co uk forumdisplay php f 105 and see if they respond with a better answer ,1,EliteOne

Schneider21,fixed i i think ,2,EliteOne
Schneider21,great response although i like to recommend trading or even light smuggling when starting out i am willing to wager the pirate who attacked you was an npc player cmdrs who are pirating you are a bit more patient and prompt a response while player seal clubbers would have just ganked you without saying anything these type of players are thankfully few and far between ,1,EliteOne
Schneider21,welcome those are quite the questions and unfortunately i am just heading out the door take a gander through some of the links on the sidebar here to get started and i will report back in a bit with specific answers to your questions when i get a chance fly safe cmdr o7,1,EliteOne
Schneider21,not sure what happened to the original clip video http xboxdvr com gamer schneider21 video 17467629 ,2,EliteOne
Schneider21,i have only just joined them really getting my elite on in the last few days but the reason i did was because of what they stand for much like the respectable fuel rats the paladins are very focused on making the game fun for new cmdrs so many mmo style games die off because of a toxic minority that ruin the experience for many ensuring new players have a great initial experience is the only way to ensure the community continues to grow which only benefits the rest of us as well thanks for the words of support ,3,EliteOne
Schneider21,i am only a hobbyist game developer so this is more of an educated guess than anything the landing computer pretty much just turns your ship into an npc ship using the same path finding and behavioral instructions they use when docking the scene geometry has collider that the ai finds routes around through and trigger areas that would notify the ship to deploy landing gear descend vertically etc as in anything with development it only insanely complex at a high level when you break it down into individual tasks it much simpler ,1,EliteOne
Schneider21,the group founder big pappa says the definition of a paladin is would efender of a cause our group was founded on the principle of helping others and i believe that truly defines the character of each and every paladin now it time for us to properly embrace that role on may 8th of this year the paladin fleet set out to embark on this next chapter of their existence by making their way to the starter systems where every new player flies out of the station in their free sidewinder and tries to make their first 10 000 credits the paladin role will be to assist these players in any way they can offering them advice teaching winging and simple high waking tactics assisting new commanders in res sites to increase their earnings and when need be standing between them and those that would harm them to show them that open play is not as dangerous as it can appear bp goes on to say i fully believe that this expansion will define the next chapter in the existence of one of the most noble and selfless groups in the elite community and every paladin will help to guide the hand of the scribe that will be documenting their journey together into the dark unknown as long as there are paladins around there will always be light to guide the way for every commander in the galaxy the paladin fleet will be actively working with frontier and their galactic academy initiative to further assist new commanders by hosting various events tailored to those just becoming familiar with their new universe ,3,EliteOne
Schneider21,i did not even know those were a thing good share ,2,EliteOne
Schneider21,i have not actually played in a wing yet new to the faction thing and none of my friends play yet so i cannot help you there i will let you know once i do though if you have not figured it out by then fuel rats are a great group of people who really get into the role playing side of things and also enjoy helping players it common for new cmdrs to get stuck without fuel and the rats help them out of kindness there is no pay involved but you can freel free to donate to them on their website http fuelrats com if you feel compelled they have a whole process for getting into your game instance when you need them at which point they use fuel limpets to give their fuel to you ,2,EliteOne
Schneider21,exactly pirating is not and should not be about just attacking anyone you run into that just being a jerk my first rare goods trip running stills from jaques back to the starting systems i was nervous as hell all of my funds were tied up in that cargo if i had gotten interdicted by a cmdr pirate i would have gladly given up a percentage of my cargo to at least make it back and break even on the investment otherwise i would have been starting over with a sidey which was a total thrill to be risking ,4,EliteOne
Schneider21,not a problem it a lot to take in and we are here to help the sidewinder you start out in is small and limited in how much you can outfit it with luckily there no penalty for selling off mods and replacing them with others as you get the full cost of the mod back when you sell it so if you want to try mining sell off your discovery scanner and even your shield generator if you are feeling bold and throw a refinery and some extra cargo holds in there when you want to try bounty hunting sell all your mining equipment back and go for weapons and armor exploring get that scanner back and pick up a fuel scoop and some tanks by the time you figure out what you enjoy best you will be able to afford a bigger ship with more slots available for outfitting in a way that allows mixed style playing i do not believe there a player player trade system built in best you could do at this stage would be to drop cargo near each other and just trust they wo not screw you over p many people here use discord link in sidebar to communicate i have not tried it yet but it provides voice channels so you could use that there a phone app too if your computer is not handy to team up most people join a faction and coordinate efforts that way you will have to add each other as friends through the xbox system and then you will see each other in the game to ensure you are in the same instances when arriving at stations and while in supercruise you will want to join the same wing which is basically like an xbox party ,2,EliteOne
Schneider21,no one wants to see your asp hole nice album though cannot wait to come across my first black hole someday ,2,EliteOne
Schneider21,welcome i found mining to be a bit difficult to understand at first too basically though if you went with the cheapest refinery you could get it only has one hopper for processing a single material type at a time so if you zap off a chunk of rock that contains two different materials as most do i believe whichever one was higher will go into the hopper while the other goes into a sort of purgatory area i believe you have to vent that in your right panel before you can collect any more material to process better refineries can process multiple types at a time and are worth investing in additionally you can get collection limpets to collect the little chunks for you i was hesitant to join open play at first also you work so hard early on to earn money and get a better ship and you are deathly afraid of losing it and having to more or less start over however i have recently switched to playing open only and while there the added excitement of potentially running into other hostile players so far other cmdrs have left me to my own affairs your rebuy cost is not too high yet so it worth checking out at least and giving it a shot agreed on the ridiculousness of rescuing stranded pilots being a crime if you have the smartglass app for your phone you can leave that open and when you bring up the text box for chat or searching in the galaxy map the app will bring up the keyboard on your phone or you can plug an actual usb keyboard into your xbox and type that way if you prefer fly safe cmdr o7,1,EliteOne
Schneider21,1 arena is a standalone client for engaging in cqc battles open play is what many would consider the actual game and is indeed multiplayer 2 a good question and answered below 3 the sidebar here has a few links to give you an idea on what to do but it depends on what you want to do it a lot to be covered by a single guide hopefully others will know of a source i do not that may be what you are looking for 4 you can ferry goods from port to port in order to make some cash or accept missions from the bulletin board at stations if you go to a port and do not have any missions offered it means you do not qualify for any they currently have check a different port or come back to that one later the game does have a steep learning curve and it definitely a sandbox that forces you to find your own fun stick with it though and just try doing everything you can and you will get the hang of it in no time ,3,EliteOne
Schneider21,thanks for bringing me on board guys i look forward to helping out with this exciting and very unique community edit i hate myself for writing very unique just now ,5,EliteOne
Schneider21,i do not think the current system is too far off if pirating were more lucrative and safer everyone would be a pirate it certainly more exciting than trading or mining and if everyone was out pirating there would be nobody but npcs to rob i think it could use fleshing out a bit more which i believe will happen over the course of future expansions but as far as holding someone up demanding cargo and getting coffee well that on you for not cargo scanning them and selecting a bountiful target is not it ,3,EliteOne
Schneider21,that or you have to wait 8 weeks for it to be automatically collected for you which would be an even bigger kick in the groin if you were making your way out to beagle point to collect and did not get there in time only to have the money transferred 3 4 of the way there ,2,EliteOne

Schneider21,weird i definitely do not have any functions assigned to rb or lb in my y menu i will look again tonight to confirm ,1,EliteOne
Schneider21,sorry when i say combo menu i mean any of the face buttons a b x y and they are associated popup menus when held my y menu has nothing mapped to the lb or rb so i am betting i had cleared those out when i first started playing eons ago haha ,1,EliteOne
Schneider21,this is an intriguing idea if the purchase origin is tied to the system you purchased from and not the station though as i assume it is it may still be worth stocking up on stills and dragging them all the way back to jaques sell him his own stills back for several million per tonne ,1,EliteCG
Schneider21,hm i wonder if i just botched my mapping or something because i looked through all the combo menus last night and did not see it guess i should look at the controls menu tonight thanks ,1,EliteOne
Schneider21,when do you generally play i am on the east coast us and play from around 9pm to midnight i have a functioning mic but cannot use it due to the copilot wife sleeping next to me ,2,EliteOne
Schneider21,i believe i read somewhere that 1 6 will add the option to bind rebind controllers for any function so it may be worth holding out to see if this will solve the issue what is the problem with pips on xb though ,1,EliteOne
Schneider21,that what i was considering but understood there was not a way to easily do this quite yet it only available as a setting in the pause menu right not in the right panel ,1,EliteOne

Schneider21,i used it briefly it okay if you only plan to do occasional code related stuff but if you plan on working with web stuff regularly it worth investing a bit of time into something like atom it has a bit of a learning curve to get the most out of it but it will save you a lot of time and frustration in the long run ,1,EliteOne
Schneider21,right but other pc players from friendly factions could do it yes ,3,EliteOne
Schneider21,os x has textedit but there better editors that provide syntax highlighting available for free like atom or sublime ,2,EliteOne
Schneider21,is it that big of a deal someone else can repair it cannot they do people actually enjoy all this silly feuding between player factions or is it something they do out of spite and real world anger ,-1,EliteOne
Schneider21,i have to say i have been having a lot of fun making quick fuel runs for this cg i even made enough selling cartography data to upgrade my ship enough to make the trip to zarya manas in 4 hops instead of the previous 7 anyone have an idea of how many tonnes it might take to jump from the 90th percentile to the 60th ,3,EliteOne

Schneider21,how do turbolifts and gravity work on the death star is the whole station set to use artificial gravity with one of the poles being up while the other is down or is it like a normal planet with down being towards the core the shot of the falcon being pulled into the hanger bay seemed to suggest that straight out from the hanger was empty space and since the falcon landed on a surface perpendicular to the core it seems to suggest the polar up down idea ,235,Showerthoughts

Schneider21,allison rapp is a former marketing specialist for nintendo before being dismissed she was hounded by members of gamergate her feminist viewpoints and over issues not even directly connected to her for example with localization of xenoblade chronicles x changes including removal of skimpy outfits on young female characters and an adjustable breast size slider trolls uncovered a paper she had written in which she suggests that western morals and beliefs should not be imposed on other cultures which the trolls claimed suggested rapp endorsed child pornography and pedophilia nintendo made no public statement on the matter until firing her which rapp alleges is directly related to the insistence by the harassers it a huge deal because women in technology fields already face so much discrimination and unfair treatment and the same outcome if it were a man being harassed seems unlikely ,-3,OutOfTheLoop

Schneider21,i am sure it all added up in jamie conscience and everything but i do not believe he would have killed aerys if it was not to end the war and judging by the contempt everyone held for him afterwards it seems unlikely that another member of the kingsguard would have done him in otherwise it would be fascinating to see an alternate timeline in which ned had said no to be sure maybe if jj abrams ever makes a reboot of game of thrones we will find out ,1,dataisbeautiful
Schneider21,probably what people thought of young aerys too ,2,dataisbeautiful
Schneider21,sure but not from the tiny amount you get from water vapor you would involuntarily cough it out far before it got to the point of being a danger you would likely even expel a good bit just by breathing ,2,explainlikeimfive
Schneider21,yes but ned had nothing to do with it cersei was likely the one who engineered his demise and would have done so whether or not ned was wearing the pin or not ,10,dataisbeautiful
Schneider21,the books also point out clearly that cersei was a bitch long before she was married to robert she twisted baby tyrion niblets out of pure cruelty and anger felt at her mother death i do not think aerys would necessarily have died if ned had not joined the war with robert dead the rebellion would have been crushed and their armies would not have been marching into king landing prompting the mad king to order his pyromancers to burn them all which in turn incited jamie to slay him so assuming the targaryens were still in power with the mad king at the helm things may have still been progressively worse without ned involvement which i am sure was something seriously considered by ned before deciding to join in robert war ,21,dataisbeautiful

Schneider21,since the major turn off for 3d tvs for me at this point is having to wear the glasses around what is stopping us from making a tv that uses the 3d technology found in the nintendo 3ds since you have to be at an exact position to be able to get the 3d effect the tv could have a built in kinect like sensor which would be able to determine your distance and position and adjust the image accordingly so you could get the 3d effect no matter where in the room you are thoughts ,1,technology
