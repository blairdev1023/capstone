TinysocksB,i am not trying to be sexist here buuut and obviously this concept does not apply to this situation as they are children but men being expected to protect women is a thing because it worked way back when we were still living in caves men are the stronger sex women are vulnerable especially when pregnant so the female must be protected to ensure the offspring survival and preserve the species i think for a lot of people this is still the natural way of thinking because it is a natural reflex of sorts i would wager that most men in this thread should an intruder break into their home would spring to protect their families whilst the woman mother would gather the children and flee for help just food for thought tldr the concept of women fleeing and men standing their ground is not sexist but a natural reflex probably ,2,interestingasfuck

TinysocksB,10k per match that is an incredibly low score you get 5k just for escaping if you want a high score you need to do more than just survive you need to also allow yourself to be hooked chased and hit by the killer if you spend all game hiding and doing gens your score will be incredibly low ,-1,deadbydaylight

TinysocksB,you say you have around 1200 hrs in game angrypug has around 1 719 hrs and has multiple piii characters same with 72hrs i think the issue here is not game time put in but rather skill if you are hitting around 20k per match the bloodwebs are easy to unlock we do not need dbp all the time the grind is only hard for those that play poorly and without it there would be no player base until new dlc releases no grind no player base dead game ,-12,deadbydaylight

TinysocksB,dude maybe you should just git gud ,12,deadbydaylight
TinysocksB,are they though i have had no problems at all with swf matchmaking the last few days but i am wondering if that is more to do with the dlc release and shorter queue times due to everyone wanting to play the new killer ,1,deadbydaylight
TinysocksB,new killer dlc just released paid and a survivor left for dead dlc free there was a large update recently which changed the ui and fixed a ton of glitches problems including swf matchmaking also buffs debuffs to certain perks and killers wraith hag sadly this new dlc has unleashed a ton of new bugs into the mix self care is not triggering anymore and i was recently unable to leave two games in a row and ran around the outside of the map for a good ten minuets but this is to be expected with a new dlc release overall game has undergone a ton of improvements and is well worth your time to give it another shot ,3,deadbydaylight

TinysocksB,i agree with you the dr is weak against good survivors who know how to juke the dr excels in finding survivors but not catching them his abilities are great fun against new rank 20 players but experienced survivors will find him no challenge at all devs will likely buff him in coming weeks so fingers crossed the dr can still be salvaged ,4,deadbydaylight

TinysocksB,dlc is out right now dude ,3,deadbydaylight
TinysocksB,this is a nice idea maybe this is where the dr will shine in the hands of an experienced and cunning killer ,-1,deadbydaylight
TinysocksB,i agree the dr needs a slower build to madness iii which should also have far more impact he just is not punishing enough he is great for new killers who need help locating survivors but he is no better at catching them than any other killer ,6,deadbydaylight
TinysocksB,he lacks impact for experienced players whilst the dr excels at finding survivors he can be juked just as easily as all the other killers the dr has the potential to be a real threat to swf groups with the hallucinations and other effects but they are just lackluster right now ,5,deadbydaylight
TinysocksB,i like the idea of inverting the survivors controls for 3 seconds upon reaching madness 3 ,5,deadbydaylight

TinysocksB,you may actually be right i was thinking it was an additional asylum map as it definitely gives off that hospital vibe but smith grove sanitarium would also be a good fit people have already noted the similarities in decor to the lampkin lane map it does seem weird to have two separate asylum based locations though still very nice suggestion ,2,deadbydaylight
TinysocksB,the devs wo not do that because it too comical and they want to maintain immersion simple hospital gowns are in keeping with the theme of the game and the asylum maps i think they would make a nice addition ,5,deadbydaylight

TinysocksB,your inclusion of pagan worship makes for a really interesting response thank you i remember reading something about sun worship years ago and its connection to the son of god and the parallels between jesus christ and the egyptian god ra however i do not know if that holds any merit or is even relevant here u uchihakengura42 has suggested that the concept of a magic holy grail originates from medieval times which pairs nicely with your answer citing pagan england i suppose this answers my question of where why the legend itself originated so thank you ,2,explainlikeimfive
TinysocksB,thanks for your reply i have done a little of my own research and it seems that upposedly after christ was crucified the cup he reportedly used at the last supper was used again to collect his blood i suppose if you believed him to truly be the son of god it would make sense that his blood possessed magical abilities this legend is believed to have medieval arthurian origins possibly relating to king arthur and the knights of the round table as you mentioned in your reply is there some connection between the knights of the round table and the knights templar ,1,explainlikeimfive
