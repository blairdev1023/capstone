blhylton,depends on the severity i have had a sinus infection where i was admitted to the hospital due to high fever also sinus infections can lead to something worse if not treated but in our contextual example the minimum wage worker does not have the money to go to the doctor nor to fill the prescription i am also not sure how i feel about food service workers continuing to work if they are sick regardless of what it is and how minor it may be ,1,LifeProTips
blhylton,i guess we will because i do not view health care as something you do or do not deserve especially since we are contextually talking about people who could lose all means of living if they catch a simple sinus infection ,1,LifeProTips

blhylton,where i live there a 40 month infrastructure fee just to have electricity i have lived in studio apartments here and my lowest power bill i have ever gotten was 75 the landline information may be old because the last time i had one was 6 years ago and it was required by my job at the time and there may have been additional features i had to have for that job that aside let use your numbers 510 out of 740 month is spent on utilities that leaves you with 230 to purchase food for a month clothing either purchase or maintain and figure out transportation as i said it is doable if you never get sick or injured but as soon as you have a doctor bill and are out of work for a day or two you are screwed ,1,LifeProTips
blhylton,if you think 185 ish week assuming a 30 hour week because most minimum wage places wo not hire full time after taxes is a livable wage in an area where the cheap apartments are 450 month with no utilities included i am not sure what to say that leaves you with 290 per month to pay electricity which will be between 80 120 buy food and clothes and pay for transportation to and from work on top of that most jobs are not going to hire you without some kind of phone line and unless something has changed from the last time i had to have a landline they usually run about 90 month unless you get them packaged internet or tv this all might be doable if you manage to never get sick or injured ,1,LifeProTips

blhylton,alright you are not wrong still does not change the fact that the primary was not and is not a straight popular vote i never said anything about it helping or hurting sanders just that after all of the misunderstandings during the last primary about how the primaries work the last thing we need is to spread misinformation ,1,politics
blhylton,i was a supervisor so i was making a little not much mind you more than minimum wage in a small city where your job options are basically call center fast food walmart or other retail i was in college at the time and call centers wo not work around that fast food places around me only offered about 20 hours per week walmart i averaged 30 at least but the schedule was so sporadic that you could not hold a second job and most other retail either is low hours 10 20 or has very little turnover so they are hard to actually land the job even the walmart i was at was turning away about 3 4ths of their applications because they did not need people also i hate the company and their ethics the job itself was not any worse than any other retail job ,2,esist
blhylton,did they i read the article but it was long and i had not been awake for very long so i may have missed it also are they corroborating the information in the report or are they saying that the fact that it was an nsa report prior to the arrest happening has been corroborated ,1,news
blhylton,please read the edit at the bottom i was being unintentionally ambiguous i meant that the information is legitimately from a classified source in other words legitimizing its authenticity not that it was verified or accurate ,2,news
blhylton,okay let back this up first you said its frustrating people were not taking this stuff seriously earlier and then you started talking about circumstantial evidence being admissible in court i should have called this out when i responded to the last statement but i thought maybe you were going somewhere with this but now it obvious that this is either a red herring or you are attempting to move the goal posts from people should have taken this seriously to this should already be a court case to the first argument people have been taking it seriously but the best thing to do is to allow the various intelligence and investigative agencies to do their job and keep pressure on them to do their job if you have reason to believe that they are not they are better equipped to deal with and have way more information regarding these matters than the general public to the second argument unless you have some information that i do not prior to yesterday the only evidence that we have is hearsay which does not typically qualify as evidence there are exceptions but i do not believe any of those would apply we have a credible witness coming up soon that could change that comey but until his testimony is entered into record then we as the public do not know what he is going to say and do not know that his testimony contains evidence of anything furthermore you are attempting to apply america court procedural laws to an international incident which has it own set of rules lastly yes circumstantial evidence is admissible as evidence and can be strong with enough corroboration but that depends on the circumstances hence the name surrounding the evidence being presented ,0,politics
blhylton,yes but if all you have is circumstantial evidence then you have a very weak case and it not likely that you will be able to convince a judge or jury of anything assuming that the court even agrees to hear your case taking circumstantial evidence too seriously is how the alt right was able to push the pizzagate narrative and i do not feel like we should sink to that level ,2,politics
blhylton,not really delegates represent a district if 100 people vote in the primary for that district or if 100 000 people vote in that district it still one delegate districts are supposed to be drawn so that a delegate is roughly equivalent based on population but in practice that not typically the case ,1,politics
blhylton,i see what he saying my original post was poorly worded and ambiguous i have edited it to hopefully clarify you are correct in what i was meaning when i said legitimate ,2,news
blhylton,this is what i was meaning to imply with legitimate and actually with my entire statement i guess i was not quite as clear as i had hoped i meant that the leak was legitimately a leak but that we do not have the information to know if the contents were verified ,2,news
blhylton,i feel like a decent number of people were taking it seriously but without some sort of credible intelligence it falls into the category of hearsay and acting on hearsay other than to investigate it further does not help anyone ,18,politics
blhylton,assuming that this intelligence is correct and accurate results were tampered with we just do not know if it was direct or indirect without more information suppressing the vote in areas likely to vote for clinton has the same result as changing the numbers just with a bit more uncertainty ,1,news

blhylton,if they are arresting leakers it means that classified information was leaked and that the information leaked is legitimate anything else is speculation since there is much more information that is not leaked and we are not privy to that could change the meaning of the leaked information edit based on some replies to this i guess i was not quite as clear as i had hoped i meant that the leak was legitimately a leak and the information is legitimately from a classified document but that we do not have the information to know if the contents were verified or accurate intelligence ,267,news

blhylton,right i did not mean to imply that that had not happened i was on mobile could not think of a way to say that succinctly and hate typing on mobile i meant that i wonder if the questioning she got from the secret service was enough to make her backpedal i am with you it obviously not a credible threat but if trump was pissed about it he may have told them to lay into her he is their boss so at his order she may have gotten a harsher questioning session than nugent and that may have been what made her go maybe i should apologize before this man baby actually tries to pin something on me or the like ,2,esist

blhylton,to most outsiders this sort of thing happens because e cigarettes exist at all not because the labelling is not up to snuff i am not yelling at the other side so much as i am yelling at the media for painting us in this light and pinning blame on us when the fault is on both sides as you said it the parent job to teach their kids and it our job to clean up the image of our community the article only focused on one side of that though and that what frustrates me and makes me push back i am not saying that we do not have our part but i am saying that even if we do our part and something like this happens again we will see the same kind of articles vilifying us ,0,electronic_cigarette
blhylton,oh 100 i just cannot be complacent with such shoddy and misleading reporting i feel like allowing them to say these things without pointing out that the labelling may have not made a difference since you know the kid is eating random things they found on the ground is just as much a problem as the labelling itself what if it was a candy bar that someone had tainted some how would we be having conversations about how candy should not be marketed to children because we cannot trust them not to eat things they find on the ground i know that a bit contrived because presumably no one tainted this e liquid but it the best way i can illustrate my point that allowing the media to blame this solely on the label without at least arguing the point is not in our best interest ,1,electronic_cigarette
blhylton,i am not disagreeing at all that it needs to be changed i just cannot bring myself to be complacent to the media placing blame on something that may not have even mattered and i feel like saying well they are kind of right you know instead of pointing out the flaws in the article is giving them just as much ammunition as the labels do in the first place ,0,electronic_cigarette
blhylton,and i am not in disagreement i am frustrated that the article is written to make it sound like this is normal for a kid to do and that this is the fault of e liquid and or the label ,1,electronic_cigarette
blhylton,no i understand what you are saying i am more speaking about my frustration at the article making it seem like this was the label or the liquid fault and that kids consuming things they find laying around in public is completely normal ,1,electronic_cigarette
blhylton,that a valid enough point but this makes it not specific at all to e liquid what if it had been a flavored codeine suspension which still has the sweet smell and flavor would we still be having this conversation about labeling i agree we should be more conscious about it but the fact that a kid picked it up off the ground and drank it speaks less to the labeling and more to the intelligence of kids ,1,electronic_cigarette

blhylton,then that what the investigation should show if that the case there no reason to delay that by firing the person in charge especially so suddenly and without a replacement if this were truly about ineptitude related to the clinton email scandal then he had plenty of time to have a replacement lined up the timing and circumstances make this seem hurried and frantic like a cover up which is why so many people myself included are viewing it as suspect and demanding a better explanation and more thorough investigation ,7,SandersForPresident
blhylton,i did not care for comey either for a number of reasons but it not the person that got fired that is causing the outrage it the timing i would be just as upset if trump had fired don knotts if he was the one leading the investigation related to possible treason ,8,SandersForPresident
blhylton,oh right i even go on to say in my next comment that i know some conservatives who are much more logical instead of emotional in their beliefs it just that from my perspective and experiences they are in the minority i could also just be jaded keep in mind that i was responding to a question that basically amounts to so why cannot we have a logical conversation about the issues with these people so i was using my anecdotes to illustrate why logic does not always prevail this is true of both sides of the aisle imo but that did not pertain to this particular conversation ,2,worldnews
blhylton,i agree and i wish i knew what to do but at this point a large number of them are effectively brainwashed and i wonder if there is a possibility of a return for them that said just so that it does not look like i am speaking ill of all conservatives even though i am painting with a broad brush i have friends and colleagues that are conservative and i have had conversations with them that are much more reasonable in actuality of the smarter conservatives i know it seems that we want the same things we just disagree on how to achieve them one example i always like to use is that we all tend to agree that we do not want the government meddling in every little thing and that the government should only step in in industries where private industry has failed or the public good is at stake for a failure where we differ is that i feel that the medical sector more specifically the insurance portion has failed in the private sector and puts the public good at risk if they continue to fail and the government should step in a la single payer or multi payer with a public option but they believe that it has failed because of over regulation and that the market should be more free to correct itself ,1,worldnews
blhylton,yeah that the rico case that a lot of people keep bringing up it a stretch to think that trump would get caught in that all though he is a bumbling idiot so it also would not surprise me if he is truly involved at all people are grasping at straws looking for hope ,1,politics
blhylton,speaking from what little i know about the specifics of that case and the fact that i am a layman and not a lawyer from my understanding we are not sure that trump is actually involved in that one just that this was happening from a condo on the 63rd floor of trump towers btw that where trump got his info that tt was bugged during the election it was but not listening to him and that there is a potential rico case being pursued the idea is that we all but know that trump had has ties to russia so it not a huge leap for him to at least be aware of that happening on his property if he was bribed to let it happen or was being paid some of the earnings then that would implicate him as well if my understanding of how criminal rico cases work is correct ,6,politics
blhylton,anecdotally speaking from my personal experience to a lot of conservatives the mexico thing is the issue it a level of racism that you only see in private conversation one day i was walking into the grocery store with a close relative and as we walked in a mexican mother and her three kids were walking out with a buggy full of groceries my relative unprompted as far as i am aware leaned over to me and whispered i bet she never worked a day in her life and that your and my tax dollars paying to feed her little shits probably is not even legal welcome to obama america to which i responded relative she a doctor at my doctor office well that does not make her legal now does it i wish i had a better explanation i really do i love my family and would love to know why they think this way but i have been trying for 15 years with my genetic family and nearly 5 now with my in laws and i just cannot understand it when i bring up something like what you did about the cops becoming part of the community to help with crime they say things like they do not want help all they know how to do is fight steal and sell drugs that just how those people are if i had to point fingers at the root cause of this most of them are older the younger generation is typically much further to the left or are republicans because their daddy is so i think i can safely link some of this to nixon and reagan war on drugs and the cia movements in the 80s and 90s being based around the idea of south and central american drug cartels there also the fact that a lot of them were alive or nearly alive when the civil rights act was enacted so some of that is simply holdovers from segregation i can also say with certainty that it has become much much worse since 2001 and the rise of fox news and their inflammatory statements as well ,2,worldnews
blhylton,real talk as someone who sounds like they are in line with left leaning or at least more in the center than the republicans on other issues how would you feel about something like a federal permit required to purchase firearms and ammo that the only requirement for was a background check with specific criteria not a felon no diagnosis of mental instability and similar the goal from my perspective and in my experience the perspective of a lot of progressives and leftists is simply better gun control not necessarily to make it more difficult to purchase and own than it already is this is a mostly off the cuff idea that i had and i likely cannot defend it all that well but i am curious about how pro 2a people would see something like that ,1,worldnews
blhylton,real paraphrased in some cases responses to those questions from my far right family members corporations give us jobs and allow us to continue living they need to have influence over government in order to make sure they have the money to continue doing so yes we spend far too much helping the mexicans and blacks and their welfare queens no our military is the source of the nation power and is the only thing keeping the muslims in check the arts and sciences only help make things more complicated no it the damn mexicans chinese and indians at least i can only assume they mean india when they say middle east yes china and mexico stole all of our manufacturing jobs because of nafta and clinton school these days is just a place for kids to get together and do drugs and have sex they do not teach anything that will help you in life so i do not see the point in funding them i also have to point out that they will then say with a straight face that they are not racist but everyone knows that that just how those people are i hate living in the south ,4,worldnews

blhylton, what bigger problems do we have and maybe more importantly why should people support candidates if they do not agree with them are you saying that any issue an individual deems important enough to guide their vote counts as a purity test if that the case then all the rhetoric against purity tests would seem to indicate that the democratic establishment simply wants their voter base to stop caring about any issues at all the bigger problem in a nutshell is that the country is drifting further and further to the corporate right because people are staying home and not voting because they do not feel like the progressive candidates are progressive enough i wish that we were in a perfect world where candidates could embody every issue that important to their constituents but in reality that can never happen meanwhile while we are bickering about who is and is not progressive enough with differing personal litmus tests the right and alt right are voting for the thing closest to their beliefs which is all i am really asking for obviously if someone is so far off your beliefs that you feel that they counter your idealism then do not support them but sometimes it is prudent to still vote for your closest match i will use myself and my area as an example i am in one of the reddest districts of tn we have not voted in anything other than a far right republican since the early 1800s given that i am likely to vote for any person remotely left or even center that has a chance of winning because it brings my area closer to my views this i think is the fracture it is certainly a problem for some democrats up for reelection that a significant portion of active progressives do not support them not all of us here would agree that it our problem i think that it great that people are excited to primary people like nancy pelosi but i do not think that this is as much a fracture within the progressive movement as it is a split within the democratic party in the case of pelosi and her district whoever wins the dem nomination will win the seat 99 999 of the time right so really the race is in the primary i have not been following that race closely admittedly so the rest of this is going to be a hypothetical scenario but say that there are 2 people in the primary to keep this simple pelosi and one semi progressive candidate some people will say that the progressive candidate is not progressive enough and stay home and if enough people do that pelosi wins that the problem with purity tests as far as having more than 2 i am not sure that we have a good answer to that short of a rally behind a particular candidate even if they are not the perfect match for us or b implement ranked choice voting or some other form of less spoilable voting something i just realized that may have framed this entire conversation incorrectly my initial post said the thing killing the progressive movement is the infighting when it should have been more if anything is killing the progressive movement it the infighting which does paint everything in a slightly different light ,1,SandersForPresident
blhylton, i certainly think people should be able to call tulsi or keith or dianne feinstein or bernie not progressive enough if that what they believe not really disagreeing here but the problem is that people are not debating this they are just talking about how they are not progressive at all and need to be replaced with no real examples i feel like we have bigger fish to fry and saying that these guys are so anti progressive that they need to be voted out who exactly has these purity tests and how are they a problem i have seen these things being stated here in the our revolution sub politics sees it a lot not that i trust anything there and various groups around the internet they are a problem because like i stated before we kind of have bigger problems than quibbling over well this person supports a public option instead of single payer so they are not progressive enough or bernie does not support nuclear power and that anti progressive i am not saying that the community is horribly fractured just that we have to be aware that there is a lot of bickering and well infighting to keep using the same phrasing that could lead to a fracture if we get too self righteous see what aiden was talking about that i originally responded to yeah he did something that a lot of people view as bad but he stepped down from all leadership and ultimately it does not really matter yet people still give him shit for it months later because he hurting the progressive movement the only thing that i think comes close to a litmus test among the progressive community is fighting the corrupting influence of big money in politics that is the only thing that separates liberals from progressives the establishment from us on the fringe 80 90 of the democratic party and all the independents that want our elected representatives to represent our interests and not corporate interests 100 with you there i think when establishment democrats say that purity tests are a problem they must either be deliberately trying to frame the progressive movement as fractured and this could be the explanation but the thing is there are still people are inherently progressive but they support establishment candidates and cause these problems they are not themselves anti progressive but they see the establishment dems as progressive enough that one fracture that could be a problem especially for midterms where we need every vote we can get ,1,SandersForPresident
blhylton,i am not saying we should let them off the hook just that the purity tests are a problem everyone has a slightly different idea of progressive and what it means to them and if we are not willing to budge at all then that causing infighting i have heard people talk about how sanders sold out after he lost the primary for instance i have heard people talk about keith ellison and tulsi gabbard not being progressive enough i was not a fan of clinton have never been and i did not vote for her i am tired of being thrown table scraps by the establishment and their ilk but if we are unwilling to at least reach a middle ground with the various progressive sects then i worry that we are in for 2 more years of the same come 2018 and 4 more years come 2020 i guess the point i am getting at is no candidate will ever be 100 perfect for everyone ideology but that seems to be what a lot of people are looking for and fighting over if we keep holding our breath and waiting for that candidate we allow the country to drift further to the right ,1,SandersForPresident
blhylton,regardless of the reason behind it the infighting is the problem while i do not tend to disagree with your sentiments pointing a finger is not going to help either ,0,SandersForPresident

blhylton,the way i handle this for roommate splits on bills is i run all expenses through splitwise to keep track of how much i am owed but once the money is spent in ynab it is spent when they pay me back i count it as to be budgeted this has the added benefit of notifying them when a bill is added to splitwise ,1,ynab

blhylton,so you have nothing but moving goalposts imagine that the country as a whole is moving towards the right here some lies and campaign rhetoric that proves you wrong that more towards the center and is campaign rhetoric anyway two can play the strawman card reply when you want to have a conversation about this like adults instead of slinging insults ,1,politics
blhylton, they just pushed for a single payer healthcare system for most of the first world single payer or universal healthcare of some sort that does not feed corporations free money is considered a centrist idea the fact that you are touting it as progressive is one indicator that the country has been moved to the right over the past several years i personally feel like policiticians use social issues like lgbt rights as a smokescreen to keep us fighting among ourselves and they are things that the parties can support or object to without using much political capital to keep their base happy while i wo not deny the importance of this i feel like it a piece of candy they drop every once in a while when they feel like the base is beginning not to like them green energy is again a centrist idea according to most of the world i am more viewing this from an economic perspective most politicians are bought and paid for and want to keep it that way this is on both sides of the aisle look into the clinton third way democrats from the 90 and the corporate economic policy behind that i really cannot think of a single issue that the democrats have moved to the right on dropping the public option from the aca in order to appease insurance companies and the republicans even thought they had a congressional super majority at the time is one that comes to mind without too much thought relaxing the medicare expansion rules alongside that so that many states refused to expand medicare and there were a lot of people left without insurance who could not afford it but did not qualify not to mention all the things you have mentioned are rhetoric hillary may have had a great plan but obama had a great plan for a single payer healthcare system in the 2008 primaries general so why do not we have that now using a politician campaign promises to say that they are progressive does not typically hold water ,2,politics
blhylton,so the dnc has 0 control over how and when people can register for their party and how their primary election is conducted sounds a bit odd to me like i said prior all in the past anyway and there no use dwelling on what if and what could have been ,1,SandersForPresident
blhylton,because there money to be made from companies that benefit from reduced regulation or are you asking what i am seeing that makes me think that we are moving right ,3,politics
blhylton,i am making that assumption because the party and the country leadership as a whole has been pushing right for decades now due to corporate influence the only stick carrot we have is our vote and if we are just going to give it to them anyway why should they listen ,3,politics
blhylton,conversely why should they cave to pressure to move left if you have already shown that they have the progressive vote regardless ,4,politics
blhylton,fair enough not op anyway i just saw one way to interpret it if i had to guess the ignoring the popular vote that most people cite is more about super delegates selecting clinton regardless of the popular vote of their state although that would not have made a difference without better media coverage and generally better handling of the whole mess ,9,SandersForPresident
blhylton,i would argue that due to the dnc draconian party registration laws in certain states sanders was robbed of votes that could have put him over the edge that not to mention the mess that was nevada arizona etc it in the past at this point though so as much as i like what if s 2018 is more important than squabbling over what could have been ,11,SandersForPresident

blhylton,yeah i personally dislike the precedent that it sets and i really wanted it for that reason it also begs the question why the isps were so dead set on getting it removed that they spent what they did which is why the paranoia is setting in also looking back i may have misread your original post which caused the confusion i was on mobile on my lunch break at the time and skimming posts mea culpa ,1,politics
blhylton,my response to you was simply that your isp does not use your ip address to identify you if you believe that an ip address is how you are identified then you are mistaken that said in response to your other statements i was saying that your isp is not going out and saying blhylton is surfing on these sites they are not even providing ip addresses names physical addresses to the buyers of this data they are providing people in this state city are surfing these sites etc there nothing stopping them from doing this for the right amount of money without protections in place which was what the fcc was offering and what was shut down now it would be foolish to think that under normal circumstances anyone would pay an exorbitant amount of money to get the records for an average user but to imply that it will not can not happen is just as foolish every site that you go to can look at what is in your cookies cache etc this is wrong unless you are using a really antiquated browser that i am not familiar with that uses a non standard js rendering engine a site can only look at the cookies and cache for its domain there are ways to do what you are talking about but those of us in the tech industry call that malware and any competent anti malware software scans for that sort of thing how do you think that those advertisements that are targeted to you come up considering that i work for a digital marketing firm as a developer i know exactly how they are targeted and it has nothing to do with your isp and everything to do with facebook google reddit et al selling your data with your permission to do so who reads eulas anyway this fcc rule that you are screaming about being taken down is not even in place yet your data has been being sold for years if you want to protect against that the only option is to use a private vpn always has been always will be or obviously stop using the internet i wish vpns were more practical for certain applications that said if you are really wanting to keep your data from being sold a vpn alone is not enough ,1,politics

blhylton,agreed but a lot of them seem squeamish at gold plat ,1,OverwatchUniversity
blhylton,yeah although the shield tends to die before your rein so quick reflexes could sleep the enemy rein to allow yours to distance himself if the enemy team is not following up the way they should granted this requires that you time everything perfectly so the attacking team has the advantage i have also noticed that most reins will wait until they have the bubble to charge in if they set this up which means that in a lot of cases the zarya shield is broken before the pin actually happens lots of variables overall good video just stating my personal experiences with similar ideas ,1,OverwatchUniversity
blhylton,there a vast difference between rewarding reward able behavior and giving out participation trophies ,2,Competitiveoverwatch
blhylton, your ana grenade will not cleanse the enemy ana grenade unfortunately oh of course i meant try to do it preemptively if the enemy rein is not bubbled or otherwise immune to beat any healing that might reach him of course a sleep dart is even better but that not always practical for various reasons ,1,OverwatchUniversity
blhylton,huh i have been doing half of this as ana for a while and occasionally the zarya will follow suit i honestly did not really think of it as a strategy so much as it just makes sense to chance edit chase your rein in with the grenade and same for zarya to bubble someone diving in the flipside is also good if a rein dives in and pins your rein as ana use your grenade assuming you cannot sleep him for some reason to negate the enemy ana grenade ,2,OverwatchUniversity
blhylton,i tend to say this when doing 1v1s but never bothered in regular matches for some reason ,2,OverwatchUniversity

blhylton,the way i handle it is to use another tool to keep track of it and do not track it in ynab i handle my apartment bills through splitwise to keep track of how much i am owed or how much i owe though that rarely happens and when i pay a bill i just count it as money spent in ynab and when they pay me back it counts as income ,3,ynab
blhylton,how does that relate to the conversation i am saying in the here and now that it is no longer a gamble that we have the ability to back out of so we should make the best of it ,1,politics
blhylton,that not what i am saying i am saying that the gamble has already happened saying this is a gamble we should not take is like trying to tell a bookie you should get a refund because your horse lost you already took the gamble and the opportunity to back out is gone ,1,politics
blhylton, are not going to destroy our alliances or get us into a nuclear war i cannot be so sure of that i just think that if they do send us to war they will have some way to justify it remember the last time a republican was president we started three wars and the only reason there was not outrage was because the public was convinced they were justifiable are not going to destroy the government ryan became famous because he spear headed the government shutdown over the aca and has been a champion of privatizing most of the functions of government pence admittedly is slightly better on this front but only slightly pence also has the bonus of being extremely unpopular pence had a better approval rating as governor than trump has as president i have not seen anything on his approval rating as vp ryan might be a lot more popular hard to tell because congressional approval ratings continue to fall and without being truly elected by the nation ryan may still be viewed as a member of that failing congress ,2,politics
blhylton,thank you i honestly did not even know what to search for to find the answer to that ,1,politics
blhylton,i agree but i personally feel like that gamble was taken when trump won the election and that short of going through minimum three impeachments which has never happened and unlikely to happen given the timeframe we are stuck with that until at least 2020 ,1,politics
blhylton,also a valid point that i had not thought of ,1,politics
blhylton, saying pence is not any better is nonsense pence wants a lot of the same things except he knows how to get them and not destroy his public image because he knows how to play the game saying the two people are exactly the same is nonsense i never said that and i actually pointed out one contrasting point between them ,1,politics
blhylton,it would not surprise me but at the same time when is the last time an incumbent president did not run for office he would risk appearing weak and that would bruise his ego so it a bit of a toss up ,2,politics
blhylton,again not disagreeing i just believe that pence and or ryan would do just as much damage but with the key difference that they know how to politic so it would not appear as bad to a layman ,1,politics
blhylton,for 2018 i hope so but him getting impeached in early 2019 and having nearly 2 years without him may make them apathetic again i agree that they are doing a ton of damage i just do not know that impeaching him would help because i feel like we will see the same damage from his successor s they will just be more subtle about it ,1,politics
blhylton,honestly i hope he does not get impeached for a few reasons 1 pence is not really any better neither is ryan if it comes to that 2 if he gets impeached by a democratic congress that will just rile up his base and we will see someone just as bad have the same shot in 2024 assuming the incumbent runs in 2020 3 him staying in office is still our best bet to get someone with progressive policies in in 2020 because while pence and ryan are just as bad they are politicians so they would know how to handle the office better and will overall have a better public image ,11,politics

blhylton,yeah i am definitely not saying that they do not exist but you typically have to pay a premium for it and in academia they do not see the need when they can just add another adapter and save some scratch to pocket ,3,pcmasterrace
blhylton,i have seen that a lot on pcs too on campuses most laptops do not have vga or dvi out and a lot of projectors in use in academia do not have hdmi or minidisplayport in for whatever reason it in these situations would rather buy adapters that you daisy chain together instead of replacing adapters just so they do not have to find a use for the old adapters and answer to higher ups why they are throwing them out ,5,pcmasterrace

blhylton,it was not just eastman there were a number of companies that complained what ultimately happened was that the students in question basically copy pasted their way through and never actually learned what they were doing so the department underwent some pretty rapid changes over a summer i do not remember all the details but i do remember that they implemented a lot of new department policies to ensure that students understood the material instead of just regurgitating it and they asked a lot of the old guard faculty to resign retire all in all for the better but it was still messy ,1,battlestations
blhylton,etsu i think i can see that on the diploma if so i was there when they changed the name from computer science to computing it not something the faculty talks about but there was a class around 2007 that some how graduated with the b s in comp sci and did not know jack shit and gave the degree a bad name so they changed it in order to rebrand the department ,1,battlestations

blhylton,cowboy bebop is one of my favorite series of all time and the one that really got me started in anime there are several parts that drew me in given the timeframe for the release it was incredibly well animated the characters were relatively deep but you are left to fill in the blanks a lot which makes for an engaging experience while the show is episodic it did imo a masterful job in weaving all of the parts together to make a space epic instead of just purely standalone stories ,2,anime

blhylton,yeah but for some people that worth it look at it this way if you have enough money to pay someone to do all this for you keep in mind that water cooling and cable sleeving are time consuming and can be a pita and support it for a few years after so that you are not the only person liable if something goes wrong then it your prerogative if you want to spend the extra i have been building pcs for close to 15 years now as a hobby so i personally would not pay for it but i never understood the hate for someone who has the money and does not want to be hassled with learning the diy ways ,1,pcmasterrace
blhylton,the same hardware that is in this is roughly worth 5k before water cooling is it worth it no but to imply that you can get the same hardware for under 2k is disingenuous ,2,pcmasterrace

blhylton,oh so you were saying it while both sides were mudslinging and saying whatever to make the other side look less appealing that will certainly make your cause stronger i am still waiting for apologies from people that said the same thing about obama ,1,Political_Revolution
blhylton,but by saying it so soon after his election particularly without citing sources and drawing comparisons between historic events makes it sound like a knee jerk reaction to his election instead of a valid concern in turn you are hurting your cause more than helping it by unintentionally invalidating your own voice again this is primarily constructive criticism which is why i am not attack the actual substance but if that is your end goal there are a lot of things that would be a better use of your time than ranting on an online forum ,1,Political_Revolution
blhylton,let assume for the moment that i agree with you what are you accomplishing by saying something so early by making these statements at this point you sound like someone who is simply butthurt and if more signs appear further down the line you will sound like you have been crying wolf all along so no one will believe you ,1,Political_Revolution
blhylton,i think the point we disagree on is that trump is a backlash to decades of neoconservatism instead of the logical next step to it also worth noting everyone keeps saying that trump is tyrannical when he has not even taken office yet we have to put up with 4 years of it regardless barring impeachment and removal so we may as well see what he going to do do not get me wrong i hated the things he said and did during his campaign as much as the next person but he did win the election ,1,Political_Revolution

blhylton, i think its the 3rd way democrats that i have been starting to hate due to the drivel they spew that the majority of democrats nowadays the ones that focus on pointless social policies gay marriage abortion etc to appease the left while pandering to corporate interests the left liberals 3rd ways idk exactly so thus the left 3rd ways are actually slightly to the right of the center on everything but social issues and liberal has become synonymous for them most people who are truly to the left of the center without being far left are called progressives granted shades of gray once again one of the problems right now is the left seems to think of anything to the right of center as actual evil this kills debate the right does the same thing the thing that a lot of people do not seem to realize is that the government has not had a left wing since carter was in office we have just had center right and right i agree but i do not trust the goverment to run healthcare properly they do not do a great job with the va and for the most part i think that the private sector can do a better job i could have been a little more clear on this i am not proposing that they run healthcare i am proposing that they fund it through a medicare for all single payer system or through a multi payer system with a government backed option a la germany ie i make 32k a year full time i cannot actualy afford to live on my own around the norther chicagoland area because rent is 50 of my pay and thats not economically feasible i need to get out of this shithole of a state are you me in a different area of the country were i not married and the wife working full time as well the 34k i make would not mean jack do not get me wrong i want a mulligan i am just holding my nose and voting for trump as i think he is the least worst of the two evils but i recognize we are fucked eaither way not that my vote matters i live in illinois why not vote for a 3rd party to try to bring them a little more into the spotlight i am in tn myself so my state will go to trump regardless of what i do so i figure i will probably end up voting for dr stein because she honestly the closest thing i have even if i do not agree with her 100 i did not agree with sanders 100 either but i was excited at the thought of him as president ,2,news
blhylton, i do not disagree we are currently in an oligarchy though tyranny takes many forums we seem to be edging closer and closer to the 1984 style though as the left tends to push more thought police style stuff like in europe there an authoritarian left and a libertarian left this sort of thing is coming from the former most of us on the left tend to dislike the term liberal because it has become associated with the 3rd way democrats that bill clinton created yea agree here our form of capatilism seems to be the least bad thus far as it has propelled the world into quite a bit of prosper will be an interesting future were this the 80s i would probably agree the reagan era tax cuts and regulation changes were great in the short term but in the long term it is what is causing our current problems our current form of capitalism is a bit too laissez faire in some ways and too many overbearing stipulations in others i feel both sides could actualy talk more like we are right now if our media was not drumming up controversy and practically trying to start a race war for ratings so they could make more money the old if it bleeds it leads stays true and the talking heads on eaither side confirming biases all over grant them easy views i had a friend many years ago he and i would sit around drinking and ranting and raving like this until well into the night at the end though we would always realize that our differences were simply a matter of opinion and that we both really want the same thing but have different ideas on how to achieve it which brings me to my next point i truly wish our goverment was smaller and mostly kept out of our lives my version of the gov is to be big enough to take care of the things people cant aka military police roads while leaving everything else to the states but alas no current political movements seem to be that way absolute power corrupts absolutely this is my desire as well i just feel like medicine and basic means of survival fall under the heading of the things people cannot basically my want is for the government to create an equal starting point not for the government to just hand out luxury i have heard the nordic model called everything from socilist to capitalist sort of my point social democracy is only socialism in a technical sense and is instead a mixture of socialism and capitalism certainly do not expect social security to pay out when i retire and wish i could invest that money myself it has been projected that by increasing the social security contribution limit to 150k and then indexing it to inflation that it would become solvent again and would be around when you and i retire i am just still annoyed that the baby boomers are kind of eating it all away and then calling the current generation lazy i do not wish for starving in the streets but we were able to help everyone in the past without just giving them money how i am actually intrigued by this one honestly prior to president clinton we had open ended welfare systems that most considered to create more dependency than what we currently have as for medicare i have not delved too much into it but it does seem to be bankrupting our country and a huge part of why our healthcare costs so much in the first place their billing structure this part as i understand it is two fold medicare is bankrupting the country because of the cost of health care but the cause of it is actually a combination of private insurance and lack of insurance the way it works currently when someone is unable to pay a medical bill it gets charged off as a bad debt and sometimes sold to collection agencies for pennies on the dollar when this happens in order to make ends meet health care professionals increase their prices the increase in prices causes insurance costs on both the consumer and corporate end to increase causing more people to go without insurance because they cannot afford it ad infinitum having a system where everyone is covered would mean no more new medical debt and doctors pharmaceutical companies would be able to charge more reasonable prices for things thus bringing the overall cost of health care down i am not that kind of person while i can be abrasive to the children in these threads and thats mostly because reddit is hugely made up of actual children and i get fucking irritated with some of their absolute drivel if you actualy talk with me like you have you will see a diffrent side it is sort of interesting how this de escalated eh i do not affiliate with any political parties kinda hate them all at this point however i will support trump over hillary because hillary is a war criminal warhawk in very poor health who does not care about the constitution and wishes to trample over our rights oh yea she is also a felon i honestly do not know that i can choose one over the other i see them both as an absolutely terrible choice ,2,news

blhylton, how on earth is fascism an extreme form of capitalism i was actually waffling on adding that one i had heard others say it but had never researched it myself i should have left it off mea culpa well that is the only form of socialism that has actualy existed out of all the experiments of countrys whom have tried them the ideology that sanders albeit mistakenly imo calls democratic socialism and i prefer to call social democracy is actually used sucessfully in a lot of european countries fun side note although i do not think this is entirely relevant there were actually 3 similar but distinct brands of socialism in the ussr during it lifetime marxism marx leninism and stalinism granted true marxism cannot exist but that what the earliest era was referred to prior to the changes made by lenin stalinism is the flavor that is typically referred to as communism except in china where that is instead maoism again completely irrelevant just something i stumbled across you are trying to conflate two ideologies which can not mix and instead going to a third what other political system can be described as utilizing the egalitarian principles of socialism while trying to stay capitalist except not capitalist because its run by the democratic state a mixed economy that describes fascism or communism except that neither fascism nor communism can exist if there is a classical liberal democracy whether or not we truly have democracy as it stands currently is an entirely different debate funny thing i found it off a random google search i do not get my news from that site if it is as bad as salon damn weird because i did a cursory search and only found articles explaining why they are different google and its tailored search results i guess that said the guy is a favorite guest of glenn beck if that paints a better picture for you so in closing based on your description social democrats are closer to fascism and communism than socialism i will still not support any of the 3 that is your prerogative though i could realistically make similar generalizations about any political ideology ,2,news
blhylton, as a seeming believer of democratic socialism what is the diffrence baseless assumption but i will humor you there both is and is not a difference because socialism includes democratic socialism as well as other types like marxism stalinism utopian socialism et al the reason there is a difference is that when most people use socialism with a capital they are actually referring to cold war era communism communism is considered to be an extreme form of socialism similar to how anarchism is considered to be an extreme form of libertarianism and fascism is considered to be an extreme form of capitalism that aside sanders policies were never those of a democratic socialist but instead those of a social democrat similar to fdr and other new deal era democrats social democrats strive to utilize the egalitarian principles of socialism while remaining within the economic structure of capitalism democrat socialists want to control the means of production through the democratic process marxist socialists want to remove the state and everyone has control of everything and please list this obvious bias the site you linked to is ran by trevor loudon hence the url this is the same trevor loudon who wrote a book in 2008 detailing how obama was a plant by the late ussr to convert the us to communism the guy is a known right wing propagandist also does a bias mean automatically wrong if so explain it does not mean automatically wrong but it means that if that is the only place you can find that information then you should think long and hard about whether you are getting the entire picture similarly i would not cite a salon article if i was trying to back up the claim that there was no difference between a republican and a fascist ,1,news

blhylton, my belief is that nothing is superior but everything is different and everything has proper functionality i agree but that does not make us all equal equal parts of something maybe but not equivalent on the whole that aside what you are suggesting is a bit unrealistic specifically this if each person actually chased their passion it would lead to a stronger system some people have a passion for ruling some people have a passion for killing some people have a passion for stopping people from pursuing their dreams this is the nature of some people and good luck changing that you keep talking about the government as though it is the root of all evil why would this not be the people in the government or maybe the people who are pulling the strings of the government because they have money all that removing the government would do is put those people who have the money directly into power instead of having a middle man ,1,RiseUPP
blhylton,that still speaks nothing of the system only of people also this is rife with contradictions naturally every man and woman is exactly equal to each other no they are not in order for everyone to be equal to one another we would all have to be identical is 2 equal to 3 because they are both numbers with the same importance and significance some people are smarter than others some stronger some more charismatic but we are certainly not all equal now i get what you are saying that we are all an equal part of something bigger but the problem with that is that all those equal parts have non equal ideas about how things need to happen so you need some form of mediation government is our mediation in this case even a 3rd grader is equal to a 5th grader they are only at different stages if they are at different stages then they are not equal they may be equal in every other way but being at different stages makes one not the same as the other we do not need politicians to tell us how to live no one is saying that we do we are only doing it now because we are in primitive times still as we grow we have to align with nature so that everything flows like water so in order to become less primitive we have to embrace nature which is by definition primitive no man should have excessive power what is excessive to you is not excessive to everyone else without more concrete terms this statement is basically rhetoric some power differences are necessary like a father and son but still both are equal how can something be greater than but also equal to we point to others calling them villains when we need to utilize these people as they are part of the 7 billion person team some people like soros have so much power that their presence acts like a cancer to our planet we should not be calling people villains but that guy soros is definitely a villain it sounds to me like you are trying to solve the great philosophical question of why cannot we all just get along the truth of the matter is it because we are all some what unique and all have different ideas of right and wrong ,1,RiseUPP

blhylton,and in the present historians look on past societies as proof that direct democracies have just as many if not more problems if for nothing else logistically it would be insane take our discussion for instance while we agree on transparency we do not agree on how to go about it extrapolate this to several thousand people across hundreds of issues and you have a split party if you were elected to represent your constituents for this party and you had a split constituency how would you handle it keep beating a dead horse until you come to a consensus or would you rather risk pissing off half the people who voted for you because of something that you were forced to choose between what if it is a matter of national security and you as a member of the government have access to intelligence that you can not reveal to the public at large that makes one choice a non point i agree that we should see more referendums and our representatives that we elect being bound to vote in line with them but to do this for everything that the government needs to vote on would not be a useful endeavor you also do not have to involve corrupt politicians if corrupt politicians are not elected which is where we should be focusing our efforts complete upheaval deconstruction and replacement of the current system will not be something that could likely happen in our lifetime short of overthrowing the entirety of the government ,2,RiseUPP

blhylton,oh i agree with that part in so far as we need to actually teach children instead of beating them to death with rote memorization but i am just not sure about the structure you are proposing with them waiting until they are 12 to start attending i get that there are supposed to be the online courses for the basics during the time before that but i do not fully trust parents not to allow their kids to cheat them some how ,2,SandersForPresident

blhylton,not having social media wo not really help or hurt you in my case unless the person you are up against does what i mean by this is like i mentioned before i use social media to get a bead on your trustworthiness and overall personality if i cannot get a feel for you some how but i am sure the other person is a decent fit everything else being equal the other person will likely get it this is not a conscious decision i make though that said if your credentials and qualifications severely outstrip the other person and your asking compensation is a better value it a moot point ,1,AMA
blhylton,it not my job to do this but i do end up doing it as a small part of my job what is the extent of your searches given a name city of residence and an email i can typically find out a lot about a person especially since we are not located in a metropolis if i have connections that may know a potential hire i usually call them up and ask in the end all i am looking for is if you are trustworthy because we have had employees in the past try to do some shady bullshit which platform is the easiest to exploit depends on what you mean by exploit that said none of them are particularly hard to get at the information the hardest to exploit again none of them are particularly hard what else can you do to poke around when a profile is locked down private as i said i have lots of contacts having lived in the area my whole life that i can call and usually at least get a character reference besides that i look for other identifying information on social media accounts a lot of people will link facebook with other accounts that you can get a different username for and searching that username will usually yield some results granted i take these with a grain of salt since i cannot always verify that the person i have found with that username is the same person but sometimes it is obvious that it is which gives me a lead to follow again all i am looking for really is if the person seems trustworthy i honestly do not care if they party on the weekends or anything like that so long as i do not see a pattern of it interfering with work or school the only other thing i am getting a bead on is personality i work for a small company 14 employees as of our most recent hire so everyone needs to mesh together ,1,AMA

blhylton,the majority of your comment makes sense although i question the feasibility of creating an alternate infrastructure in the manner you suggest but that really here nor there that said in that situation it would be difficult for one greedy person or organization to consolidate power around themselves because people would not want to return to a life under a state like structure i see a few things wrong with this statement it would be difficult for one greedy person or organization to consolidate power would this really be more difficult than the alternate infrastructure that is being proposed to lead to this point assuming people would not want to return to a state like structure is a rather large assumption state structure does not historically happen because someone in particular wanted it it has tended to happen because of a necessity for shared resources the option when someone else has something you want is to either take it from them or barter with them for it some people will opt for the latter some for the former people will eventually either rally behind and give power to or fear the person who gets these resources for them through either means this is the beginnings of a state ,1,TennesseeForSanders

blhylton,right and that kind of my point he got a decent number of votes in 1992 as well and was still in the debates the next go around does not really change that they did bump it up to avoid competition i just was not following the logic that they did it because he got too many votes ,1,Political_Revolution
blhylton,it hard to say if they were credible or not but i seem to remember similar stories about david davis when roe ran against him back in 2008 that caused davis to back off and ultimately lose his seat i was living in va at the time though so i did not pay a whole lot of attention and may not be remembering correctly ,1,PoliticalRevolutionTN

blhylton,you are forgetting about the people who want to be ruled of which there are many people naturally rally behind the ones they view as strong and then you have tribes tribes are a form of government as well now what happens when the tribal leaders decide to work together ,1,TennesseeForSanders
blhylton,i am actually familiar with this but a lot of anarchists et al seem to have this idea that this will magically happen if the government is displaced the thing that has to be realized from my perspective is that a lot of the resources needed to live are owned by this elite class be it the government corporations or the 1 when we go to take it from them there will be people fighting on their side because they are able to pay though in this case payment would be in goods not currency more than likely assume best case scenario that the rebellion if you will were able to remove the means of living from the elite what happens then communes will work in some places but there are a lot of weak minded people who will feel like they need a leader to rally behind this would eventually lead to various tribes which would either war constantly or who would agree to work together and create what would basically be a governing body would it resemble the government we have now who knows would it be better or worse than the government we have now who knows would it all happen in a given person lifetime probably not but ultimately we would end up with some other form of government because that is what humans tend toward by nature all it takes is one person getting greedy and if they are cunning enough they can become the next ruling class granted that just one man opinion and no more or less valid than anyone else ,1,TennesseeForSanders
blhylton,a fun read i will give you that assume for a minute that we remove the government what will take it place if you assume nothing then you are naive there will be another government whether that another attempt at a democracy corporations taking over as the governing body or some other form of government it will happen the odds that we end up in a better place than we are now are actually fairly low given what we would be up against ,4,TennesseeForSanders
blhylton, it would portray their party as fucked up as the gop civil war implying that it is not heading that direction that said with the platform changes in place i do feel like clinton is the better choice when we elect a democratic president there tends to be a democratic congress elected along with them given the recent party platform changes assuming they stick to their platform we might actually see some of these ideas be put through as bills and then clinton would be much more likely to sign them into law than trump at least that the silver lining i see here ,1,politics

blhylton, there is give and take to this story do not you think oh i do agree that it not as simple as black and white and that the answer lies somewhere in the middle the problem in this case is caused by the minimum wage increase that was passed last june this has caused a rush of people that want to live there driving rental prices through the roof anywhere that is in a reasonable commute distance for seattle normally i am in favor of minimum wage increases but when a single city raises their wage disproportionately to the rest of the country this is what you see it great for the city bad for the residents that were there prior to the raise as far as rent control is concerned i feel like it is useful in situations like this simple as a means of keeping the rent from spiking rapidly on people that have been in the same place for a number of years the problem with rent control as with the majority of government things is that it is typically far too heavy handed ,1,news

blhylton, according to your self reporting sure i and plenty of others think the sanders camp got nasty and clinton handled him with kid gloves both parties involved were not hit nearly as hard as they could have been for sanders getting nasty would have been pointing out that the clinton foundation presumably accepted money from foreign nationals in exchange for favors from the state dept or that hillary was once a goldwater girl or that her emails potentially compromised the lives of cia agents and informants similarly clinton could have just started running ads with the red banner flying behind sanders to say that either party got nasty or handled anyone with kid gloves is disingenuous at best and the truth falls somewhere in the middle ,1,Political_Revolution
blhylton,agreed i have supported sanders the entire way but a lot of people are downright delusional the only way he could possibly win right now would be that election fraud is proven in time which does not necessarily change the results anyway or if there is an indictment over the email situation which would not really be a victory anyway and would leave a bad taste in people mouths i am all for fighting to the convention but the people that think that that is because we still have a chance of an actual legitimate win misunderstand what the point is ,1,SandersForPresident

blhylton, don t like rigged elections don t be a democrat you talked through the entire post about how the republicans did the same thing in 2012 and that the rub they use labels to turn us against each other and distract us from the fact that both parties are basically the same thing ,17,HillaryForPrison
blhylton,how so the democratic party all along has been saying sorry but that the rules and now that the rules did not play out in their favor they violated them without consequence the only part missing in the analogy is that the sanders campaign did not violate them prior to this so they could not give him a ticket so to speak ,1,SandersForPresident
blhylton,i would be upset if it was the cop who just gave several people tickets for jaywalking saying i know nothing was coming but it the law was caught jaywalking and was given a pass just because it was his buddy that caught him does that make it more plausible ,1,SandersForPresident
blhylton,if someone were to be caught jaywalking but not punished then yeah i would be pretty upset particularly if they were to cause a wreck ,1,SandersForPresident
blhylton,that just it what is more in line with the democratic will is subjective and maybe it not more democratic but more constitutional like an attempt to repeal the aca in my eyes and presumably in yours based on this discussion that just an excuse for those in power to justify violating the rules in order to achieve the desired outcome there in lies the problem what justifies violation of the rules for one person does not justify them for another so in order for the rules to remain meaningful all violations of them must be treated the same ,1,SandersForPresident
blhylton,so what you are saying is if the house of representatives were to hold a vote to change it so that the speaker of the house were able to basically make the final call on a legislative vote based on which side sounds louder and he held this vote when congress was not in session you would be okay with this because those are the same parliamentary rules of order you keep saying are unimportant the thing is i am not in disagreement that the outcome was more correct democratically what i am disagreeing about is that any violation of the rules is just as egregious as any other especially when you take into account that the same people who violated the rules this time have been using them as an excuse in every other scenario ,1,SandersForPresident
blhylton,sorry to leave you hanging went to bed after my last comment which really obscure rule are you referring to keeping the polls open until the scheduled time or requiring a countable vote you do realize that what started all this right they held a vote 30 minutes before everyone was supposed to be there to make changes to the rules the is analogous to closing the polls early and telling people in line that they are sol the changes to the rules included changing everything to a vote by volume where the chairperson decided which side was the loudest and that was the side that won following this sham there were several people regardless of political affiliations who attempted to make motions to have the earlier vote reconsidered and were ignored there was also a congressional candidate who was allowed on the mic who then put forth a motion to remove the chairperson from their position who mic was cut and they were then rushed off stage by security this was not just oh boo hoo sanders lost this was the party leadership outright ignoring the party elected delegates and office candidates ,1,SandersForPresident
blhylton, people break rules all the time you are correct that people break rules all the time but the reason that it does not cause a breakdown of society is there are still perceived consequences we were shown in nevada that at least some rules can be broken without consequence except maybe alienating your voter base when it is convenient to the people making the rules also i cannot help but be amused by the parallels between your arguments and the ones that clinton has made regarding her email server 1 there was no classified information nothing of importance was changed 2 other people in the same position have done it people break rules all the time not really important just interesting ,1,SandersForPresident
blhylton,i agree that that is a personal question and that is the problem when dealing with groups of people you have to adhere to agreed upon ethics and rules since any two people are going to have different personal beliefs on what is right or wrong when you violate those agreed upon rules with no consequence then you have set a precedent to have any of them violated without consequence ultimately i am not trying to change your mind i am just trying to point out why this does carry a bit more weight that you seem to be giving it ,2,SandersForPresident
blhylton,fair enough point but then where do you draw the line at what point does it become too corrupt for it to be justified ,1,SandersForPresident
blhylton,given the context if a relatively small group of people will use any means necessary to get where they want to be then that small group of people becomes and oligarchy in other words allowing the end that a small group wants to see become the determining factor in whether something is okay is allowing the ends to justify the means afterthought please note the small group i am referring to is not necessarily the people who want to see clinton as president although they are in this case a subset of that group ,1,SandersForPresident
blhylton,the ends justifying the means is how we end up in an oligarchy furthermore part of the problem has been all the times that the sanders camp has been told yeah you are at a disadvantage but these are the decided upon rules and we are not changing them then when the rules err in sanders favor suddenly oh this is not what was meant to happen so we are going to change the rules not only that but they do it in ways that basically nullify any chance at having a way to stop the change even if the majority were to oppose it ,3,SandersForPresident
blhylton,i personally am more likely to vote trump than clinton at this point but i am in a deep red state so i doubt that my vote would make a huge difference either way the way i see it is that a large part of the populace is being ignored because they will vote for me anyway since i am the closest they have and that has to stop somewhere i cannot speak for everyone on the left of the spectrum but i am fairly tired of compromising and being thrown a bone every once in a while i am a sanders supporter because i feel he is the best choice for president come november but that does not mean i find him infallible if he were to endorse clinton i feel like it is only because of a lesser of two evils scenario that we tend to find ourselves in every election cycle ,2,politics

blhylton,what you have is a valid argument but the problem currently is that if the federal minimum wage is set at 9 for the sake of argument there are a lot of states and areas that need more than that but will not raise it above that because of what i can only assume is misguided libertarian idealism then there are states like alabama that pass laws saying that cities cannot raise the minimum wage but the state itself will not raise it i am not pretending to know what the answer is to this but i do feel like sanders is a step in the right direction plus a lot of his ideas may be pie in the sky unobtainable but that at the very least gives bargaining room 15 hr may be too high but it may be that after negotiations we end up at 11 hr whereas if we had started at 12 hr we might end up at 8 hr just because of the divisiveness of congress ,1,AskBernieSupporters

blhylton,out of curiosity what is housing in your area like 860 month would barely cover rent where i live and i live in an area considered by most to be fairly low col with 1br 1ba apartments running around 550 600 month that said you are right that 15 40 hours a week would be closer to 1800 2000 month take home unless someone is factoring in some hefty state taxes ,3,AskBernieSupporters

blhylton,it typically has to do with when they were added to the ballot an unfortunate side effect of sanders wanting to go the signature route instead of paying a fee ,8,SandersForPresident
blhylton,i thought the same thing at first but i think they are meaning to imply that only about half in ohio felt that way vs a solid majority in other states ,1,SandersForPresident
blhylton,worth noting exit polls have favored hillary pretty heavily in this election thus far we could speculate why all day but do not invest too much stock in them ,7,SandersForPresident
blhylton,after michigan i would not trust a thing they have to say i honestly did not trust them that much to begin with since they were regularly posting entirely different numbers than every other source but michigan kind of drove that home ,1,SandersForPresident

blhylton,i am really hoping that his campaign is a farce that at the end he going to say after all the shit i said i still won over the majority of you what the hell is wrong with you people ,11,SandersForPresident
blhylton,you getting downvoted for this is showing that people did not open the tweet ,5,SandersForPresident
blhylton,1 it very unusual for a candidate to be removed from a ballot once they are on there even if they suspend their campaign 2 the order they are on the ballot is usually dictated by when they were added to the ballot so this is an unfortunate side effect of sanders wanting to go the signature route instead of paying the fee ,3,SandersForPresident

blhylton,bill made his way to ohio last i heard and was actually seen inside the polling place ,6,SandersForPresident
blhylton,if you read his expanded stats ohio sounds about right the median shows clinton barely winning but he has it within 1 standard deviation that ohio could go sanders basically he saying it leaning clinton with a statistical tie ,2,SandersForPresident
blhylton,clinton was being interviewed by some news crews and there was a press mob last i heard ,1,SandersForPresident

blhylton,because he technically still eligible to be nominated he only suspended his campaign it a nuanced difference but basically they do not typically remove someone from the ballot after they are on it ,6,SandersForPresident

blhylton,as far as i know there are no winner take all states in the democratic primary that said he needs to do more than barely win it i have not done any delegate math yet personally but the story going into today was that he needed an average 6 win in most of the remaining states to pull it off today might not have changed that much but if it did then it got worse there is still very much a fight to be had but as was shown tonight a sure thing is never a sure thing ,3,politics

blhylton,i did not say anything about anyone having to work for it just that everyone wants free shit ,2,SandersForPresident
blhylton,that would assume that 100 of the population voted so no this is basically saying that the sc youth vote was roughly proportional to the amount of youth in the population so the voter turnout was no worse for them than for any other demographic ,5,SandersForPresident
blhylton,a lot of southern states will not go in bernie favor because young people do not tend to stay there after they finish school and those that do tend to be the kinds who get their politics from their parents and do not have an opinion for themselves all anecdotal observations mind you but i have seen enough of it that some of it has to hold true ,0,SandersForPresident

blhylton,i do not expect my area to ever go to anyone that could be remotely considered liberal in the general election but i also do not anticipate that those people will be voting in the democratic primary on a mostly unrelated side note the feuding between the trump and cruz camps around here is amusing every day at least once a day i see somebody in a beat up pick up truck stop on the side of the road to destroy their opponent sign and put up one of theirs ,1,SandersForPresident
blhylton,i used the census for my initial statement so i am aware of the numbers frankly i have never seen people misconstrue 13 voter turnout under 30 this way i was watching the thread when they were talking about exit polls and saw at least 6 threads that stated some variation of 13 of people under 30 showed up this is what we did all that calling for all this post was originally meant to be was a stfu to the people who were saying that like that what it meant and that that was in anyway meaningful this statistic is again meaningless agreed had i known this would blow up like it had i would have been more diligent in my math ,2,SandersForPresident
blhylton,that a fair enough assessment i just could not fathom rubio being considered a liberal extremist by anyone ,3,SandersForPresident
blhylton,i wish i could say that it surprised me but i know a lot of people who tend towards democrats but identify as conservative just because the republican party has gone so far to the right that they no longer relate to them ,9,SandersForPresident
blhylton,your link does not work but you make valid points i was frustrated at the people saying that only 13 of people under 30 turned up to vote when that was obviously not the case this frustration caused me to speak without thinking and i forgot to account for the voting age population being smaller than the general population so yes the voter turnout could have been better and can always be better until we have 100 of people voting but it still was not as abysmal as only 13 of people under 30 turning out to vote like so many were saying and that was what i was trying to dispel ,2,SandersForPresident

blhylton,hopefully so i am just not letting myself get my hopes up over sc given what we knew going in ,1,SandersForPresident
blhylton,because there no way of knowing the exact number of eligible voters under 30 in order to make that statement in the first place so either they mean that 13 of the vote was from people under 30 or they are making a statement that is disingenuous at best and an outright lie at worst ,5,SandersForPresident
blhylton,0 1 reporting do not expect it to change much as votes come in but just feel like the whole picture needs to be painted ,1,SandersForPresident
blhylton,for which part ,2,SandersForPresident
blhylton,because that also would not be true my point is that the voting percentage of young people is roughly the same as every other demographic could it have been better yes but the young vote was fully representative of it stake in the sc population ,3,SandersForPresident
blhylton,those of you complaining about the low young voter turnout need to get a better grasp on percentages 13 voter turnout under 30 does not mean that only 13 of people under 30 showed up to vote it means that 13 of the people who voted were under 30 based on the most recent census data only about 13 of south carolina is under 30 and over the voting age in the first place edited for clarity ,228,SandersForPresident

blhylton,the medicare for all tax is the only one that would affect people making minimum wage at least as far as their wage is concerned 2 2 of 15 equates to 0 33 so it would offset it slightly but we are talking an approximate net gain of 7 47 hr even with the new tax ,6,SandersForPresident

blhylton,if it is purely an investment sure but those same two houses you were getting tax breaks on the interest of cannot be an investment for you to get the initial interest tax break ,1,SandersForPresident
blhylton, i mean it money that is already spent and dumped into the economy so the government is just letting you take that off what you owe okay then we should be able to claim everything we spend as a tax exemption and only have to pay taxes on savings that are not invested since everything other than that goes into the economy some how also i said nothing about refunds ,1,SandersForPresident
blhylton,only for the first two homes that you own in a given tax year so if you sell one and buy another selling a house also has a capital gains tax exemption up to the first 250k of home equity then you can claim it the next year ,2,SandersForPresident
blhylton,i cannot remember how much she made but it was up there the difference was capital gains and the amount of deductions he was able to leverage simply due to having more money ,2,SandersForPresident
blhylton,the mortgage deduction assuming a 400k house with a 500k salary would allow for an additional 16 20k in tax free income per year may not sound like a lot but that is only one tax break and already you have a higher deduction than people who take the standard deduction the most famous quote illustrating the problem with this is warren buffett 3rd richest person in the world 2nd in the us who stated that he paid a lower effective tax rate than his secretary ,29,SandersForPresident
blhylton,depends on if your walmart has a hot bar in the deli that aside when i worked for them it was a common practice at my store to change the schedule multiple times after finalizing it in order to make it more difficult to schedule another job around them for whatever reason walmart goes out of their way to make sure their employees have a very hard time keeping or finding a second job ,0,politics
blhylton,biggest problem with the way walmart handled it was you did not get benefits as a part timer until after 2 years but if you called in sick even with a doctor note more than 3 times a year in those first two years you were written up two write ups was immediate termination so if you had anything else against you you were gone otherwise the next absence before at least 2 of the others fell off was a write up ,1,politics

blhylton,in new hampshire there are two counties that have polling places that are tiny and traditionally take all their votes and reveal them just at midnight that what the results are that you are seeing none of the other polling places close until 7 and some at 8 ,1,SandersForPresident

blhylton,is not this the main selling point of free public college in the first place ,1,SandersForPresident
blhylton,all very valid points and we are definitely in agreement on most of it i however still have concerns that money taints the whole equation you are correct in saying that once you are on top who do you have to answer to but that depends on how much money you want to make once you are done as well that said as we have both stated all of this is just a matter of opinion really and neither of us are clairvoyant we could probably continue this conversation ad infinitum but i feel like it best for both of us to just conserve our energy and agree to disagree thanks for the polite discourse that so rare nowadays ,1,politics
blhylton,i was not saying that she running for president because of the money but rather that she gave up on progressivism because of money to the point where her decisions while president would be affected ,1,politics
blhylton,i guess that the root of our differences i personally feel like hillary became a moderate when she realized she could make a ton of money by doing so and has had to effectively sell her soul in such a way that she can no longer be a progressive while in office there also the problem that coming off of reagan and h w bush nearly anyone would seem overly left so i am not convinced that means much i remember the end of the clinton years but i was not old enough to be politically aware really until a couple years before w ,1,politics
blhylton,i guess i just also do not know that i can consider hrc trustworthy enough to not completely change her stances once in office i also feel like the differences that are there have to do with the rate of change that is anticipated by the policies and personally i think we as a country need to accelerate our rate of change which is what i see coming from bernie policies granted opinions and such ,1,politics
blhylton, i think that our society has brainwashed itself into believing we are so exceptional that we should be involved in every world conflict have we i see this as something politicians seem to think more so than their constituents but i digress i can agree with the sentiment of your comment even if i do not agree that they are nearly the same on the other stuff ,1,politics
blhylton,no problem at first i thought you were asking why it was separate instead of included in the tax brackets ,1,politics
blhylton, the added tax is included https imgur com goywchr just not where you are expecting it to be ,1,politics
blhylton,not quite there is a separate 2 2 tax that is applied but it not a federal income tax increase similar to how the 6 2 for social security and 1 45 for medicare are already separate ,1,politics
blhylton,well that sort of what i am getting at i was 16 years old when we invaded iraq and i had said a lot of the same things about the invasion but that certainly does not make me an expert on foreign policy ,1,politics
blhylton,i hope that he does choose someone who is particularly well versed in foreign policy i guess my one major concern is bernie does not seem to have a strong stance on foreign policy in any regard other that more carrots less sticks and i was right about iraq do not get me wrong i like sanders and will be voting for him in the primary and hopefully in the general but until he has someone advising him on foreign affairs i feel like that is the one area where we are still stuck picking the shiniest of two turds if you will pardon the expression ,1,politics
blhylton,okay being right is important but what else does he have to say about foreign policy seems like anytime foreign policy comes up all anyone can say is well he was right about iraq and then leave it at that even in the debates when asked a foreign policy question it quickly turns into i voted against the iraq war ,1,politics
blhylton,not disagreeing at all but most supporters agree that sanders weakest area is foreign policy so it just intrigues me to see someone who would pick him based on that issue ,2,politics
blhylton,as a sanders supporter your view intrigues me i feel like foreign policy is bernie weakest link and one of hillary strongest but it seems kind of like you have a mostly opposite view care to elaborate ,8,politics

blhylton,few minor differences from my viewpoint i feel like the first quarter was a tie with clinton maybe having a slight edge oh god it like iowa but from the perspective of the undecided voter how many are going to be turned off by the aggressiveness that a quest edit question self stop trying to watch tv and type at the same time that neither of us can truly answer second and third quarter i agree fp is not his forte and that hurt him badly there fourth quarter i feel like sanders was a bit stronger from a progressive standpoint ,1,SandersForPresident

blhylton,no not sure where you are getting that idea neither system is perfect i am just stating the perceived problem with a winner take all system i was typing on mobile earlier so it may have come across as short and kind of snarky if that was the case it certainly was not intended ,2,SandersForPresident
blhylton,yes if sanders has the majority of support in a 3 delegate district then clinton camp will try to do the same thing the strategy of moving caucusers to mom only becomes viable if clinton is winning by more than 50 support in a 3 delegate district or more than 2 3 majority in a 4 delegate district ,3,SandersForPresident
blhylton, you guys are openly using mom as a means to restrict delegates to clinton what is this you guys talk my state has a typical primary p i have just been following the caucus closely enough to answer this question that said i agree that it a crappy way to do it but it is basically required at this point and it swings both ways clinton crew will be doing the same thing if need be and if the shoe were on the other foot i would expect o malley people to be having the same discussion ,4,SandersForPresident
blhylton,winner take all has the problem of over representing the urban population while the rural vote becomes effectively useless ,1,SandersForPresident
blhylton,there are situations where clinton would come out ahead even if everyone in o malley group joined sanders if there are 3 delegates up for grabs for instance and clinton has more than 50 of the support in attendance then if o malley becomes unviable she will get 2 3 and sanders will get 1 3 whereas if o malley remains viable everyone will get 1 3 ,126,SandersForPresident

blhylton,as a related point if you look at it by income brackets it is trump v sanders in all of them except 200k which is sanders v clinton with sanders maintaining a lead in all except the 25k 50k bracket granted this is not a representative poll by any means but it does make you wonder what the correlation is between the two ,2,SandersForPresident

blhylton,dr paul i want to say something up front not in an attempt to start a flame war nor do i mean any disrespect i do not agree with most of what you stand for simply because i do not believe that a lot of policies that you advocate are in the best interest for our country at this time that being said if you are elected as potus what will you do to convince me and people like me that your policies and changes that you seek are the best course of action best of luck in the upcoming primaries for what it worth if i had to vote for anyone on the republican ticket right now it would be you edit looks like he left while i was typing my question oh well ,1,IAmA

blhylton,any program that has to be dragged and dropped into the applications folder can actually be run from any folder but the convention in os x is to use the applications folder programs that require you to use an installer typically have one or more of the following 1 they have to install drivers specifically for their software to connect to the hardware 2 they have dependencies other software packages they depend on that they cannot bundle in one place for legal or technical reasons 3 they have to perform some initial configurations based on your specific system and the creator decided to do this in an installer rather than on first run which is more of a windows style behavior than an os x one which is why you see it more in cross platform software ,1,explainlikeimfive
