YoBoyCal,wait whaaaa send a screenshot ,1,NOMANSSKY
YoBoyCal,i found an a class ship and now i understand it is indeed better than c ,1,NoMansSkyTheGame
YoBoyCal,the notes said your ship cost is removed from the new ship cost so it would only make sense for a lower price ship to cost nothing because your ship is worth more therefore paying the cost of the new ship and when you buy a new ship you lose your old one unless you use a freighter to get more than one so the transferring items message is telling you to transfer the items from your old one to the new one before you accept it ,1,NoMansSkyTheGame
YoBoyCal,i agree with everything accept i feel like this update was larger than the last one bo ,1,NoMansSkyTheGame
YoBoyCal,they should make them more common that black holes but less common than nada and polo i have wanted space whales since i learned that there was space above my head ,8,NoMansSkyTheGame

YoBoyCal,now when you buy a ship the value of yours is subtracted from the price so buying a less valuable ship means the value of your ship pays for all of it you could say that you are trading them if you want ,1,NoMansSkyTheGame

YoBoyCal,great idea until the junker jumper becomes literally unable to fly ,3,NoMansSkyTheGame
YoBoyCal,i like the idea for the last one the main thing that brought me to this game was when they said you could choose to be a trader pirate scientist etc now if you try to shoot down a ship you have sentinel ships there in seconds i want to carve out my own path without restrictions ,0,NoMansSkyTheGame
YoBoyCal,i too got my ps4 for this game and was slightly dissapointed at launch luckily bf1 came out and it geld me over til these updates we do need better variety tho ,2,NoMansSkyTheGame

YoBoyCal,i agree they could have made the game 2 as big they even said 98 probably wont be explored but if they worked on just that 2 they could make something really different ,1,NoMansSkyTheGame
YoBoyCal,i feel as though they tried to give the game purpose with the atlas path that was the center of attention when they were hyping it up 3 days and i finished the path i would not even be mad if they added an entirely new version of the atlas path that actually had you accomplish things instead of grinding until you find the next anomaly anything to do in this game would be great,1,NoMansSkyTheGame
