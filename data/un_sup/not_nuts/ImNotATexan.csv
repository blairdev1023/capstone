ImNotATexan,i loosely remember the part you are talking about kind of not really i remember killing perecles or hercules or something or both but i think both of those were before 3 all i remember in 3 is you kill helios do a puzzle thing with a bunch of boxes kill zeus the game starts out climbing around on inside a titan or 2 idk they all blend together ,2,gaming

ImNotATexan,oh then you are good on some of those things you know better than i do if the traffic is actually garbage just multiply however terrible downtown la usually is by like 11 or if there anything to eat down there when i went there was seriously nothing and anything inside the staples center was closed or totally out of food i live in houston and can only assume that with a population 3x ours it literally unbearable to drive in southern california that camera looks great should do the job i would just be careful with it which you obviously know maybe do not use the bigger lenses as it rare that you will need to and then that will make it more maneuverable my only concern was film vs digital let just say we had issues with traditional film and may or may not have lost literally every single picture we took at e3 no big deal right it not like it a potentially once in a lifetime event ,2,gaming
ImNotATexan,that the way to do it my friend and i won our passes as well ,2,gaming
ImNotATexan,from experience at e3 bring more than a weeks worth of clothes because staples is going to get humid and just uncomfortable as fuck and you will hate your life if you cannot change clothes at least at the end of each day if you are bringing a traditional camera do not bring a digital camera a real one preferably not your phone otterbox for your phone japanese dudes are going to be walking their asses directly through you and you are going to be pissed if you drop or lose your phone so that will at least protect it though it may not help with losing it backup camera if you are flying tsa will probably try to kill you if you bring junk food so when you get there get snack food you will want it when you leave the center each day and you literally cannot find a restaurant to eat at there is not jack fucking shit anywhere near there to eat there stuff inside the center obviously but they have weird hours and may not even be open the entire facing side of figueroa st is probably still under construction right now so there wo not be anything on that side of the street there nothing on the north side of the street either because it just a big microsoft office park and everything else for 3 or 4 blocks is just part of the center or who knows not food for sure i could be wrong and it could have changed but as of the beginning of 2017 there nothing remotely nearby to eat and there was not last time i went to e3 either so just do not expect that metro pass you would have to buy when you get there if you have any intention of going anywhere and are not renting a car or driving there you are not walking trust me as for the con itself most of the hotels do offer free shuttle service back and forth at least they did when i was there you will want that even if you did drive there l a is like the worst place to drive ever do not drive around if you have the choice unless you live there i guess comfortable ass walking shoes that place is giant and you are going to walk a lot it like the biggest con you have ever been to times 10 smaller than disney land or world for sure but still laptop charger for damn sure extra battery if possible and for phone bring your assertiveness if you need a table or something take that shit otherwise one of the other 10 billion people there is going to do it without a second thought probably a water bottle you can wear around your neck or something or a canteen maybe even a camelback put whatever you want in it i do not care water soju water and soju etc if you have a 3ds or vita or psp or 2ds or switch in fact even your console bring it there will be people playing games and shit especially if nintendo has any presence and maybe you will make some friends and then you may want to game at the hotel also bring your game skills maybe there may be tournaments and stuff going on at some of the booths definitely gps if you are driving and you own one or your phone i would also google street view the surrounding area just a bit so you are somewhat visually familiar with it as it seriously huge and can get a little confusing if you go outside ,2,gaming
ImNotATexan,it hard to say who the worst dev ever is a lot of them are terrible i would not say respawn is perfect considering it was founded by the founders of infinity ward who were intentionally using activision money and resources to work with ea they kind of do not have a lot of integrity or at least did not 10 years ago ,1,gaming
ImNotATexan,in gta they are clearly the assholes in those stories and that why they are popular people are assholes and want to be such in a consequence free environment if you try to be a douche and drive like a prick in real life you get killed either by someone with a gun cops or physics for example ,1,gaming
ImNotATexan,ehhh i do not think it should be too hard if you actually give the player a choice that a thing you can do in video games i heard ,2,gaming
ImNotATexan,sounds accurate i did not know people with friends actually played this game considering you know it fucking garbage if i owned mario party and my friends came over it would be so we could put mario party in a bonfire and drink beer smoke as we watch it melt ,2,gaming
ImNotATexan,and that why most of it sucks dick probably then again polygon is satan so after me3 and da3 and now this i would prefer the pessimist version where ea tosses them in the mass burial site with the rest of the devs they bought and ran into the ground ,1,gaming
ImNotATexan, make up some bs about how he died in case anyone ever asks but just have him not appear next episode ,1,gaming
ImNotATexan,every game has a level up system like no seriously all of the games bejeweled has a level up system calling me2 and 3 an rpg is pretty silly they are story driven shooters with some player choice even me1 is hardly an rpg and there is literally no exploration in me3 sidequests are side quests unless you have to stumble upon them on accident there no exploration involved mass effect tells you where to go and you are automatically able to jump there if you want to call them rpgs then be my guest i wo not ever be doing it me quickly deletes them from rpg category on steam ,0,gaming
ImNotATexan,hahaha the hobo omg the guy on the train at the end that was bs that he just disappears and dies ,3,gaming
ImNotATexan,by whom bioware literally rewrote the ending of the game it was so bad what about me3 even makes you think it an rpg because they called it an rpg the game itself has very few choices in it that affect the resolution of the overall story there no exploration whatsoever the combat is even more casual and dumbed down than me2 was there almost no character or weapon or equipment modification without actual game mods tor is garbage mass effect 1 is half decent 2 is just a third person shooter 3 is just a crappier third person shooter with literally the worst trilogy ending in the history of game trilogies dragon age 1 is a terrible game boring combat boring story boring characters bad graphics bad mmo design the only good part about the game was the starting sequences for each race andromeda is a terrible game with no soul whatsoever composed of 40 dreadfully bland and boring gameplay and 60 forced in multiplayer trash that had no business in the game on any greatest rpgs of all time list mass effect 3 would be at least 120 spots from greatest bioware would have 5 or 6 of their own games ranked higher as for your real point yea i agree the witcher 3 circlejerk never should have started in 2013 in the first place and it still going especially after the clear graphical downgrades and yea sorry pc fuck you shrug offs they used to explain the downgrades i do not find witcher 3 to be that good of a game because it is not i have played through 3 times and working on the fourth but cdpr is improving their game quality more or less with each title bioware has been on a 2 decade nose dive and somehow has not crashed and gloriously exploded yet i am pretty sure that when they fuck up this new dragon age game though they will join the rest of ea former acquisitions in the developer mass grave site ,1,gaming
ImNotATexan,it does not matter if it pre rendered or not the point still stands this quality will literally never make it into a game and yes all the screenshots used to show that content off are pre rendered the scene will look entirely different in real time if you open it up in udk without lighting previews turned on p s teraflops are just a number they are not necessarily indicative of any real processing ability especially when you consider how well a game interacts with the hardware it just raw floating point operations ,1,gaming
ImNotATexan,and yet it still ran like shit on current gen gpus was the best part ,1,gaming
ImNotATexan,remember when games used artists pepperidge farm will remember in like 10 years for now there are still some in the future it will apparently be photographers taking 32 megapixel photos of leaves and shit they will be carrying around some mobile 3d scanner and then just applying the photo texture to leaves and shit ,1,gaming
ImNotATexan, that bioshock 2 it came out in 2010 and it does not really look too dated if you need evidence a brute splicers did not exist in bioshock 1 b you could not dual wield plasmids and guns in bioshock 1 c there was no chaingun in bioshock 1 you only got the thompson using an goldeneye from 1997 is disingenuous it a console game it was a fantastic game but it certainly was not a pretty game even if they were not exponentially better looking there were much better looking games in 1997 https goo gl bvcpfu https goo gl 2ijo8p anyone can cherry pick examples going past 1997 and then to 1977 is also disingenuous as you are ignoring that graphics technology was primordial until the end of the 90s we went from the 8086 and 8088 in 1977 to the 286 to basically the pentium 2 from 1997 to 2007 we went to quad core hyperthreaded processors that are holy fuck compared to the pentium 2 from there we went to 18 cores with simply smaller processors and more transistors not that big of a change the gains are subject forever to diminishing returns the jump from 2017 to 2027 is not going to be remotely as big as it was from 1997 to 2007 or 2007 to 2017 the only reason the ps4 is holding its own against pc graphics is because the industry does not care about pc anymore if anyone actually made a pc exclusive to take advantage of the hardware without catering to the fucking low and mid range pc casuals so they do not hurt their precious feelings it would be insanely ridiculous how good it looked the only reason that statement even applies is because of the three companies who drove the pc graphics revolution id epic and crytek only one of them still exists crytek is not doing shit anymore and they are certainly not going to make another crysis or release a game on cryengine 5 that melts the entire gpu industry like crysis did id is bethesda now and they are certainly not going to do shit their market is console now epic does not even do anything anymore other than pretend they are going to make rift games and support paragon ,1,gaming
ImNotATexan,we have seen these these have nothing to do with reality they were made by a freelance artist in their free time because they wanted to see how pretty they could make something and they are all pre rendered too game development will literally never reach that level of quality it a guaranteed never going to happen these games have to run on multiple devices with varying power mostly the shitty consoles that cannot even handle 1080p60fps on medium graphics so no game developer is going to intentionally make something so taxing on a system that 80 of the market cannot even run it the only dev with the balls to do that was crytek and look where they are now ,1,gaming
ImNotATexan,probably still meh in 15 years gpus still wo not be able to handle real time ray tracing so nothing is going to get any more realistic looking than it already does without tricks it just going to be a bunch more shitty post processing trash slathered on every game like some fucking kid on instagram playing with filters aaa right now is basically just activision ea and ubisoft and if that the case ea games look like shit even when they do use frostbite 3 except for battlefield 1 and probably battlefront 2 and we all know call of duty looks like shit right now 32x anti aliasing literally is not even a thing anymore it used to be a thing in some ways graphics have gotten worse in order to make compromises so that other things can look better view distance even on pc anymore is trash in these multiplatform games on witcher 3 you have to use an lod mod and basically rewrite scripts to actually work they do not currently in order to get a good view distance ,1,gaming

ImNotATexan,no one going to read my essay so i will post this separately this shows a significant disregard for the customer as well as going to show you they are not in touch with the gaming population ie the customers of their only profitable division in their entire company all of their competitors offer backwards compatibility now all of those competitors are also charging money for digital licenses to play those old games rather than allowing you to put the actual game disc in the console but they also are charging reasonable prices or letting you use your previously owned digital games like from x360 at the very least they are not coming out and saying i will tell you what to think i do not care what you thought the executives of this industry clearly cannot empathize in any way with the consumers of their products and services it no big deal to sony that people have little choice but to rebuy a game 10 or more times sometimes literally every time a new console comes out it no big deal that the only actual option right now to play old playstation games is to buy a ps3 or ps2 or ps1 sony particularly is doing their best to become apple they are only going to support the newest shit and anything older does not matter no faith in their products no support behind them nothing to offer but a new product the same as the last one but new clearly some of these execs do not have their heads up their asses microsoft is on the backwards compatibility train or they at least know how to manipulate people and press and their own employees to make it seem like they are pro gamer and pro consumer nintendo is more or less on board they are trying gaben understands it the cdpr guys who run gog get it activision blizzard even gets it they still offer playable versions of the lost vikings and wc3 battle net still works the last time i checked ,1,gaming

ImNotATexan,tl dr version sony look i used to like you i still give you money for ps now but you really do not want to be the odd man out on this one you are wrong everyone knows you are wrong just admit it and be an adult of course they do not because many of sony customers are brainwashed shills who legitimately many of them not all believe there no reason for backwards compatibility i have talked to people on this subreddit who have said paraphrasing why would i want to play old games old games are old i want new games if you read the article on i think gamespot jim ryan said again paraphrasing if you look at some of those old games from the 90s they are awful to look at who would want to play them if that was not bad enough out of context he picked a totally inappropriate game to say that about gran turismo gran turismo was never a pretty game until gt5 prologue in case anyone forgot either gran turismo 6 literally reused assets from the older games putting in ps1 and ps2 era models and textures in a ps3 game with little more than a reskin it also still had 2d sprites for the crowds you are right who would ever want to play pro skater gran turismo spyro crash bandicoot ff7 ff8 ff9 chrono cross xenogears parasite eve resident evil silent hill prince of persia trilogy killzone 2 or 3 god of war metal gear solid collection devil may cry resident evil 4 last of us uncharted who in their right mind would ever want to play these games again who in their right mind would want to play them a first time because they either were not alive or did not get the opportunity to yet play them i sure cannot think of anyone and to make things worse he said again paraphrasing data does not support that it actually a used feature again i reiterate this backwards non gamer mentality has spread to gamers actual self proclaimed gamers playstation fanboys who gobble up every word a sony exec or employee says someone on reddit literally asked me what the point is of being able to go back and play old games well for starters ps4 is only 3 5 years old 3 years and 7 months what few select games from last generation ps3 did not get an upscaled remaster release are still on ps3 and cannot be played anywhere but ps3 or ps now but you are right why would anyone want to go back and play old games it like those silly people who listen to music why would anyone want to listen to the white album why would anyone listen to master of puppets who cares about back in black man listen to rust in peace man it so old those vocals are so not autotuned who would want to go back and watch the original star wars laserdisc man it so ugly it not retouched it doens t have digital dewbacks everywhere and cg aliens in the foreground and hayden christensen what a bunch of troglodytes wanting to use old shit oh right i know why because 99 of all the best games ever made in the history of video gaming time are old games that do not run on playstation 4 because it a new system that a fact it is not negotiable history happened in the past yet i have had people argue that with me too if you would argue that this is not a popular and really a non negotiable feature you are a shithead and you have no business in a customer facing position you definitely belong in the business in this current profit centric manufactured obsolescence driven anti consumer business because you are the type of person who will happily find a way to re charge customers a 27th time to re buy a game they already own in the name of profit just not ever talking to the press ever for any reason this guy is don mattrick as far as i am concerned and don mattrick did not even piss me off don mattrick says we have a product for people without internet it called xbox 360 jim ryan says we do not care about people who want to play games released before 2014 both of them garbage let talk about business though backwards compatibility is a feature that been present in almost every console released since atari 7800 snes had it you had to buy an accessory wii had it it played gamecube games straight off the disc not to mention nintendo introduced the virtual console that forced you to rebuy the same roms you were getting for 10 years off the internet for 5 or so xbox 360 had it as long as you had an official microsoft hard drive you could install the emulator software from xbl and play old games though you had to buy them xbox one has it playstation 2 had it right out of the box though some games did not work the same can be said for all systems playstation 3 had it at first then sony took a page from nintendo book and realized if they remove the hardware from the ps3 that allows for that function they can cut costs on the unit and sell more at the same time they put all those games on psn and charged 10 or 20 for their digital version switch will probably have a virtual console as well although it wo not play discs that i know of so all of your competitors do offer or will offer this feature but you do not think it a feature people will actually use despite being the most requested feature on playstation does the sheer fact that anyone subscribes to ps now not provide evidence that people do want to play old games how about the fact that gamestop is still a business that exists their entire operation is contingent upon people buying old games whether it for a current system or a previous one and by the way i will have to dig through my fb posts from like saturday for this for the pics and it did happen on june 3rd the ps3 500 gb bundle and the ps4 uncharted 500gb bundle were literally 6 dollars apart the ps3 was 242 00 and the ps4 was 248 on us amazon so if his solution is along the lines of don matricks we still have the 360 then no that is not acceptable it is not acceptable for your new console that been out for 3 5 years to be the same price as your 11 year old console that is not being manufactured anymore people should not have to pay the same price that ps3 sold at when the last of us was brand new to be able to have a system that plays ps3 games only a ps2 will still run you 40 50 too that far more acceptable especially if you already own the games is the ability to play old games not pretty much integral to the entire hobby of gaming you do not see guys posting a picture of just their ps4 cases and saying check out my collection bruh no because no one gives a fuck good for you you have 32 ps4 games that means nothing to us show us your room full of video games dating back to colecovision as far as i am concerned willingness to discard 30 years of gaming as if it is not relevant anymore makes you decidedly not a gamer on another note like i said in a different post i hate to be the pc master race guy in the room that actually going told you so but take a look at pc backwards compatibility is one of pc biggest advantages we can play every damn game made since dos why do you think there such a hullabaloo every time microsoft introduces some bullshit like play anywhere or games for windows live or requires windows vista 10 sony look i used to like you i still give you money for ps now but you really do not want to be the odd man out on this one you are wrong everyone knows you are wrong just admit it and be an adult ,1,gaming

ImNotATexan,the engine had working vehicles in it in 2006 they simply could not find a way apparently to make the train move realistically without it clipping into shit and fucking up so they made it into a hat with an npc walking under the map it literally only existed in broken steel and you only used it like once so there would have been no point in finding a way to make working trains otherwise the point of fallout is shit does not work ,3,gaming

ImNotATexan,i am just saying those games would not have existed because there would not be an environment for them to exist without sony ms and valve creating an environment that encouraged people to make those types of games ,1,gaming
ImNotATexan,that era is not gone at all the literal only way to make a game is not to hire 1000 fuckers from across the globe working in 37 different offices and throw money at them that bullshit it been proven false hundreds of times now and aaa means nothing it a moniker for big dev you can make a fantastic game for that amount of money most games cost less than that to develop casuals always throw that term around as if it some standard of quality or means something and it means nothing it just a term like big pharma or big business call of duty 1 was made by 25 people at a startup company with literally nothing a bit of funding from activision it was a great game call of duty costs exploded because once activision pimped the game out the only possible way to top each title was to make the next one have bigger explosions more explosions bigger setpieces better graphics more voice talent but more importantly more marketing so as many people as possible would buy it every year to offset the ridiculous expenditure of trying to get those people to buy it ,0,gaming

ImNotATexan,but valve made it 500x easier for indie developers to succeed we have had a literal flood of indie games since the early 2000s from amateurs not just guys that used to work for microsoft or whatever and started a tiny studio gems like castle crashers fist of jesus kerbal space program banished prison tycoon binding of isaac super meat boy jumpjet rex axiom verge rogue legacy ftl starbound terraria stardew valley salt and sanctuary literally none of those would have happened in a non valve world ,1,gaming
ImNotATexan,you are mostly right but i think n64 comes the closest at least 93 of 293 games on n64 were good or excellent some of them i cannot attest to like madden or some of the wrestling games so they may have been good or pokemon stadium i have no idea there were a lot of sports games on n64 i am not joking at least 94 of those 293 games were sports and i am not even including the mario sports games or things like road rash or excite bike or extreme g that like all anyone made for 64 fishing racing football soccer f1 snowboarding tennis jetski etc even the franchise games like star wars donkey kong or mario were about racing like wtf nintendo ,1,gaming
ImNotATexan,first of all inflation since 90 is 46 5 so the games are not 33 cheaper second those games were released finished although in some cases broken in 2017 you are paying 60 for a base game plus a minimum of another 60 for dlc the majority of which is useless crap that adds almost nothing to the game that 120 64 in 1990 to get still less game than in 1990 the games are not requiring a ton more investment either we just established that inflation is what it is the games are costing the same amount of money to develop as they always were companies now are not spending money on development they are spending on shit like advertising marketing campaigns activision literally spent 500 million on marketing for destiny 1 https www engadget com 2014 08 13 destiny 500 million that utterly fucking ridiculous and it entirely their fault for mismanaging money not an inherent expense in games destiny did not even sell well and that makes it even more delicious but also helps their case more when they try to act like video games cost too much to make super expensive games like destiny and shenmue are exceptions prime examples of bloated aaa development at its worst they are not the norm and those games rarely exceed either gta5 for example cost 265 million to make and market combined but it sold 80 million copies and made rockstar well over a billion dollars in profit although there was obvious double dipping involved across the entire gaming market modern warfare 2 for example was 50 million to make with a 150 million marketing budget if you take a look at the list of most expensive games to make most of them did not sell well at all https en wikipedia org wiki list of most expensive video games to develop so it totally ridiculous to think spending 5 shit tons of money on a game is normal or that it is going to accomplish anything ,1,gaming

ImNotATexan,it pretty disingenuous to try and make a claim that steam pushed indie devs 5 steps back indie devs have been around since the beginning of video game time valve themselves were an indie developer 20 years ago literally sierra did not own valve they just published half life if anything valve is the quintessential story of indie success they went from being a small team of developers who made a good game to basically the biggest player in the pc gaming world within 20 years really they became the biggest fish in the psea much quicker than 20 years it took about 14 ,1,gaming
ImNotATexan,keep in mind though when reading that information that the creator of ninja gaiden left team ninja before they even made ng3 and that ng3 was pretty much their worst game ever until they re released it without the super casual garbage features so i would not expect any famed gaiden awesomeness calling nioh a dark souls clone when it came from team ninja who was making brutally hard games before from software even touched a keyboard is pretty moronic it moronic to call any game a clone of any other game unless it literally the exact same game with different assets like people who call dante inferno a god of war clone no no it is not it a very different game with different game mechanics when it comes to character customization and magic not to mention totally different story material different combat system and more difficult or calling darksiders a god of war clone lol one is a zelda like one is a 3d beat em up or hack and slash if you prefer ,1,gaming

ImNotATexan,neither because they ruined warcraft ip they retconned the lore so many fucking times it incomprehensible most importantly metzen did his best to show his heavy horde bias and he rewrote the story to make the alliance the assholes when it literally not negotiable that the orcs are the villains in the story by proxy the legion being the true villains not to mention they pimped warcraft out for all they possibly could movie novels card game board game toys and expansions warcraft has been ruined since wc3 it was an abomination it was a good game but it turned warcraft from a strategy game into more of a tactical rpg hybrid and ruined the story let not forget they also pimped starcraft out releasing a 150 game over the course of 4 years and calling protoss and zerg content expansions yet priced the same as wol and they also ruined diablo releasing a totally subpar shitty as fuck game in 2012 where people literally could not play on release day the game had a crap predictable story crap gameplay with minimal character variety extraordinarily low drop rates for loot and you had to play the same shitty garbage through over and over on different difficulties to level your character then they added the rmah and the game was not worth a shit until after the expansion pack blizzard even interviewed before the game released and announced that people should expect the game to suck then to make it all better they merged with activision the motherfucking devil nothing they have done since is any recompense either we wo not even discuss hots hearthstone or overwatch ,1,gaming

ImNotATexan,the last good cod was cod 2 cod 4 if you want to count that genre diluting abomination as good it is not the creators of cod and infinity ward literally went back where they came from ea after activision fired them and they founded respawn games that how you know you fucked up when you pimp a franchise out so hard with annual releases spread over 4 developers that the people who left ea technically 2015 inc to form that developer that brought you that franchise that you bought leave your company in order to make a deal with ea the company they left to work with you to make their own company again and then go into partnership with ea you know you ruined their legacy they left activision 7 years ago to make respawn technically west and zampella were fired for insubordination and breach of contract which probably anyone would do if they worked at activision and knew they deserved better that after mw2 that 7 cod ago there another sign that you fucked a franchise up when people can use it as a unit of fucking time and it replaces years accurately for clarification in case you did not know 25 of the people who made moh allied assault developed by 2015 inc left 2015 and founded infinity ward they are the people who made cod that why it was such a good game because aa was such a good game activision bought 30 of their company to help get them started at the beginning and then bought the other 70 the same year 2003 when cod 1 went to market by the way jason and vince were fired for non compete they were talking to ea about leaving activision and making a new studio which is exactly what they did they got fired for no other reason than that they were bored they were done with activision and call of duty and were using company time to basically look for new employment like if you were sitting at work applying for jobs and using your company phone and company email to talk to employers it unprofessional but it hardly makes you the biggest asshole in the world then ea tried to sue for damages after they fired vince and jason and 40 other people claiming that these 42 people deprived activision of services that would have potentially led to billions more dollars profit because they were fired no matter that activision are the ones who fired them and ultimately by fucking common sense the ones who deprived themselves of services they basically were trying to hold ea and these people responsible the lawsuit was dropped though a day after vince and jason gave an interview about it to game informer these are the people you say did not destroy cod they literally tried to sue the creators of cod for getting fired by themselves because they alleged that firing them deprived them of money if you can follow the logic it hilarious to put this in perspective activision popped out so many cod games in 13 years that they have literally out oversaturated final fantasy if you only count numbered games and mario party both of which predate cod cod also out saturates moh now the franchise that spawned it there are only 13 moh games right now 14 if you include the gba game there are 16 cod games right now including the ps2 version of cod2 cod 2 3 4 waw mw2 blops mw3 blops2 ghosts blops3 advanced warfare infinite warfare cod4 remastered big red one and ww2 sixteen fucking sixteen in 14 years you are right it not destroyed it ruined as far as discerning people with taste and self respect are concerned ruin cause great and usually irreparable damage or harm to have a disastrous effect on a noisy freeway has ruined village life synonyms wreck destroy spoil mar blight shatter dash torpedo scotch mess up sabotage screw up foul up put the kibosh on nix scupper scuttle and that all without addressing one of the major reasons to hate cod they are intentionally made as disposable games meant to be purchased annually the few titles that have dedicated server support act shuts down the official servers after a year or so the games that use p2p rely on matchmaking servers which act also shuts down after about 2 years meaning you either run your own server if the game supports it or you play the game they want you to play ,1,gaming

ImNotATexan,first of all it not their name they bought prey from human head the same way all trademark and patent trolls buy their crap from someone else even so it not their name because the names are blatantly different prey for the gods and prey prey is being used as a singular name in bethesda tm it just a noun in the kickstarter game it part of an overall phrase the entirety of which is what they wanted to trademark not every single word individually trademarking a dictionary word is a more complicated business than just saying oh i want to trademark this word the only reason zenimax can even get away with this is because both prey and prey for the gods are video games if prey for the gods was anything else like a book it would not fly zenimax filed a motion claiming that prey for the gods possibly caused brand confusion because of their upcoming game prey a year ago it a totally frivolous legal action that has no basis in reality prey for the gods wo not be out for years by which time there is literally no possible way anyone could confuse prey for the gods with prey not to mention only a few thousand people have even heard of prey for the gods bethesda claim was bullshit through and through and pete hines good guy bullshit we did not really have a choice sorry that how teh law is is showboating it predatory trademark trolling that all it is there no risk of bethesda losing their trademark no company could legally release a game named simply prey or doom or anything else zenimax owns without an unquestionable legal defeat following it as long as zenimax did not let their claim expire you do not see them filing a motion to protect their tm every time a game has the word doom in it or rage either it does not matter anyway because like all startups no matter had to change the spelling of their game to one that still appropriate and still the same word so it does not matter their only other choice was to waste money they cannot afford on bullshit legal fees and lawyers and a waste of time in court to win the case the majority of these disputes are not legally buoyant the only reason big companies get their way in these situations like apple and samsung and bethesda is because they can afford to waste money on lawyers to draft up paperwork and file it with courts ,1,BethesdaSoftworks
ImNotATexan,naughty dog literally fucking is owned by sony you tool sony bought them 16 years ago they were not hired to do anything sony tells them to make a game and they make a game ,1,gaming
ImNotATexan,he specifically mentioned tactical games there are multiple genres of tactical games dark souls falls in none of those genres https en wikipedia org wiki real time tactics https en wikipedia org wiki tactical role playing game https en wikipedia org wiki turn based tactics what you described is literally just learning how to play a game and playing the game that has nothing to do with tactics we get it you like dark souls ,1,gaming
ImNotATexan,yet what you said is for a fact inaccurate funny how now you want to twist words and apply caveats to everything when the blatant undeniable fact that you are wrong is pointed out you are on a pc centric reddit talking shit about pc when you literally have no facts to back up a word you say have a good day kid ,1,BethesdaSoftworks
ImNotATexan,hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah 500 hours i have 100 witcher 4 three times one on death march and two on new game every single quest every single piece of armor and crafting diagram potion gwent card meaningless treasure chest in skellige and elsewhere every guarded treasure every monster nest every place of power every race every fistfight every contract absolutely everything in both expansions and i have barely 400 hours in the game there no way in hell andromeda has even 70 hours of content in it none the main story is not even 20 hours long ,0,gaming
ImNotATexan,it pretty bad anyone who tells you it not bad or not as bad as people are making it out to be is full of shit valid opinions cannot be expressed in one tiny little sentence andromeda only succeeds in not being classified as molten hot garbage because it does not have constant ctds the environments are beautiful too the tempest ship design is cool that it literally everything else sucks 1 the voice acting is bad when the best voice actor in your game is kumail nanjiani no offense to him i like him he is a good voice actor and he hilarious on silicon valley it time to call it quits that the shitty part the best voice actor in the game is a salarian that only has like 19 lines everyone else is flat and boring in fact all the best voice acted characters are on the nexus all of them and they stay on the nexus forever 2 the animations are terrible it like they chose frosbite 3 for the good graphics but then they forgot that frostbite 3 has only ever been used 1 time for an rpg and da3 sucked it not an engine you use for up close shots of character faces the only instance where frostbite 3 looks good with facial animations is battlefield 1 in the pre rendered cutscenes because they were pre rendered animators spent days and days and weeks and months pouring over those specific short sections of the game that were not even in game they were pre rendered with the game engine for better lighting and to eliminate texture problems etc battlefield front engine is not something you use for a game that is meant to tell story and have characters who convey emotion it could have been done with professionals but they outsourced a lot of the work to college students holy fuck 3 on that same note about using frostbite 3 they seem to have thought that doing so would automatically make things look good they do the environments look great but everything else is pastel and looks stupid and boring the jacket that ryder wears looks terrible the specular highlights make it look almost on the low quality level of doom 3 where everything looked like clay the humans skin textures are practically flat shaded there no swarthiness their skin is just all one color it atrocious 4 let not even discuss the angara they are basically colorful less imposing version of kilrathi they suck and the enemy look so similar to batarians that it seemed pointless for them to not just be batarians they could have just retconned a little bullshit story in about how the batarians are in this galaxy 5 the only character with anything resembling a personality is the head of security the turian and the krogan the humans ryders kora the redhead the engineer all of them except the engineer are boring and vanilla as fuck also jaal the problem is most of the characters in the game are human no one as interesting as shepard kaiden liara thane wrex grunt jack jacob kasumi or even miranda is in the game no one your human teammates have no back story and neither do the aliens 6 this game is supposed to be about humans colonizing a new galaxy so not only are the humans the shittiest race in the game but the colonizing sucks too and the galaxy itself is already inhabited and pretty much ruined except you only get to see a tiny part of the galaxy like 6 planets it has maybe 16 systems in it and the space exploration is garbage remember how in me1 2 and 3 you would go to a system and it had a percentage indicator to show how much you explored you had to go to each planet and explore it and each planet actually had a fair chunk of stuff at least resources in andromeda each planet only has one thing if it even has one some of them literally have nothing to discover and you cannot go to the surface either 7 the game has way too many stupid mmo fetch quests that mean nothing and the entire quest design was just boring garbage i do not know what inspiration they allegedly took from witcher 3 witcher 3 was smothered in boring rinse repeat sidequests but andromeda just has like 5 boring ass sidequests per colony also tying in to the characters the loyalty missions are terrible even the missions on the nexus are boring in me2 it would be like hey this quarian is being treated like shit by a volus and these lazy asshole guards that are racist and assume she a thief because she a quarian go find the volus shit and straighten them out in andromeda it like hey can you scan the plants in the atrium 8 just some other random stuff the outfit customization screen rarely works properly the nomad does not even have weapons just literally everything about the game is half baked and disappointing they repeated all the same mistakes of me2 and 3 but did not even put as much effort into them again for a game about colonizing a galaxy you can only build so many colonies and you have almost no role in doing so you clear a planet you turn on its terraformer bam the expedition sets up a colony giving you a new quest hub for shitty little quests and do nothing but give you xp and artificially add time to the game the only good thing in the game is the combat which has improved significantly except you can only equip 3 abilities at once so all the skills you learn are basically useless ,1,gaming

ImNotATexan,another terrible one is in metro 2033 it not really an escort mission but it basically the intro to the game before the actual game starts going with bourbon to that one station at one point after you cross around downtown with all these nosalises and demons everywhere you get to an area where you have to fight off like infinite demons and nosalises and you have to stay alive for a fair amount of time before he says okay come this way and you get to run away to safety meanwhile you die over and over because you do not have the ammo or firepower to kill them well enough all so he can die within 30 seconds when you get to the next station ,1,gaming

ImNotATexan,jesus get over it you crybabies are attached for no reason to literally one of the worst games in the entire 2000s prey 2006 sucked it sucked it not a matter of opinion it was a shitty game i own it i played it when it came out it had the same level design and gameplay quality of fucking turok 1 10 years later without the consolation prize of fun gameplay it had no story direction the combat was boring the graphics were meh it did literally nothing to stand out from other shooters and the best moment of the game was the intro no one even liked prey no one bought the game so all the kids running around pretending man we got robbed need to seriously sit down and shut it and prey 2 idea was far more ambitious than that developer would have been capable of delivering it would have been an unfinished disappointing pile of garbage worse than the first game they literally cancelled development because it was not up to quality standard it sucked not to mention it sounds terrible what you are saying is that you want yet another generic assassination target hunt type game like hitman boring as hell ,1,BethesdaSoftworks

ImNotATexan,the fact that tes3 has the most votes is sad shows that most people never played the first 2 daggerfall far more needs a remake but the problem is daggerfall is gigantic bigger than witcher 2 3 breath of the wild fo3 fo4 fonv tes3 tes4 and tes5 combined 88 745 square miles skywind and skybivion already exist and are likely going to be less wonky than bethesda actual official remakes not to mention better so why you would not vote for arena or daggerfall is beyond me silly geese ,1,BethesdaSoftworks

ImNotATexan,probably not because the demo was its own thing different from the game like you get the shotgun way faster in the demo than in the game certain doors are accessible at the beginning that you cannot get to in the game at the beginning etc i spent like 4 hours getting mad because i could not get the shotgun when i installed the game but that because the game is too open and does not really force you at the beginning to do anything other than by using locked doors ,1,BethesdaSoftworks
ImNotATexan,i would prefer io just go back to being an independent studio making hitman and not making crappy ones now i do find it hilarious though square enix tried the stupid unnecessary pointless episodic formula with hitman and it evidently did not work that makes he happy any time i can see these giant companies who are too big for their britches make a stupid mistake everyone knew was a mistake and suffer for it ,1,BethesdaSoftworks

ImNotATexan,mm yea no the ps3 did not sell more than the 360 they both sold 90 million and no final numbers ever got revealed because by the time they both sold 90 million the xb1 and ps4 came out your sad bias is showing show us proof that the ps3 sold a million more than the 360 ,1,gaming
ImNotATexan,as a pc gamer and xb1 owner that did disappoint me especially when phantom dust was a store game and no longer exclusive now crackdown 3 will be on pc and not one single formerly announced xb1 game is actually exclusive to xb1 i want to sell it now but i use it for netflix plex amazon and to play 360 titles because i am not paying 200 or whatever horse shit price for a 360 4gb just so i can put my old 360 hard drive in it 50 100 then we will talk just like the 500 gb ps3 right now is literally six fucking dollars less than the 500 gb uncharted ps4 bundle i am not joking check amazon ps4 248 ps3 242,0,gaming
ImNotATexan,nothing remotely confusing about it all the console peasant population did by crying about this was prove that they are averse to change and too stupid to figure out basic things like the way pc games have operated for over 20 years it really not complicated cd key is already registered put the disc in another system and try to use the cd key sorry buddy that license is activated you need to get one ,1,gaming
ImNotATexan,just like ps3 vs 360 most of the xb1 titles perform better on xb1 because they have to run on a crappier system besides none of that relevant now because the scorpio is more powerful than the ps4 pro by a long shot ,1,gaming
ImNotATexan,you are there are a fair amount of people who liked it ie pc gamers we saw no problem with it because to us the xbox one was like already 15 years behind the trend that pc set and we just scoffed saying about time to us the console market is a joke buying retail discs trading them in for pennies on the dollar to get other new 60 games that you will trade in again and never actually have a game library not being able to upgrade hardware other than your hard drive etc if we went to some random ass isolated pacific island where it still 1942 and we tried to force them into everything being wifi cellphones he washing machines microwaves robotics self driving cars internet only shit they would react the same way ,1,gaming

ImNotATexan,ps3 literally did not have any games for like 3 years after release the people who did buy one bought it entirely out of blind consumer loyalty while they waited year after year for even one game to come out that made their 700 console purchase seem worth it and then mgs4 came out and it had 47 minutes of gameplay and people shat their pants what else came out warhawk not even remotely 1 tenth as cool as the original warhawk kk xb1 has multiple great games and the majority thus far of its exclusives within 3 years it just those games were multiplatform or previous generation games ps3 did the same thing but they got rid of the hardware compatibility to cut costs and instead shifted all the ps2 and ps1 games to psn where you had to pay 10 a title for them whether you owned them or not so it not the same and not worse by a long shot not to mention microsoft actually listens to its customers has a feature creep plan and updates their console each time sony releases a ps4 update it does nothing it adds nothing microsoft at least added backwards compatibility a feature that the console did not ship with and a feature that is very popular to consumers who are not retarded which it did not have at launch and which ps4 does not have and will never have the funny thing is people who bought ps3 out of brand loyalty why can you even name more than 25 good games that were on ps2 i cannot warrior within two thrones burnout 3 burnout revenge burnout takedown ffx gta3 gtavc gtasa silent hill 2 code veronica x re4 fatal frame 2 sf3 shadow of rome megaman x trilogy oni that 17 the vast majority of its good games were asia pac exclusive and you had to mod your ps2 to even play them ,0,gaming

ImNotATexan,they would find a way if ea just writes it it highly unlikely it was going to be a happy ending more likely the brethren moons around earth would have resulted in the death of billions of people but the planet could have survived somehow maybe if isaac or ellie saved it idk besides there are dozens of human colonies humanity would survive ,1,gaming

ImNotATexan,list leaves out pandemic origin systems criterion popcap and visceral even as others have mentioned ea has fucked every developer and ip that has ever been involved with them they are the reason looking glass studios closed they published system shock 2 after basically begging lg to change the game they were working on into ss2 and then the studio went bankrupt when ss2 did not sell a trajillion copies it sold 400 000 at the time which was extremely good for the pc market in 1999 before digital distribution was a thing they are part of the reason system shock as a franchise has been in legal limbo for almost 20 years now they also have exclusive rights to create star wars games and i do not know the truth but i bet you they had their hands in lucasarts closing too i bet there was some sort of business deal they participated in but maybe that just me wanting ea to be the villain they destroyed maxis caused the leaders of pop cap to leave and pimped them out for stupid mobile games they caused the founders of criterion to leave and they ruined then shelved burnout after paradise was shit caused the creators of dead space to leave ea after they forced stupid changes on dead space 3 and made them make a game they did not want to make destroyed westwood by releasing multiple re hashed shitty c and c games after the creators took their checks and left rightfully destroyed bulfrog the list goes on bioware has not made a single good game since me1 you could argue that me2 and 3 were good but the reality is those games lacked every element that made the original so appealing to so many people and replaced those elements with casual bro shooting garbage yea sure you know what me3 had cool moments like bro ing down with garrus on citadel like the entire intro like parts of the ending the action and story development in 2 and 3 were cool but the action took precedence over everything the catalyst was a stupid horrible change to the plot that ruined the entire story and in the end they were just shooters mea was just utter disappointment and failed potential it was da3 in space with a mandatory stupid multiplayer component that no one wanted whether or not these are the same exact people who made bg and kotor or not is irrelevant it the studio name and they ruined the studio name by slapping it everywhere they could and selling it black box pandemic criterion popcap games ea redwood shores visceral bioware looking glass studios maxis westwood bullfrog origin systems playfish dice is pure shit now so that counts and the list will grow if respawn keeps working with them ,2,gaming

ImNotATexan,at literally every game company that has ever made an escort quest this shit happens in so many quests in witcher 3 where geralt has to follow someone btw except for about 6 quests that force you to walk more because of the environment than because of the npc usually it will adjust the npcs speed to match yours but there are dozens of quests where it does not not to mention in the last quest to confront avallac h it literally gives no indication whatsoever where yennefer is going to go and she only moves once you are right next to her then goes bolting off across the island just saying because everyone mistakenly thinks witcher 3 is this brilliantly designed masterpiece literally every game ever made makes this same annoying mistake not only that but witcher 3 will have quests where you want to walk but you cannot because there no way to walk you can only jog or run ,2,gaming

ImNotATexan,well see the thing is the game has very simple mechanics for instance if your teammate us incap by a special you kill that special immediately now as soon as you can not killing the specials is unacceptable and you are a jackass if you do not help them it not a game where you can be like i do not need teammates i am a bamf mfer because you will definitely die even if you are amazing at the game i can hold off and kill multiple tanks solo and still there no way in hell i could survive the game alone with 3 teammates dead for more than a minute or two anyone who cannot understand those mechanics is no good to any team yet people do not seem to understand you are right though how indeed do you git gud at a game when you cannot play the game because everyone kicks you i do not know man honestly the community is toxic and friends are the only way other than random luck reddit should help find people or l4d forums on steam you can have fun once you have people that are okay with screwing around but otherwise people would like to avoid losing for no reason ,-3,ShouldIbuythisgame
ImNotATexan,i tried to pick games frattynuts did not already address among the sleep pretty decent horror game where you play as a toddler so obviously a toddler perception of scary things is far different from an adults and it was pretty original amnesia dark descent basically started the whole run away from shit and be scurd trend but it also had a pretty decent story banished excellent indie city builder that provides a brutal challenge on higher difficulties even lower difficulties in comparison to other city builders there are a lot of advanced game mechanics hidden in what seems like an otherwise simplistic game like traffic routing population growth trade using the right cash crops etc arkham games pretty good beat em up batman games with some cool story and graphics binary domain i personally thought this was one of the most original games of last generation it a third person shooter from sega with cover mechanics but it also has a lot of rpg mechanics between upgrading your guns and characters to multiple endings based on building relationships with the different ai partners using the voice command system throughout the game to build trust with them also had some pretty cool bosses and enemy types ranging from bipedal mechs to an airship to a huge mechanical spider bioshock all three games and remasters are excellent fps rpglite hybrids inspired by and made by the same people at looking glass who were basically responsible for a majority of systems based games that exist today thief deus ex system shock bioshock prey dishonored etc the story in 1 and 3 are great while 2 has better gameplay than 3 and is arguably on the level with 3 burnout paradise i cannot really say much positive about this game it an open world version of burnout with a lot of the same crap but it totally omits the wreck minigame and pretty much most of the destruction mechanics not to mention world challenges like stunt jumps respawn after you do them so it hard to keep track company of heroes easily one of the best ww2 rts made by the same people as dawn of war it has a lot of advanced mechanics not seen in most fps cover based combat location based damage on vehicles commander specific abilities vehicle loadouts it allows for far more tactical gameplay than your standard rts and is great in multiplayer cook serve delicious may seem like a stupid casual game to most and they may be right but it at the least a good brain exerciser where you have to remember keyboard shortcuts for hundreds of ingredients basically memorize the recipes for how to prepare a lot of different items and do them at very high speed in order to get higher scores ie earn the most money also it has a very catchy soundtrack that will get stuck in your head forever and a lot of fun side content like iron chef type stuff darksiders great games that combined action rpg gameplay with hack and slash gameplay you can upgrade death and war weapons learn a lot of powers but at the same time it has metroidvania type gameplay in some ways where you have to solve a lot of puzzles to open areas and progress in the game dead island depending on how you play it alone vs with friends without cheating it can be either a survival horror game or basically a funny shoot and loot the writing is not amazing the animations are wonky the physics are terrible the guns are always underpowered unless you use a hex editor to make your gun do 2949849845 dmg per shot and the weapon degradation mechanics pissed a lot of people off when their steel pipes broke after a few head bashings but the game is worth playing dead space easily the best survival horror game since re code veronica re4 really was not survival horror it was built by basically applying the re4 formula with different ingredients the themes have been floating around scifi for a long time like the thing or alien and the game itself was basically going to be system shock 3 which is obvious when you know the plot of system shock 2 and dead space until visceral turned it into something else ds1 is much more of a horror game than 2 is where 2 is basically all action all the time with a few scary moments regardless both are hands down 2 of the best games ever in the horror genre ea may have fucked this franchise with moronic expectations but you can still enjoy it at least deus ex hr one of the systems based games i mentioned i personally did not care for it having preferred the original deus ex but it was still a pretty good game that allows you to approach quests from multiple different angles based on your character build the story is pretty good graphics were pretty good even for 2012 gameplay was fun enough a mix between stealth and action again depending on how you build your jensen dishonored 2 another one of those systems based games that spawned out of looking glass ashes it a spiritual successor mostly to thief kind of like a combination between thief and deus ex or thief and dark messiah of might and magic you can play how you want again and how you approach missions determines your ranking and ultimately what ending you get high chaos low chaos whether you kill people or not contributes to chaos or if you are spotted etc the game lets you choose between corvo and emily each of which have their own sets of unique powers i actually have not finished but so far it been fantastic dh1 and 2 also have some of the best art design in modern games as far as i am concerned it not very often you get to see some actually awesome art in a game or its concept art but arkane is one of the few western developers i believe that still pulls it off fallout i cannot believe you havethem and have not played them but our libraries are similar size and my backlog is like 800 games at least so i get it fallout 1 and 2 have some well written dark humor and player agency is high what you do and how you level your character affects everything down to the dialog options combat is obviously not the same in 1 and 2 and as you level it harder to kill simple things like molerats or even rats but the games are great if you stick with them fallout 3 was still pretty great and had a lot of memorable characters and quests but if you listen to the community they will just cry because it was not fallout 2 fallout shelter is a f2p shitfest and i would only recommend playing it on pc if you use a trainer to cheat and get nuka cola but either way once you reach 100 population the game is pointless even with all the new content and quests added to it ff13 this game deservedly got a lot of hate considering it has no actual towns you cannot interact with npcs you cannot freely explore anything except for one zone at the very end of the game you do not control your party and above all you get an instant game over if lightning dies however the story was actually pretty decent the problem is the storytelling methods they used were terrible constantly relying on flashbacks and shit so you have to piece the story together graphically though the game is very purdy if you ignore the inconsistent framerate where it jumps from 60 during combat to randomly tanking on the world map such as when you are on the airship it worth 1 playthrough i would say if you make sure to approach it with lowered expectations and make fun of it it also has probably the most difficult yet awesome adamantoise in the franchise game of thrones telltale if you like asoiaf or the game of thrones show the telltale game is pretty good it tells the tale of a family that was loyal to the starks after the boltons become wardens of the north it was pretty well written had some great art direction and made you hate and care about characters just as much as the show itself while maintaining a level of gameplay close to the walking dead games but not as horrendous as telltale jurassic park if you have not played that it has no mercy on the qtes whatsoever and they are constant sorry you have a lot of games that i also have and have played i am jealous that you have heavy gear assault i want that game the original heavy gears were bad ass back in the early mid 90s and the new one looks sweet but it has a lot of negative reviews over the early access ness and so i have not bought it yet ,1,ShouldIbuythisgame
ImNotATexan,yes absolutely both old blood is a prequel but it does not matter if you play it first if you play tno first then you will have mastered most of the gameplay that you will encounter in the old blood i grew up playing wolf3d and doom and i can honestly say tno and tob are the best wolfenstein games period way better than wolfenstein 2009 for sure and obviously a different beast than the original rtcw was awesome yes but this is better never played the original castle wolfenstein and stuff but they are not even the same genre with any luck beth will announce the new colossus next week at e3 ,2,ShouldIbuythisgame
ImNotATexan,overwatch is not a real fps so you are the target audience actually ,1,ShouldIbuythisgame
ImNotATexan,great game it unfortunate that the developer basically abandoned it though after the last update which was in 2014 there no end game and the only thing left to do is try to get more people without everyone dying planetbase is very similar but you can only build inside airlocked habitats obviously and robots are the key to labor the pathfinding issues are there too from banished but fortunately unlike banished population growth does not screw you over in banished when you build new houses married couples and kids move out of their families houses and take your supplies with them so it bad to expand too fast in planetbase though you can build as many dormitories as you need as long as you have the supplies ,1,ShouldIbuythisgame
ImNotATexan,do not pick up cities xxl or cities xl same franchise same developer but it garbage compared to sim city or even skylines anno is pretty decent there a mars city builder on the horizon from tropico devs too if you are interested in a challenge banished and planetbase are basically the same game brutal city builder with a lot of difficulties to master that is awesome ,1,ShouldIbuythisgame
ImNotATexan,that rarely ever works on anything but mimics all the other enemies either break out of the glue quickly they disable your gun or they can shoot you while being glued ,1,ShouldIbuythisgame
ImNotATexan,the story by no means takes off in the first 10 minutes at 4 hours in i was getting legitimately pissed off at the lack of story direction in the game if you are talking about the literal beginning of the game as if it was supposed to be prey shock moment that silly that was 100 predictable and expected there was no way the game could proceed without that happening immediately especially considering the game had been revealed the game is extremely open ended like deus ex 3 but even more so from the beginning it let you go places that you have no reason to go at all before you ever proceed very far into the main story and frankly that openness kind of subtracts from the games narrative pacing ,0,ShouldIbuythisgame
ImNotATexan,yes get it it combines the themes of system shock and bioshock with the gameplay of system shock 2 bioshock and deus ex 3 it well optimized runs very well on everything and has decent replay value it the only game i looked forward to this year until they said battletech would release which i doubt and i was correct in looking forward to it it pretty damn good about time a shocklike came out it been years ,1,ShouldIbuythisgame

ImNotATexan,all of the games if you are looking for a shooter maybe check out rising storm 2 maybe day of infamy or insurgency all three are more realistic and brutal than battlefield but may not have as epic of explosions ,1,ShouldIbuythisgame
ImNotATexan,6 hours in and prey is not remotely scary other than omg these typhon are fast you get mimic detection pretty quickly too you will learn pretty quickly that the game only uses jump scares if you have played dead space you have seen every scare tactic this game has to offer in dead space it was a thing because you did not know if the loud noises and shit were actually a necromorph or a lie in prey you can pretty much always tell that it a lie because it happens constantly prey is an odd creature thematically it totally inspired by system shock and bioshock and solarix and other games like that but gameplay wise it is more a combination of deus ex 3 bioshock system shock 2 and some other games it pretty fucking good so far i wish i played it more but i have issues really gaf enough to play games anymore especially with a library over 1600 of them now none of those games you mentioned were remotely scary so i think you are under estimating yourself ,2,ShouldIbuythisgame
ImNotATexan,depending on if you like space sins of a solar empire star wars empire at war rise of nations maybe stellaris endless space 1 and 2 same people as endless legend both are very good ,2,ShouldIbuythisgame
ImNotATexan,there are like 900 to choose from pubg is the rage now also 7 days to die standed deep hmmm shoot what else ,1,ShouldIbuythisgame
ImNotATexan,get 4 primal is stupid it just a reskin of 4 using the exact same world map ,1,ShouldIbuythisgame
ImNotATexan,i have never seen a spawn timer below 10 seconds ,1,ShouldIbuythisgame
ImNotATexan,it not really like battlefield but it still wonky as fuck and uses the same mechanics and gui as red orchestra 2 they put in helicopters but only us has choppers and only certain maps and their only real purpose is to harass the nv team except it realistic unlike battlefield which is 100 arcade the maps are far smaller than battlefield maps they just seem huge but the non combat zone is much larger and closer to the action and right now there a very small amount of maps if you shoot someone in rs2 they die almost always sometimes you will have to hit them twice it hard to tell because there a 15 second delay before it tells you you actually killed them sometimes i have hit people point blank 4 times and not killed so i do not know the game still has a lot of stupid issues that need to be fixed i have the full edition and have no idea what the difference is if you have not been playing ro for 14 years at least 10 years you are going to run into a lot of shitty assholes that treat new people who have less than 1000 hours combined over ro1 2 rs1 and even rs2 which has been out 6 days officially like complete assholes but thankfully those people are few and far between just play with your squad try to follow orders and do not shoot teammates and do not use grenades in buildings because the grenade throwing arc is fucked up and you will eventually miss and tk someone who too stupid to run away i hear talk of zeroing distance but i have yet to see any need for it with mosin or anything else unless people are talking about sniper i have had no issues hitting people at any range with anything except for the times i forgot to lead as someone who has played ro since it was a mod in 2003 i have seen it change a lot and frankly not for the better it was a far more enjoyable game when it was a ut03 mod ut03 did not have vehicles and so when ut04 came out ro mod changed to include vehicles putting vehicles in the game basically ruined it causing the maps to balloon in size and make infantry basically pointless because you either never saw anyone got sniped across the map or would run into an enemy tank when you did find someone ro2 mostly fixed that situation by reducing the map sizes again and introducing what is basically operations mode and ro2 was amazing rs2 feels a lot like rising storm which was just ro2 but the pacific front but they seem to have removed some mechanics entirely like going up to a wall and then pressing control or whatever to take cover which would make you automatically peak out when you aimed and moved around but still be kind of anchored to that cover spot it way easier to get killed now because of that but the game is still fun the only thing i hate is that it feels like tripwire had a contest with new world interactive insurgency day of infamy to see who could put more frequent and annoying artillery explosions in their new game in doi you die fucking constantly from airstrikes and artillery and bombers no matter where you are rs2 is starting to feel like that but only if you are anywhere near a cap point ,1,ShouldIbuythisgame
ImNotATexan,dwarf fortress that a strategy roguelite ,0,ShouldIbuythisgame
ImNotATexan,well it been that way for years at this point if you suck at l4d2 you are a bad person and it inexcusable but there are still plenty of new people and you can find people to play with what you say is not inaccurate though this is exactly how pub games in l4d go which is why you cannot play with randos you need to find people first and then play i happened to have lucked out and found a group of cool people but i also already had hundreds of hours and was excellent before doing so ,-4,ShouldIbuythisgame
ImNotATexan,yes ,1,ShouldIbuythisgame
ImNotATexan,usually you can do it directly through the game but depending on the game some of them will show you people you have recently played with on the steam overlay ,1,Steam
ImNotATexan,it for people who have taste and more games than you to recommend games they have decided are worth playing and buying you need not pay attention to them ,2,Steam
ImNotATexan,i mean that cool before it just sent you an email for each item on sale so you would have 47 emails which worked just fine unless you use a crap email service that does not support conversations let me know when you can actually buy games directly from the wishlist page until then it absolutely worthless ,1,Steam
ImNotATexan,steam has been out for 14 years what are you talking about it is literally older than most of the people using it valve has been around for 20 ,0,Steam
ImNotATexan,the only feature you mentioned that does not exist is listing multiple items at once and these are not essential features at all get a job ,8,Steam
ImNotATexan,because you literally cannot do it you can only run one instance of steam per machine it not possible to run another you would have to run a virtual machine to run another copy and even so that other steam would have to be on another account because you can only play one license of a game at a time it the same reason you literally cannot play a game if someone is using family sharing to play one of your games or that game specifically ,-1,Steam
ImNotATexan,eh you should not be able to but interesting those people chose not to be a part of their community so nothing on their profile should be visible and their reviews should not count towards the score or even be visible ,2,Steam
ImNotATexan,that because there are a whole lot of people who use steam who are also retards and they apply tags to games as a joke because they think they are funny ,2,Steam
ImNotATexan,that version is 1 22 compatible not 1 30 compatible your instructions should begin at step 3 ,1,witcher
ImNotATexan,my problem is the game itself generally runs fine but when i record with share the video is like 30 fps when it set to 60 and my pc is more than powerful enough to handle it ,1,prey

ImNotATexan,there nothing spoiler about it unless you actually know what is happening in which case it not a spoiler ,1,gaming
ImNotATexan,damn right but did not we just have a circlejerk about how good the game is yesterday on a different thread just finished it like 5 minutes ago myself the whole time i kept trying to figure out who played cooper and it was matt mercer have not seen his name in a while not since re damnation but i guess he probably voiced leon in the upcoming vendetta movie too ,9,gaming
ImNotATexan,you mean the massive constant bugs and the shithead players and wonky guns and constant artillery spam none of which were problems in ro ro2 rising storm kf or kf2 sure ,-1,gaming

ImNotATexan,do not touch ccleaner if you do not work with the registry on a regular basis to identify what it wants you to delete you are far better off using iobit uninstaller a portable version even better ,2,pcmasterrace
ImNotATexan,remove what the weird ass character shit you would have to do it through registry probably the only thing you can do is copy that string of nonsense and control f the entire registry for it and then nuke anything that has it i mean it should be in hklm or hkcu somewhere but not sure technically you could hide the drive as long as its actually assigned a letter but i imagine you just want it gone try iobit uninstaller and see if it snags anythign with that name i have had similar issues in the past with some japanese applications that install and screw up or do not uninstall properly where a footprint gets stuck in appwiz cpl or even on the start menu or programdata folder it a pain in the ass but generally harmless ultimately you have windows on a separate hard drive it looks like or at least a separate partition so you may as well just nuke your install and redo it i know it a pain in the balls but it easier than fixing problems most of the time in pc troubleshooting using a nuke to do the job of a scalpel is not really a big deal i ran it by one of my colleagues to see if he has any ideas but no answer yet ,1,pcmasterrace
ImNotATexan,lol ea ,1,pcmasterrace
ImNotATexan,lol,1,pcmasterrace
ImNotATexan,i will tell you what to think i do not care what you thought this is a gigantic waste of money is what it is i would pay at most 15 i also own blops 1 and 2 but i do not have all that bullshit dlc ,2,pcmasterrace
ImNotATexan,you know honestly i have never had any success with this program i think i have used it like 3 times after i bought it and it did not work on those games ,6,pcmasterrace

ImNotATexan,then they are mentally fucking retarded and they need to get a fucking life you cannot expect 100 of the playerbase to have 1000 hours in a game that has been out for 72 hours that entirely their fucking fault and it not understandable nor defensible ,1,rs2vietnam
ImNotATexan,maybe read the post next time before you respond you literally did not read a word i did not want to be squad leader i never said anyone said anything to me for being the squad leader i did not know the only way to relinquish sl was to exit the squad which is frankly fucking stupid and regressive that seems to be a recurring motif with this game they literally innovated nothing no contextual squad leader commands the gui is almost identical to ro2 and bad and certain shit like commander orders only stay on screen for 2 seconds forcing you to use your map in a game where you are constantly shot across the world or blown up inside of buildings if i had known that i would have done it i will play sl when i feel like it it not ro2 where the only way to win was to play sl because no one actually played and you had to command your bots when i learn the guns then i will be sl ,0,rs2vietnam
ImNotATexan,thanks for proving the point kid ,-1,rs2vietnam
ImNotATexan,that has nothing to do with how many games you have there something wrong with you if you literally cannot tell the difference between duke nukem 3d made 20 years ago in build engine and force unleashed only 9 years ago and completely 3d completely different type of game completely different everything ,2,pcmasterrace
ImNotATexan,yep i am the asshole because everyone else is talking shit about people and treating everyone like an asshole for every tiny thing they do wrong especially if they just got the game you are right ,0,rs2vietnam

ImNotATexan,right even for ro vets it means pretty much nothing in rs2 same engine more or less totally different everything i am pretty pissy that the mosin behaves like shit in rs2 for example i set my game to use ro2 controls yet the take cover button does not appear to even exist among other differences ,-2,rs2vietnam

ImNotATexan,i called that one trogdortwo because it was previously called trogdor and i had to reformat it or something i am not sure it has both a windows 7 and 10 boot disk so it may be called something else in windows 7 i also had an older computer like 2 years before that which may have been called trogdor idk i usually just call them all trogdor i named the new one daishi ,2,pcmasterrace
ImNotATexan,danke i can do it now or when i get home preferably not now as i am about to leave and about to get pissed if i have to do much of anything ,1,pcmasterrace
ImNotATexan,i knew prey would be the only good new game this year and that why it the only game i cared about after andromeda came out re7 did surprise me and prove me wrong though so prey was the second good game this year calling prey not an action game is kind of silly though if there are 2 phantoms fighting you at once or a named mimic you are going to die if you do not put effort into it at least in the beginning before you get at least a pistol it far less plodding than system shock 2 was and system shock 2 was definitely an action rpg although to be fair enemies would respawn in system shock 2 every time you left an area of the ship but the same can be said about all bioshocks even bioshock infinite in the beginning was easy bioshock 1 was never heard unless you were trying to get the 0 deaths ever achievement and also kill big daddies so you could get max eve the only times you could even die were on fontaine and like maybe when fighting big daddies with rivet guns mimics stop being an issue once you can fabricate 300 bullets without a care sure but that does not make the game not an action game that makes it more of an action game because it gives you reason to confront the mimics that would be like saying re4 is not an action game because by the end of the game your guns are stupid overpowered and you have tons of ammo ,1,pcmasterrace
ImNotATexan,not scary it uses the same tired by today standards tricks as dead space to try to scare you constant shaking of the space station parts of the space station blowing out into space constant loud noises enemies talking at you through tv screens and shit the main thing in prey is that enemies can disguise themselves as basically any object in the game other than the heavy stuff that needs leverage to pick up unfortunately there no pc demo but you can watch the demo being played it only really shows the first like hour or so of gameplay and there is not really much story to be spoiled besides backstory setup ,1,pcmasterrace
ImNotATexan,system shock 2 is not so old that it not playable especially with shtup mod it plays 100 exactly like bioshock or prey with some slight ui differences and some mechanics like the rpg levelling and the separate tutorial level choosing your character class ss1 yes a bit ,1,pcmasterrace
ImNotATexan,not sure why you would listen to someone who literally says you will love this game then tells you not to buy it it not going to be on sale on steam i promise you it wo not be it a brand new game it has not even been out for 4 weeks yet it sure as fuck not going to be on sale for at least another 4 weeks besides you can get it for 48 on humble or gmg or even amazon as it is ,1,pcmasterrace
ImNotATexan,fine and great on both i am only like 5 hours in and so far it feels kind of aimless there is not a very strict narrative to force you into certain areas like there is with all three bioshocks and with system shock 2 where you literally cannot go much of anywhere except where shodan tells you for the first few hours in prey you can more or less choose where you want to go as soon as you can actually access certain weapons and equipment and computers or have certain suit and player abilities basically once you get certain game mechanics unlocked you can kind of just fuck around for a while and not progress it actually more like deus ex 3 than it is like system shock 2 when it comes to gameplay progression many of the game mechanics and the art design and the entire concept though are straight system shock down to the copious references to looking glass both as an in game thing and as a developer and some of the stuff like the character design overall it really good so far as expected from arkane ,1,pcmasterrace
ImNotATexan,they are far better built and are very comfortable ftfy dualshocks are trash especially ds3 cheap flimsy plastic that breaks from the slightest drop joysticks are too close together it small and has no weight to it ugh ds4 is a little bit better ,1,pcmasterrace
ImNotATexan,they are still widely available 37 49 for an official one on amazon ,1,pcmasterrace
ImNotATexan,yes the wireless dongle for one actually works 360 the wireless dongle for the other is a piece of shit and does not work reliably also the battery life on both is terrible bluetooth is the answer for xb1 as long as you get a newer xbox one s style controller and they do not look remotely the same the xbox one controller is better if you can actually get used to it i have 3 and a couple 360 controllers but i usually use the 360 controller just because i do not want to deal with bluetooth sometimes if you do not use the bt for a while it just totally desyncs the controller from being a recognized bluetooth device and you have to go through that bollocks again both still squeak like a mofo though in reality i often still use my wired logitech f310 that i bought like 7 years ago it basically a wired ds2 with xbox face buttons but ps2 thumbstick caps and it supports both directinput and xinput i use it for psnow mostly because psnow sucks at detecting other controllers besides playstation or generics ,2,pcmasterrace

ImNotATexan,not set war thunder to launch as admin perhaps also make sure your administrator account is actually called administrator if you are the administrator your user account you need to put your username there is no hidden administrator account on windows on a personal computer unless you are on a domain or the machine was imaged to have a built in localadmin i have not opened war thunder in probably 4 years so forgive me but there no reason it should be prompting for an admin password in the first place ,2,pcmasterrace

ImNotATexan,a shadowplay has not been called shadowplay for like a year it called share now b what are your record settings on i would honestly just set it to manual record and make sure to hit record when you game just set the recordings drive to a big hard drive external or not you can go delete crap if it wasting space i used to use the last 15 minutes thing and it just garbage it never works correctly i know the feeling though i have missed so many badass rampages on bf1 because i forgot to hit record ,1,pcmasterrace

ImNotATexan,what i do not get the question obviously i have like 1800 games i do not remember shit about shit until i play them a second time and i have only played like 400 of them som did that and a lot of other games did as well like grunts would run away in halo games if you killed their teammates most games of a genre have almost identical gameplay so remembering subtle differences would be a challenge ,2,pcmasterrace
ImNotATexan,g910 is not their flagship keyboard it for casualbros who play mmos and league the g810 is the same keyboard without the frilly bullshit and extra keys and silly design they have several other excellent keyboards as well like the g610 which has reds really there no reason to choose corsair over logitech ,1,pcmasterrace
ImNotATexan,on the hardware side too they invested an asston of money into those romer gs and it shows they are amazing plus they have the most strenuous and detailed quality testing process in the industry and their support is excellent ,1,pcmasterrace
ImNotATexan,no there is not a big difference and no logitech is the superior choice but the reality is they are all like 01 difference in quality it up to you corsair makes ram let them stick to ram their keyboards are good but it not what they are good at ,1,pcmasterrace

ImNotATexan,that a good thing ,2,gaming
ImNotATexan, because ea although there are actual reasons for one their store interface is just as shitty and actually shittier than steam still all they ever show is like 2 games and then 350 dlcs for those games on the house recycles the same 6 games over and over and over they have given out crusader and wing commander and syberia 2 like 5 times each now they are not free games anymore if you already own them but yea sure that program started out cool and became bleh they also still sell some of their pre origin games on steam but the dlc only exists on origin and so you have to install the game on steam then redeem the key on origin if you can and download and install the game and dlc through origin somehow only having one install mass effect 2 did this and it was really stupid and confusing migrating all their new games to origin only circa 2012 also annoyingly split up a lot of franchises in people libraries mass effect dragon age dead space the sims c c just to name a few it also lacks basically 100 of steam features guides discussion forums forums in general artwork videos centralized mod support gifting wallet funds streaming to anything except twitch or youtube and origin overlay is kind of janky the only thing better about origin is that ea has good customer support i accidentally bought two copies of the saboteur due to their poor ui design and it took about 2 minutes to get them to refund me one why did this happen because when you buy something on origin it often takes forever to show up in your library even after reboot also it does not prevent you from buying the same game over and over like steam does steam will tell you you already own this game if you are trying to buy as a gift then click buy for someone else origin does not do that there are also some shitty origin issues i had to put mine in dev mode one time because origin kept fucking up and it got stuck in dev mode forever until i totally reinstalled windows ultimately you can work around most of the preferential issues with origin like just adding origin exe as a shortcut to steam for each individual origin game and then renaming the shortcut if you want each individual game to show up differently to your friends or for screenshots but people like to complain basically it because it ea and people hate ea for absolutely valid reasons ,1,gaming

ImNotATexan,and the massive clusterfuck failure that was mkx let see bf4 broken for 1 year after launch multiple patches to fix netcode and tick rate bf3 totally fucked up for 1 year after launch multiple patches to fix netcode and gun balance dishonored 2 practically unplayable for 5 days after launch because of rendering issues ff7 port used to require internet connection and you literally could not play the game otherwise not to mention it still has 2 different controller configuration windows and directinput and xinput both have issues with proper button mapping no matter what button you map to circle circle is hardcoded to the same function ff13 requires internet otherwise you cannot load saves if you did not disable cloud saving before not having internet connection and also was stuck at 720p with locked framerate still runs like shit except combat which is 60 fps even after they fixed it ff5 and ff6 ports have totally redone ui that look like a 3 year old played around in rpg maker not to mention they totally neutered and fucked up the art style dark souls 1 locked framerate and 720p most ports no native controller support at all and would not support controller without third party software or until steam added native support and to that end some still do not work correctly like dead rising 2 lost planet 1 has massive rendering issues that tank framerate if more than 2 enemies are on screen arkham knight was totally unplayable at one point due to rendering issues mkx not only had terrible performance but would glitch out and not even play animations during fatalities and the game would ctd at random usually during qte scenes like kano and kotal khan enslaved odyssey to the west was 30 fps capped and used the same shitty low res assets from 360 and did not support vsync original re4 port which was infamous for being fucking terrible super low resolution textures worse than the ps2 version lacked all the particle and weather and lighting effects from gamecube version and even the shittier versions from ps2 did not have proper controller support was wonky as hell and used the same lowres cutscene videos from console oh and it was ported by ubisoft btw splinter cell has no controller support without third party like steam dmc3 defaults to windowed mode still and the joystick axes are mismapped by default mgs2 missing textures effects shadows disappearing textures fucked up audio and frequent ctd rise of the tomb raider ran like fucking turd even on the best cards partially because of hairworks has been patched multiple times to improve performance kof2000 and 2002 had unmappable controls entirely basically every activision game ie cod no dedicated servers on most of them dead space the physics are frame based instead of time based leading to tons of problems plus vsync caps the game at 30 instead of 60 combined with negative mouse acceleration the game is unplayable at 30 fps with m kb if you play with an uncapped frame rate then qtes become unwinnable at 600 fps for example you have to press e 20 times as fast as you are supposed to have to to break free when you get grabbed this also causes physics interactions to freak out necros will stretch out 100 feet if you hit them at certain angles objects get stuck in walls and vibrate around at a hundred miles an hour often being more scary than the game itself also it has no achievement support and no steamwork support nor does dead space 2 and uses the same muddied more or less low resolution xbox textures meant to run on a 256mb memory card bioshock no achievement support no dlc had occasional mouse acceleration issues and plenty of ctd problems some of which have persisted after the remaster release which did add dlc and achievements bioshock 2 minerva den had constant ctd issues in the exact same spots until the re master plus most of the same issues as the original game plus no steamworks plus it originally had gfwl which made multiplayer impossible once gfwl went down achievements eventually added when it was converted to steamworks sonic adventure dx locked fps locked resolution no anti aliasing just awful doa5 did not even have multiplayer for months after launch binary domain voice commands almost never worked and more to the point the game forced you to use voice commands and made it very unclear that you could actually respond to them using a controller re6 not a pc specific issue because it happened on 360 and ps3 as well every time you try to join a multiplayer game if it fails to connect or the host decides to be a douchebag it boots you out all the way back to the beginning of the multiplayer menu making it more hassle than it worth to play and this was not fixed for pc either so shitty design still counts force unleashed constant ctd issues all the time sound desync and force unleashed 2 has plenty of rendering issues where the entire everything disappears except starkiller red faction guerilla totally unplayable at launch and still has alt tab issues and ctds for seemingly no reason ac4 the awesome black pearl glitch among others as well as needless performance problems without an actual increase in image quality ac3 lots of controller mapping issues disappearing textures and polys framerate issues crashes etc on that note unity and syndicate also both have plenty of issues with disappearing faces and textures and objects etc gta4 literally unplayable at release even on minimum graphics the second you got in a car and went more than 5 miles an hour the framerate nosedived to single digits on cards that were several times more powerful than the ps3 and 360 combined the game is still nearly unplayable on a 1080 even the evil within forced letterbox with no option to disable it until after a patch very poor performance and the image quality was barely better than console until a few patches resident evil 5 still has the same fucking retarded split screen co op bullshit from console ie the screens literally do not use the entire display there a giant black section of unused pixels to the right of player 1 and to the left of player 2 i get this from the fact that i have been a pc gamer for 30 years and i have over 1500 games on pc a lot of those that are not exclusive being bad ports there a pretty big stink every time any port is shitty all over the internet the list goes on and on and on it seems like an odd thing to be incredulous about when it a known fact that pc ports are shitty more often than not even wonderful ports like vanquish still had the bug where high fps higher damage for the player ,2,pcmasterrace

ImNotATexan,i agree on the weird parameters for different endings in stanley parable i just do not understand the appeal of gta5 especially online it entirely filled with hackers who make it impossible to enjoy either they are spawning jets and shit and just killing everyone instantly across the map or they are throwing out bags of free money and making everyone kill each other or they come on your yacht and spawn npcs and shit and it totally fucks the game up i used to love gta3 vc and sa in college even gta4 to a lesser extent played hundreds of hours of each just going on rampages or killing all haitians because one dude in their gang shot at me or having contests to see who could last the longest with 5 stars before dying or being arrested etc gta5 just has none of the fun that i remember in it driving is boring wrecking is boring combat boring everything everything is boring ,0,pcmasterrace

ImNotATexan,this review sounds like some bullshit to me it would be like reviewing red orchestra 2 and then going getting killed by mg42s is bullshit man they fire fast and are reasonably accurate and there are so many freaking windows they could be in or something like bro it not battlefield 1 you cannot just stand still across the map and snipe someone in the face with a scoped automatic before they can do anything even though they have already hit you twice or tanks take more than one person to operate this is dumb engineers have to clear road obstacles for tanks to move up too realistic 0 10,1,pcmasterrace

ImNotATexan,you would be wrong because cities skylines is literally the best city builder game in history right up there above simcity 2k 3k and 4 and the only reason it ranks higher is because it has massive mod support and continues to see new official content from what i have heard planet coaster is also the best rct game to date goat sim is hilarious but idk about good rocket league xwing alliance and stanley parable are also fantastic i agree though lego star wars is no better than any other lego game and thus far of the 2 episodes i have finished i did not really find it that great gta5 is overrated crap blops 3 sucks csgo is fake cs for russian teenagers young millennials and i cannot really speak to the rest because i have not ever installed them but i wo not downvote you ,2,pcmasterrace
ImNotATexan,except the reality is often the opposite pc ports are usually terrible for 90 of games especially anything from ps1 ps2 era that was not specifically made for pc like kof2000 and 2002 where you cannot remap the controls maybe in the new gog version you can it only been recently that developers have started trying not to drop a turd in an install wrapper and call it a pc port ,4,pcmasterrace
ImNotATexan,the possibility of choosing the worst icons there are yep s nots for the jerkwagon who is going to downvote and say waaah mah opinion blurred icons remove the entire point of grid view using steam grid is so you can see the artwork blurring the artwork out except for a logo defeats the purpose of that entirely not to mention it extremely lazy to just open up photoshop and blur it out you may as well toss all games in one category and just use list view or thumbnail view i consider it not only counter intuitive but also shitting on the artist who made the games cover art to use blurred icons just saying i hate even making them when i make mine and i stopped ,-1,pcmasterrace

ImNotATexan,in fairness this was only the case when they actually came out if you install witcher 3 and own all the dlc now it automatically installs same with all games but yes you are right ,1,gaming
ImNotATexan,no it was literally dlc it was free dlc it was not an update it was not part of 1 31 1 3 or any previous patch it was a separate dlc installer if i was at home and could get on my steam client or my gog galaxy i would show you screenshots from both for how it is explicitly a dlc gog http imgur com a mwwhd the op in the first place already proves our point by the way you will notice in the right side of the screenshot it also shows the 1 31 patch which is in a separate section the normal game files on gog meaning the 16 free dlc are not updates they are dlc btw cdpr owns and operates gog or rather their parent company does so i am pretty sure their own storefront and game downloader is the authoritative source it further proven by the fact that certain mods like hairfx on everything mod or additional beards literally wo not work without these dlc installed because they cannot find the files otherwise ,1,gaming
ImNotATexan,it got really really old before the game even came out it not that good of a game they are not good guy cdpr fucking sick of it and i have played the game through 3 times i am finishing up a 4th game right now just to see the game on super ultra with mods and take screenshots and it really not a good game especially the fourth time through i literally only did it more than once to see ng and what making different choices does ,2,gaming
ImNotATexan,and just like valve they will be greedy ass fucking bullshit valve within another 5 years with gog people like to forget cdpr operates gog it their store the only difference is gog does not force drm ,1,gaming
ImNotATexan,where have you been for 4 years reddit and the net have been royally circlejerking over cdpr and witcher 3 since fucking 2013 it got old before the game even came out and it only intensified after they downgraded the graphics with people going oh hurrdeedrr it made sense and they had good reasons and blah blah blah in defensive mode ,1,gaming

ImNotATexan,going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you never heard of tw3 and just got it ,1,gaming
ImNotATexan,ah so you mean like when you put it on ultra and it only sets msaa or asf to like 4x instead of 16 etc yea that shit is dumb witcher 3 is really annoying about that you have to use scripts to actually push the lod distance and shit the rule of thumb is if you have the gpu to handle it and you know it treat presets like they do not exist just go in and manually move all the things that what we have done for decades no game is ever going to detect your hardware correctly even if you have the nvidia game ready drivers that are allegedly optimized for that game worse yet is the optimizer in gfe does not recognize your shit either it will set the graphics to something stupid instead of super maximum ultra ,2,gaming

ImNotATexan,same comment i just left it really is though 5 may have online and it may have hunting and all that bullshit but everything in sa was better better driving school better flying better planes better melee where you could literally learn different styles better soundtrack better world better voice talent better missions better train chase better car customization better character customization with full rpg elements gang wars etc plus you know jetpack ,4,gaming

ImNotATexan,been a comcast customer for 2 years they did not enforce the data cap until last october in houston area absolute motherfucking bullshit is what it is we did not really used to go over the cap but now that there a cap you bet your ass i am fucking going over it as many times as possible highest we managed so far was 3 tb in january before we opted out of the cap so we could have unlimited back what is shit about it is you pay that extra ulysses no matter what come on bro just because i want out of the data cap does not mean i am always going to use more than 1tb that a stupid fucking decision to have to make and so basically what i should run netflix 4k content more i should find more porn to download just to justify the 50 i mean i will but come on what i wish they would do is say okay we will give you unlimited data if you actually use over 1 tb in a period we will take that 50 if you do not you do not owe us that extra 50 or the least they could do you would think as a rational human is to apply that 50 as credit to your actual bill next cycle if you do not go over the 1tb would not that be a fair incentive for heavy consumers to curb their usage a little bit that what i would do if i ran a company but hey if i ran a company it would go out of business because i am not a greedy fuckface just a humble fuckface you are going to charge me for data then i am going to use all the fucking throughput that exists i hope everyone else on the wan suffers because of it this is comcasts doing not mine they wanted to be cunts and someone will suffer for it if my wallet has to mature hell no my prerogative hell yes it great though since i moved to texas it has been like a renaissance for my virtual hoarding my downloadering we were lucky to get 50 mbit s in ohio now we have several times that speed my habit is restrained only by my ability to buy new hard drives which is basically unlimited i have picked up like 13tb of drives in these 3 years and comcast enables me but fuck those fuckers ,1,pcmasterrace

ImNotATexan,that and the simple fact that laying wire literally anywhere is almost always going to be regulated by some bullshit local government agreement or non compete agreement between isps that prevents them from doing so or using existing wire so to work around that costs even more money but to your point i read a story about a dude who talked to comcast about running 2 gbps to his house it ended up costing something like 20000 or more they had to get all the permits survey multiple points around the property and neighborhood dig up pavement and yard run the crap out and put a host of equipment in his house and this was like the suburbs not even rural maybe even 40 000 it was on pc gamer many weeks ago i do not envy the people who have to put up with the regulatory challenges at my employer nor any of the other telecoms i have worked for like twtelecom it seems like a whole lot of uncalled for crap to deal with just to bring people a service they want and are willing to pay for the wire techs either especially here where it hot as the fuck ,2,pcmasterrace

ImNotATexan,because it was one of the worst cop out jokes of an ending in video game history 120 hours or more of story build up to a fucking door 1 2 3 price is right ending plot twist all the doors open into the same room but there a slightly different colored light in the doorway you literally shoot a different colored tube based on what ending you pick and voila the end it makes no technical sense no scientific sense no logical sense in any way you shoot a tube and kapow here an ending there was also the fact that the original release of the game heavily leaned on multiplayer components in order to boost your galactic readiness rating which is what determined if you could get the good ending where shep survives considering ea nukes their multiplayer servers within 1 2 years of release of any game that is not entirely multiplayer based like battlefield and even then those servers get nuked within about 2 5 years that was another stupid thing about the game when i played me3 i got full readiness or whatever rating just based on single player mechanics because they at least bothered to change that part the fact that they tied up different facets of the story like the quarians and geth and such in post ending cutscenes is fine that normal witcher 3 did that any game with a substantial plot that has a lot of subplots involved does that movies have done that forever like at the end of it where it tells what happen to the living characters or the end of a lot of war movies but the ending itself and the entire existence of the reapers was just such crap it was such battlestar galactica this is how we do things always crap and do not get me wrong i love bsg ,1,pcmasterrace

ImNotATexan,the funniest moment i remember in dod was 1 3b when they first put in bayonets i was on omaha there was a dude prone in the farthest right corner german right side on the cliffs and i snuck up on him and bayo ed him he went flying off the cliff with the little blood squirt sprite following him and i lost my shit cuz it was beta and it was wonky first time i ever played was on dod snowtown which i believe is called dod kalt now it was dec 2000 and some friends and i were jamming we just happened to be checking some game shit out and saw what i believe was a reel video of beta 1 i was like i must get this shit right now and could not wait to go home and do it ,1,gaming
ImNotATexan,i really had high hopes for dod s and it became apparent within a year that valve really did not give a damn about it they never added paratroopers back in or the bar bipod or fg42 bipod mg34 british entirely missing and they chose a few select maps to remake in source one of them being the map valve themselves made for dod back in the day avalanche which sucks and always had the grenade glitch always where germans just got grenade spammed in their spawn before they could move i also feel like the rifle grenades replacing just throwing grenades was really lame and added an explosion spam level that was not in before it just seems like a missed opportunity i feel like if they had returned the game to it former state just with better graphics and updated physics it would have been absolutely great back in the day there used to be an event called battle for europe that was played with a few games dod one of them where people would organize into large groups and max out the servers people using voip and actually communicating playing certain maps to represent certain regions and then it would be like a tournament most wins out of whatever games and the allied or axis team won the region and then you moved on to the next thing it was like bf1 operations mode but not actually part of the game it was one of the few times i felt like i did not hate the entire gaming community ,1,gaming

ImNotATexan,great feels like extreme exaggeration valve ruined this ip from day 1 when they bought it from the dod team the official 1 0 dod release under valves name maintained all the features that existed at that point but when they did source they removed all map variety all weapon variety totally changed gun behavior removed classes and just made it into a crappy arcade game when dod was a mod in additional to the normal raid conquest type maps it had paratrooper levels one life cs style you die you are dead until next round the objective was to blow things like flak guns up using tnt or using the bazooka schreck piat this was literally the only reason those weapons were in the game and why the staff sergeant german equivalent was in the game thus also having the m1 carbine and k43 carbine as well as the option to have the m3 grease gun and the fg42 they also removed the british entirely and british maps or changed said maps like flash and jagd they also removed the mg34 and bar bipod removing mg variety and the thing was even with only 2 game modes the original game was still fun enough that you did not get fatigued all dod source is is a cheap ass cash in on the ip they bought from creative people a graphical update that removed all soul from the game sorry dod is a very close to the heart issue for me it was unquestionably my favorite multiplayer and ww2 game ever until valve got their hands on it battlefield 1942 happened fortunately day of infamy has filled that gap and is now officially out it has many of the same maps reworked like avalanche is now fortuna i believe dod thunder which is called dod donner in source is called st lo in doi and it also has all the same guns that were removed from dod plus more plus more game modes and gameplay mechanics i think foy actually has a similar layout to flash as well but is way more open i literally cannot play dod anymore because it such trash unless it gungame or it deathmatch or one of the dumb maps like orange arena my two complaints about doi are that movement still seems a bit wonky like you will get stuck on some geometry sometimes okay three complaints mg34 reload anim is eternal and i seem to die more from bombs than ever before in alpha beta it like no matter where you are you dead if you hear any arty or bombers ,2,gaming

ImNotATexan,you are not gauranteed work at all i know plenty of better programmers than myself who struggled their asses off for months 4 6 months as soon as they graduated even my friend who dad basically should have been able to get him in the door at apple with no effort be wary of false expectations too ,1,pcmasterrace
ImNotATexan,do not forget that deficit is because it hiring is handled almost exclusively by it recruiters and recruiters do not know shit they scan thousands of resumes for keywords and if those keywords do not ding in their search in the exact syntax they searched them you will hear nothing it an employed person deficit not a qualified candidate deficit there are millions of veteran programmers admins systems engineers etc out of a job still ,1,pcmasterrace
ImNotATexan,ba in computer science lol you mean a bas ba would be bachelors of arts unless programming is really what you want to do as a programmer i strongly recommend against it you will be writing dumb code for stupid assholes probably locked in a pit somewhere with other 20 yo kids for most companies there are plenty of satisfying jobs in it that require exactly as many thumbs as programming pay more or less the same and offer less stress just a thought do what you want if i could do it again i would rather have been a network technician or administrator if you are anywhere near the space coast orlando titusville melbourne ish area a job should not be too hard harris and nasa among others do a lot of hiring and that area is basically tech only just like our space coast here in houston in the webster area ,1,pcmasterrace

ImNotATexan,telecoms sell the phones at a massive discount 500 off or so if you sign up for a 2 year contract otherwise the phones are fucktardedly expensive no one paying 800 for an iphone unless they are an idiot even if apple did not realease a new throwaway garbage every 6 months ,1,pcmasterrace
ImNotATexan,do not even fucking talk to me about comcast i just paid a 500 comcast bill yesterday and then i still do not get my speed fuck wait until you get that data cap threshold message and it the fifth of the month i used 3tb in january and that was my last courtesy month after that i opted out of the data cap and that how you get a 500 bill 50 flat data cap opt out per period plus 70 per period or so for service and rental plus 10 late fee and do not pay the bill for like a month since comcast is allowed to charge you every 2 fucking god damn weeks and it not illegal ,1,pcmasterrace
ImNotATexan,it does that on all machines battles are 60 fps but the game itself has shit as fuck framerate will dip from 60 to 15 at random sometimes battles are 30 ,2,pcmasterrace
ImNotATexan, lightning cute lel ,-8,pcmasterrace
ImNotATexan,the sad part is the 360 version of 13 ran better than the pc port and really still does even now after the fixes there are sections where the framerate tanks like on the lindblum exterior just before you fight barthelahellalahandelus for the first time ,2,pcmasterrace
ImNotATexan,sometimes clicking ferociously will cause a non responsive program to respond like 2 out of 300 times and then there no telling if it was coincidence with shitty garbage like bmc remedy though yes ,3,pcmasterrace
ImNotATexan,very easily i have broken at least 6 hdmi cables this way if you yank them out at anything but a 0 degree angle they will fuck up instantly especially if you pull on a cord and do not know which one you are pulling bam there you go the connector pops off and gets stuck in the hdmi port they are very flimsy cables regardless of how much you paid for them which is exactly why you are retarded if you buy an hdmi cable that costs more than 10 ,1,pcmasterrace

ImNotATexan,eh i do not buy parts retail unless it has to be done do not know anyone who does on purpose ,1,pcmasterrace
ImNotATexan,that information was all available before the game released it had a demo for starters and the fact is l4d2 was a ripoff if you bought it on release the only reason the game is considered awesome now is because they integrated all the l4d1 content for free even if you did not own the game after years pure speculation is the entire basis of the free market economy you do not just go out and buy shit because it can be bought the only thing that going to change your mind is total risk or recommendations ,1,gaming
ImNotATexan,you have been proven to have no fucking idea what you are talking about and your downvotes supports that yet here you are spouting more bullshit because you were called out on the fact that you have no idea what the issue of net neutrality is about or why it an issue good for you you are an independent that makes you just as dumb as everyone else from the stupid shit you have said you would fit right in with the fake republicans clearly from my hundred or so comments over a 6 month period about net neutrality i understand exactly what the issue is ,0,pcmasterrace
ImNotATexan,either you fucked up your registry somehow in the hklm software microsoft windowsnt curentversion profilelist or windows itself did totally possible or another program did either way you can delete it through user accounts control panel or just delete the user account folder from c users and delete the subkey from hklm software microsoft windowsnt curentversion profilelist deleting it through control panel should be fine but if it not showing up there there some funk going on the profileimagepath value in the subkey subkey is usually a giant string of numbers like s 1 etc will tell you the path of the actual user profile if you do look in the registry if you are logging in to a microsoft account instead of a local account it is creating a local account on the machine regardless but again it wo not show up as 2 different accounts on the login screen seeing as this is 10 you may honestly be better off just backing your shit up and wiping everything if you are not comfortable with this profile existing and cannot delete it malwarebytes is not always going to find everything but it probably windows itself that caused this problem windows is very good at breaking user profiles has been since xp from the description of your problem it totally possible there actually is not another user profile with the same name it not possible for 2 user profiles to exist on the same windows system with the exact same name unless you are on a domain and one of them is an old profile in which case it still would not be the exact same name because again two folders cannot exist with the same name you would have to verify this through registry to see if two user accounts actually exist with the same profileimagepath value i have never seen it happen before and it highly unlikely but not impossible ps do not touch the registry if you do not know what you are doing ,1,pcmasterrace
ImNotATexan,agreed entirely although frankly i could not give less of afuck about gta5 not even sure why i bought a second copy on pc i used to play the living fuck out of gta even as recently as gta4 just driving down the main road on the west island and doing flips off of bikes and shit now i just really do not even care ,1,pcmasterrace
ImNotATexan,my friends do the same i told them i am not dealing with it anymore they constantly get new games and then they play shit for like 5 hours and never touch it again like squad they have not touched that shit since it came out i refuse to buy anything they want to play anymore and i never should have bought bf1 ,1,pcmasterrace

ImNotATexan,man those fucking hex editors i edited tiberian sun one time to make the wolverines do ground deformation damage that was funny as hell the map is unusable after about 5 minutes if you get enough of them fighting ,1,pcmasterrace
ImNotATexan,red alert 2 or rise of nations supreme commander is a good contender too i would not count total war as it a hybrid empire earth 1 and empires dawn of the modern world are awesome too empire earth ii is a lot more like rise of nations also same territory push mechanic ,1,pcmasterrace
ImNotATexan,sacred chants must be phrased above all else if it corrupted though you are f ed unless you are rich enough to afford professional data recovery if it just a crc error well you are probably still f ed ,1,pcmasterrace

ImNotATexan,i said 2 comes before 1 because you are acting like it totally normal and cool to play games out of story order ,1,DeadSpace
ImNotATexan,that an optional menu feature it not a mandatory part of the game and it still not a substitute for playing the first game mk9 was a total reboot and was the only game that did get praise for it story again no mk1 through 8 not relevant ,1,DeadSpace
ImNotATexan,well played you are correct ,4,gaming
ImNotATexan,i mean on my current ng i have enough unused points to respec anyway ,1,gaming
ImNotATexan,lol no it does not and you are being a pedantic tool trying to apply what i said to games you know for a fact do not have a story the thing i explicitly said was the reason to play games in order there is no story recap period in dead space 2 there are a few dialogues and video logs at the beginning of the game that give a two sentence synopsis that not the same at all as playing the entire game do not even act like mk 1 through 10 have a consistent story or sf 1 through 5 ,1,DeadSpace
ImNotATexan,then you are not a gamer and your opinion is irrelevant because you are the same type of shitlord who would call darksiders or dante inferno god of war clones when god of war is not even the first or best example of that genre and neither game is even significantly similar to god of war what is that a new fps pssssssh wolfenstein 3d clones you do not know shit about games just stop you are a bad person and need to find a new hobby where you are not a cancer to everyone with your shit spewing ,0,gaming
ImNotATexan,probably because you are a douchebag troll ,2,gaming
ImNotATexan,same concept as pirating game dev story is not the first game dev game there are tons of them and it definitely not the best either there are at least 7 game dev games on steam right now mad games tycoon better than game dev story and still in beta game dev 1 5 game dev tycoon and the list goes on ,1,gaming
ImNotATexan,indeed you are correct ,1,gaming
ImNotATexan,yes but tycoon is newer and has way more functionality ,1,gaming
ImNotATexan,game dev tycoon is a similar and far better game with full mod support available on steam and off without drm not game tycoon 1 5 that game sucks game dev tycoon it usually only a few dollars ,1,gaming
ImNotATexan,silly idealistic game dev story if you have not played it check out game dev tycoon and make sure to get mods it one of the best games i have played in the last decade easily despite how visually simplistic it is and yes it better than this game ps the graphics do not fucking matter ,1,gaming
ImNotATexan,not sure why the guys thread got buried the guy asking about the flags if they were representative of a real group but to transplant the conversation the symbol is an inverted and slightly altered version of the nazi 1939 iron cross medal so i am going to go ahead and assume the main villains are white supremacist stereotypical prepper domestic terrorist type guys like those dicks from the end of breaking bad obviously the promo image is not going to have swastikas and shit tattooed on them but that my prediction that symbol cannot be a coincidence because it literally a rotated version of that medal ,1,gaming
ImNotATexan,well that a lie considering there are only about 5 games that are not old that you could possibly be running at 4k60fps on one card on ultra but i will agree that the void performance is not desirable ,0,gaming

ImNotATexan,no because you do not need to play msx first to play mgs and mgs does not make sense anyway so it not a good example it literally the most convoluted game story ever ,1,DeadSpace
ImNotATexan,hmmmmm interesting yea i clearly did not pay attention those are definitely star destroyers my bad ,1,gaming
ImNotATexan,ehhhhh on release day with my system 6700k gtx1080 ssd all that it was playable but there was microstuttering or some shit that did not make any sense even inside when you leave dunwall tower and supersampling was broken they patched the game within a week and i have not seen either of those issues since ,0,gaming
ImNotATexan,you only say it garbage because people with shitty systems had issues with it for 5 days before it was fixed ,1,gaming
ImNotATexan,the fuck with these downvotes name me one game made on cryengine that was not made by crytek that actually looks fantastic ,2,gaming

ImNotATexan,you would think they would have learned their lesson from seeing how critically re6 was grilled when capcom tried to appeal a niche game to a mainstream audience but nope ,2,DeadSpace
ImNotATexan,i did indeed address the gameplay the gameplay is the problem the story is fine also no he literally was not there during the outbreak he showed up days after it started days the out was broken he just wandered around the streets and killed zombies for 5 minutes until he found claire and then wandered around another 5 minutes after which the entirety of re2 takes place in doors so he would have absolutely no frame of reference to compare the beginning of the outbreak in tall oaks where people are driving cars into buildings blowing up gas stations shooting each other etc to the beginning of the outbreak in raccoon city no one knows what happened in raccoon city that was the entire fucking point of leon re6 campaign the president came to tall oaks to do a press conference while he was there announcing what actually happened at raccoon city that why simmons started the outbreak to kill the president leon claire sherry and the people they briefed are the only people who know what actually happened throw in maybe some people at tricell and obviously wesker and umbrella all of whom are dead or irrelevant by the time of re6 everyone else was told a cover story about an explosion and fire that destroyed the town ,2,DeadSpace
ImNotATexan,which resident evil 7 because they are fucking idiots re7 is dead on 100 resident evil just with a first person view wait what re6 i did not say people were wrong it the worst resident evil title in the main numbered series without any doubt at all au contraire chris campaign was the best campaign in the game it maintained consistency from beginning to end the plot was clear you expected retarded gears gameplay from the beginning and you got retarded gears gameplay you got bro downs you got chris being a stupid idiot like usual the car driving and jet flying garbage made sense because it was all action everything fit in nicely it was again the best campaign in the game and this accentuates how terrible re6 was because the best part of the game essentially had nothing to do with resident evils core gameplay elements although the bsaa angle and outbreak are what resident evil has become about since they started pumping out alphabet viruses and outbreaks anywhere possible the mansion lab city lab antarctica rockfort spain kijuju whatever outbreak killed sheva parents the city in revelations the ships in revelations the island in revelations 2 russia the central american country in chronicles etc juxtapose that with jake sherry clusterfuck shitty mishmash of game concepts none of which had any business in any re game in the first place hanging out of helicopters while a nemesis knockoff jumped between choppers minigunning you hunting down shit in a snowy canyon only to have to drive snowmobiles through ego apparently creeping around doing shitty qte stealth the next chapter creeping around a lab and shooting all the things the next fighting a tank and then running around a dock and shit the campaign was again garbage mishmashed game concepts from other games that did not belong and worst of all contrast that against leon god awful re4 re5 imitation wherein leon and helena constantly yell it just like raccoon city even though she never been there and he actually was not there during the outbreak he showed up days later as cars motorcycles trucks buses and any other vehicle possible explode all the fuck around them i literally counted there are like 60 exploding vehicles in leon game alone about 15 of them in the first chapter in some pathetic attempt to condition the player into believing the campaign had any similarity to re2 which it did not then you get to journey to the center of the earth to medieval european ruins beneath midwest usa and back up again where you then cause an outbreak in china and fight the same boss over and over ending in literally the dumbest boss in the history of resident evil no re6 was a colossally shitty piece of shit and chris campaign was the only consistent thing about it which further exacerbates the problems with the game by showing that the only time they got it right was when they were making a total action game with almost no ties to resident evil but hey re6 does have the best mercs mode of all the games ,1,DeadSpace
