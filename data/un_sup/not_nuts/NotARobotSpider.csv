NotARobotSpider,for several reasons first they had chemistry and that special and hard to come by and you do not toss it away lightly she also broke up the monotony of run fight call d c that plagues the series she had personality and a realistic level of quirk where he was more of a cypher she drew him out and made him more interesting helped us care about him because she was so down to earth and she grew to like him also she was european and for a series mostly set in europe that added a lot of local flavor and made a lot of sense it moved it from using europe as a background set staging area to really interacting with the place through her they set it up as mystery amnesia assassin boy out of an adventure novel meets relatable young working woman type and it worked that was part of what was special and different not just all the fight scenes she helped it be less generic as a metaphor it like if you buy a lot of neutral tone furniture for your home apartment you should also get something colorful to add or else it going to seem dull she was the color ,6,AskReddit
