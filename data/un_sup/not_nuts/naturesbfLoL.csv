naturesbfLoL,i mean the last bullet point,1,apple
naturesbfLoL,valuable start ups ,1,apple
naturesbfLoL,so that means pixels will get android 9 i think that fine tbh at a certain point with phones being old version updates really do slow down phones security updates for 3 years is arguably bad does not bother me as i replace my phone every other year tho,1,apple

naturesbfLoL,i think you misunderstand what im saying i do think the pixel looks bad i also think the iphone looks bad i am saying that because the iphone and the s8 are the main competitors of the pixel and the pixel is comparable to at least one of the two that not a huge deal because comparisons are what truly matter if the iphone 8 is going to look as nice as people say it will then the pixel has major issues if it not updated as well if someone wants a nice looking phone and wants a top phone they will get an s8 for most people it they care a little bit about looks it not make or break with the pixel and the iphone both not looking great they do not default to one or the other they compare other features ,0,Android
naturesbfLoL,and all i am saying is if it looks comparable to one of it 2 main competitors then it not a huge talking point this year if they do not update to match the iphone 8 in some way then that a big problem cause they are behind both competitors by a large margin,1,Android

naturesbfLoL,i am not sure if you saw my edit but it pretty relevant ,1,Android
naturesbfLoL,so i can have the phone i want every single action you do in your life has a risk to it from lifting a pen to driving to base jumping they all have a risk associated with it yet the majority of risks we just do not think about this is another risk so miniscule that for the vast vast majority of people they are completely okay taking the risk because it much more safe of a risk than the risks they take every single day economics also you are wrong again the note 7 was released thirteen samsung phones ago the last 12 had no problems,3,Android
naturesbfLoL,so you do not care as much about the design of the phone as some some like it more enough to make the phone significantly more fragile to look nicer ,1,GooglePixel

naturesbfLoL,my stats actually were relevant the risks i stated were similar in degree if you will drive from point a to point b with no second thought then you should be able to order a phone from samsung with no second thought because the risk is even less burn your house down i think you need to do your research not only did you not know the stats you did not know the extent of the damage it did not truly catch fire or explode it was mainly internal damage and burned from the inside unless your house is all wood and there are matches and gasoline all around on your phone when the 200 out of 10 million phones combust yeah you also are acting like your current phone the lg g4 cannot have that happen any lithium ion battery can combust and fail at any point does not mean you should be worried phone manufacturers including samsung have it down so it practically never happens ,6,Android

naturesbfLoL,true it also occurred while i was watching youtube while in bed though i think i am probably just fidgety ,1,Android
naturesbfLoL,how does that boggle your mind does it boggle your mind that people drive more than they have to when they could be killed on just one trip i mean that more likely than a samsung phone exploding over a 2 year period let alone actually harming you that probably more in the realm of the chance you are shot in your sleep tonight you should look at the actual statistics the risk is not existent at all unless everything you do in your life is a risk ,2,Android
naturesbfLoL,is less than 01 of 1 50 of their phones actually enough to worry you they actually have a fantastic track record i do not even like samsung very much i have a pixel but their track record is amazing just due to the number of phones they have made that have worked just fine to me that is akin to being scared to drive every day because you could get into a wreck actually a much higher chance of that than having your note 7 explode and much higher chance you are killed than a samsung phone exploding over the 2 years you have it ,3,Android
naturesbfLoL,that has happened with other phones just not as widespread i remember the old ipod touches had that problem for a bit when in a hot area not worth hating apple over shit happens seriously once again very few people had that happen to them and most people that had the note 7 were treated well out of 50 phones samsung has made one went really really bad and then they handled it well if you want to boycott samsung for it you do you i do not see the point in that and most agree ,2,Android

naturesbfLoL, we can accept octavia falling off a cliff you do not need to understate things to make your point it just makes your statement disingenuous i discussed jon snow earlier in this thread yes its plot armor it explained they get away with certain things due to being fantasy and not being sci fi but yeah it plot armor i personally think getting stabbed and falling off of a large cliff is more unbelievable however i have also stated that that scene had absolutely nothing to do with me making this thread i had planned on it for a long time now how many times have characters been in situations in which any other character would die not cause of skill cause of sheer luck how many times has it been that a group of people go out and the least important character dies hell it happened twice in the same episode that octavia survival happened the missile is still in my opinion the worst offender of plot armor as there were 5 6 instances of it i made this comment earlier if the show is tricking you into thinking a character is a main character that because they were the main character up to a point that simply how the plot is working call it a trick or not does not change the impact of it at all the show did different pov characters than the books ie rob stark stannis 4 have died from the books though something like 80 established characters have been killed in got that as well as the number of people still alive is a useless statistic because of the scale of got vs the 100 thats a valid opinion not killing characters makes me stop caring because i do not have anything to worry about i know it will all be okay ,1,The100
naturesbfLoL,i mean both,1,The100
naturesbfLoL,i am unsure of what you mean here are you saying it been about dany and jon since the getgo because grrm knew it to be so because anybody reading the books for the first time or watching the show without reading the books or knowing anything has no idea the show will end up about them the first season leads you to believe ned will be one of the people fighting for the throne he dies and rob takes his place and for two seasons the primary storylines are his and kings landing you could make the argument that by s3 dany is definitely one of the main characters but that with rob jon was not there yet it is a recent development aka about half the show ,2,The100
naturesbfLoL,thats true he did have those two scenes ,3,The100
naturesbfLoL,uh i am sorry to inform you but life is literally in jail right now for matchfixing it killed korean sc2 it was a bunch of people but life was the main one,1,leagueoflegends
naturesbfLoL,ned and rob were the main characters at the points they were killed only now is it dany and jon it gotten to that point ,0,The100
naturesbfLoL,i literally never excluded anybody i included wells who was a main character however not the main character like i am talking about im referring to ned and rob stark who were indisputably the main characters of the time,1,The100
naturesbfLoL,in another comment i said i predict either daenerys or jon will die in got actually not worth talking about in a the 100 thread though i like your perspective on it makes sense,1,The100

naturesbfLoL,hold up they literally set up the main characters via the food gathering party in episode 1 every character in that party was a main character regardless if you felt that way jasper monty screentime was happening without anyone else so at least one of them was a main character remember when jasper was in his i am awesome phase anybody after watching episode 1 can come to the conclusion of who is important minus maybe jasper you start getting attached to these characters from episode 1 that why their deaths would hurt so much and be so great for drama you can also definitively tell that kane and abby are important in space i completely agree they did a great job with that one of the reasons i got hooked even though i had forgotten about him monty had tons of screentime without jasper starting in mount weather and moreso after mount weather jasper obviously had screentime with his girlfriend those are very key in writing when depicting if a character is a main character why because you are seeing the story from their perspective i completely agree with your last bullet point i literally would not watch the show otherwise it still a good show i always think something will go wrong the problem is the thought of bellamy dying never even crosses my mind regardless if there a knife to his throat or not when did lincoln have alone screentime he was almost always with octavia we had no idea he was on mount weather drugs until he was found in the sewers ,6,The100
naturesbfLoL,arurf is fair in that everyone gets a random champion urf is fair in that everyone can pick an op champion urf is completely fair system wise on that fact alone you have to put yourself at a disadvantage to be at a disadvantage ,3,leagueoflegends
naturesbfLoL,it been for a little bit but not since the ded gaem meme it kinda died with the matchfixing stuff ,1,leagueoflegends
naturesbfLoL,i am on mobile so i cant quote effectively i would agree on murphy i think though he was an antagonist of sorts s1 just kind of absent for the most part in s2 yes i think that might be the real problem the show just does pseudo red shirts and so when a hunting party goes out you know exactly which of them is going to die i still believe that killing characters adds a lot to a story like this though so maybe a bit of column a and a bit of column b,2,The100
naturesbfLoL,providing reasons for people surviving does not make it not plot armor though reviving a certain character in got is still plot armor even though they have a completely valid backing for it,0,The100
naturesbfLoL,that simply not how a plot works that only if you are saying the end result is all that matters at that point in time they were the main character i actually do predict daenerys is going to be killed before the end of got ,1,The100
naturesbfLoL,and i strongly believe it would have been a great ending to s3 to have jasper kill himself ,3,The100
naturesbfLoL,lexa gets screentime with clarke lexa does not get her own screentime like the characters i listed do we had a scene with purely jasper about to kill himself because he is set as a main character every time we see lexa or roan someone from skaikru is brought in as part of the scene lincoln is the same way i do not remember any scenes that have lincoln without characters i listed,9,The100
naturesbfLoL,i have been meaning to make this post for a while octavia almost dying was one of many instances of this game of thrones has killed off the main character twice that is what has given that illusion i can tell you with 100 certainty that clarke will be alive at least until the last episode of this show i cannot give you a character in got where that is true daenerys and jon snow either of them could die likely not both even though they both have plot armor personally i do not think octavia surviving is the most blatant plot armor element in this show it the missile look who just so happened to survive and who died ,3,The100
naturesbfLoL,i said it has some plot armor did you ignore that part due to killing two huge characters which i wo not spoil here just in case it creates a sense of oh fuck he could actually die in game of thrones thats the point i was getting at not this show does not have plot armor and the 100 does and thus the 100 sucks or anything of that nature that minor comparison was definitely not intended to be the main part of this post ,1,The100
naturesbfLoL,not really though right ,1,The100
naturesbfLoL,wells was definitely one of them forgot about that i disagree that lexa was a main character major sure but not main lincoln you could make an argument for i do not think a character dying is something you should have to live with or be okay with almost nobody here would have straight up enjoyed octavia dying and that why it a great idea it adds pain to watching the show which makes the show better overall also an actor popularity should not make them stay in the show honestly maybe an argument to keep them more than the pilot but fans should not change the writing ,5,The100
