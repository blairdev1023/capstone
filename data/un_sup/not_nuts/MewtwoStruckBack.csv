MewtwoStruckBack,on one hand this is a solid flipping tip on the other hand that all kinda of fucked up i never had this done to me not to say i was not punished as a kid no playing nintendo until your grades improve perfectly reasonable i am selling your nintendo because of your grades not reasonable and imo should be illegal if the kid bought it with his own money then it should be considered theft at the very least even if it was a gift gifts are given without strings attached and once it given it should be considered a transfer of ownership the same as if the kid bought it now if the kid did something dumb like break shit and there is a cost to repair or replace then yeah making them sell things is valid but not at the pennies on the dollar punitive method if the kid has 2 000 worth of stuff and broke a 100 door in rage then they should be selling 100 worth of their stuff not 2 000 worth for 100 one thing i would do if i had fuck you money like if i won the powerball is find these kind of craigslist listings go to buy the stuff and give it right back to the kid excluding if the kid had to repay money for broken items with the instruction that those items are now legally the kid and if the parent tries to sell them or give them away again contact me and legal action would be taken these kind of stories are also why i wish there was a legal value assigned to progress in a game based on hours played so if someone ends up losing a game through either this or someone breaking in and taking their shit there would be a far higher penalty to pay it one thing to lose a copy of a game they can be replaced it another to lose that 500 hour save in skyrim or your completed pokedex gamers whether you are kids that would have to worry about punishments like this or just gamers in general back up your fucking saves in multiple places put out the money for action replay and whatnot if you have to enable cloud saves email yourself saves to a special account dedicated solely to that so if you do lose your collection if you get the games themselves back you can pick up right where you left off ,0,Flipping

MewtwoStruckBack,they can set the amount of time you have per game factory default is 22 seconds plus it goes up a little every time someone loses at 22 seconds even right after a jackpot you would need two buckets of five balls and ten buckets of four balls in order to jackpot once about 70 75 people lose the game will allow enough time for you to do nothing but four bucket balls and still win until it is won once then it goes back to the original difficulty dave buster uses the 20 second setting now this means that upon just having given up a jackpot the machine will require you get six buckets of five balls each and five buckets of four balls each in order to get a jackpot at about 70 75 losses in the extra time given will get the game back to original settings where you need two buckets of five and the rest four at about an additional 50 55 losses it will now be in full easy mode where you can do nothing but fours ,2,DaveAndBusters

MewtwoStruckBack,so it took about 6 5 hours but i managed 100 502 on 1 422 0 due to a bit of running around before going in i did not get in right at 11 30 that was my first mistake i come in to see both down the clowns rung up through 600 leaving them at 640 ish that was j and i now realize i need to defend my jackpots on clown where the last time i had to do this involved the fluffy couple looks like i will need to make 100 sure i am in at open on every possible day so i took the 2 000 available out of that moved onto tailgate 61k up through 121k with two fails space invaders i accidentally made 10th on the high score list my second game which triggered fuck you mode and it did not see any losing play from anyone else to roll it back down well shit there goes that someone that knew what they were doing to some extent played 2md it was sitting on 578 to win which meant someone hit 509 529 and 559 with no overscores upon seeing this i took it up through 999 with two fails along the way gb was at 1 2 to win taken up through 2 0 later in the day back to 1 6 taken up through 2 1 took ss once at around 300 jumpin jackpot once for 900 with two sensor fails prior to this panda got fixed went 33 33 34 when it came back up i was killing time waiting for zombie fills by playing candy crush from level 6 onward that was my second mistake sunk waaaay too much into that even though i did get it eventually with one 500 along the way found a credit on tippin swiped in won the jackpot played the second credit won in impossible mode swiped in again to avoid a card lock did not win that one managed a few wins in crazy tower hard mode even though that did not mean all that much a few wins on pirates crossy and one on regular crossy nerfed bonus be damned cleared a few racks on zombie while the 500s were empty and i was elsewhere apparently the e came out j and some 8 year old girl who knew what was going on with the e were playing her dad telling the girl not to let j get it and the girl sniped j wish i had knew it came out as i would have probably been able to hit it a couple semi hard qds to round things out the last of which was the nudge to push me over 100k on the evening ,2,DaveAndBusters

MewtwoStruckBack, 1 is about 40 800 and it goes to 41 000 when it not ready to pay i would say that a pretty good correlation that ready to pay couple thousand below the lowest high score and not ready to pay just above the highest ,1,DaveAndBusters

MewtwoStruckBack,i said the same thing in r hockey give the guy 30 days of community service or house arrest but with a catch each of the 30 days is done separately and each one will coincide with the next 30 games of predators playoff hockey this forces him to either be unable to attend or outright miss multiple years of predators playoffs yet keeps the guy out of jail ,3,penguins
MewtwoStruckBack,i do not think the guy should get jail laws and rules being what they are that still kinda dumb this guy is not a threat to society you do not have to lock up your valuables or protect your kids at night because this guy snuck a catfish in and disrupted a sporting event for 2 minutes with it if they want to do something significant to the guy to send a message yet not smack the guy with something that could ruin his life give him 30 days of either house arrest or community service with a catch each of those 30 days is separate and will coincide with the next playoff game the nashville predators participate in this way he has to either not attend house arrest or outright miss community service in a place the game cannot be watched the next multiple years of predators playoff hockey ,4,hockey

MewtwoStruckBack,play stupid games win stupid prizes ,1,hockey
MewtwoStruckBack,game ideas i have first the wide area progressive that i brought up in some other threads a while ago every single game that pays tickets has a little bonus wheel that can display on its embed reader embed would know if a game paid a jackpot and based on the difficulty of the jackpot a player would have a 1 in x chance of getting the jackpot for games where the jackpot gets hit all the time like down the clown it could be a 1 1 000 000 for games where it far less common like big bass wheel it might be 1 25 000 for that game every play on every machine in the store adds 1 ticket to the meter which starts at 250 000 tickets or so and accumulates until the prize is won if the embed spinner post jackpot lands on the jackpot it sends a signal to the main server that the jackpot was won to freeze the progressive and to call a technician to the machine to verify the win d b could easily afford to do this it would whip up an insane amount of excitement and it would not automatically be something the aps would hit games in the normal ap gambit that get rung up either 10x day 20x day or infinitely would have a very low chance but games that are harder to hit or not necessarily able to be aped would have much better chances have smaller prizes as well something like 5 10 tickets for your standard did not win the wide area progressive with occasional larger wins of 100 500 2x the jackpot you won bonus chips or things like a free dinner or appetizer or dessert loaded to your card like everyone a winner i would also still love to see something like the gauntlet it would be run similarly to pax omegathon and this is something that could make d b a shitload of money not lose it and would require aps branch out from their normal games let say you have got 256 people signed up 25 a head so 6 400 in comp everyone a dinner which is at most 5 in actual food costs so knock 1 280 off of that 5 120 remains round 1 of the tournament begins 6 player super shot matches make sure same number of balls are in each machine top 3 scores from each 6 person heat advance bottom 3 are eliminated you are down to 128 players round 2 have everyone get on a racing game like daytona usa or fast and furious anything where they have at least a 4 player setup same thing eliminate the bottom half of the field down to 64 round 3 something like down the clown top 32 scores advance round 4 a non ticket game possibly something like time crisis half of the field advances keep alternating between redemption and non redemption games eliminating half the field each time until you are down to 2 players but make sure the game that moved everyone from 4 to 2 has a way to determine which of the 2 people who advanced was better so you have a 1st and 2nd seed bring both of those players over to one ticket game the player with the higher seed determines whether or not they play first or second each player alternates until one of them wins the jackpot whoever wins first gets 1 000 000 tickets 4 000 i know there are probably legal issues with every single one of my ideas with some stores that cannot offer jackpots over 500 tickets or prizes over 250 it would be a legal nightmare for them to be able to pay out 4 000 worth of tickets to one person at one time but damn if it would not be cool and a huge draw as for games i want to go global it more games i want to see come back or games i never got a hold of stop the clock at 1 000 chip away spin doctor basically true skill based redemption where enough people lose so d b makes money but aps who know what they are doing can make a significant take off of it ,4,DaveAndBusters
MewtwoStruckBack,the prizes are better because the payouts are worse at round 1 so it much harder for an advantage player to be able to go in there on a consistent basis and come out ahead to where they can clean them out if d b had round 1 higher end prizes and priced them at the golden standard for ticket value they would be gone in a flash ,1,DaveAndBusters
MewtwoStruckBack,and let me guess the score to jackpot is 600 if this is the case the machine had a failure in its settings and no one ever bothered to reset it back to global i have seen this at pit too it usually not malicious just needs fixed ,2,DaveAndBusters
MewtwoStruckBack,they won the challenge so they retained their timeout ot all sports with replay challenges should make it that if you win the challenge you not only keep your timeout but retain the challenge as well nfl you should be able to keep challenging everything and anything until you are wrong twice in the same game nhl you keep challenging until you are wrong once mlb keep challenging until you are wrong once ,1,hockey

MewtwoStruckBack,the thing is there good dlc and shit dlc there valid microtransactions and microtransactions that should be barred good dlc the game is released and could be considered whole on its own the developers continue work after the game has gone gold and shipped and this additional content is sold shit dlc the game is released but with certain things blocked off from the player that are already present in the game files or disc dlc unlocks things the player would otherwise have access to if not for the block good microtransactions a free to play game allows a player to purchase in game currency that speeds past an arbitrary block however once the player has bought enough in game currency with real money the in game currency shop closes and the player is permanently given an increased spawn rate of power ups ability to bypass the block in question pokemon rumble world did exactly this stopping the player from putting in any more real cash once they spent 30 okay microtransactions purchasing booster packs in which a player is able to not only trade things from within the booster packs with other players but has a third party avenue in which they are able to sell the things in these booster packs to get real world cash back also a physical item which also has an effect in multiple games eg amiibo also having to pay some kind of recurring fee in which the money is directly going towards servers to keep the game playable online shit microtransactions basically the entirety of candy crush or anything where it infinitely possible to spend real world money in the game without any chance of a real world return on the open market with the reasonable expectation a player will spend more in microtransactions than a current no microtransaction aaa title on the market between all of the games being released on steam gog etc for far less than 60 and all of the other games currently on the market if you cannot make a game that can stand on its own for 60 maybe your game does not deserve to get made ,0,gaming

MewtwoStruckBack,because they are dumb that and we have essentially got a hand tied behind our back collectively given the whole cannot fix prices shit that said i do not know why you would want to sell tickets directly on ebay given it not in any of the lower fee brackets on ebay with a store and if you are doing this enough to have significant amounts to sell you have enough sales to operate a store the wiiu truly was the golden age of resale the entire goddamn community settled on a price stuck to it within a few dollars and it held for like two solid years we need another prize like that something that expensive not overcharged for ticket wise by d b meaning it holds to the golden standard of 4 1 000 tickets wo not be undercut because there a signifiant market something that in the 4 or at worst 6 fee bracket lightweight enough that shipping is not prohibitively expensive and that d b can stock on a regular basis i do believe a prize like that may exist again someday but there really is not one now ,2,DaveAndBusters

MewtwoStruckBack,there no reason to hate on the sens the caps and blue jackets are goons and play as such so it worthwhile to antagonize their subs but not in this case that said it just makes sense not to troll them right now this sub has a rule that you get banned from this sub for the rest of the playoff season so if you troll another sub now you get banned for the duration of the stanley cup finals which would not be very fun but if we get up a couple of goals in the clinching game of the finals with say 10 minutes to go it would make sense to troll the shit out of the opposing sub no matter who the opponent is as the ban could not be any longer than 10 minutes by this sub own rules the rest of the playoffs the math says it makes sense to get it in then but not now ,2,penguins

MewtwoStruckBack,finally pulled the trigger and bought a set of pucks plus three extra es i plan on pulling the whole good luck sinking it now bit pulling the e out of my pocket to try and freak a couple people out i do wonder if anyone actually going to try and go black hat and slip any additional es into a machine since i am not going to do this myself i am going to think theoretically if someone were to slip an e into a rack of pucks undetected say on a fill with half the letters already gone it would be possible to hit the e after two sets of zombi have come out call for a fill before a third set comes out and manage the amount of pucks in between the first e and second e that the only way there would be a discovery would be a full re initialize that being said re initializations happen fairly often both for good reasons number of a particular puck on the field has gotten fucked up somehow or ensuring a dispenser of pucks has been fixed and is no longer jamming up or bad reasons managers techs want to fuck over players who were close to the e but did not get it by the end of a night so this would not go undetected forever that said there are arcades where such a tactic would not be unwarranted particularly ones where they nerf on sight in response to aps rather than go by global settings change prize costs change jackpot requirements etc zome 28 would be confirmed to do this main event is questionable that said i will send some kind of prize to the first person who can show some kind of proof they have social engineered a second e puck into a zombie snatcher run by an arcade other than dave and buster should that arcade have a track record of acting in bad faith towards advantage players ,1,DaveAndBusters

MewtwoStruckBack,good 1 065 2 yielded 87 880 bad it took a bit over 6 hours the techs were busy packing up old games they no longer needed time crisis 4 and a couple others no redemption to be sent out to other stores which took up most of their time it made it take a while to get fills on zombie that said i only ran through two racks anyway no e to be found and most of my tickets were scratched and gouged out of other things i got in at open but there was a party that was let in early they rang up clown on one side to 650 and 600 on the other so i only managed 2 500 at first tailgate got rung up through 115k but the sensor in the 3 000 is failing and cost me a couple games pointed this out to the techs it yielded a reset so fuck the games i lost out on the reset exceeded the value of the losses went back to dtc later apparently the mechanism to release the balls broke that too was fixed via a reboot got lucky twice on finding a broken game in the same session j rung up floppy through 700 and a win or two on crossy i followed with one of my own and a few on pirates crossy which took it up to its new high of 350 managed to whack crazy tower a few times all in hard mode 2md through 999 gb through 2 45 left panda three separate times on 34 slam extreme once on 1 000 but it took 7 swipes because our tube is fucked space invaders got smacked about 12 times before it went to fuck you mode making it just as much a snipe as gb though i think it will not ready as quickly lots of little things losses on potc crossy that still earned 250 ice ball fx snipes a quick hit of speed demon of the 87k earned today about 55k of that was non zombie so if we do ever get that nerf it will be fine i will be there longer but my cost per chip will be better cashed out for a couple new games left half as usual no gopros in sight but they restocked much of the lower value stuff ,1,DaveAndBusters

MewtwoStruckBack,by that math 430 tickets yields exactly 43 50 winners and 10 100 winners the lottery takes in 4 300 and pays out 3 150 that a return of 73 25 coming from pa anything less than 77 is unacceptable and that 77 where they pull the ticket as soon as the last top prize is sold on conventional tickets where there are only 5 to 10 grand prizes so the effective house edge is lower seriously do the math pick any random pa scratch off lottery ticket currently being figure out the total number of tickets how much the lottery would take in and pay out if every ticket sold the patout will be within a few hundredths of 77 this 50 or 100 is not good it just less shit than you are used to ,1,Lottery

MewtwoStruckBack,this is a bit low i have all but stopped buying scratchers as i was in life ruining amounts of playing them for some time but when i did play i would not have played one like this i might have played one with a top prize of 500 600 if the odds were good enough and the ticket was cheap enough i would spend 5 but not 10 on a ticket like that pa does this kind of ticket right they short the other prize categories and there are still top prizes their overload ticket still has 5 300 000 winners odds on winning 1k are about 1 in 4620 480 and odds on winning 100 are 1 in 60 but they are harder to hit and the categories of prizes not in the overload are way harder to hit the only way i could see it being useful to have a ticket like this is if someone were laundering money but it would not really work on such a low denom if there was a ticket with say a 10 000 overload prize category like that 10 000 frenzy in another state and the overall ticket odds were like 85 i could see someone needing to legitimize a bunch of drug money embezzled money otherwise criminal gains going around buying a shitload of tickets so that they could claim a bunch of the 10 000 prizes write off the losses and now they have a valid source showing where their cash came from ,5,Lottery
MewtwoStruckBack,wait that math does not look right if you are doing the glitch you should be able to start a game on the second side as soon as you have the jackpot locked up on the first i think the glitch actually depends on that no so 500 points should be achieved probably 30 seconds in plus 5 seconds to start a game constantly moving from one machine to the other that 35 seconds per play that 14 000 seconds which would be just under 4 hours for 100 000 tickets that sucks about your arm though that could really be your mainstay game if it were not for that i really wish we had a double unit 2md cab at pit ,1,DaveAndBusters

MewtwoStruckBack,i would not have a problem with speed traps if the police were not able to keep the money generated from it if it went to another commonwealth city state cause selected at random so that there could be no mutual bribery then i would respect the idea of tickets being 130 for a basic stop sign red light violation more do the same with all money generated from civil forfeiture not one penny should go to the force to disincentivize using that power maliciously ,1,Showerthoughts
MewtwoStruckBack,i only get salty about the e when it someone who only ever plays for the e does not even stick around go for 500s which puts in significant progress towards the e coming out just only sticking around when they think it going to drop you play along with the rest of us you have a fair shot like the rest of us it can be a free for all no hard feelings for whoever wins it i think it a little different than sniping panda or tippin or gb panda will re ready itself for a hit in 10 plays tippin probably 10 15 gridiron if it a smart person running it up 20 losing plays will create 10 more jackpots ice ball fx while the jackpot may stay insanely low if the person sniping it at its max of 250 wins just barely it will be hittable at that same score requirement literally two plays after they won the more that has to go into a jackpot the more someone might get pissed when they put in towards it but come out empty handed zombie takes roughly 500 swipes to pay off sometimes more that a lot of effort to put in to see someone who put in no effort take it ,2,DaveAndBusters
MewtwoStruckBack,so we are assuming 2md at 2 credits per swipe at 5 5 2 8 and slam extreme at 9 9 5 0 for 3 balls right your average run on slam extreme for a good player was probably 7 000 tickets 60 balls at this point so that 20 swipes which is 100 chips on wed 10 for 7 000 tix 28 35 depends on when assume you have enough balls in 2md to be able to 999 consistently you are going for the same 7 000 tickets and you are getting two plays per swipe which means you need 14 swipes that 14 2 8 wednesday 39 2 chips so not only was it better it was over twice as good the only catch is you needed to be able to consistently max score it and that depends on there being 7 balls there was no guard back then and also those balls being tom brady deflated enough to be able to give you the margin for error to be able to hit the 50 at will when needed even if you were only winning every other game you would still be beating the old slam numbers at 7 000 60 that said only the best of aps can consistently hit 999 i can do it but not every game and whack n win beat slam even with slam pre nerf setup whack was 1 3 in its heyday if not better so a wednesday session was 1 020 chips to get about 102 000 which is smack dab in between old school average slam extreme and old school pre update tippin i still play 2md myself on wednesdays but not other days unless i am trying to show off and or ap some other guests for drinks ,1,DaveAndBusters
MewtwoStruckBack,in all seriousness it not your fault nor your problem nor should you be punished by removal of tickets should someone else leave a credit on a machine and you are knowledgable enough to know you need to swipe in for the tickets and you win twice every single time this has happened at pit the lock been removed but no tickets taken off it happens pretty often finding a credit in panda at 33 happens enough hell back in the day 2md had a glitch where every credit swiped in counted as 2 and swiping in after would put 3 credits on the machine on 1 swipe the one left there and two additional that would have triggered it every time but that was pre embed if you do not want to deal with it i would probably recommend keeping one card with a small amount of chips on it physical and then dumping the tickets to your main card that card will be forever locked but it not going to get tickets posted to it ,1,DaveAndBusters

MewtwoStruckBack,being able to ask for things that make sense when they make sense is pretty significant examples you are a fairly skilled down the clown player you can count on being able to run 2 500 tickets through each machine you go in one day and oh no one of the sides is tagged out because the motor that brings one of the rows of clowns up has died and they need to order a replacement part you run through your 2 500 tickets on the one down the clown and run into a tech you are on good terms with you ask hey since one clown broken can you reset the one that works once this is a reasonable question if both machines were working you would get 5 000 tickets with one machine broken if you were to ring it up to your max get a reset then ring it up again you get 5 000 tickets you are not getting more than you would otherwise it just eliminating the negative aspect of one half of the machine being out of order let expand on this both down the clown machines are out but you are a skilled tailgate player that can win 5 000 6 000 tickets on that in a day starting from the base score you run into the same tech and ask hey since both clowns are down can you reset tailgate this is not unreasonable either the 5 000 you lose out on by both clowns being down is being made up for by 5 000 or slightly more from tailgate getting rung up twice you might make out ahead slightly but the goal not to get more than you are entitled to but just not get less than your skill would justify you could even offer to only play it up for the 5 000 you would be missing out on on clown this could apply to any other game super shot jams up on you or the software freezes when you would have had a 500 jackpot asking for two swipes in 2md could be justified to make up the 500 ball bounces back into the chute in speed demon but you later got the jackpot figure out a similar cost game that you could reasonably ask for a swipe on and so on and so forth remember you are not trying to get one over on the techs they deal with people who are not even aps that do that and resent the fuck out of them you are just trying to get even to where you would have been if the issue did not arise or in your case what you would have had if you had allowed the kid to jackpot ,2,DaveAndBusters

MewtwoStruckBack,it like i do not expect more than others but i do not expect less like ok if a game breaks and i lose two swipes if i get two swipes i am cool i do not expect 3 or 4 or a brick of tickets handed to me i remember hearing a story where i was being called into question by the fluffy couple about whether or not i was getting help hitting jackpots and the manager straight up said mewtwostruckback can win his own jackpots he is not the issue let get to the actual issue at hand on the same token i do not expect to be treated like i was back in 2013 bet you thought this was going to be a 1998 undertaker meme where the one tech at pit intentionally only did half fills on tippin and waited forever to come fill it so i would have to wait around hours longer after i was done playing yes i know what you were doing and yes you were an asshole this tech if this is true is getting into asshole territory i really wish i had a couple million bucks so i could stay around each d b in the us for a few weeks and see how i get treated at each store with them having the idea that i would be a long term ap there ,2,DaveAndBusters
MewtwoStruckBack,there is so so much wrong here as you already know you have a tech thinking less of you because you are perceived to be an ap whether or not you are one guy at pit used to do this and there is one i currently avoid at pit for this reason you have the same tech deliberately interfering with the course of normal gameplay which if it were just you or just the kid would not be bad really but it was with the intent of favoring one guest playing over another plus you have the dude straight up playing with his tech card for someone i think at the point he told me to let the kid get the e i would have come up with a counteroffer on the spot was the jackpot about 3 000 that would be worth 12 so my response would have been comp my card 125 chips and you have a deal that tells him you are willing to work with him but it cannot be to your detriment kid gets 3 000 you get 12 50 in chips that you should be able to turn into more than 3 000 everyone wins and do not let him tell you he cannot do that if you bring that up senior techs are absolutely authorized to do comp loads for guests when the situation calls for it ,2,DaveAndBusters

MewtwoStruckBack,okay going to throw out some things on zombie here let say you catch the machine on a fresh start jp starts at 2 000 every tube is full e is unfortunately at the top it roughly 25 plays into the machine for the game to dispense one letter i consider a really good player on zombie yes i know there are better to be sinking two 500 pucks every 5 plays by d b math they are losing 1 50 on this exchange by our math we are making 2 20 that beside the point anyway there are i think 28 pucks that go into the 500 tube to top it off completely that means 70 plays on average and 14 000 tickets won plus any fluke pucks that drop in plus any letters the e tends to come out at about 3 000 3 200 if all is working right players are not leaving 5 letters on the field forever stopping progress towards new ones so it 600 ish plays i believe but am not sure there are 5 sets of zombi which would make sense for those numbers 26 25 650 plays which would put the e coming out about 3 300 if we are not on a fresh fill and someone manages to have the e come out and knock it and ask for and get a refill while there are 4 5 letters on the field after the fact it would but it to only 21 letters needing dropped 21 25 525 so it would be around 3050 so to put this in perspective if you are starting fresh and you are the only one playing the game that whole time at 650 plays to dispense an e an average of 2 500s dropped for every 5 plays you will have gone through more than nine full racks of 500s before the e would come out also for perspective that means you would have racked up 126 000 tickets from 500s the 3 300 from the bonus is a pittance in comparison tl dr chill about the mega bonus it not all that huge a deal in the grand scheme of things ,8,DaveAndBusters

MewtwoStruckBack,that a disturbing train of thought there deliberately going and hitting every single jackpot anyone else can hit not because it worth it to you but to discourage anyone else from playing at your location that a tactic that should only be used when there is another ap at your store acting truly in bad faith and it falls under message sending not every ap can hit every game and there are times where i have overlap with someone else where i will leave a game to be hit by another ap that quite simply needs it more than i do look at bubble berry for example he got three games pretty much floppy who j is running up to where the machine never goes below 600 to win the bonus panda as a snipe and gridiron if i know he going to be in i will leave him gridiron because his take on floppy fucked and i still have and tt at my disposal part of this is not only working with d b to keep under their targets on certain games but also working with your fellow community if a store gets too crowded ap wise yes that hurts but that does not mean it needs to be one solid ap at each store and fuck everyone else having a few diverse aps at a store can help with communication when prizes are coming in when a game gets fixed when something breaks new promos new hours etc perfect example of this for when it happens in the future there going to be another d b most likely out by robinson in pa that a reasonable drive for me but it going to be jjgeneral home store as it within 10 minutes of him if i go there i am not going to touch a single thing i know that he can hit but i will take the stuff i know i can hit but he cannot he can do panda so i will leave that be but i can do gridiron and he cannot so i will take that and not feel like i am shitting on his territory at that point the general rule of 100k was at one point 100k total on a wednesday with some exceptions but what will stop d b from nerfing stuff is far more specific by game tl dr even the best ap at a store should not go into their run with the idea that they are intentionally going to make it not worth going in for anyone else ,2,DaveAndBusters

MewtwoStruckBack,perspective here yes it sucks that you got jacked for 3 000 if you are left to your own devices and run through a rack of 500s en route to the e coming out that roughly 14 000 tickets in 500s your loss in this case was about 17 of your potential total if you went through two racks of 500s 9 6 three racks of 500s 6 66 unless your machine has that god awful nerf where 500s only come out intermittently it an inconvenience rather than something to get really buttmad about you can try and fight for what is right in either a split or countermeasures to prevent someone trying to snipe you but at the end of the day you cannot make everyone act in the best interests of the community at large let alone your best interests it about as difficult and productive as trying to convince every single person playing throwing games to not throw all the balls beanbags up after their time expires ,3,DaveAndBusters
MewtwoStruckBack,for a jackpot that is roughly 12 and on a non nerfed machine equivalent to about six regular top valued pucks which would take 15 plays on average to win which is like 5 40 in cost it caused more drama than just about anything else on the floor i am still imagining what it would be like if gambling laws did not fuck with arcades and there was a such thing as a 100 000 ticket wide area progressive like megabucks but with tickets and skill linked into every game on the floor a clear on panda at 35 would award a spin of the reels on embed in addition to its normal payout or a 999 on 2md every play on every redemption machine in every d b would add a fraction of a ticket to the meter until someone won a jackpot and also got lucky on their virtual slot spin displaying on embed imagine the drama a setup like that would cause ,1,DaveAndBusters
MewtwoStruckBack,if you have a known guy that does this and you and the other guy are on equal skill level you might suggest cutting through the crap and splitting the e that is to say if the guy putting in as much work as you in getting it to drop there one guy at pit that i will agree to do that with because he plays it as much as i do and we both know what is up now if this guy only plays when the e is out but refuses to even go after 500s or you have gone into it way more than him you have more of a right to suggest he not be going after it since you did all the legwork if that does not work you could potentially go dirty zombie on him if you are able to hit from any side of the machine move one to the left of him so that he cannot use your arm as a timing guide always be playing every revolution as your moving of the puck will make it so he cannot time right but there seems to be another issue that he has a tagalong if they are playing two sides you cannot successfully game him this way unless you have an ally yourself which generally is not solid ap to have to split tickets with someone that in your friend group alternatively if that does not work you could deliberately wait for him to get on only play once he loosened up 500s and just snipe him all day and if he says anything about it tell him oh like you do with me and the e back off when i am the one that put in the bulk of the play or i am going to make a point of doing this play fair and i will play fair in turn i did this to a kid who waited for me to dislodge the e and successfully sniped me took him about two thirds of a rack of 500s before he realized he was not sinking a single one and gave up and walked off getting the e for 3 000 cost him a lot more than 3 000 you have options just a matter of which one you decide to roll with in this situation ,1,DaveAndBusters

MewtwoStruckBack,this means complete dogshit in its current form but can mean something if retooled gustafson made an analogy to a midway basketball game saying that under the pledge the hoop can never be smaller than the ball maybe the ball is only 1 16th of an inch bigger than the ball but that still technically winnable through skill a mega stacker that is not ready to pay can allow 1 millisecond worth of timing window for every level of the game and still technically allow a win a tippin bloks that does not want to pay out can be set up a la software version 3 0 where it is still somehow feasible to win occasionally but it requires truly perfect play far beyond what is normal for the game this speaks nothing of them setting up games in what i call round 1 mode after the horrible arcade chain where the games are winnable but the value of the tickets won is less than the cost of the play even if won every time the closest i could see games being set up to have a hard mode yet still be completely winnable by skill is the current version of crazy tower the high speed mode when it paid out recently is very difficult to win in but if the player gets a perfect on the first 40 42 floors the error rate on the last 8 will still leave enough of a stack for a win aama if you are reading this and you want to put forth something that will gain a real vote of confidence the wording of your fair play pledge should read something like this as a member signing on to the fair play pledge we agree to the following no game in our arcades will ever be set with a skill barrier so high that a reasonaby skilled professional gamer cannot win with some level of consistency no game in our arcades will be set to where winning the jackpot or game normal top award is less than the cost of the play the minimum value of a game jackpot must be at least double its cost using a verified cash equivalent value of tickets that must be publically posted as well as the value of our gameplay credits games with jackpots that would reasonably require a significant number of plays read spelling zombie spelling launch on launch code or have a super bonus that requires significant luck read the monster jackpot on monster drop will have a minimum value of a certain multiple of the game base cost we will not change the value of a ticket without a significant lead time so that those who currently hold tickets have time to cash them in at the older higher rate if the value is to be lowered for those holding electronic tickets we agree to adjust the value of their holding upward to compensate for the loss in value for any tickets earned prior to the change in value for example if a ticket were worth 0 5 cents and this is to be changed to 0 4 cents someone holding 1 000 000 tickets prior to the change would have that adjusted to 1 250 000 tickets so they did not lose the 1 000 in value we will not price certain prizes above their standard ticket cost as a deterrent for people to redeem for them whether for personal use or otherwise basically the end of the apple product nintendo switch tax we agree that for games requiring dexterity with physical objects all machines will be stocked with enough of those objects that the player never loses time waiting for one to be ready to throw there will be a public posting of how many of each object ball bean bag etc are supposed to be in each machine that falls into this category we agree that games will not have their payout values or difficulty metrics adjusted in response to skilled play unless the game payout rate either exceeds 50 and the game coin in minus ticket out has not paid the arcade back for its cost to acquire the game or 75 if the arcade has made its money back on the game in question we agree that any prize offered in our arcade must be able to be redeemed for within a reasonable amount of time should stock deplete itself and we are not able to source one directly from the manufacturer we agree to source one from a third party that must be an equivalent or greater item all employees at our stores adhering to the fair play pledge will be instructed on these minimum payout values rules governing changing of payout metrics and number of balls bags throwable objects in games requiring such and swift action will be taken to correct any game that falls outside these metrics i remember hearing that there was some gaming commission in at least one state that required the d bs operating in its state set certain timing games to a more player friendly timing window to coincide with that state gaming laws basically i want to see that along with regulated payout percentages ticket values and ability to acquire payouts i am not saying they should have to pay out in the 90ish percent on their games because that just not reasonable if a machine costs 10 000 15 000 to acquire and it were required to be set to 95 that would mean requiring 200 000 300 000 worth of coin in just to make the money back your average redemption machine should make its money back in its first year of operation and thus should be allowed to operate at a lower percentage until it does this really could be something big if the rules concerning it have some teeth edit i have emailed the aama with a summary of this and asked for a follow up ,8,DaveAndBusters

MewtwoStruckBack,i can answer every single thing you asked here and refute all the incorrect information that was given to you first the spin n win errors out at 32 768 taking it over 10 000 goes through a b c d e f for 10k through 15k then it does an f with part of the left side of it missing i think a 7 with part of the side missing it for 5 000 in a row some other weird symbols goes blank for one of them i used to have it all written down but have not played spin in forever this is not an error it just how the game handles five figure sums but do not take it over 32 768 or it will roll over to 0 card blocks these are by individual game and the system smarter than you would think each game has a set limit as to what you can win on it without locking your card for most games that have a 1 000 ticket jackpot it around 1 300 or so this allows for times where you might say find a credit in kung fu panda swipe in your own card win on one of the two plays 1 000 but lose on the other 50 or for games that just pay a few tickets over 1 000 because the pulses it sends to embed are not always 100 perfect when playing the same game repeatedly this is multiplied by the number of times you swipe your card so if you play twice it wo not lock you out until you hit 2 600 three times and it will be 3 900 and so on so if you are sitting and playing spin over and over and over there should be no reason your card gets locked now if you were to play a bunch of spin n win go snipe a jackpot on a nearby game and then swipe back into spin n win this may reset that counter to 1 play and thus 1 300 tickets before a card lock and if you have a lot of tickets left to go to your card this may cause a lock there is no reason embed cannot count up into five or six figures i have seen someone manage 100 000 paid in one lump before you do not have to stand there and wait for your tickets because no one else can swipe into a game that is paying out tickets except for the card that was originally used to win those tickets i have heard stories of techs in other stores where they have turned a game off and back on because they thought it was malfunctioning a runaway transaction where embed just never stops posting tickets to the card like water race paying someone 40 000 tickets we know that bullshit but if the techs know there an ap that racks up on a machine at a store they should have a general idea as to whether or not it a runaway or if someone in the store won those tickets legit long story short there was a lot of misinformation if you need to please have your store technicians contact me either through this forum or hell have them call pittsburgh d b and talk to their agm to have them talk to me or they can just talk to him because he will know of the issue ,4,DaveAndBusters

MewtwoStruckBack,the swipes setting for 500s will absolutely kill the game for anyone that knows even the basics of it one of my biggest complaints about round 1 has always been games where the highest possible win on an individual play is less than the cost of the game a breakdown of this is in the sidebar if the removal of the 500 pucks as a constant occurs nationwide this will be the case for zombie snatcher it is not reasonable to assume a player will be able to sink a puck from its dispense point in the inner circle in one swipe even in ideal conditions this typically takes two swipes one to move it to the edge and one to knock it over this is often compounded by the traffic of low value pucks which i understand is intentional otherwise they would not be there in the first place on days other than wednesday it costs 72 cents for those using coupons or who have discounts on gift cards for one swipe d b considers a chip 15 cents rather than 10 which would put their value of one game at 1 08 d b also considers a ticket to be 0 4 cents so 250 tickets is 1 by their internal numbers this means that if a player were to sink a 250 puck every single game it would be considered by them that the player is still on the losing end realistically a pro player would average a targeted puck every other swipe this averages out hole in ones vs times where a puck gets obstructed or stuck behind other pucks so if it taking two swipes even on wednesday this would be 7 2 chips to sink a puck which would be 1 08 by d b math putting the player behind still for this reason the nerf which is still in testing should not be implemented i understand the nerf to qd because on a perfect machine it is still possible to win consistently although the skill barrier is very high i understand the payout nerfs to floppy and crossy as pro players on those games can still come out ahead of the cost of a game on a regular basis even if the tickets per hour are particularly high zombie different ideally there would be some kind of setup that auto reloaded the pucks instead so technicians did not need to be called for that task i doubt it is feasible for zombie otherwise it would have been implemented ,2,DaveAndBusters

MewtwoStruckBack,i ended up with 84 096 on 1 290 5 in about 5 hours plus a drink dinner break and 15 minutes talking outside when i came in one side of dtc was already at 740 and the other side jackpot score display was broken i figured i would start on on zombie snatcher j approached me and offered to alternate with me on 500s so we did not interfere with one another he told me the 740 on dtc was from a duo that did it a bit before i got there well shit the middle row was disconnected on the other side they powered it off to fix that score display never got fixed but not hard to figure it out so at least 2 500 came from that took tt from 75k through 120k had a couple bad games and got discouraged from going further j and i agreed to do a 50 50 split of whoever got the e rather than fight over it we cleared all the 500s and knew the e would be out next another regular but not part of the ap group went over and started playing for 250s to try and coax the e out i set my card to physiclal tickets and started playing for 250s as well knowing it was next j finished his game of flappy set to physical tickets and right when he came over the e came out the regular that is not part of our group attempted to hit it whiffed edged it and j got it on his first try we split 3 590 and had the agreement next time we were both there i would sink the e and we would still split it did not even bother with floppy since it was 574 before i even got in pirates crossy was 316 and a couple plays were not enough for me to hit that i did hit regular crossy twice starting over 220 took it well above no overscore penalties there i know the software was not updated because if it had i would have been texted about it and it getting its lifetime high score reset took 10 jackpots out of gridiron easily could have been more but wanted to leave some for bubble berry it was only at 1 66 to win at this point though the little kid who i let come in to play twice knocking 0 1 off the requirement helped ran 2md from 526 one person won one game and stopped at 509 through about the 920s with one fail j and i saw super shot got back to 500 with a 68 score to win we figured we would experiment what happened if we both exceeded the score he threw a 69 i got a 71 or 72 it only gave the jackpot to my machine so apparently in order to double up we would need to both not only beat the score to win but tie exactly that going to be a bitch but i would love to get that on video someday pissed away way too many swipes on crazy tower more than half of the time i did hit it it was in hard mode it still winnable then though i am not sure how consistently being able to perfect streak up through to where you only have 10 floors to go really helps if you let any of the blocks go back and forth within the last five floors you are fucked you hae to do it on instinct at that point if it in hard mode overall a good day really hoping we get pop the lock and baseball pro soon i want to see if the latter can be hit consistently somehow and the former is back to 500 i do not plan on taking pop the lock for six figure sums every day as happened with some stores in testing because we saw what happened with that and qd recently but i would like to be able to work it into my repertoire as much as zombie is now for if and when that eventual nerf rolls out nationwide i am not even mad that it would not be at 1 000 tickets like it apparently was when it started i do not mind needing four swipes to win nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer table ,1,DaveAndBusters

MewtwoStruckBack,they come in a pack of 20 they already have replacements my response to this would be that in every other game involving throwing objects the games are set up so that the player ideally never has to lose time waiting for a ball object to come back down the tech setup paperwork mentions putting 12 in dtc which is just enough to never lose time waiting 7 8 in 2md accomplishes the same 5 in super shot just barely though 6 would be optimal but in some rare cases would jam the machine at the start of a game so i understand 5 anything less than 11 in tt causes significant delay to the player ever game and is a loss of jackpots that should not be occurring ,1,DaveAndBusters
MewtwoStruckBack,ohhhh yeah that a big one 2md the randoms that know how to do it somewhat not aps not slouches can get in the 600 700 range and it frustrating either seeing someone throwing away tickets to show off at times even knowing the thing about overscores and not caring and yeah the clown bit is frustrating because we all feel like that our jackpot because we can do it solo but it technically legal does not make it suck any less i just got beat out of 2 500 yesterday from that one of my future planned projects is youtube videos covering arcade etiquette and i am hoping i can get a couple of the big names to come along for it if several hundred thousand subs on the big channels all see why it important to help one another out through not overscoring and not throwing all the balls beanbags up and other things where there should be cooperation between guests it might help more people win more jackpots ,2,DaveAndBusters

MewtwoStruckBack,balls are going to disappear no matter what sadly thankfully bean bags have not been stolen or wound up disappearing like the footballs in 2md and the balls in dtc but still on 2md having the ability to rapid fire 7 8 balls at the start of a game is often enough to make or break a game in the 900s and having at least 5 balls down and ready at the start of dtc vs having no balls and having it do a quick start of the timer when it says knock em over right after you swipe costing you 2 seconds before you get your hands on the first set of balls that a game breaker at anything above 650 for most ,1,DaveAndBusters
MewtwoStruckBack,this is true but if all 12 bags have been thrown up into the machine you will not have all 12 back by the time it says ready go at which point the timer starts automatically and even if you do somehow have them all back by then the 3 000 hole wo not be at the bottom of the wheel the optimum position to start a game in if the bags are left down for you you will have them set and be able to start the game in that optimum position semi moot point because you can pull the belt forward to get some of the bags but the ones that are stuck in the top part of the inside of the game wo not come out until it starts rotating ,2,DaveAndBusters

MewtwoStruckBack,i think this could be done even better if konami would get on board with it have the cards on the field of play be real cards some of which are the ridiculously powerful ones you need to have in a deck think back in the day where you had 3 dark armed dragon a copy of crush card virus a set of destiny draw etc only release those cards in the d b coin pusher and deliberately hold back on limiting or banning them from competitive play make it so the people who were able to get them have a clear and decided advantage when it comes to tournaments they enter you would have people on the machine from the minute cards were loaded in and the secondary market value of the key cards would get into the hundreds of dollars as opposed to the 15 50 market of regular gary non foil rares and foil rares in star trek sets also to go further up in your comment if they had a pokemon pusher and there was a legitimate mewtwo collectible in the coin pusher i would have to start playing coin pushers ,2,DaveAndBusters
MewtwoStruckBack,the fact that it rolls over so much is part of the problem honestly just set it up in the system so quick picks do not pick a set of numbers someone else already played so that if 300 000 000 or so people buy and play quick pick each person will have a different set guaranteeing the jackpot gets hit but of course they wo not do that unless their hand is forced because of how much extra revenue is brought in from people not hitting it and the jackpot getting to astronomical proportions ,6,Lottery

MewtwoStruckBack,do not get me wrong i despise kaizo i think it has no place in mario but i think a blanket filter that gets rid of all levels with hidden blocks of any sort is going a bit too far honestly i wish we just had the ability to tag levels as kaizo troll a combination thereof etc level uses hidden blocks to trap you in a pit you cannot escape from or otherwise intentionally causes death inability to complete the level from hitting them tag as troll level requies you to mid air shell jump past an obstacle then spin jump on the bob omb hitting it perfectly five times before it explodes to kick it just far enough to blow up an obstacle in your path before jumping on yoshi en route to licking up a shell spitting it out and having to jump on that in mid air tag as kaizo then give the player the ability to eliminate things with those tags so those who want to take on super expert can get 6 legitimate hard fair challenges i say this as someone on page 1 of the super expert clears list so it not that i cannot clear se i just think it possible to make really hard levels without needing pure muscle memory or advanced tech that do not include objectively unfair methods to force deaths ,2,MarioMaker

MewtwoStruckBack,i actually heard about this situation before your post from my understanding the machine somehow got mis set however that may be to allow 30 seconds instead of 20 and the people at your location knew about it in a situation like this where there a clear mis set and it was going to be fixed as soon as someone realized what was going on i do not really blame the people who were playing it as much as they could from my understanding the timing bit has been fixed as of wednesday and was rolled back from 30 seconds to 20 but the progressive is still being raised by 5 instead of 2 this is why it reaching ridiculously high numbers before it goes into normal mode let alone easy it usually takes about 75 ish plays to get to where you can safely do two 5s instead of 6 which would mean on your mis set game it would be at around 875 probably safe at 900 additionally there still that other issue in the player favor going on that will probably get fixed too same time the progressive does this brings up a particularly interesting dilemma if something has been nerfed at other stores but was never nerfed at yours then it might be wise to keep quiet about it in hopes that no one ever realizes a nerf was supposed to be applied this generally applies to things like a crossy road set to its old payout of 1 4 per step instead of 0 7 or something where the change in payout is not evident just by a quick glance at the machine a machine with a jackpot of 1 000 where it has been nerfed to 500 or 250 that will probably be discovered much more quickly a machine that was easier was then nerfed and then somehow got mis set back to being easy that a little different because the people at that store know it supposed to be on a different setting and it will get fixed as soon as it realized the people who were responsible for making sure it got set to the correct global settings or nerfed are in that store and know what those settings are so there should not be much to protect now in your situation should the machine have been allowing the full 30 seconds but the progressive were going up by 2 instead of 5 there would be no visual indication that anything was wrong with it so i might have suggested playing it in short bursts of 10k 25k day instead of whacking the hell out of it for longevity sake and the other aps working with you on that this also brings up the question as to just how liberally d b enforces the game malfunction voids all plays and pays part of their terms of service is a machine mis set to easier settings considered a malfunction and if so does that mean they will yank tickets back off a card and refund the plays for those games for players who played it during the mis set period if so then there nothing to be gained by playing it as opposed to informing a tech manager if not then again i understand it being played heavily as it was ,4,DaveAndBusters

MewtwoStruckBack,if it were possible to bring up goons on one day contracts to beat the shit out of someone with the intent they either never play again or never play other than to try to end someone career life and not have the team doing this lose draft picks or some other huge penalty teams would have been doing it long ago honestly i am surprised that i do not see it in the nfl where some nobody gets thrown in a game against the patriots and well after the play is over tries to deliberately either take out brady knees or deliver a similar hit to the one that jack tatum delivered to darryl stingley that paralyzed him there are probably rules against this that would penalize a team rather than just the player instructed to do it and other rules laws against slipping the player a few million under the table off the books of the standard salary cap to cover what the player would have made if they had a real career and to cover all fines the player would take ,1,penguins
MewtwoStruckBack,in keeping with the spirit of playoff hockey are not penalties supposed to go down like attacking a specific user in another sub would be a long if not permaban from here during the regular season it should be a two minute ban during the playoffs edit also it says if you troll another team sub you get banned for the duration of the playoffs does that mean if we are up 3 goals in the clinching game of the stanley cup finals with 5 minutes to go we can all brigade the fuck out of the other sub and only get banned from here for those 5 minutes because there should seriously be some method of trolling other subs that does not get you banned from here if we win the whole thing 24 hour moratorium on the rules or something ,28,penguins

MewtwoStruckBack,absolutely i am if i suspect there are other high volume lottery players at a store then i believe that they will buy the high value tickets staying at the machine buying them one or two at a time until they have a big winner or run out of money if this is the case the only way i would get a big winner playing after them would be if they run out of money are playing a different ticket and there are a limited number of high denom tickets or hit what they believe is a significant winner only for there to be a larger winner behind the first one eg 20 ticket they buy until they hit 100 give up and there a 500 winner later in the roll if i am the only one playing the heavy hitters at that store with any regularity then i know i wo not have that risk if there not a big winner in a pack oh well if there is i will have a decent crack at it big grocery store in an area that wealthier never hit for shit there so i stopped buying tiny ass gas station or convenience store by my house i have hit a good number of winners there grocery store in a less wealthy area but has a lot of terminals the lottery counter even if there someone that sits and plays until they win something of significance they probably do not have enough money to buy from all those terminals and if they did they would probably just buy books anyway i have hit decently there in the past and will continue to buy there for reference tiny ass gas station by my house has yielded my largest claim winner and someone else won 30 000 there in the past grocery store in poorer area has yielded several 250 300 500 hits grocery store in rich area has never yielded a hit over 100 for me and i highly suspect someone else is getting to them first doing the play until you hit big strategy ,3,Lottery
MewtwoStruckBack,i think i can take this one for me i expect my hobby to either make me money or at least pay for itself i did not travel to yu gi oh tournaments until i reasonably expected to place and also trade for stuff to flip to profit my current side hobby beating arcade games for profit i have a reasonable expectation of how much i should make each session that said if i am going to put in the time to get good at something i expect my total hours invested to make more per hour than i would in another hobby or something outside my main job in smash this is almost impossible and it really is impossible for new players to put out the time travel costs entry fees unless you are like top 25 in the game you have a negative expected value going to an event one of the common arguments is how will you get good if you never compete this is true and i would rather pay a local pro for hours of training and coaching as opposed to putting money into tournaments with zero expectation of being able to take money my ideal scenario i would like to see happen is some absolute nobody come onto the scene who was paying a few hundred dollars for hours of training from one of the top 10 20 players they start going to locals and regionals and wreck everyone and everyone like who the fuck is this kid and that player never has a lifetime negative as far as tournament winnings vs expenditures tl dr there not enough money in smash and not enough chance for anyone but pure professionals to come out ahead for it to be worth it if money is one of your prime motivators ,2,smashbros

MewtwoStruckBack,shit i mean it should be available in every stage plus some tournaments should be run on it simply because people would have to rethink comboing as the knockback of any attack would be ever changing and you could not account for hitting your opponent at x percent and knowing they would move exactly so far up or to the side so you can plot the next hit in a way that indefensible it would shake up the status quo ,-2,smashbros

MewtwoStruckBack,the game was built to win as many tickets as possible first and foremost yes there a high score yes there a bit of pride in being the one to hold it but between getting several extra jackpots or having the high score i will take the extra jackpots the three digits of my high score on the screen are not going to pay my next water bill or month of cell phone service or for my next dinner out yes there the allure of the high score yet that does not mean it a good idea for the sake of profit to do your absolute best every attempt for example gridiron blitz when the game has not been hit in a while or enough losing play has been put in the time to beat will be a fairly generous 9 seconds there a high score list for the day and you can wow someone by running through the last round as fast as you can possibly in 7 seconds but then you have fucked yourself and anyone else out of potentially twenty jackpots that could have been achieved in between 9 0 and 7 0 sandbagging when it smart to do so is a huge part of ap and manners regarding switches first i remember in another thread both you and someone else grabbing a whole bunch of them second my store limited them to 1 per person for the first week and a half and there did not seem to be any kind of issue with that if there are issues at a store or stores you go to as far as who redeems for what that would be something that probably should have been worked out between you and your local ap crew in advance of the release no i got one switch two other aps did the last two sat for a week and a half someone else got one sunday that is not part of our circle and they allowed me the last as enough time had passed and 2 was all i was looking to get out of the initial ship anyway half rounded down ,2,DaveAndBusters
MewtwoStruckBack,no no you are not i deliberately intentionally die as soon as i have the required score on just about every game i play crossy as soon as i have crossed the threshold unless i have a reasonable idea that the machine has seen so much play that there will not be an overscore penalty then i will take one game as far as i can go clown stop as soon as i have the jackpot so that the other balls can remain in the trough if there time left this includes after my last game so the next person to play has them all available and does not eat the 0 5 to 2 second disadvantage of waiting for balls to come down at the beginning yet their clock is still ticking super shot stop after the jackpot is achieved all balls trickle down into the trough to prepare the next player for their game 2 minute drill stop after just nudging over the high score as many footballs as can get down the conveyor get down and stay there so the next person has as good of a chance as i can leave fuck i have gone as far as to call out people who throw the balls remaining in the trough on clown drill ss if they have not swiped because i left those for the next person to play to have an advantage some of them get pissy with me i do not care sometimes mama bear or papa bear comes in trying to give me shit about how dare i talk to their kid i defend my point every time if you are gonna run the score up and do proper ap while you are doing it you are gonna run it up by losing after the jp intentionally each time scoring 201 202 on crossy to beat the requirement of 200 then 215 216 to beat the 214 then just over 228 then just over 242 etc etc even if the score to win is not going to smack you with an overscore for the most part you still end up tanking simply because tickets per hour is greater that way so i do not get how you mean people are not speaking realistically when at the very core of everything i try and show and teach and train in ap falls along those lines ,3,DaveAndBusters

MewtwoStruckBack,this is what a 10 ticket the odds on a 100 winner on 10 tickets are generally worse than 1 60 i just looked up the odds on the site of yours it 1 75 so instead of thinking of it as if you buy 75 tickets you will win it once it a 74 75 chance you wo not if you multiply 74 75 50 times equivalent to buying 50 of these the odds are about 51 11 that you still wo not have seen a 100 winner for any prize it 1 3 61 about a 22ish chance multiplied out seven times there a 10 32 chance you will buy seven of these and not see a winner so for every ten people that go out and buy seven of these one of them wo not see even a single breakeven of course you are only going to see videos on youtube of the big wins except for people who scratch whole books like that guy who won 10 000 000 back in the day but just loves scratching so he keeps at it or the occasional youtuber who wants to give a clear and honest representation of what playing the lotto is really like people will record once they see they have a winning number or a big win symbol or they will start to record themselves scratching 2 tickets if both are losers delete the recording if one a loser and the other a breakeven delete the recording and keep doing that until there a significant win caught live looking at you on this one hammer if someone wins big they tell a lot of people if someone loses they usually shut up about it that how gambling is ,2,Lottery

MewtwoStruckBack,shit paid out more back then the 10 off every day for gold card holders was a thing back then and tickets were valued 25 higher 0 5 as opposed to 0 4 cents 2001 was aping stop the clock slide master match em up chip away and a few other things match em up was 250 with no auto lose chip away was 100 to start maxed at 1 000 and one person playing a two player game on the same machine that met the jackpot requirement on both games got a double jackpot before the reset stop the clock was 500 no way that value would last now slide master started at 250 i think when it debuted it was later dropped to 100 other games had different settings hummer could be beaten back then fairly well stop the clock was at least a 25 win proposition also they occasionally priced things far far below book value ipod video was 300 in stores at release but 46 000 they said they used a lower price to entice people to want to save up for them video games were 8 500 tickets 42 50 for things that regularly sold in stores for 60 and game shipments were often as high as 8 copies of an individual title an ap could seriously consist off of nothing but flipping games not to mention if you were fortunate enough to have a place that would take those games as store credit returns at face value the math was far different than just half price and not ,1,DaveAndBusters

MewtwoStruckBack,stop the clock was pre 1 2 price 1 9 per play all the time but chips were 20 cents each then and not 10 i think the absolute best you could get was 535 chips for 100 for a while 18 69 cents per but realistically it was 20 cents a chip my ratio on a good day was 500 2 50 on a win 1 4 50 tickets 0 25 or 25 tickets 0 125 about half of remaining games so for every 8 plays three 50s three 25s and two 500s rate of return during that time was roughly 2 1 tippin bloks was still during the tail end of the 0 5 cents per ticket bit i was willing to play outside of half price and that was 4 2 chips it was possible to get 10 cents a chip but most of us loaded at 12 5 back then as the coupons were not so heavily out there 52 5 cents per play at an 80 win rate for 2 50 on a win and 15 cents on a loss on full price i would spend about 131 25 for 507 50 in value on 1 2 price day i was spending 65 for that same 507 50 rounding it to make the math easier probably 65 and 130 for 1 000 roughly a 5 1 return tippin was without a doubt much better ,2,DaveAndBusters

MewtwoStruckBack,rage something that gives you a benefit for taking damage but not dying back to the wall kind of thing i see nothing wrong with this random tripping it like that 1 255 miss that was present with every move back in the original pokemon that was not swift except in this case 1 100 i believe for tripping could there have been a better equalizing mechanic done absolutely but it was still his decision to include one he saw that there was too much of a skill gap in his game and adding such factors were how he wanted to reduce that skill gap so the better player is not just miles above the competition and in a way that could not just be turned off like items hazards how middle school going while presumably drooling on your own shirt ad hominem attack attack the argument not the person i am arguing that sakurai and his employer by extension have every right to support or not support groups of their game players and to tweak future games to that end there are so so many games and developers that support the competitive aspect of their games i do not get why the smash community just feels so strongly they need that recognition and support from nintendo when marvel tekken street fighter etc would so readily provide it ,1,NintendoSwitch
MewtwoStruckBack,and i absolutely love sakurai for it he made something the way he wanted he has tens if not hundreds of thousands of people trying to tell him that he doing it wrong and he basically goes oh i am making my game wrong he tells his haters to fuck off in one of the greatest ways possible doing his own thing and essentially ignoring the community despite the money they could potentially bring in if pandered to his game his way means more to him than profit ,-4,NintendoSwitch
MewtwoStruckBack,nintendo owes you nothing if the developers of the game do not want to create a competitive scene for their game because that was not their vision for what they want then so be it the community making its own scene is all well and good r smashbros saying leave us be when we make our own competitive scene with no items or randomization in results is perfectly fine r smashbros saying nintendo give us money and support for a competitive scene and we only want you running it with no items or randomization is not you want support for a popular competitive game either design your own or support a game where the developers are on board with it being played competitively which is literally every other franchise at evo except for smash ,2,NintendoSwitch
MewtwoStruckBack,nintendo could viably suppport esports for anything they intended on being an esport which it to say everything except smash i already see a number of rather entitled comments from people thinking nintendo owes them support for smash when the people who created smash did not intend on it being a competitive game being played the way it currently is by that community ,1,NintendoSwitch

MewtwoStruckBack, it not what the game is about sakurai himself said that the game was about not putting too much stock into whether you won or lost being able to laugh off what happened and go onto the next game that would clearly suggest he intended for things that equalized randomized to be part of the end product i have a feeling before the end of this comment chain i am going to have to get together a compendium of all of the relevant anti tourney mentality sakurai quotes with references to have them on hand nintendo is not forced to do shit and they are sure as hell not supporting competitive given there no series like capcom is running for their games they have included some things competitive like but they are taking the piss out of 1v1 no items rather than truly supporting it it goes back to brawl dojo where the japanese demo of being able to have a user tagline going into a game said real men use peach whereas the us version used real men use items the demo of the smash 4 online tournament mode made a mention of no items fox only final destination because they are laughing that that all people think the online smash community is and all they want the wiiu did not fail because it pandered to casuals the original wii pandered to casuals as much if not more than the wiiu and it was one of the greatest successes of their company the wiiu sold worse and did worse than the wii because they failed so badly in marketing it plus with the name there are people that still to this day think the wiiu is an accessory for the original wii rather than its own standalone console and was unnecessary i do not begrudge the competitive community for street fighter for tekken for guilty gear for marvel for any of those games because those games were built from the ground up with pure skill based competition in mind by the developers that what the people that made those games want the companies that made those games in some cases choose to put out money to support competition for those games i seriously wish that everyone who feels that the only true way to play smash is with all randomness disabled and nothing but player skill should determine the outcome would migrate to literally any other game on evo circuit where the people crafting those games welcome them with open arms i am not saying i want to see all skill go by the wayside in smash smash was not designed to outright be like mario party where you have no clue who truly in the lead until the last turn of the game there a such thing as too much equalizing i am saying i want to see slightly more than the occasional upset i want to see something like this https www youtube com watch v gfcnnptuhgw in a nintendo run competition at least once a year i want to see something on par with this https www youtube com watch v f2s6vzihbkm every once in a while i want a lower level between good and great great and elite elite and top 5 of the game if a lesser player that is not one of the gods has absolutely no chance to do anything except get bodied by one of those players then why should they even attend to improve there are much cheaper ways to do that that do not involve flushing your money down the toilet on airfare accommodations entry fees venue fees i want to see it be a fair bit less sure that the likes of armada hungrybox mew2king are just going to take everyone money and a fair bit less sure that the guy who put a couple hundred hours in is just going to get fucked by the guy who has 10 000 hours in that what all of those hazards and randomizations are there for nintendo has treated the competitive community like a red headed stepchild because there are enough people involved with the development of smash that feel that that segment of their player base is simply not wanted look at how project m was snuffed out any other franchise probably would have hired those developers on because any other franchise wants to support that type of competition nintendo does not i wish the community would take the hint and disperse but we both know it never will ,1,DaveAndBusters

MewtwoStruckBack,the thing is they legit should not care given the food markup i mean let look at it seriously d b has 25 000 ticket prize valued at 100 retail ap wins for 40 or so ap picks up flips at 85 after expenses d b has paid out a prize worth 100 minus 40 that the ap paid in so they are out 60 here in an unrelated instance someone else gets a 100 dinner for which d b pays 25 making 75 between that dinner and the loss on the tickets they are up 15 in the other scenario d b allows redemption of tickets for food at face value not a promotional rate at 4 per 1 000 tickets the same ap spends the same 40 to get the same 25 000 tickets a 100 value they do not redeem for a prize but instead offer to cover someone else check at a 10 discount taking 90 to pay the 100 bill in tickets in the first scenario d b puts out 100 on a prize and 25 on cost of food for the dinner 125 total and gets 40 in chips from the ap and 100 from the couple having the dinner totaling 140 d b is up 15 in the second scenario d b spends 0 on a prize and 25 on cost of food for the dinner and gets 40 in chips from the ap they are up 15 the ap in the latter case has cash in hand rather than a third party sale that has its own negatives at this point d b should be indifferent they are getting the same net there are other things we do not know the exact cost maybe d b markup on food costs is greater than 4 1 maybe d b is getting a significant discount on the prize the ap would be flipping it not all that much of one though i have seen their old ipad invoices but in general there should not be a worry that d b would lose money by allowing redemptions in this manner for many people they might spend a much larger amount on tickets knowing they will use them towards the cost of their bill another intangible is that if aps are able to cash out by working deals with others for food these are tickets they do not have on hand to wipe out the current stock of consols games or other high end items that regular guests might want to be able to go after but would be out of stock because of the aps this could induce more play as those items are visible and in hand ready to be won by casual guests plus there the non ap aspect where an ap might decide to treat themselves rather than just trying to work the room to liquidate on someone else bill and d b actually does get to get those tickets off the books in a non electronic redemption manner long story short i would see more positives than negatives come from expanding tastes for tickets if done right ,5,DaveAndBusters
MewtwoStruckBack,there should be a law that if you operate in multiple countries the minimum wage you offer in all countries must be equal to the highest minimum wage of all the countries you operate or sell to it would stamp out shit like this and also outsourcing as there would be no wage savings in hiring someone from a different country for things like call centers etc ,-1,worldnews

MewtwoStruckBack,i do not mean booze as there are too many screwy laws but yeah you would think for food it would be a total win they get tickets off the books in a way that lets them have a 3 1 4 1 markup if they did actual menu cost they could even go down to 2 1 markup and probablt still get their advantage back from most aps i would seriously eat there almost every day i played there if getting to pay for anything that is not alcohol with tickets were part of the deal ,5,DaveAndBusters

MewtwoStruckBack,it depends i would generally say it just compared to the number of total entries but sometimes there are ones that give you varying numbers of entries at random per ticket or multiple tickets all go into the same pool but the more expensive the ticket the more entries proportionally that you receive admittedly i would be a bit bitter if someone won a second chance drawing on tickets that were discarded by someone else without gambling having a gambling problem themselves if someone going to win i would rather it be someone that has the same urge to play scratchoffs as the rest of us in this community and other youtube scratchers if someone wins a huge second chance off of trash tickets i hope somehow some way the person who discarded the losing ticket gets wind that it was there ticket fights it legally and somehow wins or at least makes it too expensive for the trash picker to fight it ,2,Lottery

MewtwoStruckBack,me bitching about there being any discussion at all would be the biggest instance of the pot calling the kettle black in the history of the subreddit two words wired cracked one thing i will throw out there now that there all this new exposure if anyone out there for any reason finds themselves to where they are doing something that will generate exposure whether directly you get asked to be involved with some kind of interview for what we do or indirectly you won something that gets a lot of attention like recently please be sure that whatever platform you have the attention of you try to drill the point home about the importance of working together and not stepping on one another toes of course there going to be some discussions that turn what we do to the public eye that unavoidable and can at times be profitable in and of itself see also the aping more than the machines challenge and what it represents more people going into d b is good more people that become competition for the same jackpot pool that also refuse to work with one another not so much the longstanding members of the subreddit know the ten commandments of d b ap and how to best follow the rule of do not be a dick if new blood going to come into the community that should be the first thing they are exposed to before tip 1 about how to win stuff ,3,DaveAndBusters

MewtwoStruckBack,the problem is that the ap is now making less playing for you than they would be for themself this only works if it a friend that doing you a personal favor as opposed to you being a random person trying to get them to take on a job for you because if they are making less playing for you and they are there to make money then why would they be doing it ,1,NintendoSwitch

MewtwoStruckBack,rather than reply to every single person in the thread i am going to abuse mod power and sticky a comment as far as those grabbing multiples there is an indirect element in play here besides just wiping out the new batch if ap 1 at store x gets all the switches and aps 2 3 4 and 5 did not get one because ap 1 got them all there would most likely be some backlash multi pronged at that first that ap would probably be cut out from the social circle which would be a detriment long term as it stands now i get texts from other aps at my store as to when they are in what machines are at at the moment etc i send those texts out where i know it will be beneficial to others in my circle as well losing out on that would have some effect more importantly aps 2 3 4 and 5 who may have held back on hitting some games ap 1 plays now have retalitory incentive to rack up 1 game of choice to prevent them from being able to continue to profit a mutli ap community at least in some sense governs itself as if someone goes way out of line in one way or another the rest of the community will push back see also the fluffy couple and j in the past sometimes this means sharing resources whether it be a limited pool of jackpots multiple aps both have a skillset for or limited inventory in my opinion the golden rule has always been half the shipment rounded down with exception when it comes close to time for the next order to be placed for example if a store got four wiius and had one remaining from the past order totaling five i would get two leaving three the next order was two weeks away which means one thursday in if there are still three then one more should be on the table so that there still not three in their hands when the order goes in which might make them only get two or even zero managing d b inventory means leaving them enough for other guests but also not leaving them enough that they miss out on an order anything that has sat in stock for two weeks is entirely fair game as that a whole shipment cycle volake has posted he maxed out at two consoles per location they ship in cases of five this is entirely within the golden rule and there should be no qualms with it my store is temporarily limiting to one per person not per day until they see where their stock is after the first week this is entirely understandable on a short term basis this is a discussion that will need to come up every time a major non special order prize comes out this is part of why this community exists aps in the same store area should be aware of one another do their best not to stop on one another toes and also do their best not to blatantly piss off d b as well this may mean sacrificing some ability to cash out slightly here and there that will pay off much greater dividends later on down the line if you let yourself get up ticket wise to where you can afford to get 20 30 switches right now and are now struggling to be able to liquidate you are fucking doing it wrong while carrying two or three million tickets is a badge of honor it can also be a liability should the value of a ticket drop or you end up in a situation where your earn is a much faster rate than your redemption as a side note i wish i would even gotten to see an nes classic as a prize they never showed up here ,1,DaveAndBusters
MewtwoStruckBack,thanks for giving me wood on the drive home with this pic ,2,DaveAndBusters
MewtwoStruckBack,if you remember from ages ago someone tried to high five me after he walked up only to play when the e came out and managed to successfully snipe me i not only left him hanging but sniped his 500s for about two thirds of a rack before he gave up if you put in effort right along with me to dislodge the e and you get it more power to you you deserve it if you get it if i put 200 swipes in to churn through enough letters for the e to come out and you come up right then and sink it in two swipes you can suck a fat one big difference in intent there ,2,DaveAndBusters

MewtwoStruckBack,dude no you do not ap other apers in order for someone else to play on your behalf you need to offer enough that the person makes more per hour playing for you than they would on their own chips for example i took down 100 000 tickets last wednesday on about 145 worth of chips in 5 hours that 400 worth of tickets d b is overpricing the switch asking 400 worth of tickets for a 300 console but the ebay on it is over 400 so oh well so a 255 net over 5 hours that roughly 50 an hour you would need to be offering more than 50 hour and the chips to play the games in order for it to be worth it for the person playing on your behalf ,-2,NintendoSwitch

MewtwoStruckBack,the guide is a bit outdated and i need to find a place to host it somewhere other than dropbox you are not new to reddit but you are to the sub please read the sticky post for newcomers ,4,DaveAndBusters
MewtwoStruckBack,most stores i have heard of are doing one per customermper shipment per store at least on the first shipment so you have a better shot now than in the past on wiius with the exclusion of the final shipment i believe most people held to only getting half the shipment at maximum i did hear about one or two people who got an entire shipment at other stores i guess that was to be expected on the last one also of note now that they are 5 per case you actually have a slightly better shot wiiu were 2 to a case and average shipments were 4 total ,3,DaveAndBusters
MewtwoStruckBack,i have noticed that they put more balls in it with the guard now it is a bit awkward but i have still been able to max the score with the current setup and yes that the proper play on tt as well like how you might still reach down to scoop up balls in down the clown even if you have one or two in hand already while a row is moving back up ,2,DaveAndBusters
MewtwoStruckBack,seconding awkward comment in order to survive in this era you need multiple games a quick review of the nerf history i used to survive solely off of stop the clock at 1 000 and match em up when it was at 250 and no auto lose stop the clock went from 500 jackpot to 400 to 100 to 1 000 to 500 to 250 and then the machine was removed entirely match em up went from 250 to 100 to 50 back to 100 but with auto lose chip away was taken out and that was a valuable snipe at this point there was a period of time that going into d b outside of promos was a very poor venture i was a one trick pony during the speed demon era and learned spin n win after that got fucked spin was only decent at best tippin had me as a one trick pony for a while that lasted seven months we all relied on slam extreme for some time and in time that too got nerfed whack n win was a short solid game and that got changed as well even if you only have other games that give you a couple or few thousand each you cannot just live off one game if this last year has taught us anything it that even games we thought were entirely safe are being changed the more avenues you have to come out ahead the less it will hurt you when not if one or more of them gets hit with the nerf bat tl dr learn more shit,9,DaveAndBusters
MewtwoStruckBack,beating a game by the absolute minimum possible and leaving the maximum possible for the next play or the next player all the bags in the trough in tt all the balls in the trough in clown or super shot or 2md should be part of ap exceptions being if you know overscoring wo not trigger a penalty like on crossy sometimes if it seen enough play or the next person up is a known dick and goes against aps as a whole beating gridiron consistently is not that hard you should know how long it takes for you to make a single jump to the tenth of a second and be able to use that to factor in when to make your jump i would argue there are others that are able to score a better time than me i stop on 2 0 i have heard of people going into 2 5 3 0 thing is i think deliberately not overpowering games is the better play just like clown not getting pushed over 768 as to avoid invoking the glitch not taking gridiron over a certain mark so that it will be closer to ready upon your next visit is important unless you know gridirion will get more than 20 losing plays in between your visits you want to avoid taking it over 2 0 it might even be worth keeping track in a notebook or phone note app how many plays happened between visits so you know how far up to take it and still have a fair shot of it being at bf9 when you come back ,1,DaveAndBusters

MewtwoStruckBack,nintendo should realize they have to compete with free with internet speeds as fast as they are and emulators as far along as they are it takes a few clicks to get to full rom sets of entire console and handheld libraries if a single free game comes with an amiibo nintendo does not incur an additional cost yet might sell some extra amiibo if there is a huge incentive to have a full set it would spur demand for the remaining amiibo and we would be a bit closer to going back to where people were hyped up enough to wait outside a store before open for what they need to finish that set i have not once booted up amiibo tap and never will if i want to play an old game i will just download it unless nintendo offering is either free with a bundled purchase or in some other way superior like emulators cannot handle a certain game but nintendo vc can ,1,amiibo
MewtwoStruckBack,amiibo tap should have been so much better scan one amiibo get one free full game with zero artificial limits scan every single amiibo get every single downloadable retro game for free nes snes gb n64 all of it if you spent the thousand plus dollars on amiibo you should get permanent access to the entire library of games they come from it really should have been that simple ,1,amiibo

MewtwoStruckBack,the lowest i believe the game can be set timing wise is 20 seconds there not a lower set available it on 20 now which is 6x5 5x4 can you show me a video of the timer going down so quickly as to demand ten buckets of 5 ,3,DaveAndBusters
MewtwoStruckBack,ahh spin n win this used to be a favorite of mine as well under the old settings pre global i was roughly a 1 4 player my wednesdays consisted of going in throwing roughly 400 swipes in this and walking out with 100 000 until better games came along right after tippin bloks got nerfed but before whack n win came along there was a settings change that took the jackpot timing window from 6 milliseconds down to 4 you typically do not see people playing this any more for that reason ,4,DaveAndBusters
MewtwoStruckBack,apparently this is a common issue with star trek this is what happens when you value the turn in for a set insanely low make them difficult enough to get to be collector items to where the secondary market value of the set far exceeds the ticket value i have thrown this idea out there before and i will do it again if d b really wants to get their cards back from people they should have a promotional event where they give ticket value equal to the secondary market value of individual cards rares and complete sets with focus on rares fullsets yes this means there will be times you turn in a set of star trek cards for 2 000 tickets and then the same set ends up being worth 6 000 later on or that 5 000 foil set becomes 12 500 and that pike tribble borg is going to be enough to count for a full set on its own but it either that or not be able to keep up with demand by the players for cards in the machine ,3,DaveAndBusters
MewtwoStruckBack,it cool there are often things that drive a rush of people here sometimes some random in the gaming sub gets a bunch of tickets or takes a picture of someone with tickets sometimes someone wins on a stacker or claw game and it brings attention there were two articles done on our community that brought people in this is just another reason that will give us a traffic boost ,3,DaveAndBusters
MewtwoStruckBack,also i can verify nyintx has learned enough from me to begin ap elsewhere there a lot to work on but a couple of games he can smack a few jackpots on he and joe specifically are living proof that people that learn from me end up being at least partial if not full aps later on oh yeah you say you are an hour away where exactly are you you may have a closer store soon ,1,DaveAndBusters
MewtwoStruckBack,fucking lol i needed a good laugh this morning pittsburgh is quite bluntly the mecca of advantage play there was a point where i had almost twenty contacts in my phone that i would text with game settings changes info on when a key game was fixed or broken or half broken when prizes came in when prizes were able to be special ordered there are not as many as there were since the nerfs obviously but i will go over some of the past and present the present myself obviously the jack of all trades master of none well maybe master of kung fu panda everything else there is at least one person in the us better than me i am able to put in significant ap short or long term on fourteen different games at our store if you go in and see the game right by the door on the left when you walk in display 99999 to win i have been there u jjgeneral1 big joe and also a fellow moderator here he met me down there once threw a couple million dollar margs my way nyintx was not lying about that part p and i showed him slam extreme before it got cost nerfed we both did pretty well on it and he had a good chunk of time where his returns exceeded mine capable of winning on full tilt and crazy curves where no one else at this store explores those games in any depth matt3756 not on reddit much if at all but the famous youtuber he not so much a full on ap but is able to do some it does not matter so much since he got the channel which is a far better gig than the ap u bubble berry he is our store god of floppy bird i am not ashamed to say everything i know about doing well at that game i learned from him my highest score is in the low 600s his is about 893 with the hard mode that got rolled out and used to be in the 2 000 range before the nerf the existence of both him and myself mean it will be rare to find the score to win on this game under 300 400 the past there was a kid and his dad who lived in ohio who were fellow skill players of slam extreme pre nerf have not seen them since then james a nice indian guy who also did slam but nothing else was only a part time ap because he was involved in a baseball league that often overlapped trashbag not using his real name since he used to stalk this forum pretty hard and even made a website trying to bash me and d b in the past but the nickname was because he used to take all of his tickets and throw them in a trashbag and then turn them in all at once rather than a bit at a time key game was tippin bloks and both him and i learned from each other he did not take it well when the nerf hit the fluffy couple boyfriend girlfriend would come in at open specifically to duo down the clown and kung fu panda worked out an agreement with them to let me get some of the clown in before they did since i soloed and they did not they generally rubbed everyone the wrong way and were a good example of bad faith ap which is a shame because they knew what they were doing on slam and the girl of the couple was a legitimate 800 point player on 2 minute drill got busted for unplugging games to induce resets on camera and the guy was given the banhammer girl still allowed in but have not seen her since actually i saw her exactly once right after the ban asked me why i ran clown up above the prior agreement i told her well i understand your partner wo not be coming in any longer so that agreement null and void she left and i got an angry call about 15 minutes later and laughed my ass off after j j i am marking you as the past even though i fucking saw you yesterday you were banned 12 years ago for a myriad of offenses even though i know you deny them all i have heard both sides and i tend to believe d b whether it was finding receipts off the ground and identity thefting peoples cards jacking cards that were left on the side of machines by the forgetful getting bricks of tickets that never went through games twice having employees feed you bricks of 10 10 coupons that you would sell outside the front door for 5 each and then use that money yourself i do not know how much of that true but it was enough for them to give you the banhammer i know you think it okay to come back since it been 12 years and you think no one that was there at the time still works with the company guess what someone still does guess what else it was me and my family that were the catalyst for calling corporate to have you looked into which led to your banhammer jackass you told me that you are trying to get good at crossy and floppy i am going to make an extra effort to jack up crossy over your skillset and floppy will never be ready for you because bubble berry will take care of that you are being watched and the first time you do something stupid you are back out the door the agm already seen you and is aware of your presence aaaaaanyway enough of the bad apples of the past they are lessons on exactly what not to do to stick around d b welcomes its good faith aps even if they have to nerf some payouts to meet their payout goals at times if you want to work something out with me to tag along we need to coordinate schedules this can either be done on a wednesday or not we do not need wednesday to ap hit me in private message and we can figure it out i would be more than happy to help you win on your card in exchange for either a cut or dinner drinks or you do not have to buy anything if you just want to tag along if you want to watch me go through my average day if it not wednesday you will probably see me do 20 000ish tickets 25 000 if i push it and do a couple things i do not usually do on wednesday if you see me on wednesday and stick around you would see somewhere between 50 000 and 100 000 tickets that day i would love to take you through a day in the life

MewtwoStruckBack,had two great consecutive days tuesday crossy at 106 floppy at 80 clown ready tailgate at minimum gridirion at a big fat 9 panda ready four times tippin ready super shot at 500 everything told i had about 37 40k but am unsure of what my spend was today crossy at 140 floppy at 402 but i stole one game off of it tailgate was at 77 000ish ran up through 125k panda at 34 and later at 35 with 1 2 left tippin twice gridirion was on a bf9 when i walked in played it up to about 2 0x after doing my rounds and some zombie it was back on another bf9 totaled about 20 jackpots out of gridiron alone clown was ready for 9 of its usual 10 jackpots but there were bonus jackpots because the 30 bar got stuck that netted an extra 1 500 above normal oh yeah zombie man that shit was on another level managed the e twice with one other player the first time and two other players the second time about 3 000 each time the 500s were flowing like water the second 3 000 was enough to put me over the 100 000 benchmark and that when i bowed out exact numbers were 102 624 on 1 446 4 in 5 hours in current conditions i am damn proud of those numbers going to be in tomorrow to grab a switch ,4,DaveAndBusters

MewtwoStruckBack,i love ddr myself one of my life goals is to own a fully functional extreme cabinet but that bias is not enough for me to think d b is making anywhere near what they are hoping to make for a non redemption game your average arcade probably wants one credit to last about a minute and a half before the player needs to put in more money i do not remember exactly where i heard this statistic but it has stuck with me for a long time if anyone has something to add showing average time per play in arcade games i would not mind being proven wrong your average shooter probably holds to this maybe a couple minutes racing game courses tend to run about that long rhythm each song is a minute and a half to two minutes and players get three of them they are putting out literally triple the gameplay of an average game for the same cost to player this is why pinball disappeared from d b and most likely wo not make a return on top of the mechanical issues of those machines they just do not take the money in to justify the cost now factor in the people who would be dedicated to a non redemption game are probably also smart enough to do the 1 swipe per minute thing from power hour cards or load up on those promotional two hour cards one of those covers an entire group play for a night potentially and even if there a low 10 credit maximum the machine can hold someone else in the group can go credit up something else when the ddr piu machine is maxed there a reason 80 of d b revenue in the midway comes from redemption and a lot of it is how quick a game plays out ,5,DaveAndBusters

MewtwoStruckBack,sometimes your total take is more important than your ratio sometimes your per hour is more important than your ratio think about it this way you go in on wednesday as a jack of all trades ring up your 5k on clown 5k on tailgate 5k on gridiron 5k on 2 minute drill 1k on tippin 2k on panda 500 on super shot and 1 500 between quik drop and speed demon using these as examples as there are all reasonable things i could see being done chip cost going by the old numbers here of 34 34 34 56 2 1 10 1 6 3 4 we will say 8 for five attempts on demon 183 1 hell we will even throw in some fails in there as no one perfect might fuck up a couple times on gridiron might whiff on the 700 point game on down the clown round it up to 200 chips spent 20 and 25 000 tickets earned 100 ratio of 5 1 and you are ahead 80 let add zombie into the mix again old numbers for simplicity sake 3 4 a roll and we will say you get two 500s for every five plays so you put in work hammer out 50 000 tickets knocking 100 500s over the edge so you spent 250 plays to do so 850 more chips 85 spent but another 200 in value another 115 in profit minus expenses your ratio is now 1 050 chips 105 for 75 000 tickets 300 your ratio is now slightly under 3 1 but you are up 195 instead of 80 and zombie is a very quick game particularly if you have good tech staff that willing to refill the thing a couple times in a night the player who played zombie fared better than the player who did not despite the first player getting a way better percentage so do not let it scare you off to lay out slightly less profitable play so long as it still profitable ,2,DaveAndBusters
MewtwoStruckBack,some prices did go down it would be nice if it would get to 5 0 flat for 2md as then it would be a straight up 2 1 minus expenses for the gold standard of chip prices vs the jackpot 50 cents per play 1 for a win of 250 tickets crossy is a snipe game so that extra 0 4 should not affect things horribly given you should only be going into it when you have a good idea you are capable of winning the jackpot zombie the bitch in all of this because that going to add up we are now at 3 6 on wednesday as opposed to 3 4 and it not unheard of to put several hundred chips into zombie in one day ,1,DaveAndBusters

MewtwoStruckBack,think i am a bit late here but i managed to get 102 copies of the legend of zelda 4 game collector disc for free from nintendo that marked the end of nintendo running good promos in favor of their nintendo coin bullshit they are doing now years ago nintendo offered a promotion where they gave away the legend of zelda collector edition disc for the gamecube in three different ways purchasing a nintendo power subscription would get that as the free gift this in and of itself was ev as the subscription was 20 and the game was ebaying for 30 35 at the time this is probably why the rest of this went unnoticed for so long new gamecube systems being sold in the store that holiday season included the collector edition disc as a pack in nintendo was marketing four new games at the time 1080 snowboarding mario kart double dash mario party 5 and mario luigi superstar saga if you purchased any two of these took the included pins included with the games and registered those numbers on your my nintendo account along with your gamecube serial number this would qualify you to have a free copy of the collector edition mailed to you number 3 was exploitable in many many ways one person could have an unlimited number of mynintendo accounts even if the addresses matched and the last names so long as the first names were different guessing this is because two siblings in the same household roommates etc may want to have separate accounts you were able to use the same gamecube serial on a vast number of mynintendo accounts when this stopped working i found that the gamecube serial pattern was the exact same pattern that is used for delivery confirmation numbers at the post office seriously if you have an old gamecube take the number and add 1 6 7 or 17 to the number and one of those four results will conjure up another valid gc serial game rental places as well as some game stores like gamestop would just take the discs out of the display boxes and keep them behind the counter but would leave all other information in with the displays including the pins yes i realize this resulted in people buying a game from gamestop and being told their pin was already used if they went to register odds are a call to nintendo explaining the situation would get them a new pin for some readson adding 1 letter or number turning a into b or 4 into 5 for example to a valid pin conjured up one more valid pin exceptions being j turned into 2 and z turned into 9 for some odd reason i never questioned it trial and error just proved those to be the two exceptions so that holiday season i made a mass run to all the game stores rental places in the area copied down all the pins and a few gc serials from best buy for good measure and got to work registering all this at one point i even had the gall to call up nintendo because they sent me one less game than i had coming to me the support person saw that i had all these accounts i told them which games had come in and which one did not and no questions asked was sent a copy of the game to cover the one that did not arrive i ended up getting 102 copies of the game and was ebaying them at a pretty penny oddly enough i found out that nintendo had left my scam unchecked but put the screws to people who were mass subscribing people and listing zelda game plus free nintendo power subscription for 34 99 shipping on ebay so someone who had been cut off and still had to supply customers ended up buying most of my remaining copies to fulfill orders nintendo would no longer let them process oddly enough by doing all these registrations i fond out six months after the fact that i had won a contest for a free gba game that paid out one free game per every couple hundred people that registered their system i guess nintendo figured hey he got all these games why not one more tl dr found several exploits in a free video game promotion conned nintendo into mailing me 102 copies of the game at no charge made 3 000 ,2,AskReddit

MewtwoStruckBack,it has a lock in feature as to once tickets have started paying but it would be difficult for each individual game to program a lock out other cards until the credit s on the game have currently been done embed would have to have a way of realizing when the game credits go to 0 and then not 0 and then back to 0 and the programming would have to be done differently for every game this is a lot to ask for a system that is basically a glorified ticket interceptor intercepting the electronic pulses that would normally push out a ticket and feeding them to your card in increments of 2 instead for physical cards i recommend leaving your card in until the first tickets begin to pay to avoid this issue i do not think i ever had a single instance where someone tried to swipe in before my tickets started paying does this really happen all that often in other stores ,1,DaveAndBusters

MewtwoStruckBack,i had the exact same problem actually operative word had the scenario i am able to run through 750 duo was able to run through 850 i start coming in and seeing many early afternoons i come in the jackpot is at 850 ish i wonder if there a malfunction eventually find out about duo i start coming right at 11 30 hop on one machine play solo duo comes and hops on other machine racks it up to its max then when i am done on mine ends up taking mine i confront them on this i show up every single morning 11 30 just to thwart them until they were willing to play ball we eventually reach an agreement that i will run through 650 4 jackpots each side and they run 700 through 850 4 jackpots each side i am still salty that i am having to give up part of my morning and that the jackpot is not going to come down over a busy day because they are pushing it up past 768 more salty because they are duoing panda which actually is not ok clown it technically legal and i get it still sucks though duo manages to piss off bulk of employees over a long period of time employees put camera on power plug of dtc and find one of them was going behind the machine to reset it banhammer comes down gg shame of it is that one of the two is still allowed in but i have not seen her she could legit play 2md up to 800 on her own and i did not begrudge her that one bit hell i would tell her to play that first because she could only get up to 800 and i could 999 it so she could manage something for herself as far as your scenario do they still come around do they break any rules on other games where it legit breaking the rules rather than dtc i can think of another idea if you can pull it off long term that might make them play ball if they are not doing anything banworthy do you have any other friends or known aps that can throw a 700 if so you set it up so you and that other ap get in at open you rack up one side the other ap racks up the other and continue this until they get that the duoing is not going to be welcomed if they are willing to do a fair split of the available jackpots that different though this still does not solve the issue that them putting the score over 768 is going to mean it will never come down below that throughout the day ,3,DaveAndBusters
MewtwoStruckBack,it tracks above 1 000 we have evidence of this already from the glitch 768 glitch trigger 255 1 023 it will read 999 but eventually after 24 plays come down from 999 i was beaten to the punch i love this sub sometimes ,1,DaveAndBusters
MewtwoStruckBack,looks like the few uploads they have are all pretty old and 3 out of 4 of them are the same thing basically if you were to go to the same d b as these two and play solo you would just want to get there first easy enough to pop the 500 through 700 on each side you and everyone else would still lose out on the tickdown because of the 768 glitch after these two played but that would be true of anyone who hit a jackpot with it 718 or above to win and there are poeple who are capable of soloing above that number i have to wonder how many if any d bs have a pair that consistently and currently goes in early with the main focus being duoing clown ,3,DaveAndBusters
MewtwoStruckBack,thank you it is a delicate balance just like the rest of ap and i do realize that i get a far higher share than the other aps at pit but not out of malice i just play games that the other aps do not a very candid open look at pit ap not revealing anything anyone cannot already cover from youtube weekly wednesday threads or otherwise common knowledge about playable games we are pulling from the store main aps the ones that you can expect to see on a weekly basis or more myself jjgeneral1 bubble berry and matt3756 and starting with games that do have crossover quik drop all four of us are able to snipe it and with some struggle able to hit a 6 bucket if the jackpot clicks into the first range the range where it only 2 bucket any one of us could hit it this is not as huge of a deal because it a single jackpot that might ready itself a couple times a day floppy tickets bubble berry is the god of this game but i am a secondary he can easily go into the 600 range with effort i can get in the 400 500 but my average consistent game is in the 200s we do communicate as to who will be in and when and have split jackpots between this and other games more below crossy road jjgeneral is capable of a 200 game bubble berry is close to that i am the dickhole running it up to 200 on non wednesdays and 300 on wednesdays this is without question the single biggest game where jjgeneral gets fucked over because i have been there before him and the point i feel most bad about gridiron blitz this game is only within the skillset of bubble berry and myself he showed me floppy i showed him this in turn we are both capable of jackpot management on it to hit it repeatedly and it one of only two games paying out above target at pit i can rack it up to 2 0 easily bubble berry at about a 1 6 1 8 but can get above that if trying for the above games if both bubble berry and myself show up early think sunday mornings and crossy floppy and gridiron are all in fully ready states generally he takes floppy as he can maximize its value if in the 100s at least 10 000 jp tickets and i take crossy and gridiron about 3 500 4 000 for crossy if only pushing it up to 200 from low 100s and hopefully 5 000 from gridiron that as equitable a split as we can make happen usually kung fu panda this game is within the skillset of bubble berry jjgeneral and myself it a readily available snipe and on a long day wednesday or a busy weekend night it makes sense if more than one of us is there to alternate who wins it best question is who hit it last tippin within the skillset of bubble berry and myself similar logic speed demon within the skillset of jjgeneral and myself now for other games down the clown there is zero crossover i am the only one going to pit that solos it let alone solos to 700 you might see a duo here and there i am more concerned with the 512 glitch than any other aps or even duos at times as even the duos are not getting 700s tailgate toss again zero crossover whatsoever the highest i ever see it post guard tilt sensor before i get there is 68 000 or so 125 000 is within my skillset super shot zero crossover it only a single snipe but 500 500 2 minute drill a wednesday only viable ap game but again zero crossover i am the only consistent ap at pit doing this game and i consider it a 5 000 or close to it deal or no deal jjgeneral only not hugely profitable but something he can do that is within his abilities and no one else full tilt jjgeneral mostly and possibly matt3756 easy snipe for him on the weekends in particular for non wednesdays which is often the time that jjg and bb are in my take is going to be highest solely because of the two big no crossover games that 11 500 tickets which even if i were to leave every other single game alone would have me with the high take barring floppy being at some ridiculously low number like 80 100 for wednesdays factor in 2md as a game only in my skillset and you now have that up to 16 500 from just those three games though honestly for the games where there is crossover particularly snipe games like qd panda tippin and even gridiron those games re ready so quickly that bubble can go in early morning i can go in 5 to 6 pm and things may already be in ready state again there have been days he hit panda through 34 and i have caught it 33 a few hours later he hit tippin and so did i he took five jackpots on gridiron and i followed up with ten of my own for the aps we have their particular areas of expertise we have what i would call a managable split of machines prizes can be a bitch sometimes though hence the need for travel or middleman pickups to churn through tickets ,1,DaveAndBusters

MewtwoStruckBack,there your answer if you beat the score by 14 on crossy or 20 on floppy or less it will only go up by those minimums if you beat the score to win by more than 14 on crossy or more than 20 on floppy it will do a quick calculation of the average of the last x number of games i do not know what x is if that average is far above the average at last calculation it will increase the score to win by more than the standard 14 or 20 but never above what you scored personal example i played floppy when it was about 280 to win and scored close to 500 no overscore penalty it went up 20 i figured that meant it was safe to play my ass off scored over 500 and it went up close to 100 instead of 20 long story short if there has been a lot of losing play specifically very bad losing play it should be safe to overscore a bit and not get penalized if the machine has not been played much that day you want to intentionally tank for what it worth the day i got a 536 on crossy 0 7 step it was on 251 to win and it only went up its standard 14 ,1,DaveAndBusters

MewtwoStruckBack,this is exactly like down the clown let say you jackpot on 96 000 which makes it to go to 101 000 it will read as 99999 the next 10 losing plays take it down to 100 000 still reads 99 999 the next loss takes it to 99 900 which it will show on the display it will be 61 000 when they turn it on tomorrow morning ,2,DaveAndBusters
MewtwoStruckBack,this is correct as of this week it roughly 1 ticket per 1 000 i have seen it be ever so slightly less 123 000 ticket jp fail 120 tickets i think from what i have told tt has not been in excess of target and that with me destroying it almost as bad as downtheclownguy is killing his i hope that the buff plus my play does not put it over now that i can throw 125 000 with some level of consistency ,1,DaveAndBusters

MewtwoStruckBack,it funny how reddit works karma is a currency that you gain by posting witty onr liners and cute cat photos that you spend when you want to speak your real opinion on something i actually agree with you if you put the time in to have multiple preorders knowing someone will pay above msrp more power to you i enjoyed the spoils of this during the wiiu era me and a number of other people who were all winning wiius as arcade prizes generally agreed to keep our price the same as to not cannibalize one another sales and start with undercutting if you ever bought a wiiu on ebay for 287 50 exactly it was part of my crew if you ever looked at the buy it now listings and saw a whole string of them at that price that was why i have heard a rumor the arcade is going to heavily overprice the switch in tickets to try and stymie this so not only am i wishing you success but i and the rest of my group need nintendo to short supply the switch for a number of months so the secondary market value is about 100 over msrp so it will be worth flipping the more you end up making and for a longer period of time the longer we will survive before having to move on to the next flip that being said your posts of this nature will be far better received over in r flipping ,1,NintendoSwitch

MewtwoStruckBack,instead of taxes being paid on behalf of the robot every time a job is lost to automation the salary of the lost employee and the value of the benefits that employee would have received should be required to be split amongst remaining rank and file employees eg if there are 10 employees making 10 hour and each gets 1 week vacation and a 400 contribution towards their health care and 5 of those jobs are replaced by robots the remaining 5 employees should be by law upped to double the pay vacation time and other contributions basically make it so that automation can happen but it wo not be allowed to save the employer any money on employee costs ,1,technology

MewtwoStruckBack,okay i am bored at work and have nothing better to do so i will do a tl dr here that covers everything everyone said so far and replies to it all assuming there are still 500s and they are stocked regularly the mega jackpot is not as huge of a deal for a regular player assuming an ap average of 5 swipes per two 500s it will take 60 or so swipes to clear a full rack of 500s maybe a bit more in that time span only a few letters will come out probably 3 so if there are 3 full sets of other letters and one e it could take as many as 5 full racks of 500s minus any play from others that is as many as 60 000 tickets won in between mega bonuses the e represents only a 5 boost to a dedicated skilled zombie player carpboy they were concerned with the numbers on zombie so it not as clear cut in order for them to hit their target on wednesday of only paying out 40 assuming a value of 50 cents per play they need to take in 10 swipes per 500 that gets put out 2 5 of those come from the ap so they need the other 7 5 coming from people that walk up and play and are not accurate or more likely do not even know to target 500s exclusively if they are not getting that then i understand then sweating the money on the additional 3 4k tappintap i have suggested exactly this 1 3 the jackpot 3x as many es though this all depends on exactly what d b is trying to accomplish are they trying to cut drama between players by making the jackpot less appealing to snipe but their payout numbers are on target if so then more es lower jp is the way to go are they trying to watch their payouy percentage as it running too high for their liking make it so a letter does not dispense until 50 plays instead of 25 are d b numbers on point but they feel they need to go shark fishing that is to say deliberately reduce what aps without any other goal i do not see this as possible while leaving a game anyone else will play for more than a couple swipes if they nerf the e we still take 500s if they make 500s limited then people only go over to play it once a 500 has dispensed and they have the same issue that they do in the first place with such heavy focus on the e the tough position they are in is running a game with an alluring jackpot that wo not instantly be taken by a few people in the know and that is damn near impossible ,3,DaveAndBusters

MewtwoStruckBack,i saw a couple people playing the walking dead i am not the best one to ask because i am not big on simulators and never really followed the series but i might take one of my 2 hour cards i stashed and run through the whole game at some point as far as zombie my store was the first to get it so i have had more experience with it than most the profits to be had from it are seriously nowhere near as good as one would think but that does not mean they are horrible either it seroiusly my last resort game on wednesday the thing i only touch after all other options have been tapped it kinda fitting as it a game with a theme of the undead because it what i take on after i have killed everything else obviously the people here are only going to be focusing on clearing the 500 ticket pucks and clearing the last of the pucks to complete the zombie mega bonus which if the machine is set up correctly will always be the e puck unless you are in some place that has an artificial maximum on the jackpot due to weird state gaming laws or something it starts at 2 000 tickets plus 2 per play and i would say you will regularly get it at about 3 500 tickets or so if it shows up outside of the progressive in order to make what i would consider decent progress ticket to chip wise including expenses of flipping items you would have to knock over two 500 pucks for every 5 swipes if you are working on a prize you are going to keep for yourself you can raise that to 2 out of 6 or every third puck the problem becomes when you get a 500 puck stuck behind other pucks and you have to spend multiple tries trying to dislodge it from the cluster let alone being able to sink it zombie has in a short period of time caused a shitload of drama between aps and other aps between aps and randoms that at least know the basics of how to play between regular players and people that only ever play when the e is on the board and bum rush the machine you will have some people that will sit and wait for other people to knock 500s closer to the edge and then only play when someone else has done all the dirty work and knock the 500 off and if two people both know what they are doing and cannot come to an agreement to alternate 500s or each work on their own 500 puck then yeah gets ugly real fast every time i play zombie i do profit but every time i play it my overall profit margin for the day goes down significantly i have not been all that quiet about info on zombie because i see very little to protect but for those that have no other options cannot do the throwing games cannot do the mobile phone arcade conversion games etc then yeah i understand them being wary about too many people playing it i just do not see how anyone can be pushing the profit margins up that high where d b would even be worried given they count chips at roughly 15 cents each 500 pucks at 2 so even on wednesday it 50 cents in and on average more than two plays per 2 puck dropped and with the others that are not ap playing the percentage they actually pay out sinks fast ,4,DaveAndBusters

MewtwoStruckBack,why would a player spend hundreds of dollars on airfare accommodation etc to go to a tournament where they know they have literally 0 chance of winning or at least placing in the money to improve there are more cost effective ways to do that i would much rather pay someone who is a pro for specialized training and do that until i felt i was ready to take down a tournament without anyone knowing about me beforehand it would have to amount to less money that way to have fun then it a hobby more than something you depend on and that person calling themself a competitive player is lying to themself if they are not making money i wish smash were more like poker there absolutely skill pros win way more often than randoms but there are still suckouts and you can have someone who no one ever heard of smash a tournament for seven figures with the decent amount of skill they do have and a little luck going their way ,1,gaming

MewtwoStruckBack,i am not arguing it better for competitive gaming i am arguing it against what the people behind smash intended for smash to be if nintendo were to run its own tournament series supporting it with significant prize pools but demanding items stages with hazards equipment customs etc be how it played then the smash community should stfu about it because it their company their game their ruleset but they wo not and we both know it i am also not saying i want skill to be meaningless or that people should be able to win with zero effort i am saying i want to shrink the skill gap a bit the smash community has the biggest boner in the world for anything they can do to put a bigger and bigger gap between the top names in smash and everyone else whereas they see that as a positive and of course they would they are the ones that will be taking tournament wins i would like to see more than five or six people out of the hundreds or thousands that attend an event have a reasonable expectation of placing or doing well if there a skill scale from 0 100 where 100 is armada m2k hbox etc and 0 is someone picking up the game for the first time i am not in any way saying 0s should have any chance of taking a game off of a 100 but a 90 95 should an 80 player should have some decent chance against an 85 90 if it takes crafting a game with smash inherent randomness when it not being disabled or ruleset less stocks lower time limit getting rid of best of 5s in top sets actually playing out sudden death rather than going by percentage as a tiebreaker to allow for that to happen well of course r smashbros wo not do that but i would sure as hell love if nintendo did ,-2,gaming

MewtwoStruckBack,that kinda fucked up i view paypal the same way i view ebay as a seller i am paying you for a service to connect me with an individual buyer i am paying for this service once per buyer and should not need to pay it every single time i interact with them at least in some circumstances if i sell to someone on ebay and that person wants more items from me there is no reason i should have to eat 4 6 or 9 to ebay to deal with that same person again we have already made contact i constantly see business cards included with purchases i make on ebay or elsewhere where the seller links to their online store and offers a discount to do so presumably to avoid future ebay paypal fees i figure this is standard practice if i sell to someone through other channels besides ebay and we use paypal to complete a transaction and then in future situations find ourselves to be in the same physical location there no reason i should not be able to take cash in hand from them or suggest to them hey we are gonna be at the same place next week if you have got cash i can knock off a couple dollars it really sounds like paypal is trying to pull the same shit that ebay did a while ago to bar sellers from trying to break free from the fees on repeat business ebay started scanning messages for key words like invoice that suggest a buyer and seller would work together to complete an outside of ebay sale is paypal going to start looking for correspondence in seller notes and such to the same effect if i am selling online and have concerns about whether or not the buyer is legitimate then yes i will eat your fee as that essentially my insurance that i wll not get screwed over but once that concern is gone the additional hoops that are jumped through to facilitate a transaction and the associated fees should go away with that buyer and that seller if you want to do something to keep people loyal to you how about lowering fees rather than raising them and trying to strong arm people out of moving away from you when paypal and ebay shared ownership it would have been really simple to say if you sell on ebay and get paid through paypal the ebay fee is the entire fee you pay the paypal fee will be waived but that never happened and people are looking for alternatives ,2,technology

MewtwoStruckBack,e ticket payout speed is mostly tied to the individual game what embed is actually doing is intercepting the pulses it would normally send to the ticket dispenser that would tell it hey spit out a ticket and instead sending that pulse to your card that why tickets count up in increments of 2 or 4 on most games because it working with those electronic pulses for a game that has a very fast ticket dispenser or even a double dispenser like kung fu panda it blasts through your 1 000 ticket jackpot in the matter of a few seconds if you start a new game immediately and finish round 1 as quickly as you can it will have paid out over 900 of your 1 000 by then likewise if you have a game with a very slow dispenser tippin bloks 2 minute drill the embed payout speed is slower that said d b has done some hacking of sorts to configure the game to allow for much faster pulses when doing to e tickets that it could normally not handle spitting physical tickets out examples of this should include quik drop if set up right if you win the jackpot it will have entirely credited that jackpot to your card before you could start another game speed demon a full 1 000 win should only take under a minute where it would take much longer with physical tickets and tippin bloks which used to have the slowest mech ever but is now reasonable some games still have ridiculously low payout speeds candy crush being the biggest offender right now ,4,DaveAndBusters
MewtwoStruckBack,actually i think i may have been in error and it was 250 one ball per swipe also full tilt suffered from the same thing tippin bloks did the only ones putting any serious amount of play into it are the ones winning slam extreme survived as long as it did because there were so many randoms putting so much money in and not coming away with much any game where the aps are the sole crowd enthusiastic about it are not going to be around for long ,2,DaveAndBusters
