a_window_,i have become very disillusioned with the way dating works right now in american society in general i have given up on it completely it just too much bullshit for me too much of other people expecting you to pretend to be someone you are not rather than being a mature adult who can handle people as they are i was briefly on tinder a couple of times but that went about as well as i expected because reasons the pattern was a bit shallow for me anyways i usually do not find myself completely attracted to someone i only find physically attractive and anyways sometimes i end up being physically attracted to someone i initially did not see that way other times i feel like i could have a very strong relationship with someone in a non sexual way but more than platonic i just do not identify with the lens tinder forces people to view each other through when i used less shallow dating apps i initially had sent messages for a while first to people i was interested in including non matches and then to only matches i seldom got a reply from anyone and when i did i got the sense that the other person really did not actually want to have a genuine conversation let alone meet in person i kept narrowing the scope of people i would go out of the way to take the time to message until i stopped messaging altogether and that lasted a couple weeks until i just quit online dating itself altogether because nothing was happening different aspects of dating in american society have some work to do before i would even consider trying again most of these aspects relate to our backwards gender bound social expectations it was a difficult lesson for me when i realized that some of the most seemingly progressive people on dating sites have these incredibly shallow expectations of people in fact my experience has indicated that the most seemingly progressive people on dating sites consistently have the most reactionary social expectations these expectations are inconsistent at best and regressive at worst there are just too many dynamics like these for me being fairly avoidant my tolerance for social bullshit is even lower than most someone would have to prove themselves to be unrealistically desirable and show an extreme incontrovertible amount of interest in me for me to even bother ,2,AvPD

a_window_,yeah i am actually living with two pups currently with my aunt and uncle but both of them avoid close contact with me through no fault of their own one of them was apparently abused by their previous owner and so we think she afraid of me because i might remind her of them she also generally afraid of anyone who are not my aunt and uncle the other is not afraid of anyone but unfortunately she does not like to be picked up and held close probably because of a bad experience when she was roaming the streets i am very happy that they are safe now but i definitely will be adopting a rescue pup of my own when i move out edit i just love looking at all the creatures on r aww it gives me a happy feeling ,1,AvPD

a_window_,damn dude we have come far ,1,politics
a_window_,okay i get that conviction rates are different which is a legitimate problem worth considering but the actual policy itself despite being incredibly flawed is not based on race or ethnicity it based on backwards notions of morality regarding recreational drugs and treating the more egregious drug issues as crimes instead of health issues or socioeconomic issues i get that actual cases in the us criminal justice system might produce outcomes based on racial prejudices of various people involved but to say that these outcomes are specifically enshrined within government policy in 2017 is kind of absurd correlation does not imply causation i get really frustrated when i see people suggest that these things are specifically designed with the intention to be discriminatory because that obviously not the case the sooner you admit that the sooner there can be a productive conversation about the issues that do exist which are usually the result of the individual racial prejudices of different parties involved ,1,worldnews
a_window_,hehehe what a good floof ,1,aww

a_window_,well if the horsehoe fits ,2,worldnews

a_window_,grow up ,23,worldnews
a_window_, to mean something more technical and specific right or to allow the insecure person to feel like they are the vanguard of society by playing semantics to condescend to the uninitiated ,2,worldnews
a_window_, it a valid distinction this is what you people do you conveniently redefine the terms from under people feet so that things do not mean what they really mean you people have to be on the vanguard of something because you are all insecure so now to refer to actual racism i have to say racial prejudice because your definition of racism now describes this magical esoteric property of the universe that serves no purpose other than the proliferation of white guilt which does nothing good power structure nope this is tiresome ,4,worldnews
a_window_,okay since you insist on conflating law with morality even though i specifically insisted that i am discussing laws not morals i will relent first and foremost nowhere did i suggest that facts and logic are exclusively necessary to discern morality i did suggest that they were necessary to discern the acceptability of laws if you are unable to agree to see the difference here you might as well just stop talking at me about this because you are not going to get anywhere with me second fine i will bite with the morality true morals are not relative they are universal this is an objective fact what is right or wrong for person a in a given situation is right or wrong for person b in that same situation to suggest otherwise is nonsense because it presupposes a moral system in which morality is a nondeterministic function where right and wrong actions are arbitrarily defined normative ethical relativism proposes that there exist no universal morals if you are an intelligent person this is self evidently nonsense but again this is to say nothing about law or morality relationship to it also this is not to say that people cannot have separate and differing individual understandings of morality and abide by what they view as distinct morals but when you discuss morality itself in the ether it is necessarily rigid and universal third i will not entertain the notion that the purpose of law is to enshrine morality i have my own view of what a government should do and you have yours so allow me to explain mine and you can determine for yourself whether or not you agree with it as i see it the purpose of law is to mitigate interests such that certain rights are guaranteed for all citizens and to protect these rights through any necessary means which do not violate other rights though the origins of the rights may be informed by some morals the content of the rights themselves should be enforced without the influence of morality otherwise you essentially have a system akin to theocracy in which arbitrary moral principles are the religion do not attempt to explain anything about government to me i probably know more about it than you do ,1,politics
a_window_,how is the woofer working for you ,1,aww
a_window_,i am not talking about morality i am talking about laws the fact that people write laws does not mean they are necessarily not objective the only laws that are not objective are those which are aided by anything other than facts and logic ,1,politics

a_window_,i am so sorry to hear this try to work on appreciating those outside of your family who care about you not everyone has that privilege i certainly do not but i can certainly relate to being alone all of the time i went for a movie tonight and wanted to go to the pub after for a beer or maybe get a bite to eat but i felt way too ashamed and self conscious about being alone in town on a saturday night to even deal with people looking at me sitting by myself so i went home straight away and did not have any meaningful experiences at least the movie was decent i had also earlier went to the soccer field where i used to play at my high school to try to find closure for some feelings i have struggled with for a while i found no such closure and left feeling worse i felt pathetic for being the type of person with no social life or romantic relationships who goes to his old high school and sits by himself on a saturday evening ,9,AvPD

a_window_,yep what is fascinating to me is that all members except matt seem to be present with carin perhaps standing in for him perhaps it a statement on how matt feels that he owes so much of his success and strength to carin and by extension a more general notion that we are nothing without our loved ones also she seems to be standing and looking back potentially to matt as you would outside the bedroom door of someone you love as they are sleeping sleep well beast ,1,TheNational
a_window_,yep still have my boxer poster ,2,TheNational
a_window_,i really appreciate your encouraging words as i said i cannot afford therapy right now maybe once i start my new job which will provide health insurance after a few months i might be able to try it but i really doubt it would help i am certainly open to it but my case really is not of the textbook sort where things like that work my issues whatever they are seem to be lodged deep in my core and if you unravel that you unravel everything else that might not be desirable for obvious reasons i am really high functioning all things considered your point with the anecdote is well argued there needs to be a motivator i do not know what that would be yet i am going to be honest though it was difficult for me to read about the dogs i like dogs to know that they were hurt like that is disgusting to me i know research is important but that just seems quite cruel i do not know i want dogs to be treated humanely and reading that was quite painful ,1,AvPD
a_window_,you are fine i really appreciate what you have to say go see a therapist psychologist if you are not already i cannot afford it and i really do not think it would do any good for me anyway believe me i have read a lot about this stuff and thought about it a lot my issues are not sit let it all out and maybe come to some kind of solution my whole way of being is fixed a certain way and it what is gotten me through my life so far it difficult to explain i would need some kind of medication i cannot afford you say you have not had a meaningful relationship since childhood what about relationships will make one meaningless to you i think just feeling like i cannot relate to someone in ways that matter there is not a science to it i have just never clicked with anyone you say you have not had any memorable or meaningful experiences why why not because people do not accept me for who i am enough to do anything meaningful with me every time i try to make a meaningful friendship the other person is not interested what constitutes a meaningful experience to you something that i will think about and smile and want to share with somebody something that makes me think wow i had such a good time then what do you like to do that kind of a loaded question i like to do all kinds of things but not all of them entail other people i feel like i would like to do a lot more kinds of social things if people would have included me at some point if you are referring to non social things i would say reading writing poetry listening to music making music etc a whole bunch of things all stereotypical introvert things is there anything that makes life worthwhile while you do it of course i never said my whole life is worthless at every moment but if you look at the whole picture it pretty dreadful anything someone says to me even remotely negative will make me cry i get easily discouraged unmotivated and feel like i am worthless i am very sorry about this i used to be more sensitive to negativity but most of the time now i have just learned to give it back if it any consolation i doubt your life is as pathetic as mine i literally seek validation in places like the comments of youtube videos but there are things to live for there are things i like doing i am not very good at guitar but i love it and i practice to get better so there are a few things i want it stay alive for that great to hear having a strong engagement with music can be really helpful especially if you take it as seriously as i do you feel that nothing is worth living for again this is not necessarily true in an all encompassing sense there a great moment in the dark knight rises in the underground prison when bane concedes this to bruce wayne i learned here that there can be no true despair without hope this is why i wish for death i continue to hope though i know it extremely unlikely that anything will change enough for me to enjoy the kinds of relationships others have i hope this helps you understand me better ,1,AvPD
a_window_,i think you understood perfectly you are right about emotion i really wish people were not capable of emotion because the world would be such a better place at least my life would be a ton easier it does bother me when i see people let their emotion rule over their reason partly because i have done such hard work to become more stoic and mature and have reaped great benefits from that your point about validation is well taken too i feel like i secretly crave validation even though nobody gives me any i will watch the video in a little while and let you know what i think edit i watched the video it spot on with how i feel ,2,AvPD
a_window_,thank you i think you are right it those people who would resort to animosity against those who do not understand the world the same way as they do who i am most concerned about there so much that wrong with america but i really do not believe in some of the more extreme views of some people and they would think nothing of killing fairly innocent people to prove a point and for their own gratification i guess i just really do not think we are at a point where violence is necessary ,3,AvPD
a_window_,thank you i really appreciate that ,2,AvPD
a_window_,simple compassion goes so far though ,2,AvPD
