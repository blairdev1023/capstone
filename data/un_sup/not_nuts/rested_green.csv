rested_green,tip for those who are interested in trying magnesium it available in capsules and tablets too however you want to take it though check the ingredients before you buy magnesium oxide you do not want magnesium oxide for supplement purposes it works best as a laxative in the best conditions you will only absorb a max of 40 magnesium citrate magnesium citrate form is highly bioavailable basically a measure of how much makes it into your system it dissolves well in water unlike mag oxide and absorption increases drastically in stomach acid this is the form i use magnesium chelate glycinate aspartate these three forms possess decent bioavailability like magnesium citrate they are more potent as actual supplements than mgo chelate especially is bioavailable they are often complexed together or with other forms you will find a lot of dosages around 200mg and 400mg which is 100 of your drv as long as you are getting mag citrate or another bioavailable form you will be fine with 50 150mg doses it does not have to be taken daily you can take it every few days or when you feel like you need or might need it most supplements you will find will be magnesium oxide which like i said is next to useless you really do not want it the bioavailable forms are harder to find and they are usually more expensive but they are very much worth it bonus pubmed page on the topic with a little cursory reading if you are interested https www ncbi nlm nih gov pubmed 2407766 i hope this has helped good luck ,1,LearnUselessTalents

rested_green, raids give runite which is very handy they also give a fair amount of high level and other useful stable runes the other big advantage to them is that they give lots of power often higher than the wilds zone you are on sometimes it can be worth it to keep resetting right before you hit the boss on a raid as this can bet you a lot of power and useful runes just a tip each raid will have a couple runes that will spawn so say one raid may give one or two different attack spells and one or two different utility runes periodically while you are there dungeons give charms which give lots of various handy background effects like increased damage for an element increased xp faster reclaims lower research prices etc you can increase difficulty of dungeons by investing runite in them which can make them significantly harder but give you lots more charms they are both worth doing and in my opinion are very important parts of active play ,2,idlemageattack
