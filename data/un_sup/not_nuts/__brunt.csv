__brunt,this is getting a little pedantic but the dull knife does cause the tears because it breaks more of the onions cell walls down and releases more gas from the onion which causes the tears a sharp knife breaks down the cells less and realeases less gas which causes less tears ,1,LifeProTips
__brunt,nope still true no one was discussing the cause of the tears that part is known we were discussing the best way to chop an onion and release as little gas as possible which is destroying as few of the onions cell walls as possible when you are cutting it which is using a sharp knife ,1,LifeProTips
__brunt,an argument can be made about any team in any sport being the worst fans in the league and then amplify that by 1000 if they are fans of a successful franchise of course every team will have great level headed fans too ,3,nba
__brunt,i was not insinuating you did not keep your knives sharp or that you do not know what you are talking about i just meant from my personal and professional account over the last 16 years or so in my life it held true i have had countless conversations with tons of people about the same thing and for me and them it just a practical trueism and one that i really am surprised to hear some pushback in this thread about if people want to beleive otherwise that not a problem at all i was merely saying i will take my real life experiences along with pretty much everyone i have knowns over strangers on the internet that not saying anyone should be listening to me either if they feel differently i am just saying i will stick with what i have put to use in real life if people have different opinions that have proven true to themselves so be it ,1,LifeProTips
__brunt,in the same vein some people might be more sensitive to onions as well i really cannot say but i will say after i have worked my way up i cannot rememberer last time that myself or any of my coworkers have shown symptoms of cutting an onion so it not just me it the countless people i have been worked with over the years as well ventilation in kitchens wild also probably be a factor but i am also referencing home cooking i dunno people in this thread really want to convince me they have a nice knife that they promise is sharp but i am only going off myself and my peers in the industry and it something that been proven to myself and everyone i have worked with as true sharp knives keep your eyes dry ,1,LifeProTips
__brunt,it very well could but i do not know enough about it to say if the irritants are something you build up a tolorence to also having a sharp knife is just an industry known thing i was only providing my experience as an example ,1,LifeProTips
__brunt,i cannot and wo not speak for you but i cut onions almost every day of my work life and i have not so much as misted up in 10 years i understand the gas that is released causes the reaction and having a sharp knife only reduces the amount of cells broken in the onion vs a dull knife bludgeoning through more cells but all the same i have never had a single problem once i learned to keep my knives sharp when i was young ,1,LifeProTips
__brunt,i tend to paint with broad strokes online because most people are not going to be as familiar with the title sous and my title is not the point of my post i am just giving some credibilty that i know what i am talking about when it comes to food of course if i am talking to people in real life i make the distinction i would not ever overstep my boundaries fwiw i am 16 years in the game and do not take any of the titles lightly i added sous to my original post ,1,LifeProTips
__brunt,i am an executive sous chef so mostly yes my chef is the big dog but i see the day to day event planning etc,1,LifeProTips

__brunt,i said in the live thread that i think aldo is the last guy in the ufc who id want to take a punch from obv heavyweights and other people hit harder but aldo punches look straight up scary i say this with the knowledge that i would probably get slept by anyone in the women strawweight division not trying to sound tough guy ,9,MMA
__brunt,i do not think this is giving enough credit to how clever maxs stand up is ,14,MMA
__brunt,no excuses for aldo at all but i would think if anything aldo would be a nightmare matchup for holloway potential bjj aside max eats 20 leg kicks every fight and aldo is know for chopping down every opponent matching up one of someone biggest weakness against one of another mans biggest strengths is usually something thats gets exploited there no telling what was going through anyone head but it really just seemed like a gameplan failure on aldo part and perfect execution of a gameplan for holloway holloways chin stood tall and let aldo gas himself before he turned it on both men are exceptional fighters obviously and it really could have gone either way max stood tall and took the belt all credit to holloway no excuses for aldo it was just a super fun fight hyped for holloway but no respect lost for aldo either ,8,MMA
__brunt,yeah i do not think theres any love lost for aldo it just seems like people who already hated him are basking in the fact he lost aldo is only 30 and still has one of the most stacked resumes ever he just got beat it happens all credit to holloway no excuses for aldo all in all it was a super good fight and the guy who had the best night won it not like max wiped the floor with jose round 1 max was getting lit up it just the fight game and holloway rallied super fun fight ,13,MMA

__brunt,which might play differently if he had not just been laid out ref sees you go limp and hit the floor then eat 4 6 more clean shots he got a case to stop the fight i think you get more leeway with how many unguarded punches you can take to the face when you were not 3 4 of the way knocked out a second before it ,0,MMA
__brunt,he did not defend any of those shots he might have felt like he was not done but he cannot be mad at the ref when he was knocked cross eyed and then blocked the next 6 punches with his face rock and a hard place but he def was not intelligently defending himself ,9,MMA

__brunt,i do not mean to offend anyone who is proud but honestly why is anyone proud of their whatever patch of grass they are born on at all it strange to take credit for what other people have done nothing that happened before you had anything to do with you personally and being born in a certain plot of land is just a lottery roll of the dice anyway anyone could have just as easily been born anywhere else it not like you earned you way into waiving a flag nationalism is pointless through and through ,0,explainlikeimfive
__brunt,fair point then i did not know that about the regular season my initial response would be maybe he was just playing above the available mean the team could offer for a period of time i think he had a kinda rough start to the season but all the same the system does seem like it can work for him so long as his shot is falling but i still stand behind him not being a great 3 klay sometimes needs a decent amount of chances to get going and if he starts cold under the current team hes probably not going to get the looks he needs to get it going afterward speaking about shooting only ,1,nba
__brunt,i am legit on r nba for lengthy periods of time literally every day scroll on mobile constantly at work how the fuck have i not seen the harden one until just now ,2,nba
__brunt,he just lower on the offensive totum pole now the big question pre season was are there enough shots to go around for the warriors when kd joined the team and it sort of being answered granted the warriors are still giving him some good looks but klay is notoriously streaky and the less opportunities he has to find his rhythm the worse his shot is going to be i do not think klay makes a good number three offensively because he needs to be in the mix more for his game to work he always going to miss a handful of shots but when he not the 1st or 2nd option he not going to get a ton of opportunities to make up for the misses with that said he been more than a g in other parts of his game defense spacing etc so i doubt the warriors are complaining too much though no one would be bummed to see klay go on a scoring hot streak ,2,nba

__brunt,bisping just got done reading the secret and thinks if he keeps putting the gsp fight into the universe it will eventually come to him ,5,MMA
__brunt,gsp is only fighting because he wants a title and thinks bisping is the easiest route if bisping does not have the title gsp looks elsewhere and then bisping does not get the money fight dana promised him so unfortunetly no one wins ,17,MMA
__brunt,i would be willing to bet a lot of money it was some idiots trolling irl but that does not invalidate the bigger message lebron is speaking to the fact that sentiment could even be a relevant trolling tool proves his point ,643,nba
__brunt,seems as good a place as any to ask but who is the fat bald headed ref in the u k who apparently just wants to see knockouts because he warns you have to stay active the second the fight hits the ground and stands the fighters up about a second after that that guy is the worst is he just a former boxer who hates grappling ,17,MMA

__brunt,but i am talking about calculated risks no it not super dangerous to go hiking and climbing but it still unnecessary you are probably just as likely to get in a car wreck but save sleeping at the arena for the entire fight week there no avoiding being in a car you can avoid climbing rock faces sure it not super likely but it really not that uncommon and it just something he is not forced to do anyway my original comment was more of a lol what if than actually judging him for it but all the same i would be pretty fucking bummed out if the fight got called off cause max sprained his ankle hiking during fight week ,3,MMA
__brunt,i am at work so i cannot listen to the podcast but who is he referencing about cheating yoel i guess ,2,MMA
__brunt,lol boy you really nailed me cause that exactly what i was saying keep everyone in a padded room until fight day you got me i mean why would an athelete who only performs a few times a year show a little caution just before they are avctive it a ludicrous thought really ,1,MMA
__brunt,i literally grew up in the mountains hiking and camping climbing etc its really easy to injure yourself from a tweaked ankle to worse it happened to me and everyone i know i am not saying it the same as mountain biking or demolition derby but it ridiculous to say that a vigorous mountain hike climbing on rocks is not an unnecessary risk a few days out from a title fight edit to add the arguement has gotten bigger than i originally meant it i am not saying going hiking is an over the top dangerous exercise but that it is risky enough that i would think that would be something someone might stay away from when you have a six figure paycheck depending on whether or not you are able to perform in a few days that what i meant by unnecessary risk no it not a huge risk but it enough of one that i would think someone would think better of it ,1,MMA
__brunt,it just about taking unnecessary risks walking around climbing rocks and trees of course you do not need be kept in a bubble but doing an extra curricular activity that has an extremely high injury rate would be ill advised ,0,MMA
__brunt,that not my point training in a gym with structure is dangerous enough but when you take that structure out and add all the variables that climbing around in rocks and trees adds it just unnecessary risk i grew up in the mountains and no matter how comfortable you are doing any of that you still cannot plan on a rock being loose or a branch breaking when you are climbing up a tree training has enough risk adding elements you cannot control is just unnecessary ,1,MMA

__brunt,for sure it understandable but it just nice to see a levelheaded spurs fan i have said it all day but i am a big popovich fan and i want the spurs to win the series but the truth is the truth pop is being hypocritical and potentially unnecessarily vilifying zaza about an extremely unfortunate situation the whole thing is a giant fucking bummer but finger pointing is not going make it any better for anyone ,1,nba
__brunt, sure https i imgur com ktnud gif ,17,nba
__brunt,this is the first reasonable statement by a spurs fan i have seen yet everyone else is just it different it was not illegal etc no it 100 the same thing and hypocritical but it was a long time ago and who knows how pop feels about the situation statements he made a decade ago and does a reporter dare ask him there no guarantee pops views are the same they were a decade ago ,32,nba
__brunt,but we get two threads about russ liking the video ,42,nba
__brunt,somehow popovich quotes in relation to the context of what he said today are not relevant and are getting taken down by the mods but we get two threads showing russ liked the video of it because that undoubtedly more relevant ,68,nba
__brunt,i bet this thread stays up since its not calling out popovich for hypocrisy lol feel free to bring on the downvotes i am a big popovich fan and hoping the spurs win the series but pop is being crazy hypocritical right now and the mods showing a huge bias about it ,-8,nba

__brunt,what reporter dares confront popovich about this ,10,nba
__brunt,lol no i am not i am a big popovich fan and rooting for the spurs to win the series but that does not cloud my judgement enough to see a little hypocrisy and call it out if anything a lot of spurs fan are trying really hard to deflect something pretty straight forward but popovich is human and humans are hypocritical so it not like i am losing respect for him over it the truth is the truth tho ,20,nba

__brunt,all of the concessions you suggested are just possibilities at best and there a much smaller chance a kid is going to come in and drink 6 waters vs a single adult drinking 6 beers and ticket sales are split between the act promotoer etc money made in house on alcohol goes straight to the establishment so ticket sales are not where a venue makes money between booking an event staffing an event having he lights on and all of the other costs that go into running a music venue they will be looking to maximize profits from every show i do not know how many people you know that run clubs venues but it is not that profitable save a few big names without alcohol sales they will be potentially either breaking even or even losing money per event like i said a lot of venues are 21 for that very reason you can make 20 per customer or 120 per customer they do not have any requirement to cater to a younger audience and lose money a business is a business ,23,explainlikeimfive
__brunt,music venues are a business and the point of a business is to make money not be a charity a venue could just as easily book bands that do not cater to a younger audience or even be a 21 club to cut the problem out venues that allow all ages are already doing a bit of compensating work by inviting an audience that is less profitable in their doors since inherently they will be spending less money you can say it questionable but there are tons of venues who do not even allow kids in at all and that their prerogative no business wants to is required to take a loss on a service they provide ,48,explainlikeimfive
__brunt,alcohol sales count for a huge amount of the expected revenue for shows young kids are sometimes taxed more for not being able to contribute to the bottom line if they had sold that ticket to someone of age it a safer bet they will be spending more money at the venue than someone under 21 ,24,explainlikeimfive

__brunt,i think the step is being overanalyzed because it hurt kawhi how many times do you think someone shifts their weight in a weird way or performs a movement that does not really make much sense but goes unnoticed because it does not have any kind of impact just like a little stutter step or whatever weird little things happen this one was just mega unfortunate again this is just my take i am not in zazas head he could be a big enough piece of shit to try to hurt kawhi but that seems unlikely and honestly without looking at where kawhi was would have actually been pretty hard to aim his foot ,16,nba

__brunt,maybe i am derping but what ,528,MMA
__brunt,for sure and i am not mad at him for getting it it been a long time coming unfortunate this is the the fight that leads him into it he had way more dominating performances from fights that were supposed to lead to his title shot but all the same maia 100 deserves a crack at the belt and has for a long time ,9,MMA
__brunt,yeah i have noticed anything that is pro jorge gets downvoted pretty quick i am a maia fan as well so it not like i am bashing the guy and i am happy if he gets his titleshot but all of his offense was pretty much shut down last night jorge stuffed most of his takedowns and the ones maia did get he did not do anything with after they were down i am a fan and all but it was not like maia had a super dominant performance like i said split decision or draw sounds pretty good to me it is what it is ,26,MMA
__brunt,the a little unfair if escaping was that easy bjj would be useless masvidal had to protect his neck because it was his only option i was a little salty last night but i am more understanding of the decision today maia spent almost half the fight with jorge in danger jorge just defended at an elite level defense does not really win you points so maia was the aggressor and i will concede he deserved the w i will say there should be something to be said about neutralizing your opponents weapons which both of them did and i would not have been upset at a draw under that scope but all the same either a maia win or a draw is the only thing that makes sense jorge definetly did not beat maia edit typo ,2,MMA
__brunt,her gameplan was questioning jjs chin which she outright said she was looking for a ko with every swing rogan just praised her heart and willpower because for 25 minutes she got her head kicked in and she never really slowed down justifiable praise ja has a pretty bright future once her technical game gets more refined she obviously not getting knocked out anytime soon ,8,MMA

__brunt,i am probably too stupid to see it right in front of me but what time do prelims start ,1,MMA
__brunt,i am just excited either way i like both guys a lot and i wo not be surprised the outcome whoever wins masvidal by tko or maia by rnc it all about if maia can get through masvidals great tdd and get him to the ground it what makes the such an awesome fight ,2,MMA
__brunt,masvidal has some amazjng tdd and his striking is far superior to maia it all a question of whether maia can get him down or not 50 50 ,2,MMA
__brunt,exactly like dana said he did not have anything to do with kelvin getting pulled kelvin fucked that up himself anderson had a fight he was happy with in a place he was happy with and it got scrapped due to things beyond silva or danas hands anderson demanding a title interim fight because of that and since he could not get one telling people to ask for refunds is really childish all the way around silva is silva and all but it really not a good look for him ,1,MMA
__brunt,he was probably high as fuck ,14,MMA
__brunt,he said they were in talks which is not news at all everyone knew that sometimes i am down for his interviews but a lot of the time he just trying to get hot takes and acts an instigator he honestly just tmz for the ufc and his air of superiority about it really gets under my skin ,1,MMA
__brunt,except the ufc just threw a giant even to officially announce jones dc2 and that manuwa is ok standby if either guy pulls out ariel broke the news a half hour before the enemy started so it not like anyone was in limbo and ariel broke the story he just squeaked in so he could take credit for the news hes just kind of a leech in that regard ,2,MMA
__brunt,i guess if he considers making it a part of his job he could also just as easily simply interview fighters and report on what is going on without announcing fights before the ufc and taking credit for himself about it ,6,MMA
__brunt,i posted this in another thread but that one got deleted so i never get ariels pride in leaking ufc info before they announce things the way they want to they threw this big press conference today specifically for that and ariel is patting himself on the back for spoiling it like he did some good in the world it such a parasitic maneuver he did nothing for these fights did not book anything does not pay any of these guys he just sneaks around and leaks info that the ufc is trying make an event out of it really narcissistic i am important i got the inside scoop and knew before you guys did ,28,MMA
__brunt, there were not any surprise announcements because we announced them all earlier so kudos to the media in a proud smug voice also do you purposefully ignore all the points other people are making in this thread because you are a contrarian or are you really that big of an ariel fanboy ,2,MMA
__brunt,asking for examples of a hyperbole haha and you give ariel way too much credit he acts on his own narcissism not for the interest of any fans or to have fun ruining announcements for the ufc he just likes to feel important and no it is not more fun with ariel spoiling things what is more exciting watching a ppv and all of a sudden everything fades to black and after a few second hearing brock lesnar can you see me now and it takes you a few seconds to put it together they are announcing his return or reading brock lesner is back on twitter ,1,MMA
__brunt,even that one was understandable from the ufc standpoint they have an announcement they are excited about making during a ppv have it lined up to be introduced in a pretty awesome way and ariel rushed to announce it first so in some narcissistic way he can take credit for it afterwards probably half the audience in the crowd and at home already knew and the excitement shock value was completely lost if i were dana i would have kicked him the out too ,1,MMA
__brunt,i never get ariels pride in leaking ufc info before they announce things the way they want to they threw this big press conference today specifically for that and ariel is patting himself on the back for spoiling it like he did some good in the world it such a parasitic maneuver he did nothing for these fights did not book anything does not pay any of these guys he just sneaks around and leaks info that the ufc is trying make an event out of it really narcissistic i am important i got the inside scoop and knew before you guys did ,19,MMA
__brunt,i pointed this out when someone joked about it the celtics first series someone said something along the line of the boys better be wearing all black next game and i said i did not really think joking about funerals would be appropriate and i got downvoted to shit for some reason celtics fans will be celtics fans i guess ,1,nba

__brunt,unless cody is going to be out for a really long time there no match that would sell as high as cody tj and if tj fights anyone else he potentially loses and the title fight of cody tj is gone reading now tj might go down after mm belt but even that wo not be the fight that ufc has been selling for 6 months between cody tj no fight except them rescheduling makes sense for the ufc especially from a point of view ,1,MMA
__brunt,i asked earlier who was mad at the refs cause i missed a lot and most people said both teams since i have tuned in i have not really seen much for the celtics to not be thanking the refs about ,3,nba

__brunt,ha no ones outraged i am just trying to point out the pigeonholed logic sure other people have been in his position but why would that devalidate his own story he gets asked about it a lot almost every interview and it a part of who he is it understandable if you do not like his personality and prefer people be more reserved but calling him a wanna hardass because he is vocal about his life is kinda missing the mark his legitimacy merits how tough he is not how he talks ,1,MMA
__brunt,yeah honestly it just a great fight my gut is with jorge but that not overlooking maia catching him slipping and wrapping him up there really no way to call it beforehand either outcome is entirely plausible ,1,MMA

__brunt, or https i giphy com rvybn0uxznaai gif ,17,MMA
__brunt,for sure but i also do not think it that big of a problem yet there have only been a few weird fights that have not made a lot of sense and that meaning make sense to older fans purist for better or worse the open market is infinetly bigger than the faction of fans who have been watching for a long time of course a bunch of people are unhappy with a few recent bookings and rightfully so but overall these mega fights bring more recognition to the sport even silly exhibitions like conor mayweather a bunch of fighters might mock it now but if it happens you cannot say what will potentially be the highest selling fight of all time wo not bring the ufc more fans and in a few years time every fighter a will happily cash that paycheck with an extra 0 at the end of it and i am in no way advocating for every fight to be a supermarch and to throw the belts and ranking system out the window it just that i think there a middle ground of course the ufc will lose credibility if it goes off the rails but the ultimate goal of dana the ufc and even the fighters themselves is to grow the sport and reap the benefits i am not saying i know the answers or know what that middle ground is but i do not think even the fighters in title contention would tell you they would rather the sport stay smaller and them be paid less and for it to grow you have to attract new fans like i said it a fine line ,1,MMA
__brunt,the other elephant in the room is that the ufc needs casual fans for fighters to be paid more or what they are worth that comes from an audience much bigger than purist mma fans and while some fighters especially the ones who have been skipped over for a title shot the few that have been might grumble about the hierarchy which is fair for them to feel slighted do not get me wrong i gaurentee if you ask most fighters do you want to make 15k or 75k on your next fight they are all taking the money 100 of the time for that to happen the sport has to grow and that takes causal viewers and giving them fights they want to watch it an unfortunate but necessary evil ,0,MMA
__brunt,i think that the point of doing it now before it gets worse i think the belts do not matter narrative is a little overblown most weight classes are in normal working order with only a few exceptions mostly revolving around conor and while that definetly open to fair criticism it not as crazy as people are making it out to be yet if it keeps trending in that direction the ufc will really start to lose credibility i think a big part of dana pulling the plug on this fight it trying to steer things back to normalcy before they really get out of hand ,2,MMA
__brunt, i know i have been kind of annoying lately but i really need your help with this ,250,aww
__brunt,yeah but if he loses the bisping only lost to yoel because of steroids talk will be prominent too probably even from bisping himself people speculate and talk shit it kind of what makes sports fun if you did not have an opinion and get invested i do not really see what wold keep you watching people take it over the top and it gets annoying from both sides but honestly it would be pretty boring if everything was like a computer simulation with no emotion to it ,0,MMA
__brunt,i see what you are saying but i was more addressing the fact of fighters demands getting a little over the top and dana chapping them about it whether purist like it or not a returning legend is a net win for the ufc both in gate numbers but also adding a big name to the mix for future fights it made sense enough to dana to book the fight but then gsps demands for the rock star treatment and the fight revolving around his terms is where he crossed the line danas just saying that not even gsp gets to dictate the terms of the fight let alone anyone else if a fight makes sense at least to dana and he will take it into consideration but that not giving all the power to the fighters and he letting everyone know that it nipping a growing problem before it gets too out of hand ,1,MMA
__brunt,well yeah and i do not know why that would be surprising people talk shit and get arrogant about what is going to happen in a fight for months and it always funny to see someone with arrogance have to eat crow it the same reason people root against unpopular fighters in the first place everything is a reaction to something else ,1,MMA
__brunt,its cliche to quote rogan but him saying of henderson you can feel the ring shake when dan henderson walks through it it like he made of stone always seemed like the most apt terrifying description ,21,MMA
__brunt,i am with you it kind of exactly what masvidal just said he has the tools to take away maia main weapons so if takedowns get stuffed or returned to the feet quickly i think masvidal wins a standup fight every time obviously anything can happen but i see jorge having the advantage here ,5,MMA
__brunt,bispings tank chin are definitely his big aces in the hole for this fight round 3 and on should be owned by him he just has to survive 2 potentially brutal rounds to get there ,38,MMA
__brunt,gsp was asking for a pushed back fight date for a reason though if he already was not going to be ready to fight in july i doubt he going to accept to go into the ring underprepared and potentially embarrassed by bisping of all people dana pressuring him probably wo not speed his process up just a thought but i do not really see gsp changing his tune too much ,1,MMA
__brunt,i think this is about dana setting a precedent as much as anything he knows shit is getting a little out of hand and hes trying to put the brakes on it he even acknowdgles that conor gets to do whatever he wants which he does not seem too happy about and that he sick of everyone else asking for money fights and star treatment like conor this is a big i am still in control dont get ahead of yourselves to everyone else if he pulling the plug on a gsp fight hes saying everyone needs to back up with their demands he still steering the ship ,365,MMA
__brunt,this sub will go into the most panicked severe denial that users will start asking if bisping and gsp are ever going to stop holding up the division because yoel needs a title shot a part of me is rooting for it to happen just because the fallout on this sub will be unparalleled but i have no faith in bisping beating yoel bisping might actually die ,195,MMA

__brunt,fair enough i would be hard pressed to be convinced any show could be more critically acclaimed than the sopranos but again i am admitting a pretty heavy bias about that so i am not claiming to be right i definitely hear about got enough that i could see an argument for popularity critical acclaim ,1,television
__brunt,wow that super random this question just kind of popped into my head because i am in the middle of rewatching deadwood and just finished a rewatch of the sopranos pretty recently thanks for the link ,1,television
__brunt,it obviously a subjective conversation and i realize i am one of the few not on the game of thrones bandwagon but i really do not put those shows in the same level as the previously mentioned ones i know it won a lot of awards but is got in the conversation of goat series the way the sopranos and wire have been for the last bunch of years in my head it not but again i am not a fan so my perception would be pretty biased ,-1,television

__brunt,show up early look overly presentable bring a small pad of paper and a pen and use them be honest about your skill set and take your time if they know you are working your way out of dish they are not expecting you to have a big skill set so they are going to be looking to see if you are trainable and how strong your work ethic is show them you are worth the investment and you will be just fine ,3,KitchenConfidential

__brunt,that fair but honestly if you are making a list of nba players who are not cocky supremely confident it gonna be really really short being self assured seems like something you would need to perform under the lights in the big league tbh ,4,nba
__brunt,i get that which ties into people hating his fans and that transferring into hating him but honestly he cannot really control the narrative around him because some stupid people started talking about him on par above jordan is not really his fault but like you said this thread is about irrational so i hate his shitty beard would be a pretty acceptable answer ,2,nba
__brunt,i get that a lot of people hate him and everyone is entitled to their opinion yadda yadda but i just never understood the hate for curry like i love russ but i totally get why people would hate on him the only thing i can really think with curry is he kinda bland and people do not like that seems like he just keeps his head down to me but i dunno maybe people hate his fans which can be super annoying which translates to hating him to each their own all the same ,18,nba

__brunt,tbh it mostly an overreaction from conor haters he ruined the sport because he become a superstar that can kind of do whatever he wants i am not even mad at bisping for taking a money fight he been bludgeoned in the head for longer than just about everyone in the sport let the man have one fight he can rest comfortably after he retires with and really i do not see anything wrong with conor playing this out for himself either it a brutal sport than comes with a lot of fucking brain damage that can will really affect your quality of life in the later years i do not see anything at all wrong taking as few punches in the head as possible for the highest paycheck possible all these fans act like the fighters are endebted to them for some reason like they are owed something i get the purist side of it too do not get me wrong but acting like someone is a pussy because they only want to get in 15 car wrecks instead of 100 is being a little demanding ,13,MMA

__brunt,word i didnt watch everywarrior game this season but have been paying pretty close attention for the last 4 5 weeks and i feel like when i do watch zaza is either gettig beat by his man or committing a moving screen and typically i see javale usually have a few highlight reel moments in his short minutes must just the last few weeks tho ,1,nba
__brunt,do you mean because javale gets gassed or do you mean all around i feel like whenever i see javale out there he usually looks really good i just know he cannot really stack on minutes ,2,nba

__brunt,damn you must have really high blood pressure chill out basically no rules need to change the refs just need to stop handing out shooting fouls on touch fouls we all know what a real shot vs a drawing a foul shot is it pretty clear 95 of the time someone pushes through a screen call a touch foul but just because some hurled the ball into the air in the vicinity of the backboard should not make it a shooting foul yeah if harden is taking a legit contested 3 and gets his elbow hit send him to the line someone working through a screen and harden extends himself into their arms before flailing a ball nah that weak otherwise you have to let the ball handler go around his screen and have open looks which discourages good defense you are forcing the defender to leave the shooter open through the screen ,1,nba
__brunt,top of the knee charley horse goes away pretty quick ,14,nba
__brunt,i am sure that why the nba sportscasters and officials are talking about it for reddit internet points not because it actually a problem and making the game a little harder to watch it not because it a thing harden does it just a narrative a website started about him you got it all figured out ,1,nba
__brunt,the way it was constantly brought up out of nowhere if you are just joining us patrick beverly grandfather died this morning and it being completely irrelevant to what is happening sometimes even when he was in the bench he looked pretty torn up about it pre game and just because it happened does not mean he wants the entire world to know and ask about his business let it be ,2,nba
__brunt,lol you just got your homer goggles on bub your boy harden draws a lot of fouls and flops a lot it just a thing he does and it pretty garbage to watch it not his whole game but it a large part of it the last couple of games have actually been nice because he stopped getting the calls mostly and is actually shooting and draining his 3s but harden earned his reputation not a bunch of nerds on a basketball forum even the officials when they cut away to ask about fouls are talking about wanting to review the rules for next season that not a narrative harden earned it ,1,nba
__brunt,1 that does not address your original comment literally no ones said harden cannot shoot 3s he a sharpshooter 2 that fine that his perogative to play how he sees fit but no viewer is under any obligation to like anyone or the way they play play cheap expect to catch some hate for it he might not care but hardens fans cannot question why people would call bullshit on a lot of what he does ,1,nba
__brunt,it has not been looking good tonight but at one point it was within 11 with a lot of time left with the chance to go up 3 1 in the series ,1,nba

__brunt,does a reporter dare ask pop why he gave up and played his bench the whole 4th quarter ,8,nba
__brunt,lol no ones said that most of r nba says it funny harden flops so much cause when he actually concentrates on his shot instead of flopping he usually drains the 3 which makes the flopping even more annoying ,2,nba
