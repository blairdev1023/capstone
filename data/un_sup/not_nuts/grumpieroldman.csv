grumpieroldman,from a mathematical perspective the primary task the fed is given to stabilize the economic boom and bust cycles is similar to the problem of noise cancellation however the tools the fed has to cancel the noise and the information they receive are utterly insufficient to accomplish the task at hand it is like trying to do noise cancellation but your microphone is full of water and the signal is sent the wrong way around the world lots of lag before you get it and can act on it the consequence of that is they cannot respond in time to quickly moving effects insufficient control bandwidth and can only really affect long term slowly changing offsets called secular effects in economic terminology but they have a limited capacity to correct for secular effects which means the best the fed can do is no harm and any mistake that is made that carries them away from suprahuman computer like self control on how they affect the market stands a significant risk of making matters worse in the 30 the fed created the great depression by setting interest rates low during a boom effectively creating a negative interest rate then in 1929 unexpectedly jacked up the interest rate further their tight monetary policy was putting small banks out of business the one two punch knocked the entire world into a depression and caused the us to defaulted on the dollar this was the transition from the gold standard to fiat money in 2008 they were absolutely clueless about the coming shit storm and panicked when it happened there no notion that they were prepared and had a tough love plan ready go to they took panic to congress and the american tax payer got to bail out the banks shouldering all the risk the recovery was then the longest in american history so while they made have given us a soft landing it was an overall net worse manipulation because the economy would have recovered faster without their intervention it was a complete fucking over of not merely the tax payer but the tax payers children grandchildren and great grandchildren back to some mathematics the economy with the fed is now more stable than without it however the average growth is lower and the derivative of growth is slightly negative this means that while things are more prone to boom and bust without the fed the economy nonetheless improves more overall and much more damningly the rate of growth is not persistently negative fed considered harmful,2,AskThe_Donald

grumpieroldman,one of the most important tasks for the elder generation of men to impart on the next generations and which we have categorically failed to do with this generation is to infuse them with awareness of their inner emotive drive to capitulate to women this is why misogyny is universal if men do not learn to say no then they are taken advantage of unto the destruction of that civilization this is an expression of the more fundamental conflict between the r k reproduction strategies if r strategy wins out then you have a society where women become more and more powerful and they all seek the top class of men this disenfranchises the less desirable men until they withdraw from society and cease function as net positives as they have no motivation to do so they have no wife no children and no prospects of either or if they have a wife the children his is raising are not his this prevents them from having a emotive vested interest in the future of the society they might say they care which they might in an abject sense but without kin in the game they will not have a visceral commit to the future the world is highly competitive so a society with merely abstractly committed men will be destroyed by a society with viscerally committed men this is not new or radical thought everything that has happened with happen again the telltale political expression of this end of times for the society is bachelor taxes so called child support which is actually mother support is half way there japan in particular is in a bad way and if things do not change there soon their society will implode in about 30 years ,1,AskMen

grumpieroldman,it the mathematics concept that maps to how particles behave it not that su 3 was created for physics so much as mathematicians have explored every nook and cranny they can and out of the vastness of what is known today su 3 happens to fit well loosely speaking a group is a set of things often numbers in this case particles that can be reached using some set of operations an easy example is something like the set of integers modulus 5 that forms a group of 0 1 2 3 4 5 if you had a 6 it would become 0 so 6 is not part of the set then let say the only operation you could do on it is 1 no 2 no 1 allowed you can start from any number in the group and get to any other number in the group with 1 5 1 5 0 that starts to define the minimum of what you might need to define a group when they developed group theory they figured out all of the necessary and sufficient requirements group theory lays out what you automatically know about a set if you can prove it a group there are many variations with ever increasing requirements and if you can meet those requirements then you know more about the set one example is associative 2 1 1 2 it intuitive for integers but matrices for example are not associative which is probably why so many people are saying linear algebra is where they were exposed to it the su groups have a bunch of extra requirements https en wikipedia org wiki special unitary group i presume when physicist started doing collider experiments they started figuring out what transitions can happen and which transitions cannot happen the picture was incomplete but it started to settle in on the form of su3 which names a generation of the su groups su 1 1 su 2 quaternions 3d imaginary numbers sometimes used to represent rotations in 3d graphics su 3 particle physics up to chromodynamics which means electromagnetism weak and strong forces modeled theories out there use higher order su to try to pull in gravity an actual physicist will have to correct me but i presume that because particle states are quantum they are mapped onto either a unit circle unit sphere unit hypersphere at equal spacings like slicing a pie into equal pieces or placing candles along the edge evenly spread out and those are the members of their su3 set and the operations on that set are the sub atomic transmutative transitions eg feynman diagrams ,6,askscience

grumpieroldman,you cannot support a socialist and pretend you love america the purpose of supporting socialism is to destroy the nation the problem with socialism is technical it has incorrect market signals that result in rationing and exacerbate shortages when everything is going well or while you have excess funds to drain to patch over the problems it almost does not matter what system you use we can look to the hugo chavez years as an example of that the test of a system is what happens when it is stressed eg you are not judged by how you behave on your best day stressing a market means a shortage socialism enables the central government to budget money for the given sector this is the purpose of a single payer healthcare system if they adequately fund the sector then all should be well however any over budgeting of the sector results in graft as is common place with our current dilapidated system of defense spending which admittedly is the lesser of the two problems it much more tempting for politicians to under fund a sector to tighten the government budget and reduce taxes this results in a shortage in that sector and under socialism a shortage results in rationing because the average citizen is either not allowed to or not capable of circumvent ing the system they must get in line and wait either a physical line as had notably happened many times over for gasoline or bread or with a waiting list as is common place with single payer healthcare systems that a given socialistic system is well funded today is absolutely no guarantee that it will be adequately funded next year as socialism fails it erodes public confidence that the government will be able to fix it which causes a negative feedback cycle with the potential to destroy the nation as happened in somalia as is happening in venezuela contrast with capitalism which responds to a shortage by increasing the price of the good or service this mitigates the shortage four different ways first it encourages people to conserve reducing demand second it encourages people to use alternatives if possible which can greatly reduce demand third because there is confidence that the shortage will be addressed there is counter pressure to horde you will lose money once the shortage subsides fourth the increase in price means the produces providers make more money which they can use to help address the shortage and competition means the first ones to address the shortage make more money so there is incentive to do so if you have a momentous government failure such as carter gasoline crisis under capitalism you could still enact emergency rationing and it is possible to execute that quickly the time it takes to print vouchers and mail them if you have socialism it can take several years to undo it and enable market forces estonia circa 1992 is probably the greatest success story of a such a transition and it took two years to execute the quickest turn around of any socialist nation in human history we can engage in two thought experiments to demonstrate the different outcomes of the two systems consider what happens if a disease sweeps through cows and there is a milk shortage not entirely unlike what happened in the 80 the notable difference between the systems here is that the increase in price ultimately enables the farms to take more action sooner to raise more cattle consider the thought experiment of what happens if there is only one doctor left how does the system require her to act what choices can she make on her own what would be the best long term course of action ,4,MarchAgainstTrump

forgive their sins they did not cry tears and ask for demand apologies they made t shirts and wore them basket of deplorables on the front and irredeemable on the back this starts to give you an idea of what they are looking for on the world stage someone that will fight for our interest and not care about hurt feelings in contrast obama does not understand how to use hard power and i am not certain hillary can find north on map her tenure as sos was a disaster it was so bad it is difficult to accept that it was not intentional they squandered the arab spring granted it would have been very difficult and challenging to make good things come of it but they did not even try let just let it go the best chance for democracy in the middle east in 200 years and they had better things to do like create a power vacuum in iraqi because apparently the worlds only remaining super power is too weak to tell a nation they conquered go fuck yourself we are not leaving until you are ready voila isis but wait there more let start a war in libya because the french president sarkozy donated to my charity and asked me nicely to help him start a new round of profiteering warmongering and let me delete those emails off my private server so i cannot be charged with treason now they are out on wikileaks which is a tainted source and cannot be used to prosecute then she blames that on russia nope was us hackers and my people will believe me inside their intense echo chamber i wish that was the end of it charlie wilson https www youtube com watch v uhl 6uh8muq had good intentions and we did not know better but everyone since then in politics god damned well does yet here we are again giving money and weapons to people we do not know cannot control and probably hate us in syria oh and russia is fighting isis there and these guys are fighting russia so we need to give them more weapons and implement a no fly zone because fuck russia radical islamic terrorism is not our 1 priority fucking russians is obama got on national tv and in an interview told illegal immigrants to go vote https www youtube com watch v nfgevgvc6qs the interviewer called them citizens and not only did he fail to correct her and he agreed hillary won the public vote if you count 3 million votes from illegal aliens this is a great one as well they claim black people are too incompetent to get a photo id and at least the young liberals believe it https www youtube com watch v rrbxzgwcdgs of course that insanely racist non sense the real reason they do not want id laws is because is discourages illegal aliens from voting legal aliens have established voting rights and that fine allowing illegal aliens to vote is crazy it means i can get a big ass boat haul in people smuggle them in register them and literally buy the victory the dnc paid bernie 600k to agree to three rules he will not criticize hillary he will concede the primary to hillary he will endorse hillary wikileaks finally got podesta emails out that confirm it after the election in contrast the gop allowed democracy to run its course even though they did not like the results that principled bribing your opponent that you do not even need to bribe because you are going to win anyway is a perfect microcosm of the dnc waste money integrity flushed down the toilet and failed to achieve the objective if liberals are so smart how come they lose so god damned always https www youtube com watch v ml3qyhwrizk that was an hbo tv show the newsroom but it captured the truth about the state of america and what everyone was thinking circa 2012 the hillary gets on stage in 2016 and says america is already great jfc could you be more incompetent i guess record levels of incarceration on trivial drug charges is fine with her since she did called black criminals super predators totallynotracist the sjw all threatened to move to canada in trump won why did not a single one of them threaten to move to mexico canada sucks it cold as balls and boring mexico is fun totallynotracist how many black people are were on hillary senior staff zero she needed latino votes though and voila latino on her staff totallynotracist the dnc platform is illegal in the uk and europe so called positive discrimination is still racism it treats black people as though they are intrinsically incompetent and cannot possibly be expected to compete with white people and kicks talented poor white people in the teeth then they get told their privileged we have not even gotten to the staggering levels of sexism in the dnc yet totallynotracist let talk about blm blm in concept is absolutely correct it is not acceptable to murder some people in the pursuit of law order and we saw several cases of police murdering black people freddie grey comes to mind as the most prominent case but we also saw a great deal of false narrative lies he ai not got no gun but he did he was shot in the back nope he was charging we saw a lot of suicide by cop every single time it was black people getting killed and not a single time did they air a case of all the young white men that are killed by cops young black men are disproportionately affected however the greater number of young white men getting killed is ignored kick them in the teeth once again then a globalist fucking asshole named soros gets involved who causes chaos in countries so he can use that a prori knowledge to make money on forex and starts funding blm to amp up the violence there is no possible way obama was not informed of this he knew but the bigotry on the left would not allow him to go on tv and tell people what was going on instead he sides with criminals emboldens them and that culminates in the assassination of five dallas polices officers some of which were black and this next one is just despicable beyond words the daughter of one of those slain cops was invited to southern methodist university to throw out the ball to start a volleyball game there after trump won they uninvited her because they thought it would be insensitive to grieving hillary supporters to have her present http www dailymail co uk news article 3932200 murdered dallas cop s teenage daughter throw serve father s honor snubbed college volleyball team diversity flap html but geez what a piece of shit you are if you like pussy trump is the first republican candidate and now president that supports gay rights he for a constitutional amendment he carried a lgbt flag across the stage at one of his rallies hillary clinton already had a chance to do something about it and said the country is not ready for it it was even dick cheney supported gay rights know what did not happen no one in the gop criticized him for it no one called him a godless liberal and keyed his car and said they were not friends anymore no one acted like a bigot it was a come to jesus moment for the party and the commended him for supporting his family his daughter is a lesbian above ideology there is generally no dialog and only demonization from liberals to conservatives there is no way you do not know any conservatives they are just afraid to tell you so because the bigotry from the left is violent ,1,politics
grumpieroldman,i guess this is your public and not your private position president who bragged about groping women have you watched the video trump was a billionaire who slept with models then he gets a tv show and becomes a celebrity it was a conversation between him and another celebrity and his tone was not aggressive it was incredulous he was talking about his astonishment over the ability of celebrity to seduce his shock was that it was a bigger factor than his wealth and i have heard far worse things come from the women locker room ,2,politics
grumpieroldman,oh please the absolute worst thing that will happen to women is it will become harder to murder their unborn children yes bearing a child is a tremendous burden and it is not fair but so is being murdered do you believe in castle law because that the same ethical principle to support abortion the gop does not corner the market on hypocrisy maybe if the muslim community did some self policing and maybe if the dnc did not shut down investigations into people on grounds of sjw who turned out to be terrorist you would have a point is it fair that a well adjusted muslim will undergo additional hardship nope but that too bad because the rest of the world religions do not produce the extraordinarily large quantities of terrorist that islam does the sjw had their chance and they screwed up le pen is going to win france and then it game over for the globalist ,1,politics
