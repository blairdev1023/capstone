shadowinplainsight, that song live https youtu be atdodj9 tl4 their first attempt decent but hopefully it will improve with time like my songs know what you did in the dark centuries and immortals did young and menace is all guitar drums bass and vocals albeit with a ton of layering and effects sorry i just get fan triggered when people act like they are not playing instruments anymore,6,lewronggeneration

shadowinplainsight,i think that a pearl on her chest,4,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,well at the very least his heart had stopped,5,stevenuniverse

shadowinplainsight, no they are just using my art in a way i do not agree with steven this sounds like a very abstract problem this is for some reason one of my favourite exchanges in the series,15,stevenuniverse

shadowinplainsight,yep i was referring to the gem formerly known as lapis,3,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,well yeah but it sort of the same shape as lapis gem no ,9,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,fair point i made my joke better anyhow,1,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,to be fair to horror club he was hoping the house would give sadie back in exchange for lars so it was not entirely vengeance,3,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,oh gods you have nailed it,1,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,well i actually really liked rocknaldo but i have not wanted to risk the downvotes i would probably get from defending it,1,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,i appreciate the depiction of peedee ocd immensely,3,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,for me that sort of the point it about letting yourself feel those sad feelings so you can deal with them but knowing that they are just thoughts that will eventually go by,3,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight, after the shattering pearl why would you do this i did it for her ,3,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,a butter knife usually does it,1,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,watch starfan13 be a rogue princess from the pigeon kingdom,1,StarVStheForcesofEvil

shadowinplainsight,you can hear strong in the real way while pearl is fighting sugilite,6,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,or like why the doctor could not just pouch them up at a later point in time,1,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,i could see hunger and sleep coming up depending on how long the episodes end up happening over i also would not be surprised if steven only gets tired because he expects to ,1,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,but with pr where do the mps come from are they appointed what about regional representation if my neighbour and i birth voted differently who do we write to with our concerns ,1,canada
shadowinplainsight,but he never got a goodbye and i am still so fucking bitter ,4,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,i have been here five years now and i still dgaf about reposts,2,Showerthoughts
shadowinplainsight,so what would you say he is ,4,AskScienceFiction
shadowinplainsight,or it misshapen like the corrupted gems ,1,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,so very tardy for our enemas ,1,StarVStheForcesofEvil
shadowinplainsight,interesting how it differently shaped from the other rose quartz gems we have seen,29,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,this is going to be foreshadowing i have said it from the moment i heard it,5,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,that assumes rose had dna outside of her gem which steven would be able to pass on i feel like his kids would probably be normal humans unless of course he somehow pulls off whatever rose did to make him,5,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight, saltwaterconfirmed,10,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,shield becomes mixing bowl,6,SULeaks
shadowinplainsight,not really they are aliens,1,stevenuniverse

shadowinplainsight,that would be fantastic absolutely let me know if you have any you can spare ,1,ottawa
shadowinplainsight,lars is really relatable for a lot of people he honestly not a bad guy he just insecure and defensive to a fault,11,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,it sometimes spelled margot too,5,StarVStheForcesofEvil
shadowinplainsight,well the ikea security seems to be patrolling iris so at least someone paying attention i guess ,3,LoudNoisesOttawa
shadowinplainsight,i am near ikea and wondering this too it does not seem to be on the queensway at the very least,1,LoudNoisesOttawa
shadowinplainsight,another thing to note is that while steven may lack the necessary anger towards the diamonds lars was already pissed off at the world before he got abducted by aliens combine that with steven heroism and natural ability and stars could be quite the formidable fusion ,13,SULeaks
shadowinplainsight,in marco flashback to kindergarten she wearing a completely different necklace a peace sign ,1,StarVStheForcesofEvil
shadowinplainsight, andy flight from gem harvest is fantastic i love all of the music from beach city drift and know your fusion was packed with good stuff,3,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,if the fusion is at all feminine it will definitely give us some insight into how steven works,10,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,star vs the forces of evil remains to be seen but the two main characters are just as lovable a pair,3,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,it more just that its offspring is really cool looking,2,StarVStheForcesofEvil
shadowinplainsight,yeah but brick moon sounds lame,2,StarVStheForcesofEvil
shadowinplainsight,i thought it was fucking dope and i think it will be even better in actual concert you have gotta fucking give it to patrick voice in this,3,FallOutBoy
shadowinplainsight,i always just hear for as in he does not know what he here for,6,FallOutBoy
shadowinplainsight,easy it not what they came for,17,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,so what happens to steven in this situation ,3,SULeaks
shadowinplainsight,well i mean that is sort of what happened,11,SULeaks
shadowinplainsight,one may wonder what would happen if someone were to remove steven gem,5,SULeaks
shadowinplainsight,fuck yeah i had not even thought of that i hope we do not just get space ,20,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,because we have not had a new fusion all season and we are thirsty damn it ,6,SULeaks
shadowinplainsight,yeah i totally thought peri was male before i watched the show,9,SULeaks
shadowinplainsight,well i mean nobody gonna test that theory,1,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,his gem still was made on earth though,2,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,that the etymology of the word,15,SULeaks
shadowinplainsight,one of the amethysts has a square cut gem,4,SULeaks
shadowinplainsight,i would imagine regaining some of rose memories would be pretty terrible for steven especially with his recent existential issues,2,SULeaks
shadowinplainsight,lars is pretty angry at the world and steven could probably use a little rage besides simply not being alone may just make all the difference for steven,7,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight, blasphemy ,16,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,well i mean if stars is ambiguous like stevonnie it would give more insight into exactly how much of steven is his gem,1,SULeaks
shadowinplainsight,honestly i think they are just airing them all together,1,SULeaks
shadowinplainsight,i dunno i just do not think she close enough to the green end of the spectrum for turquoise http salmankhanbracelet com media catalog product cache 1 image 500x500 9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95 s t stone4 158 jpg which is never as dark or true blue as this gem face the darker webbing is also pretty iconic when people think of the stone so i will be surprised if they do not incorporate that moonstone http cdn gemrockauctions com uploads images 230000 234999 231535 231535 1311174028 jpg may be white but it adularesence can be deep to bright blue ,1,SULeaks

shadowinplainsight,or worse just one of them,8,SULeaks
shadowinplainsight,i would love to see lars face after a kiss of life xd,4,SULeaks
shadowinplainsight,maybe zoltron becomes a regular character in the future or the foxman from garnet universe or those pesky bees from future vision or maybe lars dad is just consistently around mourning i am 99 9 kidding,6,SULeaks
shadowinplainsight,moonstone is white and bright blue,1,SULeaks
shadowinplainsight, lars head ,4,SULeaks

shadowinplainsight,because we met lars even before we met the crystal gems he always been meant for big things,12,SULeaks
shadowinplainsight,thank you i was starting to think something was wrong with my eyes,1,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,aquamarine obviously,6,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,it also the first time he activates his gem so it a logical starting point,8,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,the cast is still working though and episodes are made so far in advance it probably is not for this season,2,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,the usa likes to forget that not everyone celebrates their holidays but it the last monday in may edit guys i was being tongue in cheek,48,SULeaks
shadowinplainsight,sardonyx seems to love herself the most,2,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,well most hour long tv is actually 45 minutes with commercials which is about right for 4 episodes maybe we will be lucky and get a fifth but i would be kinda shocked,1,stevenuniverse

shadowinplainsight,i have always been partial to topa2,2,SULeaks
shadowinplainsight, i do not know what topaz would do if she did not have topaz broke my heart in a good way oh god only one of them going to be shattered that your evil plan to hurt us is not it sugar ,11,SULeaks
shadowinplainsight,i mean we do not technically know how long rose was pregnant,6,SULeaks
shadowinplainsight,it so fucking exciting,10,FallOutBoy
shadowinplainsight,fair but my point was that he never been shown to esp style sense humans,1,SULeaks
shadowinplainsight,which is unfortunate cause i was excited for the official threads,3,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,hell maybe did,2,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,well i mean rose could have constructed a literal hard light construct ovum which was able to fuse with greg organic y sperm i mean stevonnie exists so some level of organic genetic interaction between humans and gems must be possible i guess it also possible that steven is genetically xo on a chormosomal level with the role of the second chromosome being filled by whatever kind of magic powers this kid in any case steven definitely has visual characteristics of both greg and rose ,1,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,because she wants to pass on her gem to the baby and she literally is her gem that would be like lapis existing independently of her gem in the mirror,3,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,yeah but it the literally alternate ending to lion 3 where steven watches the tape for steven instead of the tape for nora ,3,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight, the answers were inside of me the whole time ,7,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,i have a really unlikely which even i do not believe theory that rose may have gotten pregnant accidentally i mean when researching human anatomy at some point she may have actually decided to shapeshift the whole system not thinking conception was even possible,2,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,kid getting desperate ,2,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,alternate endings are never related to the plot the alternate ending was referring to nora ,6,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,my favourites moments on this show are always the ones that remind us that steven really is as much alien as he is human,9,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,it the one greg gave her the night the met ,4,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,i feel like it took entirely too long to reach this,20,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,fine then a war criminal ,9,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,so many of the crystal jamies are flawless,40,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,steven can sort of do this too in horror club when they are in the basement he says it close i can feel it it hurting and obsessed now this could also be his empathy powers but the only other time this sort of thing happens is with the cluster,24,SULeaks
shadowinplainsight,sadie asks steven if lars is in his body since steven is in lars we never really get confirmation on this so it sorta fuzzy on where lars went ,2,SULeaks
shadowinplainsight,i love these,3,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,until the choosening of course,2,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,i am i am sorry ,1,StarVStheForcesofEvil
shadowinplainsight,methinks it his cheek,1,StarVStheForcesofEvil
shadowinplainsight,what if he only half immune ,8,SULeaks
shadowinplainsight,actually they have all at least got their noses out,13,SULeaks
shadowinplainsight,i think lars has a lot of anger inside which is something steven lacks he might need this to do what he needs to,3,SULeaks
shadowinplainsight,nope even though he was literally beside a satellite,6,SULeaks
shadowinplainsight,maybe that why they cannot speak,0,SULeaks
shadowinplainsight,i mean that would kind have been foreshadowed in the new lars ,3,SULeaks
shadowinplainsight,nah he with his self proclaimed best friend ,1,SULeaks
shadowinplainsight,to be fair neither do we,5,SULeaks
shadowinplainsight,i just figured he won the election and is not campaigning right now,1,SULeaks
shadowinplainsight,i mean i would not have an issue with it if it came earlier in the series it just felt out of place after star growth also i am still trying to figure out that last scene,1,StarVStheForcesofEvil
shadowinplainsight,does light even have kneecaps ,1,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,i am really surprised that no one properly mentioned the banagic incident yet,1,StarVStheForcesofEvil
shadowinplainsight,steven could probably use some of lars generalized anger,1,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,maybe it means she a sociopath,3,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,i am still waiting on jamie blue agate,24,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,problem ,1,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,and stuck together is suspiciously reminiscent of alone together ,2,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,well i mean he tried be honest what would you have done in his situation ,21,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,since it steven and lars should not stars presumptive pronoun be he ,7,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight, i beg to differ https youtu be 5l2 vtxd9 s ,18,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,bonus points if lars gets no lasting character development,1,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,yeah and even then she had steven help sadie single handedly dispatched an invisible monster at least 5 times her size certified bad ass ,11,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,i just need him to fuse with steven it would be so good for him emotionally ,15,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,yeah but lars seemed pretty unphased by it so i guess that that was what i found odd,22,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,how have i never seen this before thank you ,4,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,well yeah but it still sounded off the lines themselves also were a bit cheese and needed to be delivered just right to not feel like that,14,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,i mean i guess i will take it anything for more sadie,1,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,i thought callison was a bit off in lion 4 mostly just in the desert scene i dunno for a show that consistently blows me away with its line delivery the scene with steven riding lion just sounded so awkward to me,17,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,i feel like i am my mom validates nearly every bit of so called filler ,12,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,well peridot has a cheater cameo,13,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,yeah but sadie a certified badass so she an unfair bar to hold up,37,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,i would love to see how the crew handled that,4,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,can we all please appreciate what good people the cool kids are also steven casually mentioning bodyjacking lars was a bit odd ,94,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,you will eat those words when stars is everyone favourite fusion ,93,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,i am foreseeing it being unintentional,110,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,overhype yourself for the lars development we are gonna be getting,15,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,31st,11,SULeaks
shadowinplainsight,keep in mind he could also just be passed out or something and steven is crying simply cause he could not save him from being abducted,62,SULeaks
shadowinplainsight,it the best thing starsgethype ,9,SULeaks
shadowinplainsight,agreed but imagine the meme possibilities ,1,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight, leak spoilers s people are theorizing that she can control how hard her light projection is ,1,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,i use it all the time but for some reason it just nauseates me every time i watch a video with it enabled,1,Showerthoughts
shadowinplainsight,but then the colours look all wonky ,1,Showerthoughts
shadowinplainsight,well we have yet to have a bomb without a song so that feels like a safe bet i also think we are due for another human fusion i would pick sadie but i think lars is more likely greg could also be a solid contender jamie would be fantastic but unlikely if not we will probably at least see the return of a fusion but i doubt we will get a new gem fusion it would be great if connie parents find out about stevonnie leak spoilers s i think it would be hilarious if some accidental fusing happens at the party in the good lars i would also be really happy of the voice from the end of the promo was topaz instead of aquamarine like everyone thinks i am also firmly on team lars nearly fucking dies i also predict that ronaldo will have a surprisingly likeable moment and that kevin or jane will make a cameo i also really want jamie and garnet to have a moment and lastly please sugar give me at least a little bit of mayor dewey ,1,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight, leak spoilers s steven somehow manages to fuse with topaz and all of the humans simultaneously s,1,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,i vote for the bottom of the page,14,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,i am of the belief that the whole dreamwalking possesion thing is unique to steven rose may have been capable of it but since gems do not need to sleep she may never have discovered it,8,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,in steven dream when we get that shot of the hibiscus flowers,3,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,i will honestly be so surprised if she alive ,6,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,we can hope,5,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,well there was the cfob mixtape,2,FallOutBoy
shadowinplainsight,i feel like he would have walked sadie home after the party which we do not see in the promo,3,SULeaks
shadowinplainsight,if memory serves there a leaked storyboard that supports this do not ask me to find it though,10,SULeaks
shadowinplainsight,i always assume i am the only canadian around we have though i know we seem to hide everywhere,2,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,i headcanon that her eyes are blue under that visor ,2,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,i think they are referring to stevonnie,2,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,i love this episode so much abs i feel like it one of the most underrated it one of the ones i point to when asked why i think steven should be peridot first fusion,3,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,and pearl more a han solo type ,7,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,gems are totally capable of fusing with humans they have just never been on a similar enough level for it to work before steven and connie greg did say he and rose never tried again and they were not exactly in sync that first time,7,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,oh pretty please,5,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,this is sort of tangential but a couple of years ago i had a ton of fun with the community charity challenge i would love if we could do something like that,1,StarVStheForcesofEvil
shadowinplainsight,when has he before this ,4,SULeaks
shadowinplainsight,right if he were just the weird kid that played the keytar he would probably have a whole fanbase that loved when he shows up ,2,StarVStheForcesofEvil
shadowinplainsight,he did not get memory wiped he said in the q as that he remembers everything but like how you remember a dream probably best for his sanity honestly,2,StarVStheForcesofEvil
shadowinplainsight,plot wise they are not too bad but i would still avoid them,1,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,also i have not looked at leaks this is speculation there a pretty good chance we may see someone poofed or something this bomb,1,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,which is easy enough to fight if you keep throwing lawyers and court fees at it,8,todayilearned
shadowinplainsight,no but you should be punished if you should be punished a 125 fine can break you if you live paycheque to paycheque but why should the rich even pay attention to the speed limit ,17,todayilearned
shadowinplainsight,you are missing the obviously superior ship of jackiextad,3,StarVStheForcesofEvil

shadowinplainsight,i just figured the destabilizers were specifically for taking down fusions since they separate into their component gems rather than poof jasper likely had one because there was a risk of encountering one on earth knowing the cg affinity for fusion but i do not think they would be all that needed in a normal homeworld setting,1,stevenuniverse

shadowinplainsight,also the gem lizard that lion was eating in lion 2 the movie ,1,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,this has probably been mentioned before but the diamond song was supposed to be a sort of factory reset for the gems but without pink diamond it went wrong and caused the corruption ergo rose quartz is responsible for the corruption,64,stevenuniverse

shadowinplainsight,i wrote this for an earlier thread but it relevant if anyone going to get shattered i am reluctantly calling peridot it not just us who love her lapis is also quite fond of her and as we all know lapis is not allowed to be happy also her speech at the end of earthlings felt very much like the closing of her arc to me obviously she still has personal discovery to do and i would love to see that but her initial arc has been concluded additionally she did call yellow diamond a clod right to her face and that will probably have some repercussions thanks to kindergarten kid we can assume anything that takes out peri will be pretty intense also i am pretty sure she was the first one to mention being shattered she brings it up more than anyone else the most cruel twist of all we may never know where she would put the star ,12,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,it probably the estelle part of her,11,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,no no rose quartz has become an expletive on homeworld ,71,stevenuniverse

shadowinplainsight,it not just us who love her lapis is also quite fond of her and as we all know lapis is not allowed to be happy also her speech at the end of earthlings felt very much like the closing of her arc to me obviously she still has personal discovery to do and i would love to see that but her initial arc has been concluded additionally she did call yellow diamond a clod right to her face and that will probably have some repercussions thanks to kindergarten kid we can assume anything that takes out peri will be pretty intense also i am pretty sure she the first one to mention being shattered she brings it up more than anyone else the most cruel twist of all we may never know where she would put the star ,1,stevenuniverse

shadowinplainsight,that one is excellent,3,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,how could we have been so blind ,1,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,oh and this one time a lady came in with a prescription on legit prescription paper from her qigong guy for six citrine stones she was supposed to bury in a protective hemi circle around her front door,3,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,sure i am a well of knowledge in this niche what do you wanna hear about as a starter the greeks used to believe amethyst would stop you from getting drunk the word itself comes from the greek amethustos which means not intoxicated they actually carved goblets out of the stuff for this reason nowadays people use it to get over alcoholism and other addictions,3,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,same i mean i know it nonsensical but i still think it fascinating when people at work ask me if i believe in crystal magic i say well i believe putting faith in something is a very powerful thing ,3,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,there a bunch of different ways it depends on the stone and on the hippie they usually utilize the four classical elements though you can pass your crystal quickly through flame smudge it with white sage hold it in a river place it in a flower pot leave it in the rain run it under the faucet bury it for a day use incense leave it in direct sun or moonlight or soak it in ideally the ocean but also salty water there are also more personal methods of cleansing such as holding it to your heart while inhaling and then exhaling on it or visualizing a column of light purifying the stone some people use sound like chimes and others believe leaving a stone under a glass pyramid for a few days will neutralize any and all negative energies quartz clusters are also great for cleansing so it about as standardized as you would expect sometimes i think about how useless all this knowledge will be when i do not work here anymore ,3,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,that legit something i would tell a customer it the properties of a chrysanthemum stone if you are interested p the difference is they act as if i have just said something extremely profound,2,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,well some people believe opals are bad luck if they are not your birthstone but that was just a rumor started by the de beers diamond family also if you will entertain my hippie bullshit for a bit stones like quartzes and obsidian that are supposed to absorb negative energy can also emit it if not cleansed from time to time moldavite also known to exacerbate existing anxieties on its own so you are supposed to harmonize it with something ,2,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,well if you are on your proper path the future will unfold exactly as it should,8,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,actually we sell jet at my jewellery store which is basically coal supposedly it purifying and protective i basically make vague statements for a living,9,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,well yeah but crewniverse had confirmed they use it for inspiration or rather they come up with personalities first and then find gems that supposedly match them,11,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight, can be used to help one quit smoking i now desperately want a fan comic of peri pestering bad pearl to quit ,17,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight, it true that it will never be clear https www mineralauctions com auctions premium 100 reserve gemstone consignment and kosnar auction ends february 21st 836 rose quartz 36416 html but it markedly more transparent than most,2,Gemology

shadowinplainsight, so many birthdays was about the gems birthdays not steven still now that i think about it he might have had a birthday we did not see based on beachapalooza and connie comment about not needing glasses for a year,2,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,she the same size actually she just looks small compared to rose ,6,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight, steven and lars get to hang out with the cool kids in town but their teenage shenanigans get them into deadly magical trouble also jenny talks about homework the cool kids are teenagers,4,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,and parenthood,11,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,that a really valid assumption which i had not thought of before i am still firmly on the one night stand side mostly because of occam razor but i would not be surprised if you were correct,3,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,you also see they outline her knees under her dress a few times,3,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,you could totally be right though sour cream could not have been born before 1994 if steven was born in 2000 i think most people assume it to be a one night stand because of marty attitude towards women you want one huge woman when you could have multiple smaller ones now he could still have come around once he found out he was a father which could be why amethyst familiar with him still i would not say she was surprised they were no longer together she asks do you ever hear from ol farty marty ,6,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,beards age people as do receding hairlines,21,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,you are right it never explicitly stated although it seems heavily implied that it was a one night stand most fans i have seen assume sour cream was conceived in the back of greg van amethyst was probably aware of marty because of childcare and support arrangements ,5,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,well he was 22 when he met rose sour cream was born a year later and he at most 5 years older than steven so that puts greg in his early to mid forties,11,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,he says he met the gems when he was 22 we also know sour cream was born roughly 10 months later if we assume steven was born in 2000 as the show started in 2013 when he was 13 and that at most sour cream is 5 years older than steven then that gives us 1994 for when greg met rose ,5,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,i love everything about this blog,1,stevenuniverse

shadowinplainsight,well and fusion,1,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,also amethyst is south korean and lars is chinese charlyne yi voice of the rubies is of rather mixed ethnicity yet often gets referred to as asian edit added apostrophes,8,stevenuniverse

shadowinplainsight,or another gem lapisfusionconfirmed,10,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,i do not think we are done with amethyst insecurities if anything i am all but sure we will see her shapeshifting abilities come into play at some point,4,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,it literally the only reason i come here anymore,5,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,this is made even better by the fact that shelby rabara teaches tap in real life she actually the one who provided the tap dance sound effects for mr greg ,2,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,peridot says lapis lazulis are partial to water so it definitely not something she realized later on,10,stevenuniverse

shadowinplainsight,greg literally calls lapis and peridot alien refugees from space in this episode,17,stevenuniverse

shadowinplainsight,rose quartz is absolutely found naturally and rather commonly too there are deposits found all over the world,3,stevenuniverse
shadowinplainsight,she made her first appearance in a cape,12,stevenuniverse
