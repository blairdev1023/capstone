forever_atone, removal of libstagefright with the android platform becoming more mature regarding audio video with the mediacodec implementation it was time to say goodbye to libstagefright the old implementation for audio and video is called libstagefright and has been in the media several times this year this method has become very outdated and the implementation wasn t the best as such we have removed the support for this and will fully focus on mediacodec this means that for certain devices this will be a step back for kodi usage or perhaps kodi might even become unusable if they have firmware which doesn t make proper use mediacodec we re sorry that this is happening but keeping support for libstagefright is hurting further progress stability and puts a too large support burden on the our android developer so we hope you will all understand this decision i wonder what this means for fire tv ,4,xbmc
