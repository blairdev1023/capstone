GI_X_JACK,not even helmets shit not even a hat they are outdoors where is their cover i wanna speak to their nco about this ,1,WTF
GI_X_JACK,yes an no wwii was the beginning of the end of segregation most anti racialist propaganda and veteran gis would kick start the civil rights movement at the end of the war the army de segregated in 1948 the pentagon was desegregated from its inception by roosevelt himself and never re segregated de segregation was a slow painful process the us did not magically become anti racialist in wwii and then re racialize afterwards on the eve of ww2 the klan was 1 million strong boasted membership in all 48 states among them the elites of society governors senators mayors police chiefs it was not just a hate organization it was also functioned as a civic organization like the masons of knights of columbus a social club for the powerful after ww2 the kkk was a shade of its former self eventually rising to 60 000 members in the 1960s and while it performed pretty a horrifying campaign of terrorism it was more a desperation act than a firm grasp of enshrined power it never really officially ended it just got pushed to the fringe where it is still slowly fading away so your statement is somewhat disingenuous ,1,history
GI_X_JACK,it is but when you consider the times they told the message the got the point across people these days especially the status conscious middle class and pretenders are very conscious about how they sound and politeness it also leads to the false expectation that if you are polite your message must be received positively and opinion valued even if terrible the message spoke to an audience that was still convinced of scientific racism and segregation was the de facto rule of law ,1,history
GI_X_JACK,except the incumbat is a dickhead and corrupt as fuck and people are starting to really hate him and he a giant liability right now jim johnson is what new jersey looks like ,1,newjersey
GI_X_JACK, i do not see that as a step back for someone who basically just ran his first campaign with no backing from anyone in power and finished a strong second exactly he ran a good campaign with little got double digits and name recognition he can easily turn into a real race against an unpopular politician ,1,newjersey
GI_X_JACK,menedez is a scumbag but so is frelinghuysen either way i am glad to see johnson take it in stride he did good with a double digit finish and i think he definitely has a future ,1,newjersey
GI_X_JACK,daily reminder celebrities are scumbags among other things rapists pedophiles and general misogynists its not a few bad apples the entire mainstream media revolves around catering to this and apologizing for this,6,bestof
GI_X_JACK,i would be here forever explaining this but new jersey always had the reputation of the mississippi of the north and the last so called free state to outlaw slavery the race divide in new jersey has always been glaring from mostly black cities like newark to the lilly jewish white suburbs also prejudice in nyc is dependant on how much money you have working class and poor neighbourhoods are broken down by race and had lines previously enforced by violence the rich freely intermingle but the poor do not if you are one of the races that does manual labor its a not so nice town nyc is the most conservative large city there is it is built on power derived from wealth and enforced with violence new jersey is even more conservative who else elected chris christie growing up in this state the racial tension was so thick you could cut it with a knife rich white suburbs on one side and poor black on the other https en wikipedia org wiki 1967 plainfield riots https en wikipedia org wiki 1967 newark riots the national guard was called everyone i ever met that was there say the official reports lie and the body counts where in the hundreds but the police did not report kills and just dumped bodies in the river ,1,newjersey
GI_X_JACK, well no guns kill far more people than lightning does what is statistically negligent are mass shootings which pale in comparison to the massive cost of other gun deaths including suicides suicide never comes up in a gun debate ever which was my point neither do any of the social issues which causes people to pull the trigger in the first place liberals have fewer of those not none but fewer not quite they just think they do liberals are not nearly as smart as they think they are education and arrogance yes intelligence no ,1,worldnews
GI_X_JACK, we both know i am not talking about monarchists and feudalists in that case the world is run by classical liberals for the most part or today conservatives the world is not run by socialists the current status quo is globalism the major news outlets most of the last few presidents and many of the leaders in our largest corporations are globalist all still conservatives by any measure of the word globalism for most intents and purposes is a meaningless buzzword the world always worked like this to some extent but before the 1800s was limited by geography and technology globalism as we know it is in fact a machination of the 1980s republican party which are very much conservative it was the brain child of reagan continued by hw bush and signed by southern democrat bill clinton income inequality is not a bad thing yes it is it disenfranchises the poor from society creates a second under society that often has problem and disputes rule of law because you need to have money to make money it affords those at the bottom less a chance to earn more the best part of a free market you can be for a free market or against globalism you cannot be both at the same time global capitalism is the end result of large companies demanding a larger market for their goods it is the natural extension of the free market as trade restrictions are just that interference with the market private property is not exclusive to the right the concept that private property is an absolute right is that of classical liberalism alone nothing else the big problem with liberalism ie free market capitalism is that theory never panned out to reality a good example is health insurance in the usa we have better treatment for rare and expensive diseases everything else we are worse including preventive care because there is less profit in it we also pay far more for the same services than countries with single payer health care even though americans tend to make more the dollar in the us seems not to go nearly as far the other problem with the free market is that its inherently unstable here today gone tomorrow this is hard on skilled workers who spend an entire career learning a specialized trade who simply cannot take their experience and talents to another field if the field shrinks there is also no mechanism to prevent panics or a handful of irrational actors from crashing the entire system this gets brought up because it happens occasionally the move away from classical liberalism was a correction to real world failures your concept of conservative is a nebulous concept that is not consistent or solid actual conservatives many of which are globalists run the world ,5,worldnews
GI_X_JACK, and no i am not being facetious it verifiably true no its not you misrepresented the study conservatives are less interested than liberals in viewing novel scientific data no its just that liberals are more interested in scientific data not that liberal viewpoints are more in tune with rational analysis they are just better presenting themselves ability to point to scientific data does not automatically mean one can interpret it correctly the gun control debate is relatively jarring a debate does not go by without school shooters employees and crazies shooting random victims this is a statistically negligent cause of death for americans next to terrorism and lightning strikes the people who do tend to base their politics on reality tend to be more intelligent that my point those people are so far and few between they are not even worth discussing conservatives are more likely to buy into counter factual belief systems like religion or tribal politics not quite they are protecting their money their status and their power or their delusion of such ,0,worldnews
GI_X_JACK,damn where do i find start trek nerds this cute,1,justlegbeardthings
GI_X_JACK,because political opinions are rarely the work of carefully researched facts even if you try the stakes are so great that great efforts are made to lie and distort the truth by planting false information even if you try to be rational the system goes to great lengths to either exclude you or force you to pick a side and stick with it even still most people are introduced to politics not from some altruistic aim but from a highly partisan source looking to create a voting machine looking for people vulnerabilities to ply them into supporting them emotions generally trump facts because its easier to keep people loyal if they do not think there is rarely a good logical choice the amount of factoids that deviate from observed truth is so great that to take a side demands you swallow an uncomfortable amount of lies for expediency the lesser of two evils narrative does not bode well so if you take a side its all in or all out you cannot judge intelligence based on political opinion because political opinions are rarely informed and rarely based on intellectual reasoning ,-2,worldnews
GI_X_JACK,that really depends on what you considered the right unless you literally mean monarchists and feudalists the answer is no we still have private property large amounts of income inequality no public option healthcare and lots and lots of states who religious liberty is to deny service and other liberty to women and gender sexual minorities because god says so the war on drugs still drags on and being pro union pro labor is even more of a taboo than it was 30 years ago since nixon the two democratic presidents where very much pro business centrists if on what measure are conservatives not the status quo in fact the definition of status quo is being conservative the only thing that conservatives generally get called out for is violating their own degeneracy rules ,1,worldnews

GI_X_JACK,you have really got to be kidding me his views are shockingly mainstream always have been and the only thing diffrence is his less eloquent way of presenting himself and he just more cringeworthy so you just randomly think in 2017 a site like youtube exists in this weird online world that does not exist in real life are you kidding me this is no hidden back corner of the internet not the least its one of the largest websites owned by one of the largest internet corporations it is a household name if you think these views are less common in real life you are in serious denial these people elected trump and before him w before him h w reagan and nixon the conservative revolution of 1994 its follow on tea party 2 and a half decades later rush limbaugh newt gingrich and a whole slew of other media personalities and politicians many who were very successful you repeat his own narrative if the post 80s bullshit narrative of newt gingrich that they are somehow rebelling against something or outsiders fighting against some feminist mainstream but that is a lie they are the mainstream and this is very common in fact majority opinion try going outside sometime ,1,justneckbeardthings
GI_X_JACK,you cannot be a traditionalist in most cultures without being sexist you just found the least likeable sexists to point out most sexist or is it you feel more comfortable pointing out sexism when you already do not like what hes about for other reasons i have yet to see anyone call out sexism when it inconvenienced them and thats why it will always be an issue the man is a product of his environment and worships not a new or foreign idea but that of what is in his direct immediate very mainstream society past that existed within his lifetime ,1,justneckbeardthings

GI_X_JACK, so what if the gas tax was lower in surrounding states it was the only inexpensive thing here they have more money to fix infrastructure and you obviously do not understand the history of the minimum wage because if you did you would realize that after inflation it still twice as high as it was at its inception min wage does not cover basic cost of living in nj end of story everything else is not relevant people should be paid what they are worth not what you think they need to survive you accuse me of assigning an arbitrary value to the worth of someone labor and then proceed to assign an arbitrary value to the worth of someone labor wages cannot infinitely rise just because cost of living goes up nowhere in the world does that logic work in most other successful societies it does if it does not society breaks if the wages do not rise to meet cost of living the system is inherently broken think about it this way wages are a liquid representation of economic contribution of goods and services a worker performs this is a better way to trade goods and services than barter because its easier to more skilled precision oriented tasks that society as a whole needs rather than every individual if what we can agree is gainful employment is not sufficient to provide necessary goods and services then that system is simply not working anything further to the matter is simply word games i would rather pay a mcdonalds employee 20 and hour because he will re contribute that back to society more than cutting taxes the fact that the global class of property owners live in north new jersey does not help the average new jersian because none of their money will go to them and they drive up prices and dislocate communities ,2,newjersey

GI_X_JACK, and yet it does not affect nearly as many people as get pushed out of the state due to cost of living concerns the only way to fix that is to increase wages there is no way around that i am not even sure it affects people as much as dui duis actually affect people i am not for legalizing driving under the influence intoxicated drivers kill lots of people new jersey roads are especially dangerous even sober traffic accidents is one of the big killers of americans but yes the war on drugs affects a lot of people its responsible for giving the us the largest prison population in the world even more chilling is 2nd order and 3rd order effects from criminalization of drugs people no longer trust the cops and become accustomed to dealing with criminal gangs http norml org pdf files state arrests 2004 norml nj marijuana arrests pdf 20 000 people get arrested for pot a year in new jersey that is a big thing thats 50 lives being ruined every day for what that does not include fathers that can no longer provide for children families disrupted and the teriary effects that the rest of us must compensate for the disturbances in our lives as well the war on drugs is really really really big it effects a lot of people and is responsible for helping turn places like newark and camden into shitholes you would think with the absurd taxes levied against us the state could find the money to do all this shit already strawman the gas tax was far lower than surrounding states it now matches you have no idea how economics works if you think continually forcing wage hikes is going to help anyone in the long term i would say you as well the min wage has been stagnant for a very long time and did not keep up with cost of living 15 is reasonable i am following examples of the most successful economies you are following what tends to be labelled banana republics the business environment in nj is utter bullshit there is no economic reason to stay here and hiking taxes and wages is going to provide even fewer reasons you will not see companies spring up in low taxes low services states ever where are they going ,2,newjersey
GI_X_JACK, and i am not sure why you are so keen on marijuana reform to the point that it your 1 issue but for me it like four or five rungs down the ladder because people are actually being shot arrested and thrown in jail it helps gangs rule the streets its a giant issue because it affects people in big ways it is the most arrested drug in the war on drugs which is the biggest impetus for ripping up american freedoms in history its a life or death issue he finally completely lost it at the gas tax hike i support the gas tax hike it puts new jersey on par with neighboring states the gas tax is to discourage consumption and repair infrastructure our roads are shit a train just crashed into hoboken killing 3 people and injuring around 100 this could have been prevented with safey controls the federal government demanded but nj put off because we could not afford it this state is not full of poor people he did a lot to keep nj affordable he did not keep nj affordable for anyone who actually in threat of being thrown out on the street he made it affordable as in better place for the rich to buy mansions edit the only way you are going to do that is hike the min wage to a living wage at the same time adding jobs which are now paying more this is tough and you have to create the right circumstances taking down public sector unions is not going to do this its going to depress wages across the board ,2,newjersey
GI_X_JACK,the two are unrelated gas tax exists to discourage consumption and if you can adjust it frequently you can use it to stabilize the cost of fuel it also exists to fund infrastructure at least in theory vehicles that use more gas do more damage to the roads inheritance tax should be 75 generational wealth causes tyranny take that money and fund job training everyone should have to work for their money,2,newjersey

GI_X_JACK,because they are just keeping up with the cost of living in nj new jersey is expensive and you need to pay public servants enough to live here a big problem in nj is income inequality the way this is bad is because it plays some silly numbers games with cost of living it decreases the amount of product while raising the price the rich spend a mere fraction of their wealthy on the economy as do the middle class also a goods and services corporation with ten million dollars will dump more of that back into the economy than either a financial corporation or person with that money usually these economies look good on paper a financial corporation can move a bunch of big numbers around in a bank account all day long and that counts towards the gdp while no goods or services have been produced because there are less goods and services prices remain high the reason is they are producing more goods or services to go around or exporting them and giving the money to go to workers right now places like morris county are just places for rich ceos and global property owners to dump their loot and build their mansions no place ever on earth do these places ever succeed the rich have large amounts of money on paper but there is little goods and services so the real wealth is low already the price of rent is increasing because of international businessmen and wallstreet buying up 3rd apartments it makes things unaffordable for everyone else more taxes are not always justified no dumping tax money into infrastructure will pay for itself like any corporation you need to pay money to make money companies go into debt all the time to build infrastructure because that infrastructure is needed to make product to sell no ceo ever would pay a dividend to ignore an opportunity to grow it takes money to make money if there is an issue with corruption that also needs to be addressed but its a separate issue increasing the tax base along with higher wages is better for the state an economy based on a strong well motivated middle class of skilled labor and professionals ,2,newjersey

GI_X_JACK,for me he speaks on two really important issues legalization of cannabis and criminal justice reform which are honestly one and the same the war on drugs is probably one of the biggest issues that never gets talked about legalizing cannabis is not about cannabis its about a substance which is so common and often ignored except used as a means for abritrary arrest the war on drugs has been nothing more than a power grab of law enforcement and a backdoor to the 4th amendment 6th amendment and 8th amendment it has militarized the police made us an occupied territory of our own government it has degraded the trust we have in law enforcement and their ability to protect us as a result someone looking to make new jersey less of a police state has my vote that is one thing for once ever that the democrats in new jersey are united behind so they have my vote until that changes or this no longer becomes an issue the war on drugs is not a small issue either it is responsible for the lion share of arrests in this country as a whole and it is responsible for giving us the highest incarceration rate in the world period no exceptions and i am not convinced he has any cogent plan for reducing cost of living his infrastructure plan will create jobs and attract industry i would rather have a state who economy that depends on taxing job producing commercial and industrial establishments than taxing the ultra rich for property and income tax in the big picture it works better for the working class and will in fact make new jersey more livable ,6,newjersey

GI_X_JACK, to clarify a bit on what i said my intent was to say that the leisure class in europe funded the people whose thinking created the scientific method and the philosophical milieu that was the enlightenment that is somewhat of a misnomer scientific expansion was driven mostly for economic gain not as a gentlemanly pursuit but in search of new products to sell you also missed how the economic reality of serfs and slaves hampers the development of engineering because why bother with automated machinery when you have slaves to do the work a better side by side comparison would be the northern half of the united states vs the southern half in the early 19th century the northern half with free labor quickly developed machinery on the backs of scientific discoveries and machining them into engineered solutions the south remained unchanged as the agrarian planter class had no reason to automate social liberalism and scientific discovery go hand in hand not the other way around social conservatism promotes scientific and engineering stagnation ,2,history
GI_X_JACK,i am going to dispute the existence of a leisure class produced the scientific revolution reason the dates do not line up it also does not explain science and technology in the rest of the world it also does not explain explosion of science that only really happened after the enlightenment most modern science starts around that time the 1800s it also does not explain how the romans and greeks where great scientists and engineers had great empires and no stirrup western intellectualism is based on the renaissance which draws from classical sources ie the greeks and romans again no stirrups who main soliders where heavy infantry and cavalry where auxiliary troops you also do not account for the time where armored cavalry dominated europe was mostly the dark ages and they became increasingly less significant as technology specifically firearms technology shifted the balance of power away from them you also miss that out of what is now known as great scientists few if any where nobility and few if any where conservative sir issac newton is a notable exception not the rule you also miss that most of modern science were the west finally re attains the level of technology it had in the roman empire ie the 19th century was only after liberalism and it was almost without exception funded and financed by burhgers and burhger institutions and not nobles it was only after the end of nobility and sefdom did the west really attain complete dominance over the world under feudalism europe was fairly weak ,5,history

GI_X_JACK,i think simply he was a communist and killed the leader of the capitalist world because the point of communism is getting rid of capitalism sometimes violently would do there is no real need to look further into it it was a political assassination plain and simple not an iconoclast not crazy simply put a political assassination of the president of the united states ,2,history
GI_X_JACK,because he killed the leader of the most powerful nation on earth at the height of her power the us had not seriously escalated viet nam yet and to the american public it was perceived invincible the president the leader of this nation also extended this invincibility by virtue that he must have the best men protecting him that said power is an illusion it was inconceivable such a powerful man could just be gunned down no one would dare kill the president right he must be protected by security as invincible as the us and nato itself right power you see is an illusion one man a known communist discovered that if you merely cut through the illusion you could assassinate the leader of the capitalist world just like that and he would die like any other man the illusion falls people scramble to keep up the illusion if the usa is the most powerful nation on earth an equally as powerful force most have existed to challenge it the problem is that was an illusion not a lie but an illusion that illusion protected the president crazy i would not say that perhaps desperate and political motivated a communist shooting a capitalist leader especially at the height of the cold war thats politically motivated and somewhat out of step with the world he cut through the illusion of power edit and if a communist where to kill the leader of the capitalist world it must be the best most powerful communist ever or in a conspiracy with other communists but no a single communist acting on his own ,2,history

GI_X_JACK,the punk suffix in punk has no dirrect correlation to punk rock but a theoretical what is the punk rock equiv of 2020s 2050s very much similar to the term astro naut who coined the term in the 1870s and started nautical comparisons to space travel space ships etc when real space travel started the science fiction terms stuck all the punk subgenres are a play on cyberpunk biopunk is the only one that has any real merit steampunk is a joke baseless jerking off to victorian era rubbish cyberpunk is like biopunk because it looks at real issues related to technology albeit often exaggerated the cyberpunk concept of 15 min into the future still applies to biopunk steampunk dieselpunk et al are a debased fantasy that ignore some of the more gritty realities of the late 19th early 20th century its low fantasy for reactionaries who want to relive the glory days at the exact height of western imperial power without having to deal with any of the underlying social issues that plauged that era compare this to cyberpunk which directly addresses the underclass of the digital age and biopunk that does the same cyberpunk is noir for a new age because 1920s chicago is long gone ,2,Cyberpunk
GI_X_JACK,for all intents and purposes they are the same genre with bio tech replacing information systems in practice there is a distinction and today the biopunk label becomes a little more palatable because information systems and computers are entirely ubiquitous and biotech is new and exciting the irl bio hackers are basicly high tech piercers while bio punk as a genre spins a scary future of the dystopian possibilities mirroring an ever growing field of bio tech its very much as relevant today as cyberpunk explored today cyber problems 30 years ago in reality many classic cyberpunk stories are actually biopunk blade runner is biopunk computers are not a critical element and surprisingly missing computers an information systems are necessary to design biotech biotech is a natural evolution of computer interfaces ghost in the shell qualifies as both as do any other story where cyberborgs show up they focus on the same set of issues feature the same type of characters exist in the same worlds its really not a distinct genre ,1,Cyberpunk

GI_X_JACK,technically the distinction is that cyberpunk is where information systems are a center point of the story and bio punk is where bio tech are central to the story in practice it gets really murky as the two often overlap as you need advanced computers to design manufacture and operate bio tech a computer needs to interface with a human somehow and what better way than implants of some sort oh and it gets really hard to write about information systems and make it relatable especially to the pre information age audiences that typically received these stories bladerunner was a pure bio punk story as there where very little computers in the film surprisingly they were not central to the plot ,1,Cyberpunk

GI_X_JACK,the tooling on arch is fantastic pacman is an excellent package manager with a lot of really great tools the aur is great as well mkinitcpio is a real pleasure to work with as well when arch had its own initscripts they were really easy and fun everything is based on bash and if you know and like bash arch rocks for example if i am looking for obscure software that typically does not ship with distros because its too niche you can most of the time find it in aur if its not writing pkgbuilds is easy its fill out the form essentially then you can contribute back by uploading it to aur every last piece of software i use including firefox plugins are install and managed by pacman libalpm also mkinitcpio is a really powerful tool and there are some interesting hacks you take do with the initial ram disk in arch some people have a full rescue environment as an initcpio img i wrote a boot and nuke script that is based on an initcpio hook i wrote using tools native to base initcpio it gets wrapped in an initcpio profile and finally high level tooling to make boot and nuke usb sticks or wipe your machine https aur archlinux org packages ninjaos bootandnuke one day i will port that to debian and rh ,1,linux
GI_X_JACK, yes but it a binary package distro with systemd there nothing really special about that yes there is nothing special about it thats the entire point of arch its as vanilla as possible and tries to keep the upstream devs vision as true as possible arch is for expert desktops and experimenting with new software arch does not ship with a gui so its entirely agnostic to desktop environments but it supports over 6 des there are package groups for major des so you can easily install the environment you want as many as you want with other distros you have to uninstall the desktop it comes with and then re install another desktops arch saves you half the trouble with that,1,linux

GI_X_JACK,from my own research cyberpunk either referred to a section of or the whole of the hacker scene in the late 80s early 1990s what gave cyberpunk as a subculture some real teeth is that computers where real and people really where in a sense digital rebels the term cyberpunk comes from literary science fiction the term astronaut comes from early space fiction jules vern it kinda seems really strange but the same time of people that hack computers are the same type of people that like science fiction and anime if you are looking for cyberpunk in movies and stories to be literally real you would not understand the effect art has on real life and vice versa if you expect the emotions and concepts to translate as allegories and the stories to use exaggerations to make a point you will see what makes science fiction a powerful genre the matrix in particular stands out because vernacular used in that movie is rife across the hacker scene and digital underground gibson has had his fair share of references or not you can go re watch old episodes of max headroom and between the 80s cheese you can see some real world technique and still applicable social commentary advertisements kill wars are staged you can use a camera to capture key strokes and then use a computer generate the most likely matches we are in some sense already living 15 min into the future cyberpunk authors envisaged and its not good dystopian science fiction is a dire warning social critique where steampunk fails is they are looking towards is an alternate reality instead of looking to the future its looking towards the past steampunk does not send a message like cyberpunk does its not an allegory there will never be a real steampunk it was born a reactionary circlejerk about how great the victorian era was without telling stories of its woes cyberpunk as a genre of exploring 15 min into the future is a dead idea cyberpunk today is living 15 min into that painful future and looking back if you need something thats more exciting today biopunk is still 15min in the future it seems to be increasingly relevant and a hot topic as well edit sauce on real cyberpunks http phrack org issues 36 9 html please note the source is phrack a very respected hacking rag also check the date their scene is long dead an buried ,0,Cyberpunk

GI_X_JACK,the cultural extent of hardcore punk is very much rooted in the times which it appeared no future and celebrating self destruction of body and mind that was not all of punk sure there were plenty of bands that where all doom and gloom but posi core was a thing many bands sought constructive solutions albeit even if they were violent also remember the term straight edge was coined by minor threat minor threat was very much against the destruction of either mind or body and later bands that followed in the sxe subgenre where very militantly so hardcore punk was violent and when hardcore hardcore separated out in the late 80s early 90s even more so 1st wave hardcore added a lot it was very much a turning point for rock n roll if you really want to understand how and why hc punk developed you need to look at the social and political history of the us and england in the 80s and 90s there becomes a giant misnomer of what punk celebrated and what it merely pointed out and what it satired and complained about ,2,history

GI_X_JACK, anyway you are dismissing the importance of 77 punk which moma called the single most important artistic movement in terms of influence of the late 20th century if you are citing the museum of modern art as an authority on punk rock then you do not have the slightest clue what your talking about punk did not happen in the moma it was not for people interested in the moma the sex pistols you can dissect this anyway you want they were a boyband and among fans of the genre their songs rarely make playlists hardly a defining punk band and little influence on punk hardcore did not have that same diversity of sound umm bullshit discharge https www youtube com watch v 4pfiljl6 hi minor threat https www youtube com watch v svct941jsxg dead kennedys https www youtube com watch v pscmriazhwk murphys law https www youtube com watch v 3 xjrlrnfus cock sparrer https www youtube com watch v zkdfjxxvfrk the influence of 77 punk lead not just to hardcore but new wave alternative indie a lot of 80s pop and much more again you are giving 77 credit for hardcore achievements new wave and the rest of post punk might come from 77 but indie and alternative come from hardcore it sounds wierd but then you gotta realize the first emo now what you would call indie band was fugazi which was ian mckay of minor threat motorhead and just about every 80s and onward metal band had at least hardcore influence either directly in crossover thrash or indirectly the very ethos of 77 punk meant that ramones talking heads and blondie could all come from the same place because it was about art about expression being taken from what they saw as the elite and being given to the people as it were can you cite them actually having an ethos also you missed out jello biafra who changed the course of his entire life after a ramones concert where he also met ian mackaye in i think 1978 dead kennedys and minor threat are both hardcore bands this is where the ethos part comes from they are reflecting back on what made their experiences in the 70s fun not what their direct influences believed in all politics in punk from boneheads to socialists and all shades in between comes from hardcore just about all social consciousness associated with punk comes from hardcore i have seen nothing to say that there was any real social consciousness in 77 music but thanks for pointing out what jello and ian took out of it and more specifically what they brought to hardcore music when they started playing ,1,history

GI_X_JACK,the ethos of democratizing art was actually hardcore it was one of the big things minor threat frontman ian mckay was about local shows community taking the rock stars off pedestals in fact just about all of the ethos of being a punk rocker is first wave hardcore at least technically most of it is lessons learned from the 77 era 1st wave hardcore bands almost by rule met each other hanging out in punk shows in the 70s 77 punk was about nothing that was the point it was about absolutely nothing the sex pistols where a commericial knock off and aimless shock art by producer macolm mclaren they were hardly democratic he was trying to sell clothes,-2,history
GI_X_JACK,if you are talking about punk from the 77 era the ramones dead boys and clash are probably better examples if you need some english bands the damned vibrators and the adicts are better examples the ramones took their look from 50s greasers and they were just a 50s pop act done extremely trashy much of the early nyc scene was just lo fi pop and not really separated from what would be later new wave post punk fear are essentially beatnicks 20 years later you could easily fit fear two albums into the second half of ham on rye by charles bukowski just 35 years prior the dead boys where more of what you think of the out of control rock band with a sleazy vibe the sex pistols are a boyband put together by a clothing designer to sell clothes malcom mclaren was a situationist so he brought situationist ism into the band i do not think anyone in the band understood it or cared about it i am sure mclaren liked dadaism i am not sure anyone else in punk cared the least neither the sex pistols or the clash are good examples of punk bands then we get to the concept that 77 punk is not what broke the mold and is not what gets people so worked up when the term punk rock is issued 77 punk lasted about 7 8 years and died quietly by the time 1980 rolled around hc punk is for all intents and purposes the punk rock people care about ,3,history

GI_X_JACK, what if i was in to dressing up like a goth and biting people before i saw bram stoker dracula does that make me more or less a vampire no the big difference is that hard science fiction is better grounded in reality than fantasy hence why its hard science fiction vampires do not actually exist the internet actually exists hackers actually exist to a certain extent biohacking really exists so a lot of cyberpunk plot elements actually do exist thats the difference this guy dressing up and posing around the city he wearing a jacket people actually do wear and real sun glasses the rest of the city scapes are not cosplay but real cyberpunk in real life is less playing dress up and more social commentary on real life if you think this is weird the term astro naut and nautical terminology for space faring existed some 70 years before the first man went into space it was coined by jules vern when he wrote some of the first space faring science fiction today we think of space in terms of the sea vessels ships astro nautical i have suggested nothing without precedence you cannot tell the difference between hard science fiction and fantasy ,1,Cyberpunk

GI_X_JACK,not really just as important as the quran are the haddiths and then there is islamic jurisprudence which interprets the quran the reason there are so many fighting sects is every time some islamic judges get into an argument they cannot resolve it splits and they make two separate incompatible strains of the religion that cannot reconcile the first such one the sunni shi ia split comes from the foundation of islam itself who had proper authority to follow as the leader of islam mohamed cousin or his supreme council since then there have been centuries of judicial differences making them irreconcilable this is not much diffrence than europeans pre enlightenment and the rise of secular governments if anyone doubts why the enlightenment was good it was because it soothed the rift because irreconcilable warring factions by muting them a little and making faith personal rather than public it was only after this did europe ever become unified it was only after this did europe experience rapid technological advancement ,1,Documentaries
GI_X_JACK,that really depends on what you mean by newer as if the sole thing driving christian thought and philosophy is christ and the cannon at its inception what we call christianity and even islam are not what they were when they were founded the christian bible and what is and is not cannon the original use of the word where decided hundreds of years after christ was supposed to live then the protestant movement happened that coincided neatly with the renaissance the printing press and later the enlightenment on another note the problem with many so called multiculturalists is they do not understand the depth of various societies and how other cultures do their have and have nots ,1,Documentaries
