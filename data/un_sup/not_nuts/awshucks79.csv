awshucks79,i took physics in high school and we had to build a machine that could launch a squash ball a specific distance it was a 2 day competition and your score would be averaged you basically had to use your machine to throw the ball across a football field you would move the machine to where the ball landed and throw again and again until your ball finally got to the finish line i had already been kicked out of my house and was living on my own with little funds to build anything substantial meanwhile several of my classmates got together with at least one father who was an engineer and built several identical machines for the group after the first day of competition where i did so very poorly i asked the teacher what grade i would get if i sat out on the second day he told me i would get a 51 i decided to compete on the second day despite being absolutely mortified at how awful it was going it took me at least 5x as long to complete it when our grades were posted i ended up with a 49 lower than i would have gotten if i just sat out the second day completely ,4,AskReddit
