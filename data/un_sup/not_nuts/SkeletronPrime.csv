SkeletronPrime,this post has made me think much too hard i do want another charger so i can have one for the dock and one for handheld after reviewing all the options i have decided that perhaps nintendo engineers know more about what is what for this device than anyone else so i just ordered another nintendo adapter from the official store it has a great spec and costs less than most of the competition and if i end up with a phone or laptop that uses usb c it sure to come with its own adapter anyway i do appreciate that op is providing information partly for those who already own usb c chargers which is very helpful but if i am choosing a new charger i would rather not mess about with third party options ,1,NintendoSwitch
SkeletronPrime,thanks there are plenty of those around but i am hoping to find something that will function as a right angle adapter for the stock power supply ,1,NintendoSwitch

SkeletronPrime,there next to nothing in terms of account information online nintendo methodology is pretty wretched my assumption is that when you make a purchase then there a hardware identifier associated with your physical device and nintendo servers store that and optionally also an nnid if you happened to create one i have made a note of my hardware serial number in case of system failure and my assumption is that this could be used to retrieve purchases if i had to buy a replacement system if i created an nnid which i have not i believe that could be used also probably in conjunction with the serial number or maybe without i am not sure someone feel free to correct me if i have this wrong ,1,3DS

SkeletronPrime,this is my first bimetal so i cannot really compare in terms of that i have a lot of one drops which i really enjoy yyr states that they made this one with an emphasis on ease of use and i would say they hit the mark i opened the box put a string on it and it immediately felt comfortable and very easy to use spin time was really the only surprise i would used a triad before so i knew bimaterial can make a yoyo somewhat op but in terms of spin the valkyrie definitely feels like cheat mode to someone new to bimetals i threw a quick combo still going ok let do another still going ok let run through that again fun i do wonder whether non bimetal teaches better skills simply for that reason anyway overall initial impressions very comfortable diameter pleasant weight outstanding fit and finish i am happy so far ,2,Throwers

SkeletronPrime,although longer string makes it possible to spin faster because physics so there that too ,2,Throwers

SkeletronPrime,it bs because the backstory re one drop is already pretty well known and it has nothing to do with being super proud of maple syrup and whatnot ,6,Throwers
SkeletronPrime,it probably depends a bit on budget and on whether you are the kind of person who enjoys tinkering with things like that i do not want to mess with it flow grooves are dirt cheap especially considering how infrequently they need to be changed ,1,Throwers

SkeletronPrime, we are proud to present the valkyrie a yo yo produced in pursuit of the absolute optimum the draupnir is a already a popular choice for competitive players who look for high speed and maneuverability but we wanted to cater to even more players first we chose specs which sit bang in the middle of the current spectrum of yo yos as a base and from there we built up a product with an emphasis on ease of use by precisely choosing the sweetest spots to distribute the weight we have managed to produce a yo yo with a special characteristic which can be described as being close to weightlessness giving it exquisite maneuverability the yoyorecreation valkyrie will likely set a new standard for competition grade yo yos ,2,Throwers

SkeletronPrime,i am glad someone posted this because i really do not like the stuff that ships with od so now i know what to avoid i love od yoyos but that string i do not know it wants to be woven into toilet paper i am sure it would be soft strong and thoroughly absorbent ,2,Throwers

SkeletronPrime,of course we are all allowed our own opinions i just really question this particular choice and wonder if it a matter of culture maybe if it were a more american tragedy would you name your new bimetal the hindenburg the twin towers i know this is a touchy subject since i posted something similar on yyws facebook page and they promptly deleted it they apparently knew people who had died on 9 11 what exactly is the length of time after which mass death becomes cool ,-4,Throwers

SkeletronPrime,there are a lot of interesting choices i have a few one drops and right now i would say that the code 1 with the soda nickel finish 115 is a good choice for full size super stable yelets is great for undersize better than the rebirth in my humble opinion but it would not be my choice for a first one drop i have also been spending a lot of time with a 2014 benchmark v the vanguard seems decent so far edit received a vanguard a couple of hours ago it very nice stable and cheap ,1,Throwers
SkeletronPrime,it an object on the end of a piece of string that you are going to be flinging around the more you use it the greater the likelihood that it going to hit something aluminium is soft one does one best but it just one of those things you will get more blunt advice than this ,9,Throwers

SkeletronPrime,we are down to philosophy at that point if you do not assign value to skills gained in a game or a particular hobby and you also require there to be a practical value then there would be no point i derive some pleasure from yo yoing for whatever reason i am also impressed by those of a higher skill level which drives me somewhat to try harder ,1,videos
SkeletronPrime,as someone who spends all day every day writing code and having to deal with a lot of corporate nonsense in the office yo yoing or playing guitar is one of the better ways for me to switch off my brain and relax it incredibly focused so it a bit like wearing mental blinkers for a while i really need that down time from caring about day to day minutiae and it a lot healthier than xanax edit i have no clue how relevant to gender this all is ,4,videos

SkeletronPrime,brandon it was absolutely a sweet deal and i am more than happy with the product and fast shipping i made sure to point out that the shipping was prompt and there were no issues i definitely did not start this with the intent of ripping any one company i just thought it was a bit weird for two companies in a row to ship in undersized packaging and wanted to know if that was typical being completely honest i still think it would give your customers a better impression if items were shipped in boxes at least the same size as their contents that goes for yoyoexpert too that said i am very happy with the markmont classic thank you ,3,Throwers
SkeletronPrime,it not going to stop me buying from either place but if money were a factor i would happily pay a couple of extra dollars in shipping for an appropriately sized box ,2,Throwers
SkeletronPrime,mine arrived today and i have put an hour or so into it i am happy ,1,Throwers
SkeletronPrime,yoyoexpert and yo yoshop it important to note that they shipped promptly and the contents seem ok i just felt that the choice of packaging was inappropriate we get excited about receiving these things you know the reason i tried more than one retailer was because of the way the first shipped and then the second did the same thing hence my question of whether this is just the way things are done with yo yos ,3,Throwers
SkeletronPrime,is it appropriate to namedrop in this sub ,1,Throwers
SkeletronPrime,a markmont classic from one retailer and a code2 from the other they both used the same size usps small flat rate box ,1,Throwers

SkeletronPrime,for what it worth i asked my wife and she agrees with you how much is it really going to change she said oh well i really do not have anything else to add if one drop cared i am sure they would have sent an nda along with that prototype ,3,Throwers

SkeletronPrime,i would rather you were completely honest and i absolutely respect your right to publish your thoughts i am questioning whether you feel it the right thing to do regarding a product that as far as we know was not finalized or shipped as i said poisoning the well i do not have any emotional investment one way or the other i am just curious ,-1,Throwers
SkeletronPrime,is not it somewhat poor form to write a review putting down a prototype of as yet unreleased product seems like a rather hostile move of course you are entitled to your own opinion which may well be thoroughly accurate but it does poison the well a bit does not it i merely ask ,3,Throwers
