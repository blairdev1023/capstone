literalmario,you are absolutely correct i think polling is great for certain opinions and specific matters but i think the flaws were horribly exposed this election cycle there are plenty of reports out there that came out after this election and some of the questions that were asked in certain polls regarding support for a candidate were awful they were definitely leading and horribly worded im just speaking from personal experience here again nothing scientific but every person i know that voted for trump has literally doubled down on him not only that but they think its great that he is calling cnn fake news and wants to be buddies with russia he is literally viewed as a god in some circles ,1,politics
literalmario,lol,-5,worldnews
literalmario,i bet you he did not this is the problem with polls his supporters are even more rabid the way the questions are asked in polling is what really matters and many times especially uneducated people do not even understand the question this was the whole problem during the election cycle and continues to be just on the surface i can tell the poll is not representative i obviously do not have my own research to back up this claim but this is my educated guess on the matter i am a political science major and have studied polling quite extensively even conducted my own polls the questions asked are wrong many times ,1,politics

literalmario,i have a slight glimmer of hope and that is trump is not as stubborn as he seems he has shown this in a few occasions so im hoping the pentagon which clearly believes in climate change will be able to talk sense into him i think the intelligence community will be bale to at least change his mind a bit remeber he has only been surrounded by lunatics until this point things change a bit when you become potus and there are advisors on all levels which will talk sense into him i hope ,4,politics

literalmario,psa not from cali but i would like to say a couple of things i dont think this will happen but it should it wont happen because the us government is just way too powerful it should happen because the people are very very different than the vast majority of the physical country and they are correct states with a million or less people do have a bit too much power especially the senator situation it was a genius move for the founders to make senators equal however it is crazy for nebraska to have the same amount of senators as cali i think a lot of this can be fixed without a calexit by simply ending gerrymandering it would fix all the issues but the hor would be much more competative currently i dont see democrats ever winning it with the current map ,1,news
