SAMSON_AITE,i have got the 180amp 240v mig welder https www harborfreight com 180 amp dc 240 volt migflux cored welder 68886 html i caught it on a big sale and was able to combine a 25 off coupon i think in all it cost me 140 bucks occasionally you can get the 10 lb flux core spools for around 45 50 or just start with a 2 lb it comes with a non shielded spool of wire which to make good welds you need a bottle of argon carbondioxide 75 25 mix gas for learning i would just start with flux i did replace the cord with a new 20 foot cord to give the welder some reach and when you set the welder up pay attention to the manual the leads for the mig gun hook to a positive and negative terminal on the machine if your welding flux it you swap the polarity from what you would have them installed at when using un shielded wire if you do not have the correct polarity it will still work fine but you will get more slag bb coming off of the weld other then that there are not any big modifications i would recommend for good quality welds you will always want to start with clean metal grind off any rest oxide paint until its bare steel where you will be welding never try to weld cast iron it will stick but will be so brittle that the first abrupt impact the piece encounters will likely break the weld for your welding technique you will want to practice a cursive c pattern essentially you want to create a pool of molten metal and move fast enough to keep it from burning through your metal work piece but also slow enough to get good penetration you will have to practice to get a good feel and adjust your wire feed speed and amperage i would practice welding on thick metal to start and just get a good feel for the pattern and speeds then try thinner stuff ,1,woodworking

SAMSON_AITE,i have supplied a few to various family and friends it a perk of it work the closest one to what your after was a hp color laserjet cm2320 it was a couple years old and we upgraded it to a higher volume machine and it going to be recycled one of my job perks is i can liberate and find homes for equipment like that this one had low clicks and it only costs 55 for a set of toner you can always try to remove stuff from the fusers i do it for a living and can save then most of the time but sometimes it just hopeless never stick sharp things in there ,1,printers

SAMSON_AITE, i guess i would not be printing that much maybe 500 pages a month tops i will have to do more research it seems i would just double check your research and factor in the page yield of the cartridges and their overall cost vs your usage and how long you plan on keeping the machine that machine is a good model i typically provide support on tech stuff so pricing is not generally something i am concerned with or i would be more specific that said i set my extended family members up with equipment now and then the most recent was last year and it a little hp color laser printer it was only 55 bucks for all 4 cartridges they print constantly now without having worry about it costing too much also regarding the waterslide sticking issue is there any way to avoid or remedy it if i am printing consistently with waterslide medium or i have to buy new cartridges every time this happens the waterslide paper wo not stick to the cartridges it will wrap around the fuser heat or pressure roller and only if you use the wrong settings or maybe buy the inkjet waterslide paper it very important that it says it for a laserjet machine i only ran into it once years ago and i think they had set the paper type to thick 1 our thick 2 in a laser machine the toner is bonded to the paper using heat and pressure the thicker paper needs more heat and possibly a slower transport speed so feeding paper with a plasticky film on it through a fuser unit operating at 400 450 and the machine even slowing the transport speed to ensure the toner really gets cooked on there you can see why that a problem it pretty impossible to remove the stuff once it in there as the heat roller is coated in teflon and will scratch off you look at it wrong the pressure roller is rubber and the two pinch the paper between them there is very little space to work in so you get a molten mess in a tight space surrounded by fragile things usually that means your buying a new fuser and that a couple hundred bucks it all really easily preventable though as long as you follow the instructions on the paper ,1,printers
SAMSON_AITE, or is this for all waterslide printing in general it not a problem with standard paper stock it an issue with waterslide and ohp they can stick to the heat roller in the machine and it almost impossible to remove them without damaging things ultimately i want to use it for custom work so i will be doing a lot of printing in the long run if it works out so i do not mind spending more on cartridges if it means i can print more what is a lot of printing to you spending more on the cartridges does not mean you get more prints as you research these machines you will typically notice stuff in this class will have a set of cartridges with an average yield of 2500 pages at 5 percent coverage the cost on a full set will range from 50 to 200 depending on if the cartridges are oem compatible and what model the machine is if your printing a few thousand pages a month you are much better off buying a 400 printer that has cartridges that cost 50 bucks for a set vs a 150 printer with cartridges at 100 set as after only 5 months the out of pocket cost is the same if your doing a few hundred prints a month on the other hand makes since to go with the cheap printer as time will degrade the components more so then the light usage and it would be many many years until the out of pocket expense would make the more expensive option make since ,1,printers
SAMSON_AITE,on the waterslide paper some of it is designed for inkjet some for laserjet make sure you do not under any circumstances use the inkjet version in a laserjet machine sometimes you will get lucky sometimes it will jam and wrap around your fuser and that not a good thing the compatible cartridges on that machine run around 100 bucks for a set of 4 there are some machines in that class that have a set for around 50 bucks so it a math problem to see if it a good machine for you if you are not printing much the cheap machine may be the way to go but if you print larger volume there are other machines out there that may be a better fit because the cost of the toner will quickly outweigh the initial cost of the machine ,1,printers

SAMSON_AITE,the hp is a solid machine almost all manufacturers will not list waterslide paper as compatible however as long as you get the waterslide paper that is designed for laser printers you should be ok my general advice for shopping for a printer is to look at the cost of the cartridges and duty cycle of the machine there are some great machines out there for filthy cheap on the low end of the cost spectrum however the cost of using them is prohibitive lexmark has some very solid machines as well ,1,printers

SAMSON_AITE, and most of this subreddit is feminist if you are going to throw that around like a label you are surprised someone might claim you need to seriously re evaluate what you are doing here i like to think most of this sub is egalitarian i explained why in another reply on this thread wither i should be here or not i am here to waste time arguing and laughing at people preferably trp but anyone will do either way mission accomplished ,-5,TheBluePill
SAMSON_AITE, yes of course i am a feminist and i fail to see how toxic masculinity is a meaningless label ostensibly feminism is a fight for equality between the genders only look at the language used on the name of that nobel cause feminism female good patriarchy male bad toxic masculinity male bad manspreading male bad manterrupting male bad mansplain male bad rape only men rape male bad rape culture only men rape culture men bad you cannot claim to fight for equality between the sexes if gendered words have a blatantly one sided implication of shame ignorance and closed mindedness if you want to have any kind of a productive conversation about how egalitarian you are you cannot tie yourself that dictionary ironically feminism is sexists perhaps you do not understand what i mean by toxic masculinity i understand the definition of toxic masculinity however it wholly incomplete in that the very wording puts all of the onus and burden of society on men a very large percentage of everything men do is solely to garner love and respect from women if you want to be egalitarian as you ostensibly do substitute the term toxic masculinity with societal expectations it at least closer to the truth and much less offensive as far as i can see we are in agreement about this yep other then the implications inherent in the wording by the way what do you do to make sure vulnerable men do have an emotional support network the best i can same as anyone i am not talking about the target audience i am talking about the message which is hold frame captain your ship be alpha show no weakness and consider your natural confidante a cruel manipulative child who will turn on you if you show any vulnerability life is a rhythm and at some points in a man life the above is a valid even nessicary message is it nice nope is it correct nope because it far to pessimistic and incomplete leaving out compassion and trust that comes from any solid relationship to actually have any understanding of a person you need to look at the circumstances surrounding who they are how they got where they are and why they believe what they believe anything is poison in excess wither it be masculinity feminity or water ,-10,TheBluePill

SAMSON_AITE,what about them it is not impossible to be happy when suffering from a mental illness its just a lot harder the depression and suicide statistics vouch for that another thing that strikes me as silly about the whole trans person fad is people are literally taking a preconceived social construct gender they take these characteristics our society says embody manliness or femininity comparing those fallible and subjective gender roles to who they are as a person they do the math i like x y z and x y z are traits that fit into the other gender role so i must be x gender why not just realize you like x y z and that it falls outside of the traditional perception of your gender role and accept the fact that maybe you are a masculine female or a feminine male there only logic in that thought process if you account for a neurological illness like gender dysphoria there is no morality to it they arent bad people they are only suffering and being led astray,2,TrueChristian

SAMSON_AITE,people with apotemnophilia feel an intense need to have a specific body part amputated they genuinely believe and feel like it will improve their lives it is a neurological disorder supporting transgender folks in mutilation their bodies is equivalent to encouraging those with apotemnophilia to get amputations i believe we should have compassion for anyone whom has a gender dysphoria disorder but enabling it is a mistake look at the suicide statistics on post op trans folks its around 40 we currently have a political landscape where one party is latching on to the plight of this group in order to attain a false moral high ground and shame all political opposition into submitting to that false pretense they tell these unfortunate souls suffering from gender dysphoria that they are what ever gender they associate as they encourage operations and genital mutilation and at the end of that road all that is left is a broken transgender person who is as unhappy as ever possibly even more so because they still do not feel right with them selves to add to their problems now they are taking a cocktail of hormones that is further unbalancing their already precarious state of mind it really is not a mystery they are killing themselves in droves meanwhile the political entity that encourage this folly pat themselves on the back for a job well done its disgusting ,11,TrueChristian

SAMSON_AITE,no problem make sure to take enough time to get your pup acclimated so the noise is not traumatizing you will start by showing it to him and letting him sniff it then giving him treats after a week of that you will turn it on a long ways away from him giving treats as the noise starts after that start moving it closer and being generous with treats it will take two weeks of that then you can do a little touch near his paw if he is not too nervous depending on his reactions you can start with very short nail sessions rewarding him liberally i have got two corg and they actually look forward to getting their nails done now best of luck ,11,corgi
SAMSON_AITE,there not a time limit per say if your dog runs on concrete for instance they will wear down naturally the problem with not trimming them for a long time like that is the quick nerve inside the nail will grow out and when you do go to cut them you will cut it and it will bleed and be painful for your pup if you are willing to take it slow you can go get a pedi paws or a clipper and grind clip just a little bit once or twice a week avoiding the quick the quick will naturally recede as the new shorter end of the nail gets too close to it ,19,corgi

SAMSON_AITE, first off im a man so the irony is not strong in that i have empathy and am able to imagine how a woman feels with such a huge life thing of pregnancy it changes the mothers life nobody cares what your sex is its ironic because you want to claim your empathetic to those involved while you also sit there and refuse to acknowledge that there are two sides of the reproductive coin it also borderline insulting to deny women the agency to make big decisions like this and take responsibility for them you do not fucking notice anything until the end product comes out but she notices every singe pain and uncomfortability and insecurity about her life and her future everyday for nearly a year you do not get what goes into it and that why it not up to you at all in life you take what you want and pay for it that what being a grown up is about it not fun it not glamorous it frequently painful and thankless the world is not fair and it never will be the best one can do is consider the rights of those involved while trying to solve the issues at hand the way things are currently destroys lives literally fiscally emotionally and metaphorically and truly harms everyone involved it can be improved if the people involved grow up and act like adults ,-1,PoliticalHumor
SAMSON_AITE, the government should not that why people hate politicians so much ftfy try putting yourself in the mothers shoes instead of only thinking about how this affects men woosh the irony is strong with this one because it has very little to do with men the ignorance too you should come back and talk me when your out of diapers and realise reproduction is an insanely big decision some times the consequences make a positive impact things like pregnancy and financial risks in other cases it a negative impact think someone murdering your child while you stand aside with no rights and watch nobody should be killing children when there is a biological parent that wants to raise them in my mind live should always trump death ,-2,PoliticalHumor
SAMSON_AITE, besides that though yes nobody should have a say in how anybody else controls their own body the government tells people what to do with their bodies all the time why is that such a sacred framework for people i could easily argue that if the father is a willing able parent and the pregnancy possess no health risks to the mother there is nothing wrong with giving the father legal rights in what happens to his offspring as it stands if an unwanted child is born the mother can choose to have it regardless of the financial ramifications the male partner why not put the shoe on the other foot you know for femanism and equality at the end of the day personal responsibility for your actions should rule for men that means 18 24 years of child support is it really that unfair that it could mean 9 months of feeling crappy during pregnancy for a woman ,-6,PoliticalHumor

SAMSON_AITE,you should have billed them as the joker says if your good at something never do it for free as for dr doosh does he not have anything better to do it sounds like he is a creep that said i would not involve your wife in the quarrel with him you can make it clear you think he is immature and wasting both your time and his by following you around and getting in the way but do not go on about how mean he is to you she is your wife not your mom why do you take the insulting behavior from him if he does shitty little jibes to you are you uncomfortable sending some back his way the way i see it you only have a few options with him either ignore avoid him what your doing now give him a verbal kung fu kick in the metaphorical balls first find out what he is ego investments are and belittle disparage and scorn them he has given you hints on what he bases his self esteem on the things he is making fun of you for instance schooling career intellect ect he also gave hints about finding your wife attractive and better then you so you can probably give him a few verbal jabs in the kidney with some innocent why are you still single comments he seems to value intellect so if he is around you looking over your shoulder you can teach him about the basic stuff your doing and generally act like you dont think he could pull it off on his own the only other option i see is to take the verbal power away from him do not let on even slightly that he is bothering you be really nice to him turn the other cheek compliment him lincoln said the best way to destroy an enemy is to make him a friend judging by this guys character this probably would be the least likely to succeed whatever you do good luck ,4,relationships

SAMSON_AITE,in obama last days he signed wide sweeping mandates that created over 500 000 000 acres of new national parks he did this with no due process traditionally they are created through an act of congress and there was no vote by the local land owners and residents who were affected i love backpacking and camping and visiting national parks so on one hand i am pretty excited about new parks on the other this costs a lot of money to private landowners that now take either property value hits due to no longer being allowed to use or develop their land a review of those national monuments may well be an attempt to reverse some of those mandates performed without due process edit am i wrong here or are the down votes for disapproving of an abuse of power ,-3,nature

SAMSON_AITE,i would say game gets easier the less you care it is a huge roller coaster when you start the what if i am rejected thoughts and feelings can really suck but the less you care the easier it gets the less you take things personally your example of hitting on your coworker for instance you are making the assumption that it was your fault she did not say yes you must have done something wrong maybe you waited too long you are not attractive enough the more you put yourself out there the more you will realize that people are just people most likely you were fine you had a nice conversation with her and she enjoyed talking to you she may even think your charming and attractive but maybe she has feelings for somebody else or is getting over some issues of her own or just does not want a relationship with someone she works with it may seem fickle to you from your point of view but if shes cute she probably gets hit on pretty often so something like oh i work with him is a big deal breaker when you can just go out with the next cute guy that hits on you whom you also dont work with do not misunderstand me you should try to learn from your successes and failures but at the same time try to not lose perspective and browbeat yourself to the point where your self esteem suffers give yourself the freedom to fail look at where you need to improve and make a plan to do so i like you felt awkward talking to people so i just made a rule for myself talk to strangers when i could it was a little awkward at first but eventually i found it got easy and i would feel good about it then the rule was make them smile and that was great because i brightened someones day and i got to pat myself on the back for being clever when i failed and it was awkward it was in a situation that did not matter at all and had no consequences the next step was to bring those skills into play with women after a while of doing that you really do care less about how things go so you are more relaxed and so things are more natural and your success goes up considerably i think your stuck on looks i do think game got easier when i was attractive but for my experience its a case of what came first the chicken or the egg was i more successful because i was more attractive or and this is what i now believe to be true looking back was i more successful because i felt attractive and therefore had more confidence and was more assertive 6 months of gains at the gym really did not make me look that different but it made a huge difference in how i felt and that drastically affected how i behaved ,1,seduction
SAMSON_AITE,lay out the ground rules in the beginning be clear that this wont lead to a relationship and stick to it make it a rule to yourself that if the other person starts pressing you for a relationship its time to bow out do not share that rule with the other person or you risk them hiding their emotions which will cause more collateral damage vs just nipping the problem in the bud and ending it when it comes up ,2,bdsm

SAMSON_AITE,there a range of ways they will hit on you when you start looking and feeling better about yourself everyone both men and women start being nicer to you like literally they will smile laugh and joke with you more since i seriously started working out about 5 years ago i have talked myself out of 4 tickets and 3 parking tickets on a campus though im friends with the head of security there so that helps it sounds like a lot but i drive 40k miles a year so maybe that mitigates it a little before that 0 and i had been pulled over about 4 5 times women start getting curious about who you are dating if you tell them your seeing someone they ask how long whats she do is she cute things like that by themselves they dont mean much but i did not get those questions when i was more average looking i had an older lady try to set me up with a young good looking nurse who is my age a few ladies have tried to set me up with their daughters i am engaged so i just laughed and said my fiancee might not like that much on those occasions the cute girl at subway dropped hard hard hints about how she broke up with her boyfriend and did i know someone who might like to go out like 3 times in the time it took to make me a sandwich ,1,seduction
SAMSON_AITE,that solid advice those non pipe cleaner arm gains will absolutely help just beware of trying to create attraction with women they are biologically wired to look for alpha male traits and if you come across as someone trying to be impressive you will find a visceral reaction of repulsion understand your audience they want the man that just gets it https therationalmale com 2012 08 22 just get it if you come off as a someone who naturally meets their bio checklist you will have to beat them off with a stick if you come across as someone trying to improve for the sake of getting attention from the ladies you will be scorned and will have a lot of women who want to just be friends ,2,seduction

SAMSON_AITE,yep i know dickies are not a walmart brand however to get their price points they often accept seconds and thirds of in many cases because of their buying power they have batches of product with the manufacturers brand made to a lower standard then typical so people go and buy something like dickie pants and get a sub par facsimile ,1,Frugal
SAMSON_AITE,their clothing is terrible i bought two pairs of dickie pants within a week i tore the knees put on both sets and i am not hard on clothes if you look at their store brand foods they are packed with fillers particularly crackers chips their electronics are all watered down versions of whatever the manufacturer offers elsewhere buying a sony tv they will carry a slightly different model number then what other retailers carry with slightly lower specs lower contrast fiewer inputs ect then they advertise 55 sony for x dollars and rely on people ignorance to lead then to the conclusion that it the same set you would get at best buy or costco overall of you look at the details their product line is very underwhelming ,-3,Frugal
SAMSON_AITE,yeah but then you have to shop at walmart in my experience their stuff if sub par and unless you make it a point to shop their sales their pricing is mediocre at best furthermore they are no longer price matching in most of their locations all of that coupled with how they treat their employees is a huge boner killer ,0,Frugal

SAMSON_AITE,i think basic income is an interesting concept and i would love to believe in it but my faith in humanity just isnt there one of the big models for it suggests taxing automated technology things like the new fast food touch screen ordering system then taking that tax dividing it evenly for everyone the company gets ahead because they arent paying labor the engineers and service technicians get ahead because somebody has to keep it all running and they are also getting a cut of the basic income the extremely poor get some slack because now instead of having to work 50 hours a week at mcdonalds to pay rent they can work 30 to barely scrape by giving them a chance to improve their situation another thing i read suggested doing this as well as abolishing the public service programs like welfare and adding that money to the pot as well i like that idea because the government is run so inefficiently that simply taking them out of the equation beyond simple division and writing a check it translates to a lot more money where it matters it also eliminates people gaming the system think illegally selling pot and not claiming the income on your taxes while collecting on welfare foodstamps ,1,PurplePillDebate
