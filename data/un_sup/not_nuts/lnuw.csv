lnuw,calling a pass play is defensible calling that particular pass play with those specific personnel was not ,3,Seahawks
lnuw, if you want to try another thing well you will go mage but almost everything you can do with mage you will do in the first hours then its just rinse and repeat lolwut the best spells in the game require a very high level in their respective magic schools to acquire and are totally op ,2,gaming
lnuw,stamina is required to zoom in with your bow you automatically zoom out when you run out of stamina so relying on veggie soup to give you 1 stamina means you would have to constantly zoom in and out ruining your chances of lining up shots ,2,gaming
lnuw,with the 100 sneak skill perk you can crouch mid combat and initiate sneak attacks at will you basically become an op vampire ninja,1,gaming

lnuw,lmfao what is with seahawks fans and thinking every free agent should somehow sign a one year prove it deal with our team show some fucking respect ,9,Seahawks
lnuw,that a bit of an exaggeration it has better storytelling than skyrim and dark souls some will debate this though but has nothing on mass effect better exploration than mass effect and dark souls again some will debate this but not on skyrim level there and depending on whether you prefer melee over magic ranged combat it may not be better than any of the other three ,1,gaming
lnuw,yeah you didnt describe it badly enough,1,gaming
lnuw,pick up the original mass effect trilogy because it a sci fi setting there no mage class in the literal sense but biotic and certain tech powers fulfill the magic role quite neatly ,1,gaming

lnuw,nobody underestimates an all pro linebacker dude ,2,nfl
lnuw,that does not really refute my point they are drafting around the same spots we are and getting much better in the packers case even elite oline play cable has no excuse ,2,Seahawks
lnuw,because they have only played one year,17,nfl
lnuw,they did show it at 1 42 of the video,3,Seahawks
lnuw,no games are meant to be played regardless of genre that what makes them games not movies or books an unplayable game is a bad game period the story is something that should be considered in the review but only if there is one what you are suggesting heavily favors certain genres over others ie rpgs will almost always get better scores than online fps and sports games,1,gaming
lnuw,that makes sense those spiders usually have a ridiculous aggro range given their propensity to continuously scurry backwards in any direction ,3,witcher
lnuw,1 geralt is not wearing any armor when ves shoots him i cannot imagine it would be too hard for a bolt fired at close range to pierce his flesh 2 you are severely underestimating the lethality of crossbows they were considered incredibly destructive innovations when they were popularly utilized and due to their slow draw speed relied upon to deliver fatal shots with just a single bolt fired at mid range 3 whether or not geralt instantly died upon being shot is irrelevant stabbing someone through the chest with a sword wo not instantly kill them either but they will die in mere moments ,6,witcher
lnuw,they do not enemies are locked into their own aggro range which means they they only attack things within a certain area and never venture outside of it the devs hand placed the monsters so that their aggro ranges almost never overlap and thus you do not see any cross species interaction closest i have seen is bandits being attacked by drowners and even that is a rare occurrence ,2,witcher
lnuw, but how many teams have drafted in the late 20 for 5 straight seasons i am not sure how many but i know of at least two the packers and patriots both have better home grown olines than we do the packers starting lt was a 4th rounder from the notoriously bad 2013 draft for fuck sake ,6,Seahawks
lnuw,i consider side quests to be anything that were prompted as such in the journal and they were in me3 btw the journal was a complete shitshow in that game too and i thought the reaper chases were absolutely awful even though they were laughably easy to avoid it was annoying that you constantly had to avoid them to begin with ,1,gaming
lnuw,saved the kids they were the ones who did not hesitate to help you talk to johnny thus bringing you closer to finding ciri anna was very unhelpful until you forced her hand i know that it was not totally her fault but i believe in helping others who help you it the same reason why i chose roche and ves over dijkstra the first two risked their lives to help defend ciri dijkstra did not do shit ,1,witcher
lnuw,my favorite video game trilogy ever the first game is a little rough around the edges because it tries to straddle the line between traditional rpg and action shooter mechanics and ends up being poor at both i suggest you use powers liberally not only are they great crowd control but they make combat much more fun and manageable than just trying to gun everything down if that still not enough do not be ashamed to just turn the difficulty all the way down it will be much improved in the second and third games to get the most out of the games get to know your crew whenever you can new dialogue options will be unlocked after every mission you complete the characters are the backbone of the trilogy not the story or the combat that all i can say for now without spoiling anything ,2,gaming
lnuw,me3 had the worst side quests in the trilogy the fetch quests were the worst possible kind literally scan this planet and come back others were shameless plugs for the multiplayer just running around and shooting hordes of mobs i will admit the me2 reunion quests were very good though like the loyalty missions i consider them optional main quests rather than true side quests overall still a solid 8 10 game for me but there were a lot of issues other than the ending that dragged it down,1,gaming
lnuw,they have fallen on some hard times,54,nfl
lnuw,bashing you for liking something that something being the witcher 3 nobody has a problem with that it the fact that you cannot make it through a conversation without insulting another game or making blanket statements about people who do not like what you like immediately calling out everyone who does not like tw3 as socially awkward wont make you any friends in real life or on the internet ,3,gaming
lnuw,you are like a living caricature ,3,gaming
lnuw,it was positive if you ignore the fact that he used two other games as sacrificial lambs to prove his point you seem to be really good at glossing over the details ,3,gaming
lnuw,i am calm i am not the one calling dissenting opinions that of sheep morons and 12 year olds it extremely hypocritical of you to accuse others of being socially awkward when irl it the socially awkward people who feel the need to bash other people beliefs and preferences,3,gaming
lnuw,tom cable and darrell bevell a man can dream ,6,nfl
lnuw,the people i know who have played it generally like it that it i like it too but we dont bash other games and fans of those games it unnecessary and accomplishes nothing i am an atheist but i hate it when other atheists go out of their way to attack other people beliefs it does not make me any less of an atheist just less of an asshole see the difference ,6,gaming
lnuw,a college hc job maybe,10,Seahawks
lnuw,funny outside of the internet i dont know anybody irl who jerks tw3 as hard as people online do it not the universally loved classic you think it is ,6,gaming
lnuw,lol are you just choosing to not read the whole comment if cod is trash and tw3 made fo4 look like a cod game then by law of substitution he saying that tw3 made fo4 look like trash it sucks that his second favorite game is now trash but tw3 circlejerk takes no prisoners and what was even the point of your comment about cod i do not like the games either but witcher 3 fanatics cannot seem to get through a conversation without insulting another game or its fanbase,8,gaming
lnuw,because of comments like this the game was so much better than anything i have ever played this game has set the bar so high for me that nothing can even compare to it even my second favorite game of the past 5 years fallout 4 is a lowly call of duty title compared this game people cannot seem to praise tw3 without also bashing another game in the same comment it not enough to just say tw3 is their favorite game they have to beat it over the head of some other game that they happen to like less it unnecessary and rubs others the wrong way how would you react if someone said their favorite musician was insert artist name here and then immediately followed up by talking about how much better they are than your favorite band now imagine if half of that musician fanbase did the same thing whenever they talked about him or her it will start to piss a lot of people off ,11,gaming
lnuw,people dont bash tw3 out of nowhere they bash the circlejerk around the game i personally really like maybe even love the game but when people continue to act like it is unrivaled by any other rpg ever made it wears on those who know better it just one great game in a long list of great games too bad people cannot seem to leave it at that,17,gaming
lnuw,i didnt make these comments just to be antagonistic the circlejerk has just gotten out of control ,7,gaming
lnuw,he was incredible against the falcons even though we ended up losing,14,nfl
lnuw,these stats are nowhere near as bad as the cherry picked stats being posted here a couple years back,3,nfl
lnuw,so basically you can compare other games to the witcher 3 after all glad we have come to an agreement ,7,gaming
lnuw,if no other game can compare to the witcher 3 then there really no point in even trying to convince you that another game is better because the witcher 3 is just totally better dood what do you call someone who cannot be convinced anything is better than their favorite x a fanboy ,9,gaming
lnuw,if someone reposted it ,93,nfl
lnuw, because the game was so much better than anything i have ever played this game has set the bar so high for me that nothing can even compare to it i skipped to the end after i read this part fanboy ,25,gaming
lnuw,yes it was a very enjoyable game with a surprisingly good story and combat with room for improvement why were all my romances one night stands ,2,gaming
lnuw, i know this may seem like the rambling of a fanboy because it is ,60,gaming
lnuw,a lot of people including myself have this issue first thing you must try is clearing the cache if that doesnt immediately fix the problem then restart your console try the achievement again and it should finally unlock be aware that the problem will eventually come back however so you will have to track your achievements ahead of time,1,witcher

lnuw,it definitely a boss fight kind of game lol the gameplay finest moments are when you are fighting the fiends griffins vampires and leshens of the world not endless groups of bandits wolves and drowners mass effect is what i would consider a non boss type of game,1,witcher
lnuw,i seem to recall a horrible zero or one win raiders team beating the chiefs that season or maybe it was the season after ,3,nfl
lnuw,a there were 8 blockers obviously wilson wo not block for himself rawls is needed to sell the fake and graham was to shed his blocker before getting open the play called for the bare minimum number of non blockers but yeah totally wilson fault b you know i can say the exact same thing about all of your examples right this kind of comment contributes nothing c the receiver was wide open because of a delayed corner blitz no way he could have seen that coming and it prevented him from going through his reads also the 2nd sack in the video was also on the line d this is getting ridiculous the ball was out of wilson hand in just under 2 seconds from snap to throw the only reason it was not a safety was because of how ludicrously fast wilson got it out of there the vikings line looks worse than it is when you focus solely on the tackles the seahawks line is completely inept everywhere but center and it not uncommon at all for them to surrender both interior and edge pressure simultaneously ,3,nfl

lnuw,xbox achievements are very bugged in this game i suggest you clear your cache then obtain the last card again if the achievement still does not unlock restart your console and do it again this should fix it for a while however the problem will likely come back a few play sessions later ,2,witcher
lnuw,that what igni is for ,1,witcher
lnuw,it funny that you use that term since only a child would struggle to understand that people goals and desires change when they grow up ,1,gaming
lnuw,different types of gamers have different standards and preferences for their games an avid rpg fan which seems to be the majority of reddit gamers may find cod madden or racing games mind numbingly monotonous and unfulfilling but not everyone has time to invest in rpgs there a lot of dialogue quests running around to the next destination inventory and stat management etc it difficult to get much done in an hour or less of playtime and some gamers dont even care about single player they just want to compete with their friends a game like the witcher or the elder scrolls is worthless to these people,9,gaming
lnuw,i would say it the ease at which you can get better in an mmorpg and rpgs in general a higher level character is a more powerful character to level up you need to grind though monotonous it is easy and you know that you are slowly but surely improving your character a stronger character will be more successful in pvp and pve which is the goal it for these same reasons that the mmo genre is all but dead gamers nowadays want their success to be determined by how skilled they are not by how much time they spent grinding they want action rpgs not traditional rpgs where stats make or break you ,2,gaming
lnuw,key differences bioware focused on relationship building with main and supporting characters a bioware game that does not make the player care about its characters is a bad bioware game combat tends to be squad or party based the player must coordinate his team in order to be successful in battle party members will often accompany you during your travels outside of combat as well leading to unique dialogue for each party member witcher focused on its dark atmosphere monster slaying and tough moral decisions certain characters are of personal importance to the pc however their relationship to the pc is derived from the books rather than built from scratch solo combat pc handles fights by himself and is expected to use every resource at his disposal melee magic potions bombs oils in any given encounter ,7,witcher
lnuw,she literally confirms that what she wants and of course she has reasons for it why would not she it would not make sense for anyone to randomly want things you are just trying to rationalize it in your head that it not what she wants because it does not have that fairy tale feeling of the witcher ending the only reason she wanted to be a witcher in the first place is because that the only life geralt ever taught her to know when given more than one option she made the decision for herself like an adult without geralt or yennefer influence the latter of whom would likely have supported the decision anyway deal with it ,1,gaming
lnuw,skyrim definitely has more things to do and allows more methods of completing objectives a dedicated stealth oriented player can sneak through an entire dungeon and steal all the treasure without ever getting detected a mage can turn an entire group of enemies on each other and or summon minions to do all their work for them and dungeons definitely do not look alike unless you are seriously penalizing a game for reusing certain textures to categorize different types,2,witcher
lnuw,even though they are both open world rpgs tw3 and skyrim are much more different than they are alike and yes tw3 is worth playing i will keep it brief the witcher 3 narrative driven while you can explore the world similar to how you would in skyrim the game is best experienced by sticking to the main quest and picking up side quests in villages and cities key choices made during some of these quests decide the fate of your friends and the world around you melee combat proficiency is the priority even if you spec into a more magic focused build you must at least get the hang of melee combat controls and mechanics to survive dodging rolling etc your character has a predetermined background that means certain actions will be off limits to you as a player you cannot slaughter a whole village for shits and giggles for example the trade off is that you get a deeper look into geralt personality through cut scenes and dialogue skyrim exploration driven while you can focus all your attention on the main quest and faction quests in doing so you would be missing out on a lot it about exploring every square inch of the world and starting new adventures that have nothing to do with the main quest melee combat is absolutely not required you can mix and match different mage thief and warrior skills to suit your personal play style you decide what kind of person your character is are you a homicidal psychopath who kills anyone who looks at you funny a thief whose only goal is to find treasure and would rather avoid unnecessary violence a sinister conjurer who prefers to let daedra minions and resurrected corpses do the dirty work ,10,witcher
lnuw,you do know i am mostly just saying all this to trigger you right do not even need high quality bait ,1,nfl
lnuw,i should have elaborated he would not have drops as a result of luck poorly thrown balls if a better qb like wilson was throwing to him ,1,nfl
lnuw, even when she decides to do it it not what she wants you have got to be kidding me there is a dialogue option where geralt specifically asks if that is what she wants and she gives a straightforward yes her reasoning is also sound monster slaying is a dying trade that ultimately cannot solve the main source of human suffering other humans if anything she worried that geralt would force her to not be empress because she knows that not the life he envisioned for her geralt being sad is what makes the ending sad not because ciri is being forced into a life she does not want ,1,gaming
lnuw, and yet you believe wilson would somehow do so for dorsett where exactly did i say this ,1,nfl
lnuw,it gets a bad rep from how it looks in the inventory screen in actual gameplay it absolutely fine,2,witcher
lnuw,well that mostly subjective and my criteria needs to be broad enough to account for games of different genres so a 10 10 horror game should make me feel genuine fear while an rpg could make me feel all kinds of strong emotions like guilt love anger etc ,1,gaming
lnuw,sweet i have never owned a playstation or nintendo console other than game boys so unfortunately i have not gotten an opportunity to play those games,2,gaming
lnuw,kotor mass effect 2 pokemon gold and silver these are just out of games that i have played ,3,gaming
lnuw,for me i rate games based on how highly i would recommend them to another person 10 10 unforgettable experience that will likely invoke strong emotional responses from the player flaws do not significantly impact gameplay or are hardly noticeable unless you are being nitpicky highest level of recommendation you are almost guaranteed to enjoy it 9 10 a game that you should definitely play before you die while there are some nagging flaws they do not take too much away from the overall experience highly recommended very likely that you will enjoy this 8 10 very good game that is worth its time investment solid gameplay all around not essential but still recommended to give this game a try 7 10 solid game that should hold your attention long enough to finish it while its strengths outweigh its flaws certain flaws may prove too glaring to overlook depending on the player recommended but not at full price 6 10 while certainly playable the game may struggle to hold the player attention until completion strengths generally outweigh flaws but not convincingly borrow game from a friend or buy it very cheap 5 10 competent enough to hold the player attention in spurts but not worth the time investment needed to finish you would be better off watching gameplay recordings online 4 10 poorly made game has some redeeming qualities but certainly not worth the time and money investment 3 1 borderline or completely unplayable not even worth a detailed review ,2,gaming
lnuw,9 10 game mainly because the vast majority of those question marks are just copy pasted monster nests bandit camps and treasure chests it actually a better experience if you focus on specific main quests and side quests rather than trying to discover all those mystery locations,1,xboxone
lnuw,she does not want to go see emhyr because it was not originally part of the plan why would she randomly visit her father out of the blue it ultimately her choice to go see him or not and if she does see him it again ultimately her choice whether she wants to become empress or a witcher but keep trying to rationalize an ending as forced just because you do not like it ,1,gaming
lnuw,you can look it up yourself if your idea of fix is eliminate all occurrences of the problem completely then no player has ever had his issues fixed ever ,1,nfl
lnuw,2012 bears vs patriots vs 49ers atlanta playoffs 2013 vs jaguars vs saints mnf cardinals falcons super bowl 48 2014 vs broncos washington rams eagles cardinals vs panthers playoffs 2015 vs steelers vs 49ers ravens cardinals vs browns vikings 2016 vs 49ers jets patriots vs bills vs cardinals bold indicates overall best of the best games imo ,7,Seahawks
lnuw,witcher 2 was a pretty good game i would not say it was amazing if there really was a large following it was probably drowned out by skyrim taking the internet by storm do not even try to argue it that game was undisputedly the king from 2011 2012,2,gaming
lnuw,kearse has a dropping problem every other year he was fine in 2013 and 2015 there your facts ,2,nfl
lnuw,i can also confirm that one can in fact see a tackle get beat ,2,nfl
lnuw,kearse drops balls because gasp receivers sometimes drop balls you keep picking at this issue as if i am supposed to be triggered by kearse drops,2,nfl
lnuw,they are pretty bad at run blocking it the only reason why they are not 1 instead of the cowboys or titans and yes i will attribute a large portion of their offensive success to their offensive line deal with it they consistently give rodgers at least 3 seconds of a clean pocket before he inevitably extends the play even further,1,Seahawks
lnuw,a very large following that apparently nobody noticed until 3 came out,1,gaming
lnuw, yes zero chance because the qb is not the problem his hands are the qb is never the problem when you are a colts fan ,2,nfl
lnuw,would people even be talking about tw2 if tw3 never came out no ,2,gaming
lnuw,kotor mass effect 2 pokemon gold silver,1,gaming
lnuw,do not listen to him he just loves to bash on skyrim whenever he can i played morrowind before skyrim and still had a lot of fun with both ,5,gaming
lnuw,too cheesy by traditional cinema standards too streamlined by the source material standards,2,gaming
lnuw,zero chance those words do not mean what you think they mean why would not you want to trade an unsalvageable bust for another team wr2 less weapons for wilson to throw to is a good thing ,2,nfl
lnuw,1 disagree i would rather live with a sub par rb or wr than lt not like it matters anyway since neither team has a dj or julio 2 montcrief was still the clear wr2 despite injury lockett had his snaps significantly limited until around the pats game or so effectively making him the wr3 for most of the season where did i say he was not part of the supporting cast 3 that works both ways at other times they were much better than the 25th best line seahawks line was just 32 all the way through with very little variance 4 really my bad then most recent grades i saw had britt at 80 9 and kelly at 81 5 or so colts still win the other 4 positions by a landslide ,1,nfl
lnuw,he does help kearse wo not turn him into cris carter though glad to see that you value your madden gameplay as much as your team irl,2,nfl
lnuw,some of the interceptions were on wilson yes if kearse drops were not consistently tipped right into the hands of the nearest db they would not have been that big of a deal now will you answer my question ,2,nfl
lnuw,sure he will fix dorsett dropsies my gripe with kearse is not even necessarily his drops so you wanna trade ,2,nfl
lnuw,i mean i will trade kearse for dorsett straight up if you will,2,nfl
lnuw,kearse problems transcend mere drops but thanks for trying also rated the worst or 2nd worst receiver in the nfl fwiw ,1,nfl
lnuw,what is wrong i thought colts fans loved playing with hypotheticals or is it only fun when you do it maybe luck would not be hurried so much if it didnt take him fucking forever to throw the ball oh wait that just the oc and pagano fault,1,nfl
lnuw,he would not have those drops if wilson was throwing to him and the colts line is much better especially when both are healthy but what should i expect from the 2nd biggest luck apologist on this sub,1,nfl
lnuw,1st of all you are right offensive line players are more important than receivers and runningbacks but keep trying to compare a te1 to a wr2 if it helps your argument 2nd lockett was not healthy last year so your point is irrelevant 3rd even with injuries those backups only dragged the colts line ranking down to 25th when they were healthy which they were at various points last season they were far better than 25 meanwhile the seahawks line was mostly healthy all year and still finished 32 4th source since you brought up pff kelly was graded higher than britt ,1,nfl
lnuw,you picked the wrong sub to ask this question but i will try to keep it as objective respectful and concise as i can witcher 3 is a narrative a driven game this means the main quest should take absolute priority followed by specific side quest lines that do impact the final ending the world is very large but there little variety to what you will find out in the wilderness combat mostly revolves around melee you can use simple magical spells called signs but you only have five at your disposal there also a crossbow but it sucks while this does not necessarily mean you should play as a melee build you do have to get the hang of that particular style of ganeplay if you want to survive skyrim is an exploration driven game its main quest is really just a formality as it is expected of you to just wander around and do whatever the hell you want dwarven ruins nordic tombs creepy caves if you want to see what is in them go right ahead saving the world can wait or you can massacre a whole town as a savage werewolf whatever melee combat is bleh obviously but archery and magic can be very fun and tactical especially with sneak ,1,witcher
lnuw,piercing cold just roll into a group of enemies and make them explode,1,witcher
lnuw,colts line is better at every position than their seattle counterparts the only reason they ranked 25th to begin with is because of injuries forcing backups to play even colts fans will tell you that so there a 5 player advantage to the colts hilton baldwin colts 6 seahawks 0 graham allen doyle colts 6 seahawks 1 montcrief kearse who is one of the worst starting receivers in the league colts 7 seahawks 1 gore rawls prosise depth does not mean shit when one team starter stays healthy while the other team entire corps gets ravaged with injury colts 8 seahawks 1 lockett dorsett having a better qb helps colts 8 seahawks 2 ,1,nfl

lnuw,for witcher 2 drink potions before heading out of hub areas you wo not be able to use them in the middle of combat do not try to tank even the weakest enemies will absolutely tear you apart if you try to jump into the middle of their group and hack away get used to rolling a lot and try to isolate the enemies furthest away from the rest and slowly pick them apart 2 3 slashes at a time ideally from the back make it a habit to cast quen before you jump in for melee attacks invest skill points in the igni sign if you can it has a good aoe and crowd control potential do not hoard your runes embed the best ones you have into the best sword you currently have you will find more later on sell all your mutagens if they are not of the greater category mutagens can be linked to certain skills but cannot be replaced with stronger ones when used though 3 is a lot more forgiving than 2 most of the tips above still apply except you can drink potions and eat food mid combat now but their effects only last between 20 90 seconds so use them judiciously you can do a quick dodge instead of a full roll now they put you in much better positions to counterattack monsters that lunge at you read the bestiary for tips on what potions oils bombs and signs to use against certain monsters even if the bestiary does not mention it igni will still wreck most enemies in the game so at least give it a try when you are fighting against groups you can swap mutagens in and out now so do not be afraid to just use the best ones you currently have ,2,witcher

lnuw,people do not improve on their weaknesses until someone or something specifically points them out they just do not at some point it ceases to become useful but i would not be surprised if carroll never reached that initial point of usefulness in the first place,1,nfl
lnuw,the vikings were not even a flash in the pan just a nice sizzle ,1,nfl
lnuw,gonna have to disagree talking people up leads them to become complacent more often than not by resting on the heels of their strengths they ignore their weaknesses only by exposing those weaknesses to the point of shame and embarrassment if need be will they be motivated to fix them,1,nfl

lnuw,radovid executes literally anyone who annoys him and the term mages encompasses not just magic users but alchemists and herbalists as well what he doing is basically the modern day equivalent of killing everyone with a master or ph d,4,gaming
lnuw,roethlisberger is not better than wilson right now he been outperformed by wilson despite having a bell brown and one of the best olines in the league to play with ,4,Seahawks
lnuw,1 does not matter 3rd down the most important down is almost always a pass even for run dominant teams we would be a better offense if we committed fully to a passing game instead of relying on wilson to manufacture one out of thin air 2 also irrelevant an og who can pass block with minimal help is far more valuable than one who needs the c to assist him every passing down interior pressure wrecks offenses 3 wrong passing can kill the clock just as efficiently as running the ball provided you have a qb who can reliably complete a routine pass the only thing that would stop the clock is an incomplete pass or running oob ,-1,Seahawks

lnuw,the point is some people actually do have a male roach so you cannot just assume everyone must refer to theirs as a female,1,witcher

lnuw,it a very good game but if you are looking for one game or a series of games i would recommend the mass effect trilogy over it they fit your description perfectly,1,gaming
lnuw,it in braille duh,7,gaming

lnuw,i thought this show only aired on monday ,3,nfl
lnuw,seriously as it is now you can drink any random decoction and get a huge melee and sign intensity bonus that surpasses both thunderbolt and petri philter it like cdpr just said fuck it who cares about balancing when they thought of this mutation ,1,witcher
lnuw,throwing the ball 40 50 times a game is far above average for any qb in 2015 the leader in pass attempts per game was philip rivers at 41 the average quarterback throws 30 40 times a game which wilson was clearly doing fuck off ,13,Seahawks
lnuw,i do not even need to reference second half of 15 as evidence that wilson is legit even before that stretch anyone who was not blind or a complete idiot could see that wilson was fucking legit when the ol could actually form a decent pocket of course they could never do it more than two games in a row until that aforementioned stretch ,11,Seahawks
lnuw,skyrim was the first game i bought when i got my 360 didnt need another game for months,2,gaming
lnuw,the circlejerk makes no exceptions ,3,gaming
lnuw,ok you are crazy ,1,nfl
lnuw,no the only two positions that are completely different are quarterback and non quarterback rings didnt stop barry sanders lt and eventually ad from being hall of famers ,0,nfl
lnuw,stop just stop palmer career is not even comparable to warner ,0,nfl
lnuw,palmer has no chance it unfortunate about his injury but fact is he been a middling qb for the vast majority of his career the fact that you would even consider him for the hall of fame is an insult to those already inducted,-1,nfl
lnuw,if lynch wins a ring this year without producing much of anything it wo not matter,4,nfl
lnuw,brandon browner has two rings with two teams back to back ,3,nfl
lnuw,the game removes all the main characters from the world after you finish the main quest you geralt are kind of warped back to a point in time before the events of act 3 happen so you are going to see some things that were supposed to change after the main quest but didnt it just a very lonely and awkward experience ,2,gaming
lnuw,the witcher 3 it a great game and cdpr should feel very proud of it i even give it 9 10 but it not flawless nor even close to it as reddit likes to suggest and i am not even referring to the combat which is actually fine unless you are the type who insists on hacking away at everything with your sword until they all die ,1,gaming
lnuw,mass effect 2 the different musical scores cut scenes and phases of the mission watching the normandy just barely escape from the explosion what an experience ,2,gaming
lnuw,kotor to this day it still remains the most memorable story i have ever experienced in a video game and i have not played it in many years honorable mention mass effect 2 best final mission of all time ,1,gaming
lnuw,eli and big ben are in with lynch it more about production than rings at this point,13,nfl
lnuw,i think we are rated just about right we dont deserve to be ranked as a top 5 team when we have missed the nfccg two years in a row and our oline has literally one established starter,6,Seahawks
lnuw,nice try you already exhausted the other two options you heathen ,2,witcher
lnuw,but what do you actually do from a gameplay perspective that different all you do is read it and honestly you do not even have to do that irl they do not really contain vital clues on how to find the treasure because the location is already marked on your map there no puzzles or minigames you have to refer to the notes to solve ,-1,witcher
lnuw,a place of power gives you something that is useful regardless of whatever gear or level you are at so no it not just extra special treasure lol monster dens are also the most common location of witcher gear diagrams which is the other thing that is actually worth finding oh and they are pretty much the only place you will find rare monsters that are not contracts good for you that you did not mind finding the same things over and over again many players including myself found ourselves burnt out from all of it ,1,witcher
lnuw,for a world so large they could and should have added more variety into the things you could find if you didnt mind slaughtering endless groups of bandits drowners nekkers and wolves fine more power to you but dont pretend that there was a lot to do out there because there really was not ,0,witcher
lnuw,not really the vast majority of undiscovered locations are just treasure monster nests aka loot with combat and bandit camps same as monster nests if youre lucky you will stumble upon a place of power or monster den but those are far too rare ,5,witcher
lnuw,can you name some of these qbs ,1,nfl
lnuw,grandmaster griffin all that sign intensity double casting is ridiculously good,1,witcher
lnuw,not that spooky when you with play with no damage mods,1,witcher
lnuw,because the person you are replying to is trying to play lawyer towards a literal video game character if cdpr felt there was more evidence necessary to confirm the full story they would have added something anything into the game for you to find but they did not because that what syanna is meant for they made the entire b w main quest rather straightforward to the point of hand holding as to what the player should do to get the happy ending regis warns you on three separate occasions not to summon detlaff if you take the fucking hint you will get a chance to speak with the character who can provide more detailed information than literally anything or anyone else available in the dlc at this point all you have to do is not choose the clearly unhelpful dialogue options and win a gwent match because nothing bad ever comes out of winning gwent ,1,witcher
lnuw,geralt takes matters into his own hands by killing people who do despicable actions all the time vigilantism is the way of the land in the world and time period the game takes place in the trial in custody argument is pure idealism those knights got what was coming to them ,1,witcher
lnuw, the treatment she endured can explain her behaviour not excuse it she caused the death of someone and she had to face the punishment for it in the end she just a petty vindictive manipulative and homicidal bitch geralt endures tons of hatred and mistrust daily too yet rises above it all and remain a good person let go over these descriptors one by one petty maybe to someone who has no idea what it like to go through an experience similar to syanna vindictive assuming that she had no reasonable motives for revenge which you clearly are doing manipulative i suppose so though that is not an quality that is unique to her in any way yen triss keira and every powerful figure in the game including anna are manipulative it how people get things done homicidal she killed four specific people for revenge it could be five if players treated her like you do and dismiss everything she tries to explain huh it almost as if cdpr wanted to punish players for not taking the numerous hints they give you go see the unseen elder despite regis warnings everybody dies do not listen to the character whose singular purpose from a gameplay perspective is to provide exposition on how and why the murders came to be everybody dies oh and geralt situation is not even remotely comparable the worst things people call him is a freak or mutant well the mutant bit is objectively true and freak is just an insulting way to point out someone who abnormal neither has anything to do with morality labeling someone as evil or a monster though that a direct attack on their morality and humanity take it a step further and start doing it when they are just a child with a highly impressionable mind they will believe whatever mommy and daddy believes ,2,witcher
lnuw, if one does not get any food for a prolonged period of time yes for a short time no that not starvation how long do you think it took them to escort her out of toussaint and into the caed dhu wilderness certainly no less than a couple of days but i guess you would rather argue semantics except she did not not really in her recollection of events she vaguely says she faced mockery insults and abuse was it disproportionate to her trying to evade them during the escort and her hurling threats at them certainly if it true it was not the least bit chivalric of them but we have no idea what and to what extent anyone did anything to her and whether it was disproportionate to her own actions have you like ever talked to someone in real life before people talk like this all the time when they are annoyed or think they heard something stupid syanna was clearly describing what the knights did to her and annoyed that geralt tried to defend them wonder why the developers also made her the only source of information regarding the unspeakable thing that peyrac peyran and de la croix all those years ago and not by accident she telling the truth you are just going through some mental gymnastics to justify your demonization of a character we are analysing a storyline in a game here so please do not resort to that tired old silencing technique not to mention that syanna was in no way an innocent victim she was sentenced to exile for an actual serious crime a large part of the ambiguity in the witcher games is that you never have the full story the only silencing technique being used here is the victim blaming her crime was apparently convincing a guy that she had visions of him being killed by his brother that is if you simply take anna word for it but i thought we never have the full story anna has a documented history of letting syanna take the blame for everything after all and even syanna says that she wanted to kill the duchess for forgetting about her and kill peyrac peyran for not standing up to her and du lac and de la croix for mocking and insulting her during the trip to the border though her story is oddly unspecific and their crimes seem to change every time you ask her from her personal experience it really did seem like her sister had forgotten about her anna claims that was not true and like with syanna the player is expected to just take her word for it anyway true or not syanna is apparently convinced that why she forgives anna when she easily could have killed her right then and there i literally just re watched her entire fairy tale land quest and nothing about her recollection of events is oddly unspecific that is assuming you are not going through mental gymnastics just to demonize her syanna even mentions she thought the bandits were going to rape her why do you think she would then suddenly be all vague and unspecific about any sexual abuse from the knights that does not make any sense sexual abuse is blatantly mentioned when the barons men said they plowed the snot out of that little shit about a farmers daughter or when they kick out a father of a house so they can have a bit of diversion with his daughter in crow perch neither of those are implied and you have to deduce what is going on that straight in your face sexual abuse there are even more examples i just cannot recall them all saying i thought they were going to rape me is not the same situation as saying they raped me it easy for people including the writers to use the word rape when it did not take place it much more difficult to use the word in a line of dialogue to reference such a sensitive event that why you never encounter a quest or interaction where an npc says something like please help they are going to rape me or my wife they raped her that why the henchmen use terms like plow and little bit of diversion to make the player instantly realize oh shit they are going to rape her without the script explicitly describing what is going on regardless abuse can encompass so much more than just rape such as beating and molesting ,-1,witcher
lnuw,dying from a fall,2,witcher
lnuw, being denied food during the escort out of the duchy is not equal to being starved what happens when you do not eat food you starve mhm but crespi was not ordered to beat me unconscious with a horsewhip after my first attempt at escape and du lac had no instructions to deny me food and abuse me exactly are you even reading what you wrote geralt tries to justify the knights not coming to syanna defense when her parents forced her into exile because they were supposed to follow orders she retorts by referencing specific things they were not ordered to do to reveal exactly what they did to her this is simple conversational analysis not to mention that this is the version syanna gives us we do not know the actual story or what the four knights would tell us if they still lived syanna has lied so many times and on such grand things that i do not consider her a reputable source if she can manipulate you can be sure she will she petty and vindictive lol victim blaming is that what we are gonna do she explaining why she wanted those specific people dead and we learned earlier in the plot that she wanted no more than five peyrac peyran alluded to these events at the very beginning of b w and syanna is there to connect the dots that the whole point of doing this quest no it does not the game brings up rape several times both in words and in actions past present and future even in the context of this quest nope it pretty much always implied leaving it up to the player to deduce what is going on you rarely if ever see an npc explicitly trying to rape someone you only hear women screaming but hey that could just be good old fashioned abuse right she tricked a nobleman into killing his brother with a false prophecy one can rightly argue that it was a harsh punishment but harsher punishments have been dealt for such crimes in the world of witcher she was unfairly treated since childhood but she was also doing a good job of living up to the expected role set for her of being a black sheep of the family due to the curse of the black sun the death of the noblemans brother was just the final straw she was labeled as the black sheep since birth anna was not exactly an angel either but guess who bore the brunt of the blame when she was out of line syanna it a self fulfilling process she could never just be a normal person who makes mistakes sometimes everything she did wrong in her life was a symptom of her curse do not underestimate the severe psychological impact that can have on someone that the type of shit that leads kids today to commit suicide or columbine shootings ,2,witcher
lnuw,regretting what you did is easy standing up for what is right even when you know you are outnumbered takes true nobleness and courage but i guess that why his death was supposed to symbolize the lack of courage ,2,witcher
lnuw,syanna was not only whipped but starved and abused abused in this context heavily implies rape or molestation as the game consistently tries to avoid explicitly using these terms they then ditched her in the wilderness with no money and barely any clothing expecting her to die from hunger or get eaten by monsters ,7,witcher
lnuw,i suppose he could have a hof career assuming he can keep up his 2015 level of play for 5 more years but i expect him to play closer to how he did in 2016 as his rushing ability declines,1,nfl
lnuw,inaccurate qb with a front runner attitude still top 10ish qb to me ,3,nfl
lnuw,yes and syanna was provoked by literally everyone she grew up around because they labeled her a monster out of pure superstition oh and there that whole matter of being raped tortured and left for dead by the chivalrous knights that were supposed to deport you out of your home ,-1,witcher
lnuw,well that very unfortunate for you then ,2,nfl
lnuw,mario ,2,witcher
lnuw,how many characters did you kill because of their despicable actions the coroner whoreson junior nathaniel ,1,witcher
lnuw,you are blaming syanna for detlaff inability to control his emotions it was his choice to summon an army of vampires upon the city while syanna was crammed into the fairy tale world by her sister syanna wanted revenge on the men who raped and tortured her detlaff killed dozens of people who had nothing to do with the plot ,1,witcher
lnuw,lmfao we are not even close to our 2012 2013 teams without wilson ,1,nfl

lnuw,did i say you were racist regardless you are already complaining about something that has not even happened i am also not sure what the actor dietary preferences gender identity religious beliefs and other skills have to do with anything where did you even find this meme ,1,witcher
lnuw,what seven potions are you drinking ,1,witcher
lnuw,blood and wine it improved upon things the base game did not do so well more variety in undiscovered locations gear that actually surpasses your witcher equipment armor dyes liberating abandoned sites actually feels like you added a whole new settlement and moar vampyrez,1,witcher
lnuw,ap was only 217 pounds when he was a rookie he gained a lot of weight since then ,2,Seahawks
lnuw,igni is less effective against random bandits since humans have very little health and the burning damage is therefore a bit lower against drowners and nekkers igni is still very efficient because it stunlocks entire groups and gives a free opening to finish them each with melee as opposed to attacking dodging then repeat also euphoria is op and you should feel bad for using it ,1,witcher
lnuw,depends as open world rpgs they both do things well that the other does not from a narrative standpoint tw3 wins pretty handily it much more focused on the main quest and there are numerous side quests you can do that will affect your final ending these side quests stand out above the rest as priorities because of the characters and repercussions involved skyrim true to tes fashion does not try to push any particular quest lines over others while this is good in that it allows the player to carve out their own character path none of the quest lines intersect in ways that they potentially could have it would have been awesome if the companions and the thieves guild were in conflict with another for example or the dark brotherhood could have impacted the outcome of the civil war skyrim left a lot lying on the table in this respect from an exploration standpoint skyrim wins while tw3 world may be prettier actually exploring it in search of a whole new adventure unrelated to the main quest is rather disappointing there are only six types of locations you will find out in the wilderness bandit camps sometimes doubling as abandoned sites monster nests also sometimes abandoned sites guarded treasures hidden treasures places of power and monster dens of these six only the latter two are the ones you actually look forward to finding but they are also by far the most rare so what you will mostly end up doing is slaughtering the same old bandits drowners and wolves over and over again it can get pretty frustrating tbh skyrim on the other hand seems to offer a memorable experience around every corner this is aided by the fact that it contains numerous dungeons all of which have unique designs and are often associated with their own unique quests i vividly remember a dungeon where you find a friendly hagraven that seeks revenge on her traitorous sister and you can basically tag along as she rampages through legions of witches even without the dungeons skyrim offers a truly open world an angry bear can literally chase you across the entire map provided a dragon does not swoop down and attack you both or you pass by a patrolling group of soldiers who can intervene tw3 does not offer that because all enemies will cease aggro once you step out of a certain area this means you can cheese through a lot of difficult fights by standing outside an enemy aggro range and throwing bombs until they die as for combat it closer than many may think tw3 has better melee combat hands down but skyrim has far better archery and magic there nothing quite like eliminating a group enemies one by one while you snipe them from the shadows undetected and there only so many times you can cast the same five signs until you just say fuck it i am going in with my sword in skyrim you can play as a pure mage without getting bored of your play style summon two dremora lords check make everyone slaughter each other check blast lightening storm from your hands check which game combat is better depends on how heavily you weigh each of the combat styles tl dr tw3 is better if you are looking for a strong narrative driven game that emphasizes melee combat gameplay skyrim is better if you are looking for an exploration driven game and favor a stealth archery or mage gameplay style,5,gaming
lnuw,have there actually been rumors that he to be cast as geralt if yes then let us discuss if no then take your angry white man complex to r the d,13,witcher
lnuw,false igni true power comes from its burning damage which scales with sign intensity and the enemy health more sign intensity greater chance to burn greater of health damage per second on death march igni becomes even more useful as everything has more health and therefore take more damage sec from igni oh and the stunlocking effect is pretty sweet too ,1,witcher
lnuw,who is our current rival it like a revolving door just like our oline,6,nfl
lnuw,there no point in making your rpg open world if you are just gonna cater to the people who only do the main quest,1,witcher
lnuw,and fragile,3,Seahawks
lnuw,yup this is pretty common quests are overly generous with experience given after completion which leads to them being overly stingy once you have inevitably out leveled some others ,3,witcher
lnuw,really i could not tell ,2,gaming
lnuw,the fanboys are pretty insufferable if anything they are just ruining the game for new players by touting it as the most flawless perfect game ever created the only thing they are accomplishing with that is by making the flaws more noticeable to people trying it for the first time with sky high expectations,0,gaming
lnuw,prosise is anything but a workhorse back,15,Seahawks

lnuw,she not ugly but her face reminds me of andrew garfield ,2,porninfifteenseconds

lnuw,it a gargoyle there not many options when fighting these keep quen up at all times if you get hit cast quen again try to position yourself behind the monster then hit him with a strong attack or 2 3 fast attacks then dodge away before it retaliates repeat until dead ,4,witcher
lnuw,whatever just came out the newer the game the more searches there will be for it on youtube,4,gaming
lnuw,maybe dragon age it on sale right now,3,gaming
lnuw,about the same the game achievements are also heavily bugged and randomly stop unlocking every three play sessions or so it very easy to miss story related achievements that you did complete but during a period when the game stopped tracking your progress still even accounting for the bugs far less than 50 of players finished the main quest ,2,xboxone
lnuw,no ,-1,witcher
lnuw,because the mages are not actually all mages many of them are merely alchemists herbalists or specialize in other skills deemed heresy by the witch hunters then there also their family members who may not be anything close to mages but must be evacuated all the same portals could be used to transport two people at a time but then where would they go there a limit to how far you can teleport and kovir is well beyond that limit so best case scenario you end up in velen a war torn wasteland infested with monsters and not nearly enough houses to shelter a family ,14,witcher

lnuw,eagles fans only know pain how to feel it how to inflict it ,39,nfl
lnuw,the devs didnt push the limits quite hard enough is the problem after a while the contracts started devolving into mere fetch quests fetch quests with awesome boss fights true but the writing gradually fell off an alternative exposition a week ago my son and his friends went out hunting they usually return by the next morning but no one has seen them since when we went into the woods that night to look for them we found a camp full of mutilated bandit corpses and animals we then heard a terrible roar and were forced to flee the site as our horses abandoned us i fear whatever killed the bandits may have taken my son please find him then you go and do your usual detective thing and find a couple more corpses of what must be the son friends but they have no external wounds at all it seems they died solely from internal bleeding only magic could have done this you follow a two pairs of footprints into a cave that seems to be inhabited by a witch or druid if in skellige you hide and wait for the witch to return and have the choice to kill her outright or interrogate her if you interrogate her you will learn that the hunters led by the son killed her pet wolf she cast a spell that caused two to die painfully then cast a curse that turned the son into a werewolf the only way to reverse the curse is by consuming the heart of one whom he loves she will only tell you where to find him if you let her live if you kill her the werewolf will eventually murder half the village population and you will have to kill it there if you let her live you will now have a choice go directly to the werewolf to kill it or return to the father and tell him the truth if you go to the father he will offer his life to lift his son curse at this point you can respect his decision or go off on your own to kill his son if you let thr father sacrifice himself he will give you the key to loot the chest in his house before you meet his son i just wrote that entire quest as i went along if a random fan on the internet could write that in a few minutes cdpr really has no excuse for rehashing the same exposition over and over ,1,witcher
lnuw,well this was not one of those monsters so what is your point ,1,witcher
lnuw,in the case of a werewolf there would be concerns over mutilated corpses and farm animals found out in the fields or a caravan that was supposed to arrive a few days ago but never did you know things that a werewolf would likely be responsible for ,1,witcher
lnuw,tbh it kind of 50 50 wraith contracts were always great as were the chort and vampires others kind of recycled the my relative is missing please find him and it always seems to be a male story too much i mean i am 100 sure he already dead but i need the money so ,11,witcher
lnuw,only the uj comments are serious everything else is a parody of what you will typically find on r gaming ,2,witcher
lnuw,the bestiary entry is not added until you have already defeated the monster so it pretty useless for first encounters like this one,2,witcher
lnuw,mass effect 2 is personally my favorite game of all time and i am generally not a fan of shooters make sure to play it without any guides ,1,witcher
lnuw,yrden and aard shouldve worked on him without taking away the suspense,1,witcher
lnuw,it does not help that you used axii which gives you a strong instant kill chance itself,1,witcher
lnuw,the most satisfying way to beat the shaelmarr ia by throwing throwing bomb at a wall to take advantage of the fact that it detects danger through sound it will then target the area of the impact and roll right into it knocking itself over every guide i have seen didnt seem to notice this,5,witcher
lnuw, r gamingcirclejerk is pure satire nothing more nobody actually means what they say on that sub i think ,4,witcher
lnuw,geralt yen triss and ciri are the most life like characters imo,2,witcher
lnuw,which opponent is this ,1,witcher
lnuw,you can still take the notes from her without killing her,2,witcher
lnuw,swords have more variety in kill cams,3,skyrim
lnuw,her lips are very distracting way too much teeth exposure nobody talks like that in real life,1,gaming
lnuw,the insane thing is with euphoria you can drink any random non combat related decoction like werewolf and immediately gain a higher melee and sign intensity bonus than if you had drank a thunderbolt and petri philter and it lasts 30 minutes it actually ends up trivializing any thought process needed when choosing what potions to drink since you can now drink literally anything and instantly become the angel of death ,1,witcher
lnuw,it op even if you are not an alchemy build all you need is acquired tolerance i have only used it once for a certain boss fight and never touched it again if there was ever something that needed to be nerfed this is it ,1,witcher
lnuw,i would be pretty angsty too if my father sold me off to be raped by a daedric lord and then got sealed underground for centuries by my mother to prevent said father from bringing the vampire apocalypse down on the planet,1,skyrim
lnuw,keep wearing at least three pieces of the grandmaster griffin armor set the double cast bonus is just too good to let go of you can swap out the trousers for the grandmaster wolven version as it offers the same stats 11 attack power recommended mutations piercing cold euphoria second life conductors of magic new skills depends on what you already have,1,witcher
lnuw,nope no mods this is on the xbox one version i am wearing the grandmaster griffin set with gray dye on the trousers and white dye everywhere else,2,witcher
lnuw,that what he gets for playing the monster deck,4,witcher
lnuw,well it definitely working,0,witcher
lnuw,remind me of the last time the team with the best oline won the super bowl,4,Seahawks
lnuw,might want to watch the game again then after the first drive the oline started to let falcons literally leak through unblocked every other play fox even showed replays of the shit to make sure everyone noticed,0,nfl
lnuw,the statement in question was regarding a fantasy like draft that means every qb gets a new oline considering 4 5 of last year starting oline would not even be drafted in this do over i would assume wilson would enjoy a pretty nice upgrade there,0,nfl
lnuw,good qb top 10 probably top 5 fuck outta here ,20,nfl
lnuw, it can be both like with carroll and wilson or brady and belichick oh so the two most hated teams with fans seriously debating whether wilson and brady are system qbs durr how many ringz would brees win with belichick would the seahawks go 16 0 or just 15 1 if they had luck as their qb give me a fucking break nobody questions carroll or belichick but their qbs are always fair game ,2,nfl
lnuw,oh give me a fucking break the witcher 3 open world has even less interesting things to explore than skyrim and i am a fan of the game everything you find in tw3 is one of the following generic bandit camp abandoned site kill everyone and loot generic monster nest abandoned site kill everything press a button to blow up the nest then loot guarded treasure fight an uncommon but not rare monster then loot some gear that probably worse than what you already have hidden treasure basically a more annoying version of guarded treasure you fight weak generic monsters and the loot is hidden behind some bushes place of power one of the only two things you actually look forward to finding because the reward is not instantly rendered obsolete by your current gear monster den the other thing you look forward to finding since you will probably find a rare monster diagrams for stuff you will actually want to use the latter two are by far the rarest and more often than not you end up slaughtering random bandits weak monsters and wolves,4,gaming
lnuw,i am speaking of the elder scrolls lore not the skyrim main quest which barely scratches the surface of the former and quite honestly left a lot on the table you would know that if you actually bothered to slow down and read some damn books in the game the ones with seemingly boring titles and multiple volumes it that kind of stuff that makes the elder scrolls games so critically acclaimed not huge climactic sequences or insane plot twists it the inevitability of being on your way to complete some set objective stumbling by something that grabs your attention for a moment then forgetting your previous objective and getting sucked into a whole different quest altogether before you realize it it been an hour or perhaps several hours since you last made progress on that quest you initially supposed to be doing even professional video game critics who know they have a limited amount of time to play the game and therefore try to complete the main quest in time to write a review get sucked into this cycle because it works it just works ,4,gaming
lnuw,no ,10,nfl
lnuw,what big ben is a hall of fame lock just maybe not first ballot,15,Seahawks
lnuw,you seem deeply upset guess now is not the best time for me to share how i played morrowind goty edition first loved it then played skyrim several years later and loved that too im afraid you might explode were someone to contradict you,4,gaming
lnuw,it one of the deepest and most ambitious fictional lores ever created in video gaming i am not sure what you consider to be creative lore but the elder scrolls has been one of the standard bearers of the genre since before you were likely even born ,7,gaming
lnuw, even the lore is dull and lacks creativity haha ok i almost took this post seriously until i read it over again maybe next time train your sneak skill before trying to disguise your trolling ,6,gaming
lnuw, side quests in any game can be boiled down and dismissed as fetch quests if one truly wants to look at them that way that includes darlings like the witcher 3 skyrim has plenty of side quests that are not just go here and kill retrieve x then come back for your reward ,2,gaming
lnuw,any good qb that hasnt won a super bowl as if being good entitles a player to a ring and if he doesnt have one that means everyone else around him is incompetent,65,nfl
lnuw,nobody cares about that besides bitter fans on the internet two rings is hall of fame troy aikman was not nearly as dynamic as wilson was and played on absurdly stacked teams didnt matter three rings ,36,Seahawks
lnuw,eh regardless of where you think he ranks among the sb winning coaches there is literally no objective argument you could use to place zimmer above him but what should i expect from a sub that still believes that elite talents somehow deserve to win super bowls ,-1,nfl
lnuw,how many 7 9 seasons would you endure for a super bowl ,10,nfl
lnuw,i love how this sub selectively decides whether a team is successful solely due to the coach or the qb but never both at the same time,11,nfl
lnuw,so he a top 10 qb except in games that actually matter ,1,nfl
lnuw,still won more super bowls than quinn and rivera combined,15,nfl

lnuw,the constant peyton manning dick sucking leading up to the game is what made the blowout so satisfying ,3,nfl
lnuw,surfaces in skyrim just have insane friction coefficients ,2,gaming
lnuw,saying it four times does not make it true,2,gaming
lnuw,play the gwent related quests problem solved ,6,witcher
lnuw,that shoulder to hip ratio is kinda crazy ,1,witcher
lnuw,there definitely some book reader elitism pervading through here of course the book readers themselves wo not admit it because nobody likes being called an elitist but it pretty obvious to those outside their group ,7,witcher
lnuw,the talking roach quest is called equine phantoms i will let you google where to find it anyway other side quests i do not think you should miss are goodness gracious great balls of granite a portrait of the witcher as an old man gwent tournament fists of fury extreme cosplay big game hunter ,3,witcher
lnuw,not faster than wilson this year,1,nfl
lnuw,imo i think what made eredin a poor villain was that he came off as more of a major asshole than anything else yeah he probably evil too but at the bare minimum level not nearly as intimidating as gaunter o would imm and there never a point in the story where you believe there might be a peaceful resolution like with detlaff he just a big jerk who deserves to get his ass kicked for his shitty one liners as much as the grief he caused ciri ,2,witcher
lnuw,this is probably the most accurate explanation look at the bottom right corner of the thumbnail pass block efficiency measures pressures allowed per snap a team that predominantly runs a higher percentage of running plays will present fewer opportunities to pressure the qb,0,nfl
lnuw,the way she twitches her head freaks me the fuck out,6,witcher
lnuw,easier said than done wilson also gets rid of the ball faster than luck and rivers so the pressure does not materialize,3,nfl
lnuw,present ,1,nfl
lnuw,use some kind of ranged attack to hit the glowing paintings crossbow aard sweep igni etc you can try to hit them with melee but this requires you to waste precious seconds getting into position,1,witcher
lnuw,it only looks good if geralt has facial hair and is wearing certain sets of armor i do not think it the worst though that honor goes to the shaved on the sides short on top and a ponytail ,4,witcher
lnuw,that a different location with a bruxa,3,witcher
lnuw,it not the same universe it a different universe based on that which is presented in the books the triss in the games is cdpr version of a fictional character that originated in the sapowski books that how artistic interpretations work the most classic example is dracula he was originally presented in bram stoker novel with a particular set of characteristics and attributes but the dracula from the movies always deviate from the source novel sunlight is almost always fatal to dracula in the movies even though that was not the case in the books some movies give dracula an origin story that is not present in the books and none of them are wrong they each take the basic attributes of a fictional character and modify him in a way that best fits how they want to tell their story the witcher games are no different in this regard ,0,gaming
lnuw,well she a fictional character in a separate medium of storytelling so yes ,1,gaming
lnuw,good thing we are not playing the books,0,gaming
lnuw,that still is not quite accurate though it should be pressures per dropback because not all will lead to an actual pass attempt ,0,nfl
lnuw,fewer pass attempts,1,nfl
lnuw,no specific approach is needed my character should not have to be a smooth talker just to beat the main quest and he she damn well need not grind through a retarded minigame to become one though i do agree that there needs to be some standards for the specific guilds ,1,ElderScrolls
lnuw,in the mass effect trilogy you increase your proficiency with persuasion by continually choosing paragon renegade options when they arise the only exception was the first game which like oblivion was clunky in comparison to its sequels there no point to including a stat if it effect is unoticable lol so if i play and beat the whole game using sword and shield and never use destruction magic then that means there no point in having a destruction skill after all having a low destruction skill had no noticeable effect on my gameplay or story progression same with blunt 2h weapons my lack of proficiency in those skills did not hinder me in any way guess they need to go ,1,ElderScrolls
lnuw,sure why not fact is for at least one season luck had a team around him that could win at least 6 games without him ,1,nfl
lnuw,by passively i mean does not require deliberate grinding to level high speechcraft is not required to pass the majority of persuade checks in the game just get better prices at stores but since you are rich anyway who cares this is how persuasion mechanics work in the majority of successful rpgs mass effect the witcher etc as long as you use it when the opportunity is there you are on the right track ,1,ElderScrolls
lnuw,cool story does not make the above statement any less true ,1,nfl
lnuw,get outta here with your facts,16,nfl
lnuw,in skyrim the speech skill is trained passively when you go shopping there are also opportunities to gain large chunks of experience through persuade and intimidate dialogue options not like it really matters since the skill doesnt make any significant impact on the gameplay experience anyway nor should it ,1,ElderScrolls
lnuw,my point is it was fucking awful and bethesda did everyone a favor by removing it from the franchise a lockpicking mini game i can understand but when it comes to dialogue just cut the bullshit,1,ElderScrolls
lnuw,it does not matter if i want to or not i am forced to do it because the minigame requires you to use all four comment types in some order i cannot just tell a joke and be done with it i have to tell a joke kiss their ass show off how big my dick is then threaten them yup just your everyday conversation there ,1,ElderScrolls
lnuw,igni master race ,1,witcher
lnuw,no it tedious and represents nothing like how you would converse with someone in real life if you know someone hates jokes why the hell would you incessantly pester them with jokes if they like to be flattered why not just flatter them and leave all the counterproductive bullshit aside the worst part is that once is never enough you have to keep playing the damn mini game with the same npc over and over until they finally like you enough to reveal some highly sensitive information ,1,ElderScrolls
lnuw,brawling builds camaraderie in nord culture so it makes sense in skyrim context please tell me how constantly talking shit making jokes and kissing ass to someone in various orders improves your relationship with them ooooh i kind of like you right now now i dont like you now i really like you now i only like you a little better than i did before you made those four comments rinse and repeat until they like you enough to give you some secret piece of information or a store discount ,1,ElderScrolls
lnuw,no it was worse than boring it became an awful chore in and of itself that forced you to look at the hideous potato faces far longer than you would ever want to,1,ElderScrolls

lnuw,i gave you advice as someone who has literally no problem winning games with the skellige deck and swept the gwent tournament on his first try maybe if you actually elaborated on how you try to play with the deck instead of complaining about apparently weak mechanics people would have given you more helpful advice to tweak your play style as it is it seems like you are asking for an elaborate walkthrough on how to play with a fairly straightforward deck ,2,witcher
lnuw,they did know the play it was literally one of the biggest storylines after the game butler and browner diagnosed the play perfectly rofl not even an option http www nfl com gamecenter 2014092112 2014 reg3 broncos seahawks menu gameinfo 7ccontentid 3a0ap3000000398444 tab videos ,3,nfl
lnuw,the patriots obviously did expect the ball to go to him because they knew the play itself lockette was also known as a pretty poor route runner which bevell alluded to in the post game interview you think butler would have put lynch on his ass if he was the receiver on that play ,3,nfl
lnuw,on the right side of your screen there should be a checkbox that lets you show my flair on this subreddit click the edit button below it,2,witcher
lnuw,severance your melee damage should be strong enough that bleeding effects make a negligible impact by comparison severance helps ensure that you actually hit your targets with all that power ,1,witcher
lnuw,and eli playing well in the postseason capped off by an all time great play ,5,nfl
lnuw,they also had a quarterback that could beat the pats,7,nfl
lnuw,first things first remove all unit cards without special abilities they are a waste of space also remove the unit cards that come with a commander horn effect their strength is too weak to make up for their lack of flexibility then choose between the clan an craite warriors or the heavy longship set these are the tight bond cards it may seem tempting to have two strong bond sets in the same deck but in reality you will just end up drawing one card from each set a lot of the time making both cards useless remove one set keep the other as your go to when you do not have cerys shield maidens next remove almost all your weather effect cards clear weather is absolutely pointless because unlike the other 4 decks skellige does not tend to favor any one particular row you also have a leader card that mitigates the effects even further and the power of tight bond cards is also more than capable of overcoming them this should be obvious but add your best neutral cards as well mysterious elf yennefer geralt ciri villentrenemerth gaunter o dimm darkness decoys commander horns scorches every faction must have these cards as for berserkers they are purely optional however i would always remove the close combat berserker and at least two of the mushroom cards ermion is more useful yet is a ranged unit card for that reason keep 2 3 young berserkers if berserkers are more of an annoyance to you just remove this set completely cerys is your trump card your nuke play her at the right time and it game over play her at the wrong time and she becomes a generic 10 strength hero i highly recommend getting a powerful non hero card on the field before you play her to bait the opponent into using their scorch card s you can do this in a variety of ways though the best is to use commander horn on a moderately strong unit card already on the field ,3,witcher
lnuw, implying that eli manning was carried to his two super bowl runs,-10,nfl
lnuw,the skellige deck is fine you most likely have filled it with cards that are situationally useful at best what are the exact cards in your deck right now i can give you advice on what cards to add or remove ,2,witcher
lnuw,i love our uniforms especially compared to the awful reebok jerseys that came before only problem i have is the lime green on the shoulders it so out of place ,1,Seahawks
lnuw,tfw no corrinne tilly romance option,10,witcher
lnuw,revival in cleveland lol,-11,nfl
lnuw,different strategies apply to different decks as a general rule i always save my powerful scorch able cards until the end of the round to make sure my opponent does not have a scorch ready it especially important with bonded cards ,1,witcher
lnuw,honestly no ,5,nfl
lnuw,lockette had never scored once in his career on that play why bevell chose him to make the super bowl winning play is beyond any comprehensible rationale ironically lynch was the only receiver to score on that play earlier in the season ,13,nfl
lnuw,removing cards you dont want from your deck is just as important as adding good cards to it a lot of people complain that the non nilfgaard northern realms decks are unplayable because they always get stuck with shitty hands then you look at what they keep in their decks and find that there a bunch of useless cards the key to drawing consistently good hands is to trim all out the unwanted fat from the deck ,5,witcher
lnuw,the awful memes most common offense is big if true it not funny it never was funny and it wo not get any funnier anytime soon ,209,nfl
lnuw,all the skill trees are good enough to win the game by themselves id rather just list some abilities i think are universally useful that you can acquire relatively early 1 active shield renders swallow and almost every other healing method obsolete let your enemies heal you 2 aard sweep geralt finds himself outnumbered a lot there is no better crowd control than knocking everyone around you on their ass with an opportunity to instant kill them 3 muscle memory more damage on your most commonly used sword attack 4 acquired tolerance lets you drink more stronger potions and decoctions the default maximum 100 toxicity is a huge handicap later on in the game 5 delusion unlocks new dialogue options very important if you dont necessarily want to kill or pay everyone that looks at you funny,3,witcher
lnuw,mine records up to 5 minutes max not 30,1,gaming

lnuw,sure do still savoring that memory while you still can until week 4 ,9,nfl
lnuw,opponents 27 now you are just making up numbers in every year since wilson entered the league the seahawks have had a larger of their drives start within their own 20 than the falcons by the yards game metric wilson just had his best passing season to date and ryan was not even the best qb in his own division and what about bad pass percentage that the only measurement that stands independent of other variables not true at all this metric does not distinguish between throwaways and actually inaccurate passes wilson is consistently near the top of the league in total number of throwaways regardless of how high or low his total pass attempts are playing with consistently bottom tier pass protection will do that to a quarterback ,1,nfl
lnuw,it really my fault for even bothering to engage in conversation with someone who actually places value on yards per game hopefully after today i will be better at resisting the temptation,1,nfl
lnuw, total qbr though tells us more of the story haha ok i think we are done here have a good weekend ,0,nfl
lnuw,most of which wilson has a distinct advantage over ryan but wait le dephense amirite ,0,nfl
lnuw,because randy moss was not already an all pro caliber receiver before he got to new england ,14,nfl
lnuw,yup and colts fans will try their damnedest to make sure nobody remembers it,-4,nfl
lnuw,there was a hail mary attempt against the chargers where the ball didnt even come close to the end zone weakest hm ive ever seen,1,nfl
lnuw,not surprised you believe in made up facts after all ,1,nfl
lnuw,passing dvoa and passer rating are the king and queen of advanced passing metrics,0,nfl
lnuw,yeah because perennial contenders just draft qbs in the first round all the time for the lolz,1,Seahawks
lnuw,the entire city of seattle would riot fuck outta here with that bullshit,1,Seahawks
lnuw,there are no stats that back it up he is literally just citing a small sample of plays and presenting it as wilson in a nutshell,5,Seahawks
lnuw,because your coaching is actually good,3,nfl
lnuw,lol keep spouting off dem yardz as if they were ever an indicator of quality qb play,0,nfl
lnuw,there is no significant correlation between defensive performance and passer rating it a made up theory used by those who want to discredit qbs who happen to play with good defenses and lynch has never rushed more than 25 times a game in any of the seasons since wilson was the qb where do people come up with this garbage ,1,nfl
lnuw,ryan has not been elite for years and he not elite now he will fall back to earth this season without kyle shanahan the true architect of that historic offense but for the next couple months keep telling yourself that sark will be a competent replacement he wo not be but it feels good to believe ,1,nfl
lnuw,it 2017 and people still believe that defense and a running game which wilson has been the catalyst of since he entered the league are responsible for his 2nd highest passer rating all time ,2,nfl
lnuw,cool he 1 0 against rodgers in a blowout win also ryan rodgers confirmed also 0 1 against kaepernick kaep ryan it is i see you are now making excuses for why ryan cannot consistently make the playoffs in a division that as recently as 2014 didnt even require a winning record to clinch since your understanding of math is clearly very limited let me explain why that important 2014 2010 the year is 2017 2014 is closer to 2017 than either are to 2010 bonus math wilson was drafted in 2012 2012 2010 bonus 2x since 2011 an nfcw team made it to the nfc championship game 5 years in a row and the super bowl 3 in a row nfc south current streak 2 nfcc and two sb appearances keep talking shit,0,nfl
lnuw, shani over the crones you have bold taste my friend ,20,witcher
lnuw,respecting an mvp is not synonymous with anointing him top 3 in the conference can newton was not top 3 coming off his mvp season neither is ryan also funny how you talk shit about the nfcw when ryan failed to make the playoffs three straight years including one where the eventual division winner was 7 8 1,1,nfl
lnuw,4300 yards is an incredibly arbitrary number which wilson will likely break this coming season anyway yards are the worst stat to determine qb play wilson set a career high for yards this past season yet everyone can agree it was also his worst season to date even when taking into account ryan mvp season 117 passer rating wilson worst season passer rating 92 6 is about equal to ryan career average take away both qb best seasons and the gap widens even further,1,nfl
lnuw,right sorry i must have overestimated your intelligence ,1,nfl
lnuw,wilson offfensive line has consistently ranked dead last or close to it in pass protection every year he been in the league check any football analysis site they will all confirm it then again i am conversing with someone who thinks moar yards bedder qb so that might all fly right over your head,0,nfl
lnuw,wilson never had a pretty good offensive line or anything even close to that thus far in his career,0,nfl
lnuw,last season was ryan first with a cumulative passer rating over 100 and he been playing on a loaded offense since 2011,2,nfl
lnuw,that honestly pretty dumb the whole point of making an open world rpg is to encourage players to do as many side quests as they can ,2,witcher
lnuw,dont you have to pay 30k out the ass for him to be able to do that ,1,witcher
lnuw,dandelion and zoltan are definitely not at the rosemary and thyme,2,witcher
lnuw,instead of reloading a save you could have just spared the boss the bandits will all respawn and you can obliterate them over and over,3,witcher
lnuw,pro tip use the piercing cold mutation it turns a normally hectic fight into a complete massacre in your favor,5,witcher
lnuw,if his ints are a disqualifier then brett favre should not have sniffed the hall of fame,3,nfl
lnuw,but luck has more wins then again it been said by many a colts fan that wins are a team stat hmm ,1,nfl
lnuw,he plays the game in such a way that got him two super bowl mvps,6,nfl
lnuw,just finished it it was a blacksmith in lindenvale that i had literally never talked to before and i have finished all three main quests,16,witcher
lnuw,yup won the tournament i am pretty certain there a random merchant somewhere i have yet to beat ,3,witcher
lnuw,the qb who is 1st place in all time ints is a hall of famer and also happens to have one fewer super bowl than eli,7,nfl
lnuw,it says i have exactly one new card left that can be won from a player,8,witcher
lnuw,i have one card left and no idea who i need to play to win it,22,witcher
lnuw,but dem yards doe ,1,nfl
lnuw,how so being one of the top 100 players in a league of nearly 2000 is still a huge compliment,7,nfl
lnuw,every team has 22 starters there are 32 teams 32 x 22 704 just being in the top 100 means you are among the top 14 of all starters in the league,4,nfl
lnuw,the blacksmith in the novigrad fish market has the toughest monster deck i have ever played against every time i played him he would either crush me outright or win by a hair it was infuriating,2,witcher

lnuw,lmfao cam newton the guy who alpha dog when his whole team is dominating but slinks away when it clear it not his best day that your it factor ,6,nfl
lnuw,depends on how pure the sign build is i consider myself a sign build even though i have only 5 blue abilities active griffin school techniques 4 red abilities 1 green and 1 more yellow battle frenzy i have never used archgriffin decoction thunderbolt tawny owl ekhidna is more than sufficient battle frenzy razor focus precise blows mastercrafted griffin sword means i enter combat with 28 chance to crit which quickly increases to 44 actually i think since it stormy weather during the eredin boss fight superior thunderbolt guarantees i crit every time first time it took me a while to beat eredin and caranthir because i played really conservatively then i re played the quest with a more aggressive approach beat caranthir in 2 minutes eredin still took me 5 minutes because i tried to get cute when he was at 5 health and he started stunlocking me which active shield totally healed back in 2 seconds overall i was still in complete control of both fights which is more important than whether it took me 20 sword swings vs 30 swings to beat them ,3,witcher
lnuw,since the inception of western rpgs melee players have always complained when they realized mage classes could kill certain things more efficiently ,7,witcher
lnuw,gear quality and player skill are more important than ability selection aka build in determining success through melee combat if you use level 18 sword armor against a level 30 story boss you are going to have a rough time regardless of how many red mutagens abilities you have active but with level appropriate gear you can still reliably cut down the boss without getting two shotted worst case scenario you can just down an archgriffin decoction,6,witcher
lnuw,this is a lot harder to do when there several of them at once even if you dodge one another can appear behind you at anytime and combo stagger you then everything snowballs and they gang bang you,1,witcher
lnuw,method works on death march just as easily do not knock it till you try it,5,witcher
lnuw,if you are lucky enough to get all of them within the trap sure,1,witcher
lnuw,yeah it sucks it does not help that a lot of achievements are labeled as secret so you do not even realize you were supposed to get one until way after ,2,witcher
lnuw,i wear wore griffin gear i hate fighting normal wraiths in general because of their bullshit teleporting and then they combo you in the back even worse when there 4 or 5 of them at a time,5,witcher
lnuw,the phantom of eldberg fucked me up good with his wraith buddies,7,witcher
lnuw,the easiest method is to hit it with igni let it burn then igni it again and let it burn until it dies ,7,witcher
lnuw,haha seriously i had to put out the igni fire myself so the burning damage would not do all the work for me,10,witcher
lnuw,achievements are heavily bugged in this game sadly you kind of just have to hope you have a save from before a major story achievement and redo it i recommend clearing the cache on your xbox before you go back and do them ,1,witcher

lnuw,how can you exclude michael and not prich the guy made a mere handful of good plays in the two seasons he actually been healthy,2,Seahawks
lnuw,freeing the tree spirit before talking with the crones means the spirit does not offer to save the kids it not part of the deal either you are simply mistaken or have one hell of a bug ,1,witcher
lnuw,you cannot save the kids as well as the couple the kids being saved is what incited the crones to curse anna in the first place ,1,witcher
lnuw,equipment durability is a cancer among rpgs,2,witcher
lnuw,why waste energy on a team that was probably going to trade down anyway ,3,Seahawks
lnuw, we won a freaking superb owl 4 seasons ago went to another and have made it to the divisional round the last 2 years so declining ,-9,Seahawks
lnuw,lol exciting and draft in the same sentence,1,Seahawks
lnuw,aaaaaand we traded down again i hope watching all the other teams draft players was exciting for you,1,Seahawks
lnuw,i meant watching the draft from pick 1 all the way to 32 though it does not help that we traded down,3,Seahawks
lnuw,this is why you do not watch the draft kids ,5,Seahawks
lnuw,i love lamp ,4,nfl
lnuw,it a single player game if you struggle to get through combat with it then it a bad idea if not then it fine ,3,witcher
lnuw,in your video you are literally just doing it to the exact same enemy 10 times i presume this was done by reloading a save and doing the poison bleed burn on this particular enemy 9 more times the game tracks how many different enemies you do this to and keeps count of it if you reload a save that erases the progress you made after that save point you have been blue balling yourself for the past two months ,6,witcher
lnuw,what do you expect from a game that came out 6 years ago on the last generation of consoles in a few years tw3 is going to look dated in comparison to a lot of games too ,6,witcher
lnuw,if you dont think you can make our final roster volunteer to be converted to oline congratulations you have just upgraded from roster bubble to potential starter ,1,nfl
lnuw,just by looking at the thumbnail i can guesd what happened yourr fighting a group of bandits roach gets in the way you accidentally press the mount button and gerald slowly makes his way on top of the horse while the bandits murder him,2,witcher
lnuw,you really are dense are not you ,1,nfl
lnuw, which brings us back to tiebreakers i must be conversing with a wall ,2,nfl
lnuw, yeah you could the colts won two more games than they needed to win the division if the pats went 16 0 and the other three teams in their division all went 2 14 that does not mean 16 0 was needed to win the division 3 13 would have done just fine ,2,nfl
lnuw, 9 7 has been good enough to win the afc south for the past 4 years and this was the statement of contention ,1,nfl
lnuw,during the years when the colts won the division at 11 5 they could have also done so at 9 7 a little slow are not you ,4,nfl
lnuw,yup,3,nfl
lnuw,ever heard of tiebreakers ,2,nfl
lnuw,9 7 has been good enough to win the afc south for the past 4 years check it ,3,nfl

lnuw,i have always seen it that why i never found her as hot as most guys do,2,porninfifteenseconds
lnuw,all fine and good but rage management is totally unnecessary if you are actually doing a signs build right your stamina should be fully regenerated within 3 seconds not that long of a wait,1,witcher
lnuw, geralt is dead i imagine ciri is captured and the world is destroyed eredin wins all because geralt i thought dodging was too time consuming ,1,witcher
lnuw,you have to create them in the alchemy menu 3 lesser blue mutagens 1 blue mutagen 3 blue mutagens 1 greater blue,2,witcher
lnuw,achievements are really buggy on this game i never got the achievement for findin ciri try clesring the cache on your xbox,2,witcher
lnuw,sign builds are extremely effective upgrade your armor with igni glyphs plus maybe a few aards use greater blue mutagens activate griffin school techniques your stats should indicate you have 100 burning chance with igni and at least 100 knockdown chance with aard if you dont have all these you are doing it wrong,3,witcher
lnuw,the vulnerability word is a bit misleading they are more like suggested items golems for example are not really vulnerable to quen but it strongly suggested you use quen when fighting them ,2,witcher
lnuw,defensively ursine griffin wolf cat offensively for melee cat wolf ursine griffin for sign casting griffin wolf every other set,2,witcher
lnuw,except for the snowball fight visiting skjall grave and refusing payment to not hurt her feelings pretty much yeah ,1,witcher
lnuw,i tried that in previous attempts since i am wearing almost no armor every failed dodge hits like a truck and my margin of error is very small ,1,witcher
lnuw,i intentiinally refrained from equipping any gear mid battle because i feel that an rpg mechanic that makes no sense,1,witcher
lnuw,if your igni sign intensity is high enough you will likely burn anything close to your level or below then the burning damage is based on percentage of health so monsters with high health will be taking thousands of damage per second far outpacing the dps you would get just hacking away with a sword,2,witcher
lnuw,i am a predominantly sign build so most monsters including fiends are only a couple igni blasts away from victory what made this fight really difficult was that i insisted on wearing only my boots and trousers,3,witcher
lnuw,same technically i could have put on my armor as the fight started but from a role playing perspective that makes no sense,2,witcher
lnuw,easier said than done when he teleports as soon as you get within 20 feet of him,5,witcher
lnuw,do i at least get to wear my armor before the fight starts ,1,witcher
lnuw,the same year a winning record was not required to win the division ,2,nfl
lnuw,i am actually very satisfied with the ending i got the process to get there was still horse shit ,1,witcher
lnuw, because i do not think that the relevant part of the choice i understand that what appears in the cut scene but i think as i mentioned the key thing is that ciri needs to feel that she does not need you always by her side to be brave if the choice is not relevant why give the player a choice at all for a game highly hyped up for making every choice matter there are astoundingly very few that actually affect the most important character in the game what is the point of even choosing your dialogue options in this sequence if the game already made the decisions for you by default i want you to actually answer this it not inconsistent you are just confusing being emotionally supportive when she emotionally hurt and allowing her to be strong on her own one is a matter of mourning the passing of a friend the other is a matter of standing up to the challenges others are putting before her so she cannot be emotionally strong on her own she cannot stand up to close minded villagers without geralt intervention but if geralt so much as offers to go with her to the lodge if she wants apparently that too demoralizing this decision is even worse than the laboratory one because at least the latter does not insult the player by making him her think that there are 2 3 more dialogue options that actually matter choose a or b if you do not like how geralt enacts it reload and choose the other not a or b then a b again then a b or c but if you choose a on the first one then you automatically choose a for the next two without knowing it you would have to be a cdpr fanboy not to see a problem with this you have to show diligence in every conversation this is objectively false you only have to show diligence in 4 or 5 you can be a total asshole to ciri in all the others but as long as you got lucky on those 4 or 5 the game defaults to you being the coolest dad in the world conversely even if you were supportive of ciri in almost every single interaction if you chose the wrong option 3 times you were a total ass by default the method by which a player gets a good ending can be summed up in one sentence always choose the second option except for the very obvious asshole option at the end i mean shit even the final conversation with ciri before she enters the portal at the end does not matter ciri i forbid you meh it all good as long as you did not make the egregious mistake of volunteering to accompany her to meet some shady sorceresses ,1,witcher
lnuw,the fact that he keeps getting tossed around to begin with says more about him than it does about about his apparently shitty luck what kind of franchise qb gets traded twice within two years ,1,nfl
lnuw,why do not you agree that it unfair for the devs to assume you took over the entire conversation with the lodge that what is shown in the bad ending flashbacks even if you took as much of a hands off approach as you could without seeming uncaring you are tricked into thinking your dialogue choices during that sequence matter when in reality the devs already decided you completely fucked up if letting ciri do things alone is what is best for her why is going with her to bury skjall a good choice she should be able to handle that very simple task by herself even worse when the villagers confront you about burying him the game forces you to stand up for her there is not even a do not react option that lets her handle it herself it a very inconsistent theme and i strongly disagree that every conversation was important there a quest where ciri meets up with her friends from a theater group during this quest you and ciri are alone and she opens up to you about not wanting to be defined by her elder blood it a pretty lengthy conversation and you can encourage her to take control of her own life or insist that her elder blood destines her for this and that but guess what how you respond in this conversation has literally no impact on the ending even the decision to help steal the horses did not matter since that should have significantly impacted how ciri views geralt as an overbearing father or someone who genuinely supports her decisions ,1,witcher
lnuw,yeah i guess you are just sol in that regard then igni better against humans anyway try aard on some wolves and see if it works ,1,witcher
lnuw,i did not get the bad ending though i almost did but i do still have a major problem with how the dialogue choices were handled to keep it short several were very unclear about how geralt would actually enact the dialogue an egregious example was in the laboratory when you could either choose a calm down or b go for it if you choose a then geralt wraps a random necklace around ciri neck and preaches about how she is the descendent of lara dorren blah blah blah which i guarantee is what 0 of players intended for him to do i tried to just do a blind playthrough where i live with my choices regardless of what outcome they lead to but after seeing how that choice was enacted i simply had to reload and do the other one it was that bad the very worst one however was when ciri is nervous about meeting with the lodge of sorceresses if you choose going with you geralt says i will go with you if you want good when phillipa tries to kick you out ciri demands that you stay or both of you leave so she does want you there after that you can choose to act as a bystander or take over the discussion completely the problem is the developers assume you chose to do the latter so if you get the bad ending this is what ciri will see in her flashbacks regardless of how it actually played out so you basically fucked yourself over just by volunteering to go with ciri ,1,witcher
lnuw,have you tried drinking a superior petri philter it supposed to guarantee signs activating their special effects such as aard knockdown and igni burning if that still does not work then i guess enemies on ng are just immune ,1,witcher

lnuw,it not just louisiana it all of middle america he could have been from oklahoma or kansas does not really matter as long as he was not a cali boy or east coast snob he fit the image brady on the other hand is from northern california and plays for an east coast team that also happens to be the most hated team in the nfl stereotypes like this exist whether you want to admit it or not ,1,nfl

lnuw,do you have the aard sweep ability if so you can just use this to knock him on his ass and instant kill him ,3,witcher
lnuw,peyton manning represents the image of the classic white blue collar middle american male it not just his skin color although that a major contributing factor he also from louisiana and has the corresponding accent which for many americans makes him more relateable than someone from the east or west coast add in the fact that he played for indianapolis which is about as middle american as it gets,1,nfl

lnuw,you clearly dont understand what he said at all ,8,nfl
lnuw,so you agree with me,0,nfl
lnuw,it is at least partially his fault that he already been traded two times in the first 7 years of his career,1,nfl
lnuw,sam bradford quickly went from sports media punching bag to the most overrated qb on r nfl ,13,nfl
lnuw,the least they couldve done was keep the main characters in the game after the main quest with maybe one new line of dialogue the way it is now you would think everybody but gerald got abducted by aliens,5,witcher
lnuw,i feel you tbh i am getting some mass effect 3 flashbacks the game just ended you are feeling all these emotions and then you get plopped in the middle of your headquarters as if none of that ever happened tw3 ending is obviously nowhere near as bad as me3 but it fucking sucks that all the main characters completely disappear after the main quest at this point i would be happy just to talk to morvran fucking voorhis,5,witcher
lnuw,it a warrior culture tbh i also find it similar to japanese samurai culture those who have lost their honor would rather commit suicide than live with their shame ,5,witcher
lnuw,i think the game could have benefited from some dungeons i have not started either expansion yet but in the base game there are only two true dungeons i can think of the elven ruins you explore with keira metz and the elven ruins again where you find the sunstone tw3 exploration is too outdoors dominant ,1,witcher
lnuw,it dumb precisely because of the hasselbeck argument ,4,nfl
lnuw,this is not about shitting on luck it about the ridiculous claim that wilson would only win 3 games with the colts so when 3 backup qbs can combine for 6 wins with that roster it because they played the easy games but for some reason wilson would only win half that many who getting shit on here your persecution complex is amusing ,3,nfl
lnuw,colts oline in 2015 was ranked 15 by pff luck got himself injured with his rushing style and there really no way you can expect a 40 year old qb to last more than a few games regardless of oline ,4,nfl
lnuw,so if russell wilson were the colts qb their schedule would suddenly be devoid of easy games except for 3 is that right ,5,nfl
lnuw,enough to win more than 5 games against teams with winning records dont you think ,0,nfl
lnuw,didnt hasselbeck freeman and whitehurst go 6 3 when luck was out in 2015 oh right they did but keep pushing the narrative that the colts are complete and utter garbage without luck,14,nfl
lnuw,it is impossible to stay at level 6 for the entirety of the velen quest line because you earn tons of xp during and after each quest if you do keira quests first you will be overleveled for the baron quests and vice versa throw in a few side quests because who does not do side quests and youre already well ahead of the curve by the time you reach novigrad there the cycle repeats itself as you earn xp like crazy while the the suggested levels range between two or three levels,1,witcher
lnuw,it literally based on five dialogue choices which is far too few i dont understand why none of your dialogue choices with the theater group for example have an impact on the ending you can encourage her to take control of her own life like three different times during that conversation but apparently none of them count because theyre not timed decisions,1,witcher
lnuw,the problem is that the locations are incredibly generic and the loot you find in the generic locations is always crap compared to what you already have the only exceptions are witcher gear diagrams or occasionally underwater treasure exploration for the most part becomes a cycle of kill bad guys collect mediocre loot a bit of xp sell loot to the nearest merchant repeat ,1,witcher
lnuw,excited nah but at least i am not as pessimistic as i was when we came away with just sowell and webb last offseason ,32,Seahawks
lnuw,seriously why is there a debate he obviously is not a hall of famer,0,nfl
lnuw,but that part of a main quest you do not find werewolves randomly prowling the woods they are always specifically designed as boss level enemies within a quest ,2,witcher
lnuw,hey there i just finished the main quest today and i give it a 9 10 too definitely a memorable game though a tad bit overrated given that it succumbs to some all too common rpg flaws,1,witcher
lnuw,in my experience dopplers succubi chorts and werewolves are the rarest i have only encountered them as part of a main or secondary quest which does not really count imo ,1,witcher
lnuw, like most rpgs 99 of the fights in the game are of one of two categories you vs a gang of weak mobs or you vs one solo boss level enemy the former is obviously much more common so invest in at least one cc method you can rely on my personal favorites aard sweep igni and the northern wind bomb whenever possible try to cast quen before you engage in combat this is because your stamina regeneration is much faster when not in combat by doing this you can then enter combat with a full quen and open with a more aggressive sign like igni or aard for cc at the onset of the fight do not fall into the typical rpg obsession with the most optimal end game build the most abilities you will ever have active at the same time is 12 and even that is not an option until you hit level 30 what this means is that early in the game invest in abilities that you can gain the full benefit from right now regardless of whatever equipment or diagrams you have available examples are muscle memory strength training arrow deflection melt armor delusion exploding shield and maybe acquired tolerance poisoned blades from the alchemy tree speaking of end game do not be afraid of dumping ability points into skills of questionable usefulness so you can reach the next tier within a given tree for example i play a mostly sign oriented build but i wanted the whirl ability in the combat tree whirl is a tier 3 ability which means i had to put a lot of points into tier 1 and 2 combat abilities that i almost never keep active since i can only keep up to 12 abilities activated there was pretty much no way to avoid this anyway make a habit of activating the delusion ability when you enter a village or city where there a village there people and where there people there going to be some dialogue axii delusion can get you out of some unwanted tense situations always keep some armor repair kits on hand and even more weapon repair kits weapon degradation is unfortunately still a thing in rpgs and your swords start to lose much of their effectiveness every 4 5 fights or so ,2,witcher
lnuw,i am on the same mission and i am pretty sure i have killed at least one of the crones ,5,witcher
lnuw,i never had this cut scene maybe it because both his buddies died in furing his personal quest in my playthrough ,2,witcher

lnuw,i dont think you have to play but you dont have to beat her to progress the quest ,1,witcher
lnuw,he has never played like someone who should have been drafted in the first three rounds do not be ridiculous,-2,nfl
lnuw,lol kearse,-1,nfl
lnuw,that didnt work for me i traveled between two zones in kaer morhen after the game had stopped saving,1,witcher
lnuw,i loaded the most recent checkpoint and it seemed to autosave like normal as i was getting off boats and such i did not have much time to see if everything was normal ,1,witcher
lnuw,i think a certain percentage of igni damage intensity is also used to subtract from armor rating let just assume it 50 if you do 300 igni damage 150 will be subtracted from the enemy armor however if 150 is greater than 75 of their armor rating then whatever is 75 of their armor rating will be reduced ,2,witcher
lnuw,even if he never wins another he will still compile volume stats which is the only thing rivers has over him right now and maintain a high passer rating time is on wilson side but not rivers ,1,nfl
lnuw,because wilson is only entering his 6th year whereas rivers is entering his 14th as of right now both need to add a lot more to their resumes but who has more time to do it wilson rivers has maybe 3 more years to get it done and i do not trust him to do it ,7,nfl
lnuw,ciri sexy accent but without yen grating attitude,2,witcher
lnuw,if he got a ring i would put him as a maybe but he does not have a ring so as of right now it a resounding no the fact that we constantly ask this question regarding a qb going into his 14th season seals it for me,3,nfl
lnuw,no and if romo had not retired i would say no for him also ,5,nfl
lnuw,if i had to bet money on a group of 7 qbs they would be brady rodgers brees big ben wilson manning and carr ,10,nfl
lnuw,what is time to throw ,8,nfl
lnuw,what is blocking ,10,nfl
lnuw,put at least one more point to reduce the stamina drain by 50 it makes a huge difference ,1,witcher
lnuw,he a monster geralt kills monsters ,61,witcher
lnuw,sign intensity increases the chance of aard knockdown as well as duration of the knockdown the duration is actually very important because if it is too low you wo not have an opportunity to perform an instant kill sign intensity affects igni damage and burn chance melt armor description is really confusing but here how i think it works let say you have 5 5 melt armor that means you can decrease up to 75 of an enemy armor rating via igni damage so if an enemy has 1000 armor you can take off up to 750 of it if they have 100 armor you can take off 75 ,2,witcher
lnuw, draws steel sword how do ya like that silver ,3,witcher
lnuw,lol are you done ,2,nfl
lnuw,practice squad dline player oline,1,nfl
lnuw,aaron donald the rams were dominating our oline with just long and quinn then of course they add another hall of fame talent to their dl ,3,nfl
lnuw,do not worry about your end game build if you are just starting out you are already really limited by the low number of abilities you can have active so at this point in the game just choose a few abilities that are useful to you right now obviously you want to get whirl asap so invest most of your early ability points in the combat tree blue mutagens are by far the most commonly dropped by monsters but they boost your signs not melee damage red mutagens boost melee damage but are much more rare so i suggest putting some points into the melt armor ability for igni so you can use blue mutagens to your advantage in the meantime i honestly would not even touch the alchemy skill tree until later in the game since their usefulness is dependent on how many alchemy formulas you already know since you are just starting this means you know pretty much zero not very helpful for someone who still just trying to survive a pack of wolves is it ,1,witcher
lnuw,some of them have a good story behind them though admittedly a lot of them are just glorified fetch quests i would still initiate the quests just to get some background on each problem wraith contracts are usually interesting edit contract monsters almost always drop specific mutagens that are needed to create decoctions trying to farm these mutagens off of generic monsters of the same species really unreliable in comparison ,7,witcher
lnuw,yes it very common otherwise guys would ask out every girl they find even slightly attracted to,-1,AskMen
lnuw,witcher gear always has a green outline in the inventory your default chest armor can be upgraded once but you have to find the diagram for it after that you will eventually have to move on to new armor sets completely quick guide about equipment classes based on outline color orangish brown relic very good equipment that is close in quality to witcher gear given similar level requirements some are arguably even better than your current witcher gear depending on what bonus stats they carry blue master decent gear that is commonly found when looting bandit camps and treasure chests they would be considered an upgrade over your default equipment in the very early game but quickly become outclassed by the stuff you will obtain through treasure hunts contracts and crafting sell to merchants for good money yellow magic very rarely a worthy upgrade over your current gear still worth looting just to sell though white common pretty much worthless even as trade bait unless you have a lot of room in your inventory you should not even touch these,2,witcher
lnuw,well he was the worst player in the league at his respective position so at least he was a good fit for us,64,nfl

lnuw,uh huh right so much for ignoring supporting cast,2,nfl
lnuw,you can make this argument for every qb it rare for any qb to be completely at fault for all of his interceptions you are just being partial to certain qbs over others ,1,nfl
lnuw,bradford transformed into captain checkdown and contributed to your offense mess in return for a misleadingly good passer rating that shit would not fly in seattle they throw downfield shitty oline or not ,9,nfl
lnuw, i try to ignore supporting casts well okay i guess you would be surprised at how many of those ints were due to receiver failure lmao hold the fuck up not only is this the opposite of ignoring supporting cast but you fail to notice that rivers was staring down his receiver the whole way,4,nfl
lnuw,i mean he also thinks newton is somehow a top 10 qb going into this season and better than wilson so take everything he says with a grain of salt,1,nfl

lnuw,i disagree the no class system encourages players to try a little bit of everything but in actual practice each individual will eventually favor a particular play style stealth archer battlemage dual wield melee sword and board 2h berzerker summoner etc the class system on the other hand not only encourages but forces the player to stick to their major skills in order to level up if for example you realize that you ai not really about that stealth archer life the game tells you no sorry bud ,2,ElderScrolls
lnuw,then perhaps your training method is the problem i still stand by my statement that your protein and caloric intake is not deficient but actually excessive try this take each exercise you do to failure then do one of two things a drop sets until you fail at 50 of your usual working weight b heavy eccentric reps with up to 150 of your working weight both methods will help you overload your muscles and cause more muscle damage that is necessary for growth ,1,AskMen
lnuw,first off you are eating way more protein than you actually need 1 gram of protein per pound of bodyweight is a broscience myth 0 7 g lb is more than enough second based on your weight and height measurements you no longer classify as skinny right now you are either very muscular or you have added a lot of unnecessary excess body fat in a wreckless bulk since you made this post i will assume the latter even worse is you are aiming for 175 pounds jesus my advice cut down on both the protein and calories a bit the reason why you are not seeing more muscle definition is because you keep packing on fat as part of an unnecessary bulk ,1,AskMen

lnuw,are you insulted because i used the word prepubescence just ignore that fact is men generally value physical features that suggest youthfulness if you survey a large sample of men show them a picture of a woman who looks like she in her late teens through late 20s and a woman who looks like she at least in her mid 30s the majority will rate the younger looking one as more attractive controlling for ethnicity of course ,-10,AskMen
lnuw,is it still creepy if i remove the word prepubescence ,1,AskMen

lnuw,lol rude the hip is a joint the femurs insert into ockets within this joint these sockets are separate from where babies are pushed out during childbirth the increased hip width causes the femurs to generally be further apart from each other and their glute muscles to cover more surface area which is why women can build impressive looking asses using much less resistance than men do but unless women have significantly larger femurs relative to the rest of their bone structure and they do not the actual mass ratio between men and women will be about the same in fact inherently large femurs would necessitate appropriately large ockets to fit them into but then this would take away space needed for childbirth the baby would be crushed because mommy femurs are filling up the entire joint since men almost invariably carry more upper body mass it can definitely be argued they need more lower body strength and mass to support the weight ,0,AskMen

lnuw,our line was not decent back then the only year they approached decent was in wilson rookie year when the read option was literally unstoppable across the league in fact that was the best year a tom cable line has ever had pass protection wise best not necessarily equating to good ,1,Seahawks

lnuw,what are you basing this off of wilson to baldwin is one of the most efficient passing connections in the nfl second only to brady gronk in 2015 three seahawks wrs were top 5 in passer rating when targeted two of those three were former undrafted free agents and the third was a 3rd round rookie sounds like you are just making shit up as you go along ,2,nfl
lnuw,lynch consistently ran a below average percentage of his runs against 8 man boxes if anything wilson took pressure off of lynch or maybe it both but certainly not as one sided relationship as you make it seem ,1,nfl
lnuw, yeah it does especially since you were the one who asked why he was not a top 20 pick then why make the ridiculous excuse for carr not being a top 20 pick if it does not matter do not ask a useless question because the reason why a player is picked at a certain spot does not change the fact that he was irrefutably picked at that spot russell wilson fell to the 3rd round because he was short in hindsight he should have been a top 5 pick and trent richardson should have gone undrafted but none of that matters in the reality because he was a 3rd round pick and he played like a top tier qb despite being paid less than tjack wilson being underpaid did not make him any less great of a player but he still is getting paid he has already signed a contract that is going to pay him for how he has performed so performance precedes payday yes that what i have telling you this whole goddamn time yet you keep crying about our lowest paid oline even though the reason for that is because they are on their rookie contracts we have given cable shit and expect him to make the great wall of china uh no we have not refer to my examples of him choosing athletic projects over proven steady starters ,1,Seahawks
lnuw,you do remember at one point we had two 1st rounders two 2nd rounders and sweezy as our starting line right the line still was not good even then ,1,Seahawks
lnuw, and who knows how good frederick would be without being surrounded by top 15 picks so maybe you should find a better causation than cable sucks let fire him um well funny thing is frederick is not surrounded by top 15 picks ,1,Seahawks
lnuw, all of these players will be making substantially more when they are off their rookie contracts and actually allowed to negotiate their pay meanwhile our line will make substantially less than all those players when they are off their rookie contracts that because the players i named are good and our ol players fucking suck quality of performance determines their paycheck not the other way around so maybe you should find a better excuse for cable than derrr we have the lowest paid line 1 ,1,Seahawks
lnuw,does not matter derek carr was a 2nd round pick and has been making 2nd round pick money for his entire career how much he is being paid does not make him any worse of a player period also travis federick only getting paid the big money starting next year because his rookie contract just about up how much was he making the past few years when he was already all pro ,1,Seahawks
lnuw,funny you mention the cowboys since their ol is not exactly built from top 10 picks either nor are they even close to being the highest paid ,1,Seahawks
lnuw,lol why the arbitrary first 20 picks then why make the ridiculous excuse for carr not being a top 20 pick all right let throw in some later picks le have on bell allen robinson jarvis landry devonta freeman jason verrett tyler lockett frank clark david johnson landon collins stefon diggs kawann short travis frederick deandre hopkins travis kelce xavier rhodes jordan reed wonder what they were paid last year ,2,Seahawks
lnuw,what if anything it helps even more even highly drafted players will be very cheap their salary has no effect on how well they play if the team were to pay each of our starting ol 5 million more for the upcoming year would they suddenly become elite fuck no paying money out the ass for shitty players wo not make them better and paying great players far less than what they are worse wo not make them bad players ,2,Seahawks
lnuw,guess how many of our starting ol are playing on their rookie contract oh wait they all are funny how that caveat is ignored when the players are bad ,-4,Seahawks
lnuw,money does not determine player quality guess how much aaron donald odell beckham zack martin khalil mack and derek carr made last year ,-6,Seahawks
lnuw,cable has a documented history of starting raw but very athletic players over proven if not extraordinary athletes couple of examples 2015 drew nowak vs patrick lewis nowak was the better athlete but lewis had starting experience and played adequately in those starts who started the first half of the season nowak 2016 jahri evans vs germain ifedi evans is a multiple time all pro rg ifedi was is a raw athlete with poor technique even by cable own admission guess who started again ifedi what happened to evans he was cut then went back to the saints and started for one of the best pass blocking lines in the league ifedi ended up being the worst rg in the entire league this tom cable victim narrative is complete bullshit ,8,Seahawks

lnuw,historically bad not even the worst from this past season and none of these factors should stop a franchise qb from playing to win bradford played to not get hurt and it showed on 3rd down especially i would rather have a qb who has a lower completion but throws past the sticks than a qb with a high comp but throws checkdowns all day,1,nfl
lnuw,probably because you have not had a real qb play for your team since then other than favre,1,nfl
lnuw,i arrived late to the party and tried to make up for it by chugging a bottle if vodka then chugging two beers at once,1,AskMen
lnuw,i am basing it on his obscenely high percentage of check down throws he relies on receiver yac to convert 3rd downs because he unwilling to hang in there a few milliseconds longer to throw past the sticks iirc you guys had some major 3rd down problems,0,nfl
lnuw,not the worst qb ever but still heavily overrated by this sub did everybody forget that this guy held out of training camp because the eagles traded up for the 2 pick even after they just gave him an extension that in his 7 years in the nfl he still never led a team and he had three to work with to a winning record everybody quick to blame all this on shitty luck but the cold hard truth is that he is not a great competitor like all franchise qbs are he will always take the path of least resistance that why his completion is so high and his ypa is so low he doesnt want to get hit behind that oline true franchise qbs stand back there and take the hit if it means they can keep the drive alive ,5,nfl

lnuw,pass protection too finesse for cable he wants gritty guys who can go out there and sack their own qb,44,Seahawks
lnuw,i agree but swap out john schneider for pete carroll remember pete was the one who wanted to wait until the last second for wilson while john had to make do with irvin and bobby fuckin wagner seriously he got an all pro mlb and a franchise qb in two consecutive picks gangster as fuck ,3,nfl
lnuw,squats not that i do not appreciate a nice ass but after the 10th instagram youtube video it just gets annoying it become one of the new basic bitch trends ,5,AskMen
lnuw,yes that too probably even more so though our extreme dedication to the run was the biggest factor in the rushing yards rankings ,1,Seahawks
lnuw,jr sweezy was fucking awful fight me ,7,Seahawks
lnuw,he did not produce great or even good offensive lines even when it was being highly paid his offensive lines have been awful at pass protection throughout his entire career even before coming to seattle but nah let blame the quarterback for extending plays when it clear as day he does it out of necessity due to horrible protection up front horrible protection that just happens to follow tom cable coached offensive lines wherever he goes ,1,nfl
lnuw,this is a lie solid talent has been there but cast aside in favor of raw project players with better athleticism it a consistent trend in the way their ol has been constructed ,2,nfl
lnuw,jesus it not about the money the line is cheap because almost all of them are playing on rookie contracts all starting five could have been all pro this year and they would still be the cheapest going into next year cable has consistently chosen raw inexperienced projects with high athletic upside to start over solid if not extraordinary players who have proven they can play drew nowak over patrick lewis germain ifedi over jahri evans resources have been there only to be cast aside in favor of athleticism ,1,nfl
lnuw,the drop off itself is not what is being disputed we both agree losing lynch would cause a drop off what is being disputed is how much success the ol was really responsible for when lynch and wilson were running roughshod over defenses clearly not much ,3,nfl
lnuw,gel at the end of the season lmfao they got completely fucked up against the cardinals and could not even run against the 49ers at the end the year gtfo ,2,nfl
lnuw,with wilson leg injuries and lynch retirement the team plumetted in just about every rushing statistic ypg ypc yards after contact you name it the oline did not help with shit,2,nfl

lnuw, fatty that why i specifically said lean i know fatty meat tastes good ,3,AskMen
lnuw,none of what you just said disputes my point ,57,nfl
lnuw,because every team drafts a qb with the hope that he can lead the team to a super bowl or multiple super bowls that the dream ,45,nfl
lnuw,yes i let it rest i intentionally leave out the butter for dietary purposes and i do not want to spend money on herbs that i will hardly ever use like thyme ,2,AskMen
lnuw,i tend to average around 93 wpm fastest i have ever gotten was like 120,1,AskMen
lnuw,awful pass protection has been an attribute of cable lines his entire career lynch was consistently below average on yards before contact and well above average in yards after contact that and we were a notoriously run heavy team when he was on the roster that where those inflated rushing rankings came from ,3,Seahawks
lnuw,we hardly ever split him out wide down near the goal line that would force the defense to put a linebacker on him and soften the run defense or put a db on h and risk getting moss would fire bevell ,4,Seahawks

lnuw,at first i thought it was kind of weird because often times the men who wear makeup would still look good without it but now i realize that wearing makeup is not necessarily about looking good but rather looking a certain way and to look that certain way usually requires makeup,1,AskMen
lnuw,the starting line is being paid low because they are on rookie contracts there is nothing the team can do about that even if they wanted to and why would they want to even if every single one of our starting linemen were all pro this year they would still be the cheapest going into next year ,3,nfl
lnuw,ryan is at least a tier below brees ,9,nfl
lnuw,but not because of how much they are paid they are just bad players ,8,nfl
lnuw, notoriously inepet organizations like the bucs who are on the upswing with a promising young team and a good young quarter back and who beat us this year and still have not made the playoffs since 2003 do not forget the notirously inept organization like the broncos who shelled out 8m for our previous lt this year man an 8m 1 year contract so horrible i like how you down play the broncos as respectable never mind that they were the reigning sb champions the broncos robbed okung not the other way around okung was floating around free agency for over a week before he decided to say fuck it i am going to beg the broncos to sign me and so they did with an extremely lop sided deal in their favor college ball does not produce enough quality linemen to fill the nfl anymore and it is showing across the nfl its time for our gm to figure it out if every team is drafting from the same pool of college offensive lineman then naturally the teams with the best talent evaluation and developmental staff will stand out above the rest conversely those that are evaluating and developing poorly will continually trot out shitty offensive linemen guess which group we fall in ,-2,Seahawks
lnuw,a second contract can be worth anywhere between vet minimum and record breaking saying player x deserves a second contract means nothing even career backups are worth second and even third contracts ,-1,Seahawks
lnuw,no those linemen who got second contracts signed with notoriously inept organizations like the jets and bucs the only one who got signed by a respectable org was okung and even he actually had to initiate contact with them only to end up signing a horrible contract he wanted them more than they wanted him as sad as that sounds ,0,Seahawks
lnuw,football outsiders does not track pressures that why pff fo as far as ol rankings go,8,nfl
lnuw,he also chosen inexperienced players to start over better veterans based solely on their athletic upside the most egregious example was drew nowak over patrick lewis in 2015,92,nfl
lnuw,did you even read his entire comment ,2,Seahawks
lnuw,no and he not on track either ,-1,nfl

lnuw,depends on what you actually plan to do to people who mean to harm you kung fu really puts the defense in self defense and should be more than enough to intimidate others while not causing much of a scene muay thai can be absolutely lethal be careful with this style because you may seriously injure someone when you did not mean to taekwondo like muay thai can be a bit overkill a lot of kicking which not only can send someone to the hospital but sacrifices balance ,1,AskMen
lnuw,western media portrayal of asian men has never been very kind for one ,3,AskMen

lnuw,arguably 2nd worst maybe,-7,nfl
lnuw,worst ol in football ,-7,nfl
lnuw,at least his ol did not literally sack him themselves ,3,nfl
lnuw, about equally is subjective they are clearly not equal neither is the number of times the a team with the 1 ranking in each stat won the super bowl in fact if you go back all the way back to the merger the stats would be even more lopsided in favor of defense,1,nfl
lnuw,never gonna happen with cable,1,Seahawks
lnuw,about equal only once during this time span did the 1 scoring offense win the super bowl the 1 scoring defense won it four times no 1 scoring defenses are also 5 1 when facing no 1 scoring offenses in super bowls ,2,nfl
lnuw,patriots because 1 i root for the team that is stronger defensively 2 i love the way their organization is run no excuses no tolerance for failure nobody is immune from criticism nobody job is safe 3 matt ryan is an overrated quarterback he was mediocre for three consecutive years before this one and now all of a sudden people are talking about him like he been elite forever no he just plays with a totally stacked offense one of the best ocs in the league 4 brady and belichick are already the goats if they win this super bowl it wo not change the way we talk about them or any other players we can just forget this season even happened ,2,Seahawks
lnuw,since the realignment aka the modern era the average offensive scoring rank of sb champions is 9 4 and the average defensive scoring rank is 8 6 so the average sb champion since then has been stronger defensively than offensively not surprisingly only once during this time span did the 1 scoring offense win the super bowl the 1 scoring defense won it four times not modern enough let just isolate the 2010s then starting with aaron rodgers first super bowl win since then the average offensive scoring rank of sb champions is 10 0 the average defensive scoring rank drumroll please 8 7,6,nfl
lnuw,pretty cool let not go around being annoying about it like colts fans after the 2013 season,41,Seahawks

lnuw,the steelers might want to cover that chris hogan fellow,75,nfl
lnuw,chris hogan face reminds me of an iguana ,7,nfl
lnuw, he has the pass protection traits of an nfl starter so there a 0 chance he will start for us,3,Seahawks
lnuw,show me where i personally judged how injured a player was ,1,Seahawks
lnuw,the packers have been the most consistent nfc team for nearly a decade and even they are not on par with the patriots level of consistency,71,Seahawks
lnuw,tbh social science courses like sociology anthropology psychology etc have been some of the most interesting and thought provoking classes i have taken college other classes that will stick with you well past graduation physics i once you understand how torque works so many things you see in life make much more sense do not be scared of the math it about the basic concepts foreign language being bilingual makes you look like the smartest person in a room full of monolingual savages also makes it easier to make friends with foreigners statistics similar to foreign language if you have a solid understanding of stats you can win yourself a lot of arguments over the common rabble biology biochemistry hard but you learn a lot about topics pertaining to evolution reproduction dna hormones nutrition etc you will never have to ask if butter is a carb again dance ok i never personally took dance but you can see why learning how to dance might be beneficial yeah ,3,AskMen
lnuw,ah yes let let fans decide if a person is healthy by watching them on tv what year is this ,1,Seahawks
lnuw, lockett was the starting punt returner does not matter he was significantly injured and took care of both kick and punt return duties anyway sherman was apparently the backup returner as with lockett his injuries did not exempt him from his duties do not mistake the team blatant disregard for their players safety as a sign of their player good health it does not make sense why pete carroll said what he said and the whole wording of using the word significant does not make sense nothing makes sense when you overthink it if pete says it was significant then that means that at least from his perspective the injury was significant and if he believed it was significant it was his duty to report it whether it was actually significant by the nfl definition does not really matter because they would not have punished him for erring on the side of caution but since he did not that gives the nfl grounds for punishment wear your seatbelt even when the traffic looks light ,-1,Seahawks
lnuw,they do if their coach wishes to hide their injuries wait a second ,1,Seahawks
lnuw, played every snap all starting cbs play every snap participated in practice not every practice not even close was put as a punt returner when they could have stuck anyone back there so was lockett while he was dealing with a listed pcl injury for over half the entire season significant injuries do not exempt players from punt return duties you are arguing using your own interpretation of what a word means with no evidence to support what you believe my interpretation of the the word significant literally does not matter all that matters is that from pete point of view it was significant and therefore it was his duty to report the injury if i think i saw a kidnapping or a murder i report it to the police even if it later turns out it was not a kidnapping murder i still report the crime because the last thing i want to be is someone who was at the scene of the crime but mysteriously did not do anything about it ,1,Seahawks
lnuw,and then it was sherman job for one game after lockett was lost for the season then it was hester job the point is they did in fact make players with significant injuries return punts ,0,Seahawks
lnuw, adams 75 rec 997 yards 12 td cobb 60 rec 610 yards 4 td these are well above average stats for 2 and 3 receivers ,8,nfl
lnuw,tyler lockett was returning punts and kicks with a listed pcl injury find a better excuse ,1,Seahawks
lnuw,if pete says the injury was significant then at bare minimum that means he personally believes it was significant that means he should have put it on the injury report the nfl would not have punished him even if the injury was insignificant by their standards you are making assumptions about the severity of the injury while having no knowledge of what the injury even is or when it even happened 1 it does not really matter what i think about the injury severity it only matters that pete thought it was significant and therefore it is shady as fuck that he did not put it on the injury report 2 pete claims that sherman played a large portion of season with the injury which was again significant how many times did the injury show up on the report a grand total of zero times you are just arguing against your own common sense to defend your team ,1,Seahawks
lnuw,how are their receivers definitely below average and how is their ol anything less than elite given that they are the best in the league at the one skill that most significantly impacts qb performance pass protection ,6,nfl
lnuw,he did not participate fully in practice he was frequently held out of entire practices for supposed non injury related purposes which were probably blatant lies given the information we have now also you are justifying pete failure by using sherman individual talent as an excuse you are trying to argue that just because a player still played at a high level his injury was not worth reporting this is ridiculously unfair to elite players and opens up a whole new can of worms in the realm of subjectivity playing at a high level despite a significant according to pete himself injury does not mean there was no significant injury ,3,Seahawks
lnuw,oline receivers ,9,nfl
lnuw,if that your fear why list any injuries at all nobody knew about russ pec injury until it was listed on the injury report and he more likely than anyone to be targeted there is no absolutely no way you can justify pete colossal fuck up ,-1,Seahawks
lnuw,what is the worst that could happen if you list an insignificant injury as significant on the report nothing the nfl wo not take fine you or take away a draft pick for that better to be safe than sorry but now we are sorry ,2,Seahawks
lnuw,if the coach believes an injury to be significant and carroll apparently did then he should err on the side of caution and list it on the injury report worst case scenario the nfl says it not significant and no fuss is made but if a coach believes an injury to be significant and does not report it then he runs the risk of getting into the situation we are in now make sense ,5,Seahawks
lnuw,i am not mad the organization already deserves grief for the abomination of an ol they put out in front of their franchise quarterback this is just icing on the cake ,2,Seahawks
lnuw,i am impressed that you have found a way to make a fuss over a simple suggestion about oatmeal ,5,AskMen
lnuw,depends what is 1 2 times yours ,1,AskMen
lnuw,oh i see i assumed the average person would be creative enough to add extra flavors to their oatmeal i mean the container itself has a bowl of oatmeal with assorted fruits added to it ,2,AskMen
lnuw,op did not say it had to taste good lol pour some cinnamon and honey into it and it will taste better ,4,AskMen
lnuw,oatmeal i buy a tub of quaker oats for 6 30 servings good source of fiber complex carbs and some protein as a bonus ,10,AskMen
lnuw,all right then here what i have got pro football reference is a bitch to navigate on a mobile device you know that zero snaps in 2014 http www pro football reference com teams crd 2014 snap counts htm 33 snaps in 2015 http www pro football reference com teams crd 2015 snap counts htm good enough for you my liege ,3,Seahawks
lnuw,i have already made my point that sowell numbers stem from his lack of starts and therefore lack of significant snap counts it on whoever wants to dispute this point to bring new relevant information to the discussion or do you think it normal for individuals to argue against their own points ,-1,Seahawks
lnuw,are there reports of a flu outbreak in pennyslvania even just pittsburgh ,-3,nfl
lnuw, i coukdnt find his career snaps but 48 extra games is statistically relevant no they are not because not all games are equal is a game where he got 5 snaps the same as a game where he started and played 60 snaps players can go entire careers without getting a penalty because they are only the field for 3 snaps a game the penalties per snap number is going to be much higher in seattle even if he was only getting 5 snaps in the other 48 prove it with numbers ,-1,Seahawks
lnuw,i am not the one who brought up the 58 games if nobody can explain why they are relevant then they are not relevant,-21,Seahawks
lnuw,probably it is a contract year for him after all,1,Seahawks
lnuw,how many total snaps did he get from those 58 games how many total snaps did he get with us this year penalties per snap is a much more informative metric than penalties per game zero snaps in 2014 http www pro football reference com teams crd 2014 snap counts htm and 33 snaps in 2015 http www pro football reference com teams crd 2015 snap counts htm keep downvoting because i wo not participate in the victim complex circlejerk ,-22,Seahawks
lnuw,then why is not this strain spreading through the rest of the population to other teams nfl players are not exactly known for their book smarts most of them probably do not even know what antibodies are ,-4,nfl
lnuw,a qb that does more to help the team win games than hurt its ability to win ,1,nfl
lnuw,the probability of an entire locker room full of vaccinated players getting the flu is extremely miniscule it much more likely that several never got the shot in the first place,5,nfl
lnuw,lol the holding comment maybe that because he had not started a game since 2013 ,-39,Seahawks
lnuw,spending money only helps if you spend it on players who are actually good signing jmarcus webb was easily the most retarded move of the off season every armchair gm already knew the guy was a bum,8,Seahawks
lnuw,russ has to literally be broken in half ,27,Seahawks
lnuw,another example from 2015 drew nowak vs patrick lewis at c drew nowak was a project player who had zero experience playing c like sweezy a favorite of cable he had high athletic upside but like i said zero experience on the other hand patrick lewis had experience he also filled in adequately in 2014 in the numerous games when unger was injured not much upside but everyone knew the guy could play the position guess who originally won the starting job nowak ,10,Seahawks
lnuw, russell wilson was 27th in time to throw i tried looking at the site you used and on no device could i get it to go beyond cousins to see how many full time starters there were wrong just because your devices are crap does not mean you can go spouting off misinformation ,3,Seahawks
lnuw,the team got worse due to favoritism over fair competition we had an jahri evans an all pro rg on our roster not only did he not win the starting job he was outright cut in favor of ifedi and j marcus fucking webb evans ended up starting for one of the best pass blocking lines in the league ifedi ended up as the single worst rg in the league and webb was so bad the team would rather eat 2 5 in dead money than keep him on the roster the resources have been there cable has just either been unable to make the most of them or just flat out did not like them ,13,Seahawks
lnuw,what happened was cable wanted his guys starting rather than the best guys you could give him the entire packers ol and he would cut all of them because they are not very good at run blocking guaranteed ,7,Seahawks
lnuw,it went through correctly it still had nothing to do with the conversation taking place still waiting for that proof that russ was among the slowest in time to throw this season btw ,4,Seahawks
lnuw,cable had plenty to work with since joining seattle okung was a 6 overall pick cable could only bring out his potential for one season from 2011 2015 carpenter was another 1st round pick hand picked by cable himself completely garbage every year he was with us cable personal adoration for sweezy and carpenter has been well documented like carpenter sweezy was garbage he may never start another game in the nfl ever again ifedi another 1st round pick worst rg in the nfl pathetic it does not take a mastermind to coach a 1st rounder into the worst at his position i could have done that for free ,14,Seahawks
lnuw,what you just said has literally nothing to do with the comment that you responded to ,5,Seahawks
lnuw, you think he would not be ecstatic to have some talented veteran linemen to build around like jahri evans the all pro rg that ended up starting for one of the best pass blocking lines in the league after we cut him does he count ,9,Seahawks
lnuw,cable job is not done until russ is literally broken in half ,10,Seahawks
lnuw,do you still want credit ,0,Seahawks
lnuw,i am not even sure if we actually have opposing viewpoints tbh i agree the offense needs to be handed over to russ completely but not at the expense of turning our defense to crap ,1,Seahawks
lnuw,things got worse from 2015 to 2016 so cable is not exactly helping the line trend upwards,11,Seahawks
lnuw,your opinions would be fine if they were actually supported by factual rationale ,0,Seahawks
lnuw,signing up for our divisional round blowout a year early i see which team will have the honor of annihilating us next year to be continued on the next episode of dragonball z ,-1,Seahawks
lnuw,guess i will have to look forward to getting blown out in the divisional round next season ,6,Seahawks
lnuw,nobody takes you seriously in this sub you brought it on yourself for being a fucking kearse fan boi,0,Seahawks
lnuw, you can pull all the stats you would like and make them try to justify everything you try to say but what i am saying is ever since sb 48 defense has become over rated lmao you are trying to talk down to someone who uses empirical evidence and facts to prove his point it does not matter if the league wants to make this an offensive league you need a defense to win championships literally nothing has yet proven otherwise i know you are still butthurt over our loss but what argument do you present other than raw emotion the panthers last year had the 1 scoring offense the 6 scoring defense and a top 5 ol and they still lost to a purely defensive driven team with a worse qb and ol if you do not believe defense is over rated now just go and re watch the no game this year ah new orleans the poster team for offense offense and more offense when was the last time they even made the playoffs 2013 you might want to check their defensive scoring rank back then it may surprise you if we want to win now moving forward we cannot keep putting all this pressure on our defense to shut down everybody and anybody i agree with this but saying we need a top 10 ol is an overreaction we just need a convincingly competent ol that does not get in russ way,1,Seahawks
lnuw,i am not advocating a better run game though it would be nice i am advocating for a full commitment to a passing game pass blocking pass friendly schemes and playcalling bevell and cable are just the wrong coaches to carry out this vision ,1,Seahawks
lnuw, and you have yet to counter my statement that defense is overrated in this qb driven offense friendly league all right let get right down to it then since the realignment aka the modern era the average offensive scoring rank of sb champions is 9 4 and the average defensive scoring rank is 8 6 so the average sb champion since then has been stronger defensively than offensively not surprisingly only once during this time span did the 1 scoring offense win the super bowl the 1 scoring defense won it four times not modern enough let just isolate the 2010s then starting with our good friend aaron rodgers first super bowl win since then the average offensive scoring rank of sb champions is 10 0 the average defensive scoring rank drumroll please 8 7 well what do ya know defense continues to play a larger role in winning championships than offense does even in this era of unstoppable quarterbacks now do you have empirical evidence to actually support your statement that defense is overrated or are you just getting too comfortable on the packers falcons bandwagon ,1,Seahawks
lnuw,ah the argument a logical fallacy used by those who equate big money gud small money bad i have refuted this silly theory too many times already and would rather not type it out again especially to someone who is notorious for defending a player like jermaine kearse in the face of all reason ,-1,Seahawks
lnuw,haha nice attempt at trying to compare cable work to scar blockers motherfucker he had to switch positions try twisting this the 2015 patriots fielded 41 different offensive line combinations by far the most in the nfl ,0,Seahawks
lnuw, that fine because they knew they had talent the pats ol was notably plagued with injuries all year including at lt marcus cannon was one of the worst rts in the nfl now he one of the best no excuses ,6,Seahawks
lnuw,patriots bandwagon reporting in brady and belichick are already the goats so if they win the super bowl it will be like this season never even happened ,3,nfl
lnuw,no i fire folks when they repeatedly fail to do what is asked of them you know why the patriots are dominant year in year out they do not accept failure less than 24 hours after brady got the shit beat out of him by the broncos last year they fired their ol coach the same ol coach whom they won sb xlix with no excuses for failure ,8,Seahawks
lnuw, only legit qbs they have faced this year have been joe flacco carson palmer and russell wilson so 2 1 against legit qbs wilson is an elite qb no shame in losing to him does not make them legit it makes them well coached front runners that are about to get exposed next week you cannot name one person in that defense besides butler dont a hightower chris long devin mccourty you sure do make a lot assumptions without factual bases their not even in the same realm as us of years past again they are and i already said they are not an all time great defense did not i ,1,Seahawks
lnuw,cable broke his own assistant coach jaw and beats women if being a piece of shit person invalidates your opinion on football then cable and sapp are in the same class difference is sapp is in the hall of fame and cable will never be i will side with the hof piece of shit over the piece of shit known for blowing smoke up his players asses ,14,Seahawks
lnuw,i do not even know what you are trying to argue anymore you have been discrediting new england defense by shrugging them off as a product of their offense which is just absurd their defense is legit not all time great but they do their jobs they also have the worst ol left in the playoffs i am still taking them as my super bowl pick over other teams with better ols because the way their team is built is better than the way the other teams are built in order of importance qb defense ol ,2,Seahawks

lnuw, exactlyy and over the course of an entire season those minutes start to add up a simple minute over the course of a season is a full quarter all righty then let start from the top of top teams and see if your logic truly holds eagles 32 57 scoring defense rank 12 texans 31 32 scoring defense rank 11 cowboys 31 27 scoring defense rank 5 packers 31 25 scoring defense rank 21 patriots 30 59 scoring defense rank 1 now let flip the variables and start with scoring defense rank patriots 1 scoring defense top rank 5 giants 2 scoring defense top rank 29 seahawks 3 scoring defense top rank 21 broncos 4 scoring defense top rank 28 cowboys 5 scoring defense top rank 3 just from this preview it clear there is no statistically significant relationship between top and points allowed if you plot all 32 teams on a graph what you will see is a mess of data points the math does not support your argument only your bias does ,4,Seahawks
lnuw,more obviously it helps when my defense can get itself off the field so i can get the ball back sooner ,1,Seahawks
lnuw, a full minute in a game where you only get 60 does make a difference oh please do elaborate on how this extra minute can propel one defense into 1 in points allowed explain in detail but please do tell me more about the star studded cast they have over there never said anything about the cast just stating an objective fact that they are the 1 scoring defense in football it helps to have a defensive mastermind like belichick running your team ,1,Seahawks
lnuw, compared to us he might as well have a top 5 ol compared to the league he does not half the league ols look top 5 compared to us and when it comes to the pats 1 scoring d how much of that is because of brady chewing up the clock the pats averaged 30 59 in top this season so unless you want to make an argument that the extra 59 seconds is what made the pats d so stingy ,4,Seahawks
lnuw,how many times does a top 5 ol lead a team to a sb ring dallas just went one and done even before that the giants defense made them their bitch the pats do not have a top 5 ol but they have brady and the 1 scoring defense i like their chances ,15,Seahawks
lnuw,russell wilson 2015 cap hit 7 054 868 roughly backup qb money that what made lynch extension financially feasible russell wilson 2016 cap hit 18 542 000 2017 18 800 000 over a two fold increase from his 4th year our offense sucks because we are unwilling to fully commit to a pass dominant offense tom cable even with all the resources in the world cannot put together a competent pass blocking line bevell scheme commands the respect of no one ,1,Seahawks
lnuw, we managed to keep an elite defense lynch and wilson all on the roster that was when wilson was still relatively cheap now he earning actual qb money lynch retired ol still sucks like it did before stop forcing the run identity ,7,Seahawks
lnuw, he not qualified to be an offensive line coach in my book sapp said because he does not know i know which way his center going 90 of the time he blew my mind with that one i said on you think i got all these sacks cause i am guessing which way the center going ,18,Seahawks
lnuw, in a segment still available online sapp questions cable ability to serve as even an assistant coach in the nfl let alone a head coach tom cable do not even know that the defensive lineman knows his protection when he goes into a ballgame sapp said i was standing in front of the man he tells me to rush his offensive line i said okay what set are you coming out in he looks at me and says what no i just want you to rush i said let me understand this you are gonna break the huddle you come out into a formation it will be two receivers three receivers whatever you want to do but there some way you have to protect and i would know that 90 of the time he looked at me like i was speaking chinese source warren sapp rips into tom cable nbc bay area http www nbcbayarea com news sports warren sapp rips into tom cable 81543512 html ixzz4vt9l18hm ,20,Seahawks

lnuw,the new england patriots brady and belichick are already the goats so them winning another sb does not change anyone legacy we can forget this season ever happened matt ryan is not truly elite so i am rooting for the falcons to make the sb and get embarrassed by the pats dan quinn would still look good for making it to the sb in his second year as a hc though ,17,Seahawks
lnuw,defense is not overrated i will still take an all time great defense over and all time great offense any day there just were not any all time great defenses this year not even close our ol still needs to get a lot better though the one we currently have is just comically bad not even nfl caliber but does it need to be dallas or green bay good lmao no we just need five guys whom one can confidently assume would start on another nfl team ,39,Seahawks
lnuw,it is outdated it only works if your team is fucking stacked compare the modern patriots and steelers to their teams when brady and big ben won their first super bowls they are not the same somewhere along the way both teams had to give up their run first defense oriented identities and commit to building around their qbs that why they have been able to continue dominating their conference for the past decade plus you cannot pay your qb and expect to keep both the elite defense and running game with it at least one of the two has got to go and the philosophy with it we chose to pay qb defense that itself is fine but the coaches are still on the run game defense train so basically we want to be a certain type of team even though the roster construction points to another when you have wilson baldwin and graham on the same team you better commit to passing your oc and ol coach need to be passing game gurus but they are not that why we our offense is a shit show every other game ,12,Seahawks
lnuw,the team does not create turnovers anymore because teams do not try to force the ball downfield anymore teams do not force the ball downfield anymore because our offense does not put up enough points our offense does not put up enough points because they are trying to force an outdated run first identity even though they cannot run the ball ,40,Seahawks
lnuw,pete carroll offensive philosophy is and always was outdated i remember back in 2014 saying a run first shut down defense oriented team is unsustainable for longer than a few years and that we needed to transition to a qb centric team like the pats and steelers but i got downvoted to hell by people still drunk off the sb victory ,11,Seahawks

lnuw,great throw,1,nfl
lnuw, wilson led the league in time to throw in 2015 with another patchwork o line numbers are not out this year but i will almost guarantee he near the top again you are wrong http www nfl com stats ngs timetothrow his time to throw is right around brady 2 61s vs 2 57s and that factoring in his extended scramble plays which will always take 4 seconds brady is more or less always passing from inside the pocket so if you look at only wilson pocket passing his time to throw would be even faster than brady just for reference here some other notable qbs and their time to throw big ben 2 59s matt ryan 2 64s philip rivers 2 64s cam newton 2 70s kirk cousin 2 81s dak prescott 2 87s aaron rodgers 2 87s andrew luck 2 88s jameis winston 2 88s,2,Seahawks
lnuw, he simply holds on to the ball for too long too much of the time his decision making is too inconsistent he does not take what the defense gives him at times in the hopes of extending the play there are games when he making the right read and getting the ball out of his hands quickly our offense really clicks when that happening it beautiful did you just describe aaron rodgers or russell wilson because everything you are criticizing wilson for rodgers is and has been guilty of on a far more consistent basis you just forget when rodgers does it because his offensive line gives him an eternity to throw and he can make up for it on the very next play or the play after that ,4,Seahawks
lnuw,we were supposed to address the ol before this season and the season before that it not going to happen with cable ,30,Seahawks

lnuw,patriots brady and belichick are already the goats so them winning another ring does not change anyone legacy ,1,Seahawks
lnuw,we have been trotting out a worse version of the 2013 team for the past three seasons and other teams have been able to exploit it defense is worse though still elite when healthy runningback is worse wr te is better oline is worse which is saying something since it was still terrible back then special teams is worse offensive scheme playcalling and coaching is the same like the ol it was bad even in 2013 so it was bound to get exposed more over time qb is better but the team still wants to pretend it a run first suffocating defense type of squad the ol coach is supposed to at least craft a run blocking line at the expense of the more valuable pass protection but he honestly a fraud so basically we have a roster that by all means could be a perennial offensive juggernaut paired with a coaching staff that wants to play a style of football that we cannot actually play ,18,Seahawks
lnuw, if you watch the 1st half you would see that they actually could get move the sticks but they would have a really bad turnover that would kill it they did not get a single first down until the 2nd quarter,14,nfl
lnuw, the play of his offensive line in pass protection however often left him with too much to overcome pressured on 46 2 percent of his dropbacks 18 of 39 wilson completed just four passes under pressure but was forced to throw the ball away four times by excellent atlanta pursuit once he broke the pocket rather than having the time to make game changing plays outside of the pocket congrats ol once again you have made an otherwise terrible pass rush look like the 85 bears for a day ,14,Seahawks

lnuw,there never a single play that decides the outcome of 60 minutes of football both the ol and the defense were trash tonight but at least you can expect the defense to struggle against the 8th best offense of all time the ol shit the bed against a weak dline ,3,Seahawks
