_talen,depends on the period but for ancient battles there were lots of cultures that had their own ways of fighting generally it seems that battles didnt have continuous fighting the whole time it is possible that longer battles would have had pauses where the front soldiers could retreat and rest for a while people like the celts who are known for using overwhelming charges to break enemy lines might do that multiple times if there were indeed breaks in the combat though this doesnt seem possible for formations like the hoplite and macedonian phalanx where the best men better equipped were always at the front and locked in formation it would also have been a matter of honor for them to fight in the front the tv show rome shows how the romans may have switched their ranks while in active combat i dont think that would be very practical while under attack and it would require a lot of discipline but we know they definitely did that on a larger scale the romans did use multiple lines of soldiers like in the video and would even rely on weakening and tiring the enemy with their skirmishers who would then retreat behind the first line hastati and then that line could retreat behind the veterans principes who would usually finish the job but there was an even stronger 3rd line of triarii even cavalry in many ages would have had 2 3 back up horses for each horseman if their horse was killed or too tired they could switch and be ready to fight again in those long battles ,11,AskHistory

_talen,gladiator is a very inaccurate movie i think its a very good movie and not bad as historical fiction story marcus aurelius wasnt killed by commodus he actually appointed his biological son as successor which was not common for previous emperors he also didnt ban games in the empire commodus was not killed in an arena and his reign was longer than in the movie when he died the empire did not become a republic again and his death caused a civil war maximus was not a real person but there are many similarities between him and some historical figures combat battle the portrayal of the germanic tribe is very inaccurate and lazy its so bad that i assume the only thought that went into it was make them look like barbarians classic hollywood garbage the equipment for everyone is all over the place catapults were not used in open field battles definitely not in forests and they definitely did not fire napalm at the enemy no fire arrows either there are smaller catapults that may have been used like scorpions but not the weird ones you see in the movie the roman legion was not shown throwing their pilum javelin which would have been one of the most common things in a roman battle but they were shown forming a testodo classic bizarro hollywood cavalry charging at full speed through the forest is not very practical arena games i have read that most of the victims in the arena were animals or criminals and that gladiators were too valuable to lose in a match in the movie lots of gladiators are just thrown into the arena to die even thought we see proximo worrying about their price earlier that first match in the arena is weird if its based on the battle of zama the carthaginians were called barbarians but they were a republic just like rome their armies were made of mercenaries from all over the place but they are shown wearing roman equipment and fighting chariots still a good movie i wish they would make more decent epics ,10,history

_talen,the large shield had a very important role in combat and it could also be used to hide the small sword so that the opponent wouldnt know where it was coming from the shield could actually allow you to charge forward and push the enemy back while stabbing most wounds would have been to the torso and legs below enemy shields but the sword could also be used for slashing and fighting in other ways ,3,history

_talen,during the battle both sides dismounted and fought on foot it wasnt just the romans i dont think it would have mattered anyway since they were outnumbered just like before that last stand happened later when paulus rode to the front of the roman line and tried to rally his men and push forward while hannibal was doing the same from the other end the roman formation really needed their cavalry to be successful for it to work they used a similar tactic at trebia and the romans smashed the light punic center to bits ,13,history

_talen,its not like in the movies people didnt really die that often during the actual battle the true killing began when one side broke and ran thats when you can just chase them down and kill thousands in an actual fight its not very easy to kill another person especially if both are using shields people are not very eager to take risks just to get a kill the battle lines also never stayed in contact the whole time that would be suicide for the front line and also impossible for anyone wearing armor since battles lasted hours there are exceptions to this though and it really depends on the period you are talking about the romans used to switch their lighter soldiers during the fight with more experienced ones in order to gain an advantage they would tire the enemy and get fresh troops at the front line the greeks didnt do this however fighting in the first line was considered very honorable but it was also because their phalanx both hoplite and macedonian was very tight and required the formation not to break this also meant that the heaviest soldiers were at the front of the line what movies cant show is also how uncomfortable the soldiers must have been at trebia for example the roman soldiers had to wake up skip their meal cross a deep river while it was very cold and snowing form up lines for hours and then encounter something most had never seen before it must have been loud scary and confusing for any soldier ,1,AskHistory

_talen,you mentioned claymores too and i forgot to talk about that two handed sword types are actually practical but it depends on what you are fighting like in what period armor and weapons they were very useful weapons against pike formations and in that period armor was good enough not to carry a shield most people think they are used like in movies with crazy swings that cut people in half the fighting style is closer to using a polearm with less obvious swings that dont expose you whole body some 2 handed swords even have a second hilt so that you can half sword https en wikipedia org wiki half sword this gives you a shorter more agile weapon ,2,AskHistory

_talen,that not a mockumentary i would say the show is closer to the scandalmaker thing they have in the series my theory is that the actual ad tv series is supposed to be the story of the are al bluths finally adapted this is something that we see in the series a few times maeby trying to make a bluth movie and then later saying it would work better as a tv series michael working with ron howard on a movie who ends up narrating the series the show also uses archive photos and footage with the narration so it could just be a re enactment of the bluth scandal ,1,television

_talen,watched i claudius recently and i think its one of the best miniseries i have ever watched the series follows the stories of the julio claudian dynasty first 5 emperors over a period of almost 100 years the stories take place in the palace and senate for the most part and the main focus is on the plotting double crossing and ambition of the various characters the best thing about this show is its cast the dialogue and acting are very good and some of the characters really stand out claudius both the kid actor and derek jacobi played the part very well augustus brian blessed steals every scene he is in livia drusilla no matter who she is interacting with she always seems like the smartest person in the room caligula john hurt holy shit this guy was so intimidating that you are scared for claudius in their scenes even though you know claudius wouldnt die others worth mentioning are patrick stewart as sejanus and two of my favorite characters in smaller roles germanicus and nero claudius drusus i really recommend watching it if you are a fan of this period of history and drama ,8,television
